<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has 'no time' to enforce Section 91/E of the Representation of the People Order, the chief election commissioner said on Tuesday. "It needs time to investigate fully and decide action, but we don't have that much time to apply the clause," ATM Shamsul Huda said in reply to a question from the reporters at the EC secretariat. Referring to a newspaper report Monday saying the EC would apply 91/E on violators, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said the much talked about RPO clause has not been applied on any one to date. "We've received a court order against a Laxmipur-2 candidate though," Sakhawat said adding the EC would probe the allegations received by his office. "Measures can be taken even after the elections," he said. Section 91/E of the RPO empowers the Commission to cancel the candidacy if serious violations of the electoral codes are proved against candidates. The CEC assured in the past and again on Tuesday that the Commission would not misuse the powers invested under the RPO. bd
