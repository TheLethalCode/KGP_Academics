 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - The chief election commissioner on Wednesday said the Election Commission was close to finishing all preparations for the much-awaited 9th Jatiya Sangsad election on Dec. 29. "The election preparation is now at the final stage. Most necessary equipment for voting have already reached destinations. Only ballot papers and a few other essentials are now being transported," CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said Wednesday. Leaving the Election Commission in the evening, the CEC was asked by reporters how many ballot papers will have to be destroyed due to changes in validations. "This is difficult to estimate right now. But some 30 lakh ballots in 17 constituencies may have to be reprinted," Huda replied. Replying to a query, Huda said due to legal obligations to hold the election within Dec. 31, the commission had to work under pressure to meet the deadline. The shortage of time made the commission decide to comply with the Supreme Court orders to validate nominations without appealing, for now, said the election chief. Asked about the news on speaker Jamir Uddin Sircar breaching the election code of conduct during his polls campaign, the CEC said, "I talked to him." "We've told him in his position he should leave all government facilities he gets as speaker when he goes to his constituency to campaign. He should leave the car the government sanctioned him, as he enters his constituency." bdnews2
