 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Regretting "past mistakes" BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, in a televised speech Saturday evening, promised if elected that curbing prices would be her alliance's number one task. "Stern actions against corruption and terrorism, and transforming parliament into an effective institution, will also get priority," she said. Khaleda's recorded speech was aired on state-owned Bangladesh Television and Radio at around 9:15pm, immediately following one by her rival Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. "We made mistakes during some massive development projects, for which we are sincerely sorry and hope that you will forgive our failures and mistakes." "We request you to believe that we won't repeat them as we've learned from the past mistakes." The four-party alliance chief said, "Our first task will be to quickly bring the prices down to people's reach then to raise output by reducing production costs, if necessary, with subsidies so that people get essentials like rice, lentil, flour, edible oil at reasonable prices." "I today firmly promise that we'll be tough with the corrupt and with terrorists," said the former prime minister. "The Dec. 29 election is very important for the country. Make 'sheaf of paddy' a winner for protecting the country's democracy and sovereignty," urged Khaleda. Khaleda's electioneering draws to a close with her TV address with all campaigning to be concluded by midnight. The two former prime ministers had earlier addressed the two largest rallies of the campaign period on consecutive days, Friday and Saturday at Paltan Maidan. bdnew
