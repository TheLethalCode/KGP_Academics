 Sumon Mahmud Chief political correspondent Jamalpur, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Thursday abruptly pulled over and walked into a paddy field and talked to two farmers for 10 minutes on her way to Jamalpur from Madhupur. Her security team was stunned by the surprise move and by the time she left the farmland of Rabiul, the people of Ramkrishnabari village had come over to see her. The farmers, Robiul Islam and Abdul Jalil, were deeply impressed to have met the former prime minister on their land. Khaleda asked the farmers about the kind of paddy they were planting and they told her it was the BR-23 type. She asked them about profit margin and was told by Robiul due to an high price of diesel, the profit was low. The BNP chief inquired about the rates of fertiliser and was told that urea and TSP that would cost Tk 200 and Tk 400 in the past were now Tk 800 and Tk 4000 respectively. Robiul also said the expenditure for growing paddy was Tk 5000 and it would sell for Tk 7000. When Khaleda asked what step would help them, they said lowering the price of diesel would be appreciated. On the preferred pricing of rice, the farmers said Tk 22/23 a kg would be better. When Khaleda sought their advice about what should be done to bring down the price of rice, they said production cost has to be lowered and the rate of fertiliser and diesel needed to be cut as well. Khaleda said, "I have listened to what you have said and if we go to power then we shall do everything in our power to help you." Before getting in her car, Khaleda touched the sheaf of paddy, the electoral symbol of BNP. In the afternoon, she will address a rally in Jamalpur and after the hustings in Sherpur, Netrokona and Gazipur she will return to Dhaka on Thursday night. She left her Dhaka Cantonment home around 11:30am, accompanied by party vice president Sarwari Rahman. The BNP chief will first address a public rally at Jamlpur Shahid Minar ground. She is also set to take part in gatherings at Sherpur Darogah Ali Park, Nokla High School ground and Netrokona Muktar Parha ground. On her way back to Dhaka, the former prime minister is scheduled to join a number of street rallies. Khaleda, who launched her campaign on Dec. 12 by visiting the shrines in Sylhet, will round her electioneering outside the capital off with Thursday's trip. She exchanged Christmas greetings with the Christians overnight at Kakrail central church on her way back home after participating in a rally in Narayanganj. She cut cake and exchanged greetings with the people of the church. The leader of BNP led four-party alliance will address a rally at Paltan ground in Dhaka on Dec 27, the last day of election campaign. bdne
