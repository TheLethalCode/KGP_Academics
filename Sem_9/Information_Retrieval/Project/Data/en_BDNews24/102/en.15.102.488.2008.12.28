 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The candidates can provide slips with voter serial numbers outside the polling centres to make voting easy during Monday's general elections, the Election Commission said on Sunday. The EC sent letters on Saturday to the parties to send their representatives during publication of results. The voting will run through to 4pm starting from 8am in 35,263 polling centres across the country. Farhad Ahmed Khan, senior assistant secretary at the EC Secretariat, told bdnews24.com new electoral laws barred election camp within 400 yards of the centre. "But there is no bar to providing names and serial numbers of the voters by the candidates." The candidate's name and symbol in the slips would not be a problem either, he said. In previous elections the political parties or the candidates would throw up camps outside the polling station. The camps had provided serial numbers and run campaign. The voting in the August polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities had gone slow as the voters were not provided serial numbers, he observed. Three hours after the voting had begun, the EC allowed the candidates to provide the voters serial numbers outside the polling stations. EC joint secretary Rafiqul Islam said a marquee had been set up around the Secretariat for the publication of results from there. Each party can send a maximum of four representatives, he said. bd
