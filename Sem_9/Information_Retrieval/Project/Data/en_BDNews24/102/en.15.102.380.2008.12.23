<TEXT>
 PARIS, Tue Dec 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Governments should be ready to increase their spending on economic stimulus programs if circumstances require it, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in comments published on Tuesday. In an interview with French daily Le Monde, Blanchard called on Germany in particular to boost its spending in the next few months as some of its European partners such as France have called for. "The coming months will be very bad. Halting this loss of confidence, providing stimulus and, if necessary, replacing private demand are essential if we want to prevent the recession from becoming a Great Depression," Blanchard told Le Monde. Blanchard said the IMF was sticking to a target of 2 percent of global gross domestic product for the fiscal stimulus required, but warned that more may be needed. "If the circumstances require it, states must be ready to do more, 3 percent or more if necessary," he said, adding: "We must think about it now because it is not easy to spend such large sums of money efficiently." Germany has been criticized by some other European countries, particularly France, for not being prepared to spend more on an EU-wide stimulus program to kickstart growth as the global financial crisis hits the real economy. Berlin says it will review its stimulus program in January to see if more spending is necessary. "The important thing is to support activity and boost confidence now. The coming six months are of capital importance," Blanchard said. "If Germany did not participate sufficiently in this stimulus, many other countries would also hesitate to do so and the effect would be disastrous for Europe." Blanchard also criticized Britain's decision to cut value-added tax by 2.5 percentage points, saying it would not influence consumers' behavior significantly. "Temporarily cutting VAT, a measure that was adopted in Great Britain, does not seem to me to be a good idea -- 2 percent less is not perceived by consumers as a real incentive to spend," he said. By contrast, he said a French measure aimed at encouraging people to buy cars was a good idea
