 By Sheikh Mushtaq SRINAGAR, India, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of troops patrolled streets when voting opened in Srinagar on Wednesday in the crucial last phase of state polls overshadowed by heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. Polling stations were put under heavy guard to check the threat of separatist violence. On Tuesday, police said they had arrested three militants, one of them a Pakistani soldier, for allegedly planning a suicide attack during the vote. Pakistan denied the man was a serving soldier. Srinagar and Jammu, both went to the polls on Wednesday. Police and soldiers armed with assault rifles blocked off lanes with razor wire and iron barricades and sniffer dogs searched polling booths for bombs. Kashmiri separatists, many of them in jail, have called for a boycott of the seven-stage polls saying India portrays voting as an endorsement of its rule over the disputed Himalayan region, and have urged people to march to the U.N. office in Srinagar. But a high turnout in the six rounds of the election so far has encouraged Indian authorities despite the scattered clashes between anti-poll protesters and government forces. "I am voting for better government," 30-year-old hotelier Imtiyaz Ahmad said before entering a polling booth. "The government will give us security, better administration. The freedom (of Kashmir) is a separate issue." Polling stations in Srinagar saw only a trickle of voters in the first hours after they opened, witnesses and officials said. Nearly 1.7 million voters are eligible to cast their votes in the last phase. At least 393 candidates are contesting elections for 87 assembly seats across the state, with 21 in total up for grabs in Jammu and Srinagar cities. Police said they had been conducting raids in the entire state over the past few days to thwart trouble. The arrest of the three militants came as nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan continue to trade barbs in the fallout of last month's Mumbai attacks that killed 179 people. India blames the assault on the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was set up to fight Indian rule in Kashmir and which has been linked to Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence military spy agency. Overall violence has fallen significantly across Kashmir since India and Pakistan began peace talks in 2004, although New Delih has imposed a "pause" in that dialogue since the Mumbai attack on Nov. 26-29. Officials say more than 47,000 people have been killed in nearly two decades of violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants in Kashmir, which was hit by massive anti-India protests earlier this year.
