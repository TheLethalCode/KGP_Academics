 BAIDOA, Somalia, Dec 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somalia's Prime Minister Mohamed Mohamud Guled, appointed by the president last week, resigned on Wednesday, saying his appointment threatened to tear apart an already weak government. President Abdullahi Yusuf sacked Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein following a row about new cabinet members, but parliament voted to reinstate Hussein and countries in the region imposed sanctions against the president for being an obstacle to peace. "After evaluating the current situation in Somalia, I have decided to resign," Guled told reporters at his house. "I stood down so that I am not seen as a stumbling block to the peace process which is going on well now." The split at the top of the Western-backed government is blamed for stalling UN-hosted peace talks and threatens to rupture the Western-backed administration at a time Islamist insurgents are camped on the outskirts of the capital Mogadishu
