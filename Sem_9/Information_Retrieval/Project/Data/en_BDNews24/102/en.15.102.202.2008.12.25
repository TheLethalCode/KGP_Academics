Le Tan Tai caught the Thai defence napping in the 40th minute when he crossed to the unmarked Nguyen Vu Phong, who delivered a perfect header into the bottom corner of the net from six metres. Peter Reid's misfiring side then conceded a second goal when Nguyen Viet Thang set up Le Cong Vinh. Thailand pulled one back in the 75th minute when substitute Ronnachai Rangsiyo's header struck the post before going in off the leg of goalkeeper Duong Hong Son. GOAL DISALLOWED Arthit Sunthornphit twice went close to an equaliser, having a goal disallowed for offside and forcing a good save from Hong Son.

"I'm very proud of these players, they believe in themselves, they're proud to play for this team and their country."

"We've now got to fight hard but it's far from over.
