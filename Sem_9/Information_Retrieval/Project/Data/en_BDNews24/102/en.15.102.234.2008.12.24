 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain on Wednesday said new events with the potential to create disaster were being created ahead of the election. He said people were worried about a conspiracy to assassinate party chief Khaleda Zia to leave the country leaderless. Plans were afoot to kill Khaleda as bids to exile her failed. On Tuesday, Rapid Action Battalion captured two militant suspects and recovered three grenades from them at Nabiyabad village in Debiddar, Comilla, some one kilometre away from the ground where Khaleda had addressed a rally some two hours before. One of the arrestees was wounded following exchange of gunfire with RAB. "This event, after the outlawed radical group JMB distributed leaflets against BNP, is part of an elaborate plan to assassinate Khaleda Zia," claimed Delwar at a press briefing at the BNP chairperson's office in Gulshan. Delwar urged immediate investigation into the grenade recovery event in Comilla and called for a nationwide protest. Khaleda herself had complained at a rally in Raipura, Laxipur on Tuesday night that the grenades were broght to Comilla to kill her. b
