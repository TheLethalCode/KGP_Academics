<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  A last-gasp strike from Alfaz Ahmed rescued title contenders Sheikh Russel KC with a lone-goal win over Chittagong Mohammedan in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. The sixth win in 11 matches took Sheikh Russel to the third place with 21 points, one and two points behind of leaders Abahani Limited and Brothers Union respectively. Chittagong Mohammedan remained on the fifth place with 17 points, also playing 11 matches. Sheikh Russel comparatively bossed over the visitors throughout the game and got the decisive goal five minutes before the last whistle through Alfaz, who also struck a goal in their a 1-1 away draw against the same rivals. The All Blues outfit launched the first attack in the 15th minute when Alfaz released a fine ball from right for winger Mobarrak, whose grounder narrowly went wide to the far post. Moroccan Touati Youness tested Mohammedan goalkeeper Mamun Khan with a powerful shot in the 25th minute, but the striker saw his shot sailed over the Mohammedan post. The visitors' striker Rapheal Sagno got into a better position, but the striker failed to connect a Sharif free kick inside the box that could have troubled Sheikh Russel keeper Titumir Chowdhry on the half hour of the first half. After resumption, Sheikh Russel stepped up the attack and came close to a lead seven minutes into the second half when a Touati header rattled the side bar before the goalkeeper palmed it away for a corner. Having reorganised, Chittagong Mohammedan launched two quick attacks inside four minutes and they were deprived of a goal in the 69th minute when substitute Chamrin Rakain headed a Camara Sifo chip to the side post and then sent the rebounder over the Sheikh Russel cross bar. Four minutes later, Rakain again frustrated the visitors when he drove an angular shot, inches off the target. After surviving from two close calls, Sheikh Russel had the last laugh when top-scorer Alfaz struck his league's eight goal. Availing a miss pass from a fellow Mohammedan player, the veteran striker advanced into the danger zone and beat a defender before lashing a shot that kissed the top of the net in the 85th minute. bd
