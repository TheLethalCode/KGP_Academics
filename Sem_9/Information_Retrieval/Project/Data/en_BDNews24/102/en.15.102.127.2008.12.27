<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  The motorcade of Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad was attacked in Rangpur on Saturday morning, the attackers smashing the windows of seven to eight vehicles in the former president's convoy. The assault occurred around 11am, minutes after Ershad's motorcade headed for Dinajpur's Parbotipur after the end of a street rally at Badarganj. The JP chairman was in the house of former state minister and Awami League leader Anisul Islam Chowdhury as the attackers shouted anti-Ershad slogans and hurled brickbats at the vehicles. Police arrived at the spot at around 11.30am, forced the attackers to retreat and the motorcade again started for Parbotipur. A number of journalists accompanying Ershad's campaign tour were among those injured in the attack. Ershad's people said supporters of Mohammad Ali Sarker, an independent candidate and former JP leader, led the attack. Jatiya Party has fielded Anisul Islam Mondol from Rangpur-1 (Badarganj). Sarker is also running from the constituency after he failed to get the party's ticket. One Sarker supporter, Masud Rana, told bdnews24.com:"Sarker is our candidate. He was elected before. But Ershad refused his nomination this time." Noor Rabbani, the driver of Anisul Islam Mondol, told bdnews24.com that the attack was led by Sarker's own nephew. Later, at a Laldighi rally, Ershad said: "Mohammad Ali Sarker is a criminal, that's why I did not allow his nomination this time." Mondol, whose own car was smashed in the attack, said in the rally. "Sarker has assaulted our leader Ershad. We must respond through the December 29th ballot." The JP chairman's information secretary Sunil Shubho Roy told reporters that they would file a case. bdnew
