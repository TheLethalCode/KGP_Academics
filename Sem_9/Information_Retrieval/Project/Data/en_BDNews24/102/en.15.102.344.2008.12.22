 MOHALI, India, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off spinner Harbhajan Singh grabbed three wickets in succession to help dismiss England for 302 and hand India the initiative on the fourth day of the second and final test on Monday. India grabbed a solid 151-run first innings lead following their 453, brightening hopes for a 2-0 series sweep after winning the first test by six wickets. England suffered a lower order batting slump, losing their last six wickets for just 22 runs after being 280 for four on the third evening. At lunch, India were nine for no loss in two overs. Gautam Gambhir was eight not out with Virender Sehwag on one. Harbhajan claimed four for 68 after running through the tail when play began after a two-hour delay caused by fog. He had Matt Prior (2) caught behind down the leg side in the day's third over, bowled Stuart Broad (1) before having last man Monty Panesar (5) caught at forward short leg. Left-arm Zaheer Khan took the other wicket, bowling Graeme Swann (3) to return three for 76, England making just 20 runs in the 10.5 overs in the morning. Harbhajan had sparked the England batting slump overnight when he dismissed skipper Kevin Pietersen for a masterful 144. The off spinner has tallied 63 test wickets this year, one behind the leader, South African paceman Dale Steyn. Pietersen stroked his 15th test century, and raised century partnerships opener Alastair Cook (50) and all rounder Andrew Flintoff (62). leg spinner Amit Mishra took two for 75. The umpires pushed back lunch by 30 minutes following the delayed start with the final two sessions also to be moved back. India won the first test by six wickets
