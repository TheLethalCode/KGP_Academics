 HONG KONG, Sat Dec 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strike by ground staff at Hong Kong airport left thousands of passengers waiting for hours for their luggage, and many left the airport empty-handed, local media reported on Sunday. The Airport Authority said late on Saturday that a total of 36 arrival and 47 departure flights were affected during the three-hour strike in the afternoon. It gave no further details. About 1,000 ground staff out of 3,000 staged the protest as their employer Hong Kong Airport Services, a joint venture between Cathay Pacific and Dragonair, planned to halve workers' bonuses, the South China Morning Post said.
