<TITLE> BNP politicising grenades incident: AL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP is "politicising" the Comilla grenades recovery incident, Awami League election steering committee co-chairman HT Imam alleged on Wednesday. Following recovery of three grenades and arrest of two militant suspects from a village in Comilla on Tuesday, a few kilometres away from where Khaleda had addressed a rally, the BNP chief and other BNP leaders claimed a conspiracy was on to foil the election by making an attempt on her life. "BNP is politicising the Comilla grenades recovery incident. It's unbelievable that JMB, which grew up under their patronisation, would be after her [Khaleda]," Imam said at a press conference at AL's media centre in the city on Wednesday afternoon. In an election campaign rally in Dinajpur later in the day, AL president Sheikh Hasina also echoed Imam. She, however, mentioned the name of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh saying HuJI had "grown up under BNP's patronage". Until Tuesday night, RAB could not confirm the identity of the group to which the two suspected militant detained in Comilla belonged to. "It is mystery how the militants, arrested from a place five kilometres away from her rally, and two and a half hours after the rally, could have been conspiring to kill her," Imam said. "Even after that, we're urging the government to be more vigilant about all possible militant activities and ensure security of all political leaders," Imam added. bdnews
