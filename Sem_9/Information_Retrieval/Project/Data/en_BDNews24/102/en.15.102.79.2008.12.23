<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  If voted to power, Awami League will not consider party politics in dealing with businesses, Sheikh Hasina said on Tuesday. "When Awami League was in power from 1996 to 2001, we considered business people at face value. We did not consider their partisanship. We will do the same if elected this time," the former prime minister told a gathering of businessmen. She also promised that if her party formed the next government it would work for the development of the country and its people, speaking at a meeting on AL's 'Charter for Change: Vision 2021' at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry former president Yusuf Abdullah Harun had alleged in his speech that the country had witnessed huge corruption during the past BNP-led four-party alliance government. "A group of businessmen were benefited while the rest of them were deprived," Harun had said. The former prime minister replied: "The effort of all dedicated entrepreneurs will be valued. Their political identity will not matter." "We are now passing 38 years of independence. We do not have enough time to spare. If we form the government we will press the country forward by implementing the election manifesto we have announced," the AL chief said. "We don't only shout slogans to save the country. We pursue politics to save the country in a practical sense. We do politics for the countrymen." "I have provided a good education to my children. My sister Rehana did the same. We did not involve our children in any other activities ever," Hasina said. "During Awami League's tenure we prioritised the information technology sector. We have given them priority again in this election manifesto," the AL chief said. bd
