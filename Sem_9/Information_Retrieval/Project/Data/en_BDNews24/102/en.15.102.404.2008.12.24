 LOS ANGELES, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Los Angeles Galaxy signed Jamaican international goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts on Tuesday in a bid to beef up the most porous defence in Major League Soccer. Ricketts, 31, will join the team pending receipt of his visa and international transfer clearance, the club said in a statement. A veteran of 67 matches for Jamaica, the 6ft 5in (1.95 metre) Ricketts joins a Galaxy team which conceded 62 goals during the 2008 MLS regular season. Although the David Beckham-led Galaxy scored a league-high 55 goals, they finished second bottom in the Western standings and failed to reach the playoffs for a third consecutive campaign. "I have known Donovan for a number of years as a goalkeeper with the Jamaican national team and have always been impressed with his physical qualities," Galaxy general manager and head coach Bruce Arena said. "It is also a position that we felt the need to improve and believe that he will be a great addition to our team and has the potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in MLS." Ricketts, who represented his country in all eight of their qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, has had previous stints with Jamaican side Village United, English Premier League club Bolton Wanderers and Bradford City of League Two in England
