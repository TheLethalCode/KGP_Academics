 CONAKRY, Wed Dec 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The military junta attempting a coup in Guinea promised on Wednesday to hold elections in two years time, but the West African state's top civilian leader appealed to the world to prevent the takeover from succeeding. There was confusion over who was really running the world's No. 1 exporter of aluminum ore bauxite two days after the death of long-serving President Lansana Conte. His death left a power vacuum and triggered a coup bid by a group of officers. The sprawling seaside capital Conakry was calm on Wednesday but soldiers patrolled the streets. Witnesses saw one heavily-armed group entering the central bank building. Calling themselves the National Council for Democracy and Development, the coup junta has promised an anti-corruption clean-up and blamed the civilian government for "catastrophic" economic conditions suffered by the population. "The National Council for Democracy and Development commits to organize credible and transparent elections for the end of December 2010," the junta, which earlier named its members, said in a broadcast from the national TV and radio it controls. Its spokesman, Capt. Moussa Camara, wearing a red beret, said the junta wanted to "save a people in distress." He called on the population not to hold any public demonstrations. But Guinea's civilian government leaders, including National Assembly President Aboubacar Sompare who under the constitution should be taking over as interim head of state, have refused to submit to the coup junta. The armed forces chief, General Diarra Camara, has also stayed loyal to the constitution. The United Nations, African Union, European Union and United States have all condemned the latest breakdown in democracy in Africa, which follows post-election turmoil in Kenya and Zimbabwe and an August military coup in Mauritania. "The international community must mobilize to prevent the military from interrupting the democratic process as laid down by the constitution," Sompare said. He said the coup-plotters were hunting for him, but he was in "a safe place." UNCERTAINTY Loyalist armed forces chief Diarra Camara has attempted to open negotiations with the coup leaders to persuade them to stay loyal to the constitution, which foresees elections being held within two months of the death of the president. "The whole of Africa and the world is watching us," Diarra Camara told Radio France International "The situation hasn't been resolved yet. Loyalists and coup-mongers have met in the (main military) camp but they haven't been able to reach an agreement," Sompare said. Earlier the junta announced the names of its 32 members, six of them civilians. They included General Mamadou "Toto" Camara, head of the land army, officers from the main army base, camp Alpha Yaya Diallo in Conakry, and at least one from the elite "red berets" presidential guard. In the power vacuum left by the death of Conte, the diabetic chain-smoking general who had ruled with an iron fist since seizing power in 1984, it was still not clear who would eventually emerge to take full control of the country. "The situation in Guinea remains calm but fluid. So far, none of the factions have assumed power. Indications are there is room for possible discussion," said Said Djinnit, the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative for West Africa. The African Union Peace and Security Council met in Addis Ababa and was expected to strongly oppose the coup bid. Analysts said the passing of Conte would trigger renewed instability and possibly inter-ethnic infighting. "Expect several months of political chaos with a high possibility of further coups, counter coups, and sham elections amid a period of ethnic and political disequilibrium," Sebastian Spio-Garbrah of the Eurasia Group consultancy said
