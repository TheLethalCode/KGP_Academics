<TITLE> Raising revenue a must to cut aid-dependence: Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Wednesday there is no alternative to raising domestic revenue in order to invigorate the country's economy and reduce dependence on foreign aid. "Government investment amounts to only five percent of the national income and most of the development activities have to depend on foreign aid which is not commendable at all," he said at an NBR award ceremony for the country's top VAT payers. Mirza Aziz said the interim government over its tenure has tried to raise internal revenue collection. As part of that, powers of tax officials have been clipped to lessen hassles for taxpayers, he added. "We have also cut tax rates for companies in the last budget in response to business community's demands for lower tax rates," the adviser said. He said he believed lower tax rates would net more revenue that would strengthen the economy. The National Board of Revenue's awards programme saw thirty individuals, five from each of the six city corporation areas, receiving the awards at a ceremony in the city's Osmani Memorial Auditorium on Wednesday. The NBR also awarded five organisations as top VAT (value added tax) payers: Koilashtila Gas Fields Ltd, Bakhrabad Gas Fields Ltd, BRAC Bank Ltd, Kallol Group Ltd and Uttara Motors Ltd. NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid said the Board was always looking means to ease hassles for tax payers. "In line with this aim, we have introduced measures like online registration for income tax and electronic cash registers for VAT collection," said the tax chief. bdnews
