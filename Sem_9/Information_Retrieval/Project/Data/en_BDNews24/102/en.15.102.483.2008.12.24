 Feni, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) Fearing manipulation of election results and having voiced concerns over attempts on her life, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia maintains that conspiracies are on to spoil the polls. Speaking at an election rally in Feni on Wednesday, she warned any conspirators of dire consequences in spoiling the elections "People with ill motives are spreading rumours that BNP does not want to participate in the election, whereas we have no intention of thwarting such a crucial polls," said the BNP chief. "I believe that people will vote BNP to power this time as they did in 2001." Said the two-time former prime minister: "Those who are conspiring to turn us into a kowtowing nation must be voted down in the forthcoming polls." "Some quarters didn't like BNP contesting the polls; they didn't want the emergency lifted even. But we have prevailed over the caretaker government to lift emergency and realise people's demands." Khaleda left Dhaka Tuesday on her two-day election tour of the southeast. She addressed public meetings at Munshiganj, Comilla, Luxmipur, Noakhali and stopped overnight at Feni. At 12 noon Wednesday, she spoke to the people gathered at Feni Pilot High School grounds. After two suspected militants were arrested in Comilla with hand-made grenades on Tuesday, Khaleda's Chittagong tour was cancelled. The grenades were retrieved from a spot two miles from a roadside rally attended by the BNP chief just a short time before. Khaleda had claimed at a later rally that the grenades had been intended for an attempt on her life. bdnnews
