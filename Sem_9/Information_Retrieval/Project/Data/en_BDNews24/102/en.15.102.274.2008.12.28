 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the former prime ministers leading two multiparty electoral alliances, in speeches beamed by state-run media on Saturday, resolved to learn from their mistakes and lift up the downtrodden millions. They both promised radical reform programmes in a last-ditch attempt to swing votes and cut across social classes ahead of Dec. 29 general elections. They pulled no punches in their attempts to expose one another's political legacies, however, throughout the final day of campaigning. They have fought bitterly for control of the government since 1991 when they and their supporters restored democracy after nine years of military rule. Together they have given the country a singular reputation for political violence. Regretting "past mistakes" Khaleda, chairperson of BNP that heads the four-party alliance, promised curbing prices would be the number one task if she went on to form a government. "We made mistakes  for which we are sincerely sorry and hope that you will forgive our failures and mistakes," said the two-term former prime minister. "We request you to believe that we won't repeat them as we've learned from past mistakes." Hasina, the president of Awami League spearheading the 'grand alliance, called for a "transparent political culture" taking lessons from the past. "Let us put an end to the politics of conflicts for the sake of highest state interest," Hasina said. "Let us all ... create a transparent political culture." The two alliance chiefs delivered televised speeches hours before campaigns for the ninth parliamentary elections closed at midnight. State-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar broadcast the recorded Hasina speech at 8:30apm. And Khaleda's appeared on TV soon after Hasina's. They had addressed the two largest rallies of the campaign period on consecutive days, Friday and Saturday, at Paltan Maidan. Tough measures against corruption and terrorism, and transforming parliament into an effective institution will also get priority, Khaleda said. "I firmly promise today that we'll be tough on corruption and terror and no concessions will be given to the corrupt or terrorists," said Khaleda. "Our first task will be to quickly bring the prices down to people's reach, then to raise output by reducing production costs, if necessary, with subsidies so that people get essentials like rice, lentil, flour, edible oil at reasonable prices," she said. The former prime minister also promised measures to make parliament more effective. "Once elected we'll reform the warrant of precedence to dignify the opposition leader over all ministers, second to the prime minister." "A deputy speaker will be chosen from the opposition and the speaker and the deputy speaker will have to resign their party position immediately after assuming office." "We'll also choose heads of different parliamentary committees from among the opposition members." Hasina, pledged to establish a Bangladesh free from hunger and poverty. She recounted the birth of Bangladesh, the ups and downs of the country's history. "I've described the past incidents in order to march forward taking a lesson from those experiences." The former prime minister renewed the pledges of her party's manifesto, the "Charter for Change" unveiled on Dec. 12 at the start of her election campaign. "We've received such tremendous support from people for our manifesto and Vision 2021 that it has become a national charter," she said. She came down hard on her rivals, saying that the militancy grew and flourished in the country under the patronisation of the four-party coalition government. "They created 111 godfathers across the country to establish a state of anarchy, while Hawa Bhaban ran a parallel government and parliament was totally ineffective." Turning to her party's 1996-2001 reign, she said, "In only five years, Bangladesh had earned self-reliance. Jobs were created for the poor and youth. Bangladesh had showed steady rise in the human development index." "The five years have been termed as golden period in Bangladesh's history," she added. Recalling her family members killed in 1975, Hasina, daughter of indepence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, said, "I've been facing threats to my life. Even after that I will continue my struggle to make the people of the country smile, which the father of the nation dreamt of." "I'm daughter of Bangabandhu, and a Muslim as well. And a Muslim does not bend her head before anyone but Allah." "I'll be serving you till I breath my last," said Hasina. Hasina called upon government officials to work neutrally during polling and members of law-enforcing agencies to take measures so that people can vote without fears. bdnews24.com/
