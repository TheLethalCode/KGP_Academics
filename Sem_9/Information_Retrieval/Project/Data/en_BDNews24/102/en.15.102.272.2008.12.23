 Shyed Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - With the countdown to election and campaigns in overdrive, voters of Dhaka-18 are anticipating "tough competition" between experience and youth as the candidates of the two rival alliances face off. A good number of voters in the constituencycovering Uttara, Turag, the airport and Khilkhetvoiced support for one or other of the alliance candidates. Though many think ZA Khan, a dissident from BNP running as an independent, will take a lead over them. "The (Awami League-led) grand alliance candidate Advocate Sahara Khatun is experienced, and on the other hand, (BNP-led) four-party alliance candidate Azizul Bari Helal is young and promising," said retired bank official Jainul Abedin from Uttara-10. "We're expecting a tough battle between the two candidates," Jainal said. "Personally, I would give preference to experience," he said, adding that he would be voting on Dec. 29. Echoing most local residents, former Uttarkhan Union Parishad member Anwar Hossain said: "I'll vote for the candidate who promises repair of roads and drainage systems of my area." After ramshackle roads and sewerage lines, the next concerns of Dhaka-18 voters are crime, schools, and healthcare. The constituency regsiters 442,472 voters, of which 210,397 are women. Khatun's record includes a defeat in the 1991 election from this constituency, and no nomination in the following two elections in 1996 and 2001. Helal, the incumbent president of BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, who passed months in jail following the August 2007 violence on Dhaka University campus, is running for the first time. Being 'local' may be a factor in Sahara's favour, as her father's home is in Uttara, but Helal has also been living in the same area for years. But, ZA Khan may split the BNP votes. Says one businessman from Kuril Biswa Road: "ZA Khan will get some votes from Uttara and Airport areas, but not enough to win. He will eat away a portion of Helal's votes, however." All the candidates are promising to address the problems of the constituency and improvement of local amenities and living standards. bdnews
