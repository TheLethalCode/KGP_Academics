 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Vehicles including private cars, micro-buses and rented CNG cars will be off the road and possession of firearms will be forbidden from midnight Dec. 28, the election day, until next midnight, the home ministry announced on Monday. The highways and 'important' roads will be kept beyond the restrictions, home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters at a briefing in his office on Monday. "Some 4,66,000 Ansar members and 6,000 RAB personnel will be deployed across the country to assist the police in ensuring security on Dec. 29," he said. "BDR men will however stay on guard along with the army as 'striking forces' and a magistrate will stay with each striking force," Karim said about the measures the government was taking for the general elections. Asked if an executive magistrate or a judicial magistrate would be posted, the home secretary said the Election Commission had asked for judicial magistrates. "The establishment ministry has been asked to take measures, and will discuss with the Election Commission before taking actions," he said. "Police and Ansar members will ensure security of the election officials, transport electoral logistics, maintain public security and voters' discipline inside the polling centres. BDR and army will stay outside the centres as striking forces." In city areas 16 security personnel including three armed policemen will protect a polling centre, the home secretary said, adding there would be two more armed policemen for each 'important' or 'risky' centre. "In the hilly areas, islands and 'haor' (shoal) areas 15 security members will be employed for the security of a polling centre and 17 for the risky or important ones," he added. "Some 50 thousand members of the armed forces have been deployed across the country since Dec. 20 and 6,000 RAB members along with a huge number of Armed Police Battalion personnel will be deployed from Dec. 24," the home secretary added. b
