 KARACHI, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) hailed Sri Lanka's confirmation on Friday of their test tour next month as a lifeline for the Pakistani game. Javed Miandad, the PCB's director-general of cricket, said Sri Lanka had formally conveyed to the board that they would be sending their team from Jan. 20 to play three test matches and five one-day internationals. "We are really grateful to the Sri Lankan government for giving clearance to the tour and it will help revive the visit of foreign teams to our country," Miandad told Reuters. He conceded that diplomatic channels had to be used to convince the Sri Lankan government to give clearance for the tour that was arranged after India cancelled a scheduled tour in the wake of last month's Mumbai terror attacks. "Pakistan badly needs to play international cricket at home and we will ensure the Sri Lankans are provided with state level security," said the former Pakistan test batsman. The Sri Lankan tour was in doubt after the island nation's sports minister dissolved its interim cricket committee headed by former test captain Arjuna Ranatunga. Pakistan has gone without a test in 2008 and has seen two major events postponed due to the security and safety concerns of visiting teams. Australia postponed a test tour in April and the International Cricket Council also postponed the Champions Trophy after South Africa raised security concerns about playing in Pakistan. Miandad said the Sri Lankans' tour would pave the way for Australia to tour Pakistan in April for a one-day series. "Pakistan cricket has been in danger of being isolated as an international cricket centre but Sri Lanka's visit should change all that," he said. "Our eventual aim is that the Champions Trophy be held in Pakistan next year with all teams having no problems playing in Pakistan.
