 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - Businessman Noor Ali on Wednesday said he had been coerced by a small quarter of the caretaker government into filing an extortion case against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "That quarter is timid, ambitious, and unpolitical," he said at a roundtable discussion marking the silver jubilee of Unique Group he is the chairman of. He added the BNP-led coalition government had also put pressure on him to sue Hasina. That government had made him an accused in the MiG-29 purchase corruption case as he had refused to be the plaintiff, Ali claimed. He said he had signed in the papers of the case involving alleged graft in the barge-mounted power plants also under pressue during the rule of the incumbent interim government. Another businessman, Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who had filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against the AL chief, recently also hinted at such coercion. "All conscious citizens with conscience can understand under what circumstances I had to file the case," Ali said, adding that his life was in danger. An AL candidate for the forestalled Jan. 22, 2007 general elections, he had filed the Tk 5 crore extortion case against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury with Tejgaon police on June 13 last year. But on Nov. 5, the police dropped chages against the former prime minister on a lack of evidence. The case details said Ali paid the moneyin 12 instalments by chequeto Hasina when she was prime minister in exchange for permission for his company Fortune Limited to set up thee power plants in Naryanganj, Chittagong and Khulna. Ali also alleged Sheikh Helaluddin demanded Tk 1 crore or a flat worth Tk 1 crore for helping him get the permission. He said he handed over the documents of two flats of Borak Real Estate in Baridhara to Rupa Chowdhury. Two more extortion cases have been filed against Sheikh Hasinaone by Azam Chowdhury and the other by businessman Tajul Islam Faruque. Azam Chowdhury on Dec. 14 said to reporters that he did not directly file any case against Hasina. He applied to the home adviser on Dec. 14 to withdraw the case in court through an executive order and told his side of the story to Hasina during a meeting with her last week. Chowdhury, Unique Eastern Limited CEO Kazi Abdul Mazid, former FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain and ex-Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Laila Rahman Kabir and other business leaders attended the roundtable on human resources development at a hotel in the city. bdnew
