 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka had a fine batting practice against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI in the drawn three-dayers on Tuesday ahead of the two Tests series starting Dec. 26. Having resumed on the final day on 36 for two, the visitors went on to make 316 all out in the first innings, with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Prasanna Jayawardene striking half centuries at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. After the first day's play was called off due to foggy condition, Bangladesh were skittled out for just 88 on the second day on Monday. The Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium at Mirpur will host the first Test on Dec 26-31. Pacer Shahadat Hossain removed opener Michael Vandort, who fell without adding to his overnight score of 17. But captain Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera repaired the damage to take their side to 87 for four before the latter fell to pacer Saikat Ali for 19. Six balls later, Saikat again struck to remove Jayawardene, who made an 88-ball 43, to peg the visitors back. But Dilshan along with Prasanna kept the attack of the local selection at bay for the sixth wicket. They together contributed 158 runs before both batsmen retired to allow other batsmen to have some batting practice. Dilshan struck 88 off 139 balls studded with seven fours and three sixes, while Prasanna hit a 126-ball 70 that included six fours. Later, Chaminda Vaas (24 not out), Dhamika Prasad (14), Farveez Maharoof (7) and Rangana Herath (0) batted before spinner Raihanuddin Arafat cleaned the tail removing the last three batsmen in a row. Arafat and Shahadat grabbed three wickets each for 37 and 63
