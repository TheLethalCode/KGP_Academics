 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  On the eve of the general elections on Monday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged political parties to "be responsible" and accept people's verdict. He also stressed the need of a greater role for the opposition in parliament. "The secretary-general appeals to all political parties to continue to demonstrate responsibility, participate fully and honour the will of the Bangladeshi people," Francesc Vendrell, head of Ban's high-level panel for the Bangladesh polls, told reporters at a press conference at Hotel Sonargaon. The UN team first came to Bangladesh in November to assess the political environment and preparations ahead of the ninth parliamentary polls. It returned again to observe the election and post-poll atmosphere. Vendrell said the secretary-general encouraged the caretaker government and the Election Commission to continue their efforts to ensure the elections are conducted in a free and fair atmosphere. "A stable post-election climate will be vital for the effectiveness and sustainability of the nation's democracy," Vendrell quoted Ban Ki-moon as saying. "He urges all political parties, irrespective of their performance in the elections, to work together in a spirit of dialogue and compromise, to address the challenges facing the nation. "Such cooperation should include an enhanced role for the opposition in parliament," said Vendrell. The UN team will prepare a report on Bangladesh's polls for the secretary-general. The three-member panel includes Nepal's chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel and former deputy director of the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division Aracelly Santana. bdn
