 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)Awami League President Sheikh Hasina Tuesday urged the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to revise their policies to equip developing countries to crises such as the current global slowdown. The former prime minister also said a quick recovery of the world economy was necessary for the country's economic development and the next government's poverty reduction successes. "There has been a call to the international financial system to intervene so as to avoid global depression," she said, addressing a luncheon meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham). "It is time that the international financial institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, revisited their policies based on the dominant economic paradigm," Hasina said, reading from a written speech. "They need to restructure their policies and instruments to be able to respond to the crisis facing developing economies, the low income countries in particular." Terming poverty the biggest enemy, the ex-PM said her party had a vision to reduce the number of poor people from 6.5 crore to 4.5 crore by 2013. "A quick and dramatic upturn of the global economy is necessary for sustaining our plan for accelerated growth and poverty reduction," she said. On the AL position on antigraft measures, Hasina said, "We see that the Anticorruption Commission should enjoy full independence." "They should carry out drives against corruption, not against politics," she added, pointedly. Referring to her meeting with the country's business leaders earlier in the day, Sheikh Hasina said the immediate-past BNP government did not produce a single megawatt of electricity from 2001 to 2006. She told the AmCham meeting, if voted to power, her government would prioritise electricity generation. The AL chief also said it would work with other South Asian countries to curb regional terrorism and militancy. "We shall maintain friendly relations with the neighbouring countries including Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal while pursuing cooperation in multilateral frameworks. "We seek to establish South Asian Task Force to combat terrorism and militancy," she said. US ambassador James F Moriarty, the British high commissioner Stephen Evans, diplomats from other missions and businessmen were present at the meeting at the Dhaka Sheraton. Hasina had earlier attended a meeting with top businessmen on Awami League's 'Charter for changing days: Vision 2021' at the Sonargaon Hotel. bdn
