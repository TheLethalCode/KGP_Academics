 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) -Awami League president Sheikh Hasina understands the 'circumstances' in which Azam Jahangir Chowdhury had filed an extortion case against her and later retracted, the businessman says after meeting her on Saturday. The home ministry on Monday confirmed it received the application of Chowdhury. Chowdhury met with Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana, a co-accused, at Hasina's Sudha Sadan residence in the city on Saturday night, six days after he had applied to the home ministry for withdrawal of the case, to clear the misgivings. Chowdhury said he stayed there for around an hour. "You just cannot believe it! Sheikh Hasina and her sister are really liberal," he told bdnews24.com. "Sheikh Hasina told me, 'you have cleared you position from the very beginning. I've seen you in the court as well. Don't worry, I've nothing against you'", Chowdhury said. He explained to Hasina under which "circumstances" he had to file the case in which cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim is the other accused. Chowdhury sought assistance from the former prime minister to put an end to all sorts of misunderstandings, an aide to Hasina, who refused to be named, added. "I understand the situation at the time of filing the case," Hasina was quoted as saying by the aide, who was present at the meeting, to Chowdhury. The source said Chowdhury told Hasina that the Tk 3 crore extortion case was filed against Hasina, Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim on Jun. 13 last year following misunderstanding. Filing the case against them was "unexpected" and "undesired" on his part, the source further quoted Chowdhury as saying. On Dec. 14, businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury said he had not directly sued anyone. He said to reporters at his Gulshan office, " I did not directly file any case. Neither did I name anyone. There was a misunderstanding, which will be over when the case will be withdrawn." Chowdhury, managing director of the East Coast Trading Limited, applied to the home adviser on Dec. 14 to withdraw the case in court through an executive order. He said it was filed on "misunderstanding" and that the case was "unexpected and undesired" on his part. He said he had filed a case only against Sheikh Selim for extorting money from him in return for a promised deal on Siddhirganj power plant in Narayanganj. "I am withdrawing the case in the interests of justice with due respect to democracy and one's fundamental right," Chowdhury, also Prime Bank chairman, had said. In his application addressed to the home adviser, Chowdhury said: "A case was filed against Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and the honourable former prime minister Sheikh Hasina with Gulshan Police Station due to a misunderstanding on June 13, 2007." "The case is currently on trial. I no longer wish to be the plaintiff in the case." "Filing of the case was unexpected and undesired on my part," he said. "Under the circumstances, I urge the government to make arrangements to withdraw the case in the court by an executive order," Chowdhury appealed. On Jan. 24 this year, Chowdhury claimed at a press conference that he had not accused the former prime minister in the case and his allegations were only against Selim. "Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and I cannot even think of suing her," he had said. Hasina was arrested and detained on Jul. 16, 2007, and subsequently shown arrested in the case. Selim was arrested before the former prime minister. A charge sheet, produced before the court on Jul. 24, 2007, named Rehana as co-accused. A UK resident, she was shown as fugitive in the case. The High Court later halted trial proceedings on a writ petition filed by the AL president, challenging the legality of the case and its trial. The final verdict is still pending. HOME ADVISER CONFIRMS CHOWDHURY APPLICATION The home adviser, MA Matin, on Monday night said that he had received the application of Chowdhury, a day after telling reporters that he had not. "I've received Chowdhury's application for withdrawal of the case against Sheikh Hasina," he told bdnews24.com by telephone. "We will sit with the lawyers for a final decision." He thinks the ministry has little to do about the withdrawal of the case, as the court is hearing the case. Chowdhury may have to go to court to withdraw the case, the home adviser said. bdnews24.c
