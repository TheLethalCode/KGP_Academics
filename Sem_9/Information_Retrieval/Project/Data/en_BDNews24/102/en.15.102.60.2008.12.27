<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Taking another shot at power, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Saturday basked for people's forgiveness "if there had been any mistakes' during her 2001-2006 rule. "We were in power. I'm begging apology if there had been any mistakes during our tenure. "We want to have a new start if we are voted to power," the two-time prime minister said at a huge elelction rally at Paltan in the capital. Indicating former military ruler Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad, a key ally of the Awami League-led grand alliance, Khaleda said, "They have formed a grand alliance with a grand thief." Firing barbs at the rival alliance, Khaleda alleged they had foiled the planned Jan. 22, 2007 election by creating anarchy being sure of her alliance assuming office once again. "The grand thief had dislodged democracy. He was convicted for graft charges in normal court. Still there are cases against him," Khaleda remarked. "The country will not get back democracy through them, neither will they eliminate corruption." "Promises of fight against corruption do not go with them. They had patronised godfathers inthe districts. You all know about the godfathers in Dhaka, Naraynganj and Feni districts, who caused sufferings to the people." She said Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina had connived with autocratic ruler Ershad in 1986. Hasina at a Chittagong rally had declared that any connivance with Ershad would amount to betraying the nation, and yet, she had gone to the election within 24 hours of the declaration, Khaleda said. Khaleda contested 'grand alliance' chief Sheikh Hasina's claim that she had been charged with graft for buying MiG-29 fighter planes and frigates to protect sovereignty of the country. "Old and reconditioned MiG-29 planes and frigates were bought for the country with a higher price that caused the government financial losses," she argued. Citing a "special" report, the former prime minister said corruption worth Tk 12, 192 crore was reported in the year 2000 during AL rule. The BNP government had reduced it to Tk 4,391 crore, Khaleda claimed, adding in 2005, her government had further reduced it to 526 crore. She promised efforts to fight off corruption and terrorism. "The Anticorruption Commission will work independently, without any government interference. No-one will compromise in preventing militancy." Khaleda alleged the AL had created anarchy in education sector and curbed freedom of the media and judiciary. "But we had clamed down on cheating in the examinations," she claimed. Despite 'repression on her family and conspiracy to split BNP', the BNP chief said, she did not leave the country, but 'many' fled danger. "Now we want to forget all differences and work together for the country. We will forget the past and move forward. "So we need to put an end to hartal, strike, and vandalism, as the people do not want any politics of conflict." She promised female students free eduction up to undergraduate level and better living standard for the people, if elected to form government. To the young voters, she said, "As a mother, I'm promising you if you vote us to the power again, we'll work for your happy future." "You are the future of the country, We don't have time to look back, we'll have to march forward." She introduced party candidates for the 19 constituencies in Dhaka to the audience and sought vote for them. "The people of the country have risen today. Create history by voting for the four-party alliance on Dec. 29. And thus save the country and save yourselves as well." Khaleda said the four-party alliance needed to get back to power again for continuing the development in education, health, women and job sectors. Khaleda wished the nation a happy new year. "We'll see a new year only after four days. On the eve of the new year, I wish the people of the country can work freely with an elected government." She started addressing the vast public rally amid tight security, behind a bulletproof glass screen. The Awami League president Sheikh Hasina gave her address at the same spot just the day before. People were allowed to enter through the main gate, the only gate between Bangabandhu National Sadium and Moulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium. They had to go through several check points to enter there. The security forces deployed patrol team in the surrounding buildings. The banner in the stage reads 'save the country, save the people for the sake of democracy and development.' One side of the banner shows the image of former president Ziaur Rahman, the party founder, and the other side Khaleda. Party supporters started arriving in the venue since morning with processions from different areas. The gathering formally started at around 3:15 pm through reading out religious text. Security set-up at Paltan has been beefed up specially in view of the two party bosses holding public meetings on two consecutive days. Khaleda, like Hasina, is addressing public meetings at the venue for the first time since 2006. She began her election campaign on Dec. 12 through visiting Shah Jalal's shrine in Sylhet. She has since been touring the country and speaking to people and seeking their votes. bdnew
