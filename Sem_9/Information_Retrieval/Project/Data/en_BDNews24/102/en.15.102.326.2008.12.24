<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - As the news spread of grenades recovered from a spot near a Khaleda Zia election rally in Comilla Tuesday, BNP-backed student front JCD became restive on Dhaka University campus. "We've heard that a bomb went off by the side of the BNP chairperson's podium in Comilla and a number of bombs were found as well," said JCD general secretary (DU unit) Saiful Islam Firoz addressing a protest meeting. A number of activists and leaders of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal took part in processions and held a demonstration on the campus at around 9:00pm, demanding "investigation into the conspiracy". "This is a conspiracy to foil the election," Firoz said, echoing the BNP chairperson's recent remarks. He demanded the government ensure the security of former prime minister and BNP chief Khaleda Zia. bdnews
