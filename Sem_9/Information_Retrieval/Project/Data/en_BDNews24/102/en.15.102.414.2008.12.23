 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)The fuel price cuts, announced by the government on Monday, came into force at midnight. The price of diesel and kerosene came down by Tk 2 from Tk 48 to Tk 46, petrol by Tk 4, from Tk 78 to Tk 74, and octane by Tk 3 from Tk 80 to Tk 77, according to a government gazette. "The new prices will be effective from Monday midnight," the chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. Terming the measure as anticipatory price adjustment, an energy ministry press release in the afternoon said, "Prices will be reviewed again in late January as part of the government rules.' Tamim earlier told bdnews24.com that the price of petrol would be reduced by Tk 3 to Tk 75 per litre based on which bdnews24.com carried it as breaking news. Fuel prices were cut in the first phase on Oct. 26. Tamim had hinted earlier in the month that fuel prices would fall further as global oil prices plummeted below $50 a barrel. Crude oil was selling at $43.91 per barrel on Monday on the international market. bdnews
