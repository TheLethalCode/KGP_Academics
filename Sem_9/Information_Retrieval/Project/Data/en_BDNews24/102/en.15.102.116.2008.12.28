 WELLINGTON, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped batsman Neil Broom was named in New Zealand's 13-man squad on Sunday for the first two matches of a five-game one-day international series against West Indies. The 25-year-old Broom replaces the injured Scott Styris, who broke his thumb in the first Twenty20 international in Auckland on Friday and is out of action for six weeks. "Neil performed well with the bat in Australia and India with the Emerging Players and New Zealand A sides," head selector Glenn Turner said in a statement. "He's also been scoring a lot of runs in (domestic cricket) this summer." All-rounder Grant Elliott and opening batsman Jamie How have also been recalled to the squad after being dropped for the Twenty20 internationals, the second of which is later on Sunday in Hamilton. "Grant gives us options with both bat and ball," Turner said. "He can come in down the order and push the ball around and also offers a good bowling option with his medium-paced swing." Rookie all-rounder Ewen Thompson, who was brought in for the Twenty20 internationals but did not play the first game, and fellow all-rounder James Franklin have been released. The first one-day international is at Queenstown on Dec. 31, with the second in Christchurch on Jan. 3. Squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Neil Broom, Grant Elliott, Daniel Flynn, Mark Gillespie, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor
