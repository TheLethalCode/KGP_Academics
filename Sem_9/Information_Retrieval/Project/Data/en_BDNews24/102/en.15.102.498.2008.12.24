 MOHALI, India, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England skipper Kevin Pietersen praised his team's grit and individual efforts despite their test series defeat in India on Tuesday. India clinched the two-test series 1-0 after the second test ended in a tame draw on the final day in Mohali. "It is not bad as some defeats, we can take a lot of positives from the series," Pietersen told reporters. "I'm proud to be captain of a bunch of boys we have brought out here," he said. "All the guys have behaved as great ambassadors of the game." England had less than ideal preparation after resuming the aborted tour of India despite safety fears following last month's militant attacks in Mumbai. India won the first test in Chennai by six wickets. England had arrived just three days earlier and went into the game without playing a warmup game. "Indian people have been magnificent, we knew they were going to be because we came back and started test match cricket," said Pietersen. "There is nothing better than performing against knowledgeable crowds with love for the game." POOR PREPARATION The visitors lost the preceding one-day series 5-0, after the last two games were called off following the attacks. "We came here with very little preparation for the series with the red ball against such a great side," said Pietersen. "India is playing fantastic cricket at the moment, confident and without fear, they are on top of their game especially in India. "But we gave ourselves a good chance in Chennai, some good stuff on that Monday but Sachin Tendulkar took it away from us." Tendulkar hit his 41st test century as India achieved a then fourth-highest final innings target of 387. It is now fifth in the all-time list. Although the Mohali test, shifted out of Mumbai, was badly hit by poor light due to the northern Indian winter, England also owed the draw to a masterly 144 from Pietersen on the third day. Pietersen, who took over as captain in the home series against South Africa in the summer, said the last couple of months had been difficult as a Stanford Twenty20 debacle in Antigua was followed by the one-day series rout in India. "It has been the toughest six to eight weeks of my career so far," he said. "To score a hundred like I did meant a lot to me.
