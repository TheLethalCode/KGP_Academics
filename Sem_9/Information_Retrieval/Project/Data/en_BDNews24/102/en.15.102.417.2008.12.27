 Rangpur, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, countering the comments of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who had called him a "grand thief" earlier in the day, urged voters on Saturday not to back "fundamentalists, militants and the corrupt". "Khaleda Zia has called me a thief. I'm not a thief; rather she and her two sons are thieves," Ershad said at an election campaign rally in Pirgasa, Rangpur, on Saturday evening. The BNP chairperson and chief of the four-party alliance, at a rally in the capital's Paltan grounds earlier Saturday said: "The great thief had dislodged democracy. He was convicted for graft charges in court. Still there are cases against him." Addressing the Rangpur rally, Ershad said, "After I left power, BNP filed many cases against me, but none were proved." "BNP has been campaigning with the slogan 'save the country, save the people', although they siphoned money abroad while in power," he said. Ershad urged voters not to cast a single vote for fundamentalists, militants and corrupts, aiming the adjectives at the BNP-led four-party alliance. Seeking votes for the Awami League-led grand alliance, he said: "If the grand alliance is not voted to power, then I'll be hung." "My party will vanish and Awami League will see great losses." "At the end of my days, please let me die in peace. I want to repay my debt to you. So give the grand alliance a mandate to power." Ershad earlier in the day addressed a number of rallies in Rangpur. His motorcade was attacked in the morning though no serious injuries were reported. bdnews24.
