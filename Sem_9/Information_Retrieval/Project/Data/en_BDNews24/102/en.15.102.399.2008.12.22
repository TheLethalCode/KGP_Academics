 PARIS, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux fought back from three goals down to win 4-3 at Monaco on Sunday and go second in Ligue 1. Monaco, thumped 6-0 at home by Bordeaux last season, hoped for revenge after three goals in 50 minutes, including two by forward Alexandre Licata.

PSG were 2-1 up when a shot when a shot by Stephane Sessegnon hit the crossbar on 76 minutes and apparently landed behind the line, according to a video replay. Referee Bertrand Layec disallowed the effort and seven minutes later midfielder Siaka Tiene earned Valenciennes a share of the points. "I didn't hesitate for a second," Layec told reporters. "It was simply impossible for me to to say for sure whether the ball had crossed the line or not." Olympique Marseille lost ground with an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat by Nancy on Sunday that left them in fifth place, six points off the pace. "There's not much to say, they were good and we were bad, Marseille coach Eric Gerets, told reporters. "We were deservedly hammered.
