 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - The Truth Commission will wind up operations on Dec. 31, paving way for the law ministry to take over the unfinished tasks, its chairman said on Wednesday. They will try to be through with as many assignments as they can by the year-end, Habibur Rahman Khan told reporters at a routine press briefing in his office. Khan said they had sent a letter to the ministry to this end on Dec. 15. The commission started operations on August 3 for five months until Jan. 5. The former Supreme Court judge said some clemency papers needed to be handed out, penalty money realised, and appeals seeking leniency reviewed. The mercy commission handed down 451 verdicts out of 491 cases. Some 17 cases had been sent to the Anticorruption Commission and 13 to National Coordination Committee on serious crimes and corruption, he added. Thirty people did not show up before the commission despite applying to the commission. The commission has penalised clemency seekers around Tk 37 crore to date, with 223 persons depositing around Tk 27 crore to the state coffers. Khan said they had decided to grant clemency to some 320 persons but until Wednesday granted leniency to 180. Another 125people are about to get clemency, he added. The Truth Commission chief said he had doubts that all those who had sought clemency would get so by the year-end. b
