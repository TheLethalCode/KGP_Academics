<TEXT>
 Gaibandha, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Thursday claimed himself "the architect" of the present Awami League-led electoral alliance. "I am the architect of the grand alliance. After we joined the fourteen-party alliance, it became the grand alliance, not a fifteen-party alliance," he explained.. The JP chief also asked for an end to the 'boat-plough row' to create conditions for victory in the elections. Addressing a campaign rally at Gobindaganj Multilateral High School in the evening, Ershad said, "The boat-plough rift stands in our way to a sure win and we must stay united." On his previous assertions that AL had "broken the seat deal" with JP, he said, "We gave up 254 seats for the grand alliance. We had candidates prepared for all 300 seats but accepted just 46 under the deal. "But AL candidates are still contesting for some of the seats allotted to us." "We didn't field any candidates in the four city corporation elections in order to allow AL to win," Ershad said, adding his party had always made concessions for solidarity. The former president said, "BNP approached me in 1996, but I didn't respond. If I had, the results would have been very different." He asked people of Gobindaganj to vote for the plough which he said "will prove that Gobindaganj has no room for others." bdnews24
