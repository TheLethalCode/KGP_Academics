 MILAN, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jose Mourinho detests the endless media commitments after matches in Italy, said the Inter Milan coach. "For one hour I have to speak with the press and I hate it, I really hate it," the former Chelsea manager said in a television interview with Britain's Sky Sports.
