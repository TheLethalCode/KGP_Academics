<TITLE> Brazil boss Dunga to call up Italy hopeful Amauri </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga has said he intends to call up Amauri and avoid the risk of losing the Juventus striker to Italy. Amauri is applying for an Italian passport and, as things stand, he would be eligible to play for the world champions when it comes through because he has never represented his homeland. The 28-year-old has said he would like to play for Italy, where he has spent almost all of his senior career, if he continues to be overlooked by Brazil. Azzurri boss Marcello Lippi has said he will consider him when he becomes eligible for selection. "I'm ready to call up Amauri as long as he does not demand a (regular) starting place," Dunga told Wednesday's La Gazzetta dello Sport. "It would be better for him if he enters on tip-toes. Everyone wants Amauri in Brazil but if the lad gets his first match wrong, he'd be destroyed the day after." Amauri has been in impressive form since joining Juve from Palermo in the close season, scoring 11 goals in Serie A this term. If Dunga is good to his word, he could play his first international match against Italy, as fate has it. Brazil will play the world champions in a friendly at London's Emirates Stadium on Feb. 10. Dunga said he has been irritated by statements made by Amauri's agent to the Brazilian press demanding he be given a regular place. "Not even Pele demanded a starting place in the Selecao," he said. "Amauri should ask Kaka and Ronaldinho, two Ballon d'Or winners, if they have ever demanded a starting place.
