 MADRID, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain will play an international friendly against England in Seville in February after the visitors refused to play at Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said on Tuesday. In a statement, the RFEF said it had decided to hold the match at Sevilla's Sanchez Pizjuan stadium on Feb. 11, without giving any further explanation. The RFEF was fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($91,910) after Shaun Wright-Phillips, Ashley Cole, Rio Ferdinand, Jermain Defoe and Jermaine Jenas were racially abused at the Bernabeu after England's last game there in 2004
