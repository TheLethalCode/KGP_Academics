 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com) - Businessman Noor Ali, who had filed a case against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, apologised to AL supporters at a rally on Thursday "in case of any misunderstanding". "I'm seeking your forgiveness if there are any misgivings among you about the case," Ali said joining an AL election rally with Hasina in Nawabganj. Speaking after Ali, Hasina said those who had filed false cases against her sought to apologise "at their moment of truth". Ali, who had filed a Tk 5 crore extortion case against the ex-PM, on Wednesday claimed he had been coerced into suing Hasina by some in the caretaker government. An AL candidate for the forestalled Jan. 22, 2007 general elections, Ali had charged Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury with Tejgaon police on June 13 last year. But on Nov. 5, the police dropped charges against the former prime minister on a lack of evidence. Another businessman, Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who had filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against the AL chief, also recently hinted at such coercion. bdnews2
