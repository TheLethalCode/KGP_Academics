 Dhaka, December 24 (bdnews24.com) --- Rajshahi emerged as the champions of the 10th National Cricket League despite losing to Khulna in their last match as title contenders Barisal suffered a shocking two-wicket defeat to Dhaka in the final round on Wednesday. All-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad slammed his fourth consecutive century denying Barisal who looked well poised for a victory and handed the trophy to Rajshahi dramatically. Both Rajshahi and Barisal finished the campaign with the same 101 points, but Rajshahi were crowned due to their more outright wins than their rivals.
