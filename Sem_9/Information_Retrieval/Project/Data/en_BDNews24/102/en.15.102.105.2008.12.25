 JERUSALEM, Thu Dec 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni travelled to Cairo on Thursday to discuss growing violence along the Israel-Gaza border and the prospects of renewing an Egyptian-brokered truce that ended last week. Livni's talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak come a day after Palestinian militants in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip fired more than 80 rockets and mortars at southern Israel and an Israeli air strike killed a Hamas gunman. Israeli cabinet minister Meir Sheetrit said on Israel Radio that Livni will "tell Mubarak and the Egyptians that Israel will not tolerate the situation of Hamas firing at towns in the south." Livni said on Wednesday that Israel will "change the reality" of the situation in the Gaza Strip. Under a six-month ceasefire that ended in violence last week, Hamas agreed to halt rocket fire in return for Israel easing a blockade that was tightened after the Islamist group seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007
