 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has blamed the media for carrying 'misleading' information in reports that party chief Khaleda Zia asked her party to 'surround polling centres' until results were out. "The party chief just asked party workers and supporters to stay alert about the poll results not 'cordon' the polling centres," office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said Friday. "Worries and apprehensions about the elections are still there, especially given the behaviour of the administration and several organisations raising concern," he said at a regular press briefing at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. Citing newspaper reports of "300 grenades being recovered" Rizvi said they could have been used "to kill Khaleda Zia." "What has the government done all these days?" he asked, saying leaflets threatening to the former prime minister's life were still being distributed just days ahead of the polls. "The government hasn't done a thing about that," the BNP office secretary complained. "Media also reported that some three lakh NGO workers will observe the election but there are controversies about the NGOs' working procedures, accounts and funds," the BNP leader said. "Is this to support 'a party'?" the BNP leader asked, suggesting their motives must be probed. On recent allegations by rival parties of "corruption under BNP's government", the party spokesperson claimed that TIB reports show less corruption during BNP rule than during AL regime. "Although TIB reports are not all above board," he added. bdnew
