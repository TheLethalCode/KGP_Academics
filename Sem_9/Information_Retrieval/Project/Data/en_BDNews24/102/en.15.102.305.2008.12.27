 Feni, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked people to watch for the BNP and its allies who she said will start doling 'black money' out to people to buy votes from Saturday, two days ahead of the general elections She told them to choose between getting Tk 100 for a day and live in woes for the next five years. "They will go to you with black money. You will have to be aware of that," the AL chief said at a street rally at Biswa Road in Comilla on Saturday on her way to Chittagong. "It's now up to you whether you will take Tk 100 or 1,000 for a day, or buy things at cheaper rate in the next five years. You will have to decide it. They will torture people for five years by giving money for one day," Hasina said. She introduced AKM Bahauddin Bahar, the AL candidate for Comilla-9, to the public. "I knew there were some problems with nomination here. Now Afzal (Khan, an AL candidate, who was refused nomination) and Bahar are working together." Earlier, Hasina addressed another public rally at Chandina bypass. If voted to power the AL would enforce the verdict of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, she said at the rally. The former prime minister said: "I give my word that we will stop corruption, crime and killing in Bangladesh." "Awami League does not believe in the politics of revenge. We believe in peace. We believe in politics of justice." bdnews
