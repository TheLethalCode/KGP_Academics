 Sumon Mahmud, Chief political correspondent Jamalpur, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Thursday asked party supporters to stay alert and cordon the polling centres until the election results are announced. "Just casting votes is not enough, you have to stay alert and cordon the polling centres until the announcement of results," she said at an election rally at Shinghajani Bahumukhy High School ground in Jamalpur. "Seeing the wave of public support towards the four-party alliance, a party is busy trying to rig and engineer elections," the former prime minister alleged. The BNP chief left her Dhaka Cantonment home around 11:30am, accompanied by party vice president Sarwari Rahman. Claiming that corruption fell during her administration, Khaleda pointed at a party and said, "Corruption spread across the country during their rule whereas they now say they tamed the terror and the corrupts." Quoting the report of a foreign organisation, she said, "In 2000 Tk 17,192 crore was embezzled which was brought down to Tk 4,391 crore in 2002 and Tk 526 crore in 2005 by the BNP-led government." "We'll ensure three meals for the people, and cut the prices of rice, lentil and oil to people's reach." "Fertilisers sold at Tk 250 in our time, whereas it's selling at Tk 1200 and Tk 800 TSP fertilisers are now available at Tk 3500," she pointed out. Khaleda promised effective measures to prevent soil erosion, resolve power crisis, take up development projects in the island areas and special programmes for women in Jamalpur. Criticising Awami League, she also said, "The country is unsafe in their hands, people suffered during their rule, the 1974 famine occurred during their time, they killed bus passengers by spreading gunpowder and people will cease to trust them." She introduced BNP candidate for Jamalpur-3 Mustafizur Rahman Babul to the audience and asked them to vote for him. She also introduced Jamalpur-5 candidate Sirajul Haque, Jamalpur-2 candidate Sultan Mahmud Babu, Jamalpur-1 candidate Shahida Akhter Rita and Jamalpur-4 candidate Faridul Kabir Talukder. She handed to them sheaf of paddy and sought votes for them. After the rally Khaleda went to Sherpur Daroga Ali Park where she addressed a rally to drum up support for Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Quamaruzzaman. Earlier, the BNP chairperson on her way to Jamalpur from Madhupur abruptly pulled over and walked into a paddy field in Ramkrishna village of Dhanbari and talked to two farmers for 10 minutes. Her security team was stunned by the surprise move and by the time she left the farmland of Rabiul, the people of Ramkrishnabari village had come over to see her. She will return to Dhaka on Thursday night after the hustings in Sherpur, Netrokona and Gazipur. On her way back to Dhaka, the former PM is scheduled to join a number of street rallies. Khaleda, who launched her campaign on Dec. 12 by visiting the shrines in Sylhet, will round her electioneering outside the capital off with Thursday's trip. She exchanged Christmas greetings with the Christians overnight at Kakrail central church on her way back home after participating in a rally in Narayanganj. She cut cake and exchanged greetings with the people of the church. The leader of BNP led four-party alliance will address a rally at Paltan ground in Dhaka on Dec 27, the last day of election campaigning. bdnews
