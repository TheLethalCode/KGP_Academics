<TITLE> Hasina, Khaleda face 'no organised' threat: IGP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top policeman has that the threats against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia "are not from an organised source". "Leaflets and CD's recovered from extremists do have threats aimed at the two leaders, but these sources are not organised," Noor Mohammad said after a meeting with home adviser MA Matin Wednesday. Home adviser MA Matin termed 'baseless' any security fears becoming potential election spoilers. "All concerned have been given orders to maintain strict security," he said. Noor, the inspector general of police, also said: "A strict security belt is being created nevertheless considering their safety and everything will be done in this regard." The police chief said all aspects of security during election were discussed with the home adviser. Director general of RAB, Hassan Mahmud Khondokar, briefing reporters after the meeting, said: "Two extremists were arrested with explosives yesterday from Chandina in Comilla, not far away from Khaleda Zia's rally." "At this moment more recovery drives are underway with the help of those detained." He also dispelled the probability of security concerns hampering the election campaigns of the former prime minsters. On the arrest of the two radicals in Comilla, he stated "They were caught and arrested due to efficient actions of RAB and now the matter is under investigation." Home secretary Abdul Karim was also present at the meeting. bdne
