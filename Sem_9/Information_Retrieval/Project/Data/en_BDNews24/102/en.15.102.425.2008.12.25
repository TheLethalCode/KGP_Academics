<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police will provide a five-tier security system for safe voting in the city on Dec 29, commissioner Nayeem Ahmed said on Thursday. "There will be a five-tier security in 15 constituencies in the capital and parts of Dhaka-2 constituency," he said. "The DMP has attached importance to three aspects in its security plans." Nayeem mentioned that the range of security measures had been enhanced this time as number of constituencies and polling centres had swelled. "Past experiences, re-demarcation of constituencies and the law and order situation have been considered in drawing out the security plans." The DMP chief briefed reporters on the measures at a monthly meeting at the Rajarbagh Police Lines auditorium in the city. "All the election-related officials have been briefed on the effective measures taken up to ensure security," Nayeem said also warning that their activities would be monitored. The home ministry and law-enforcing agencies had earlier assured that a three-tier security system, at least, would be ensured countrywide. bdnew
