<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League's election committee co-chairman HT Imam on Monday alleged that rumours against Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy were meant to influence next week's elections. "Four-party alliance leaders are talking nonsense about Joy. They are trying to attack his personal character," he said at a regular news briefing at the party's media centre in Dhanmondi. Asking people not to be confused by the rumours, he said, "We could do the same to many (leaders of the opponent party) by circulating leaflets in this way." Drawing attention to newspaper reports about the frozen Singapore bank account of Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco and the bribe he had received from Siemens company, Imam said, "We respect [BNP chief Khaleda Zia]. It's very shameful that her son did such a thing." Imam said, "Four-party alliance leaders are talking insane because they are now facing the truth (possible defeat in the elections)." Awami League supporters on Sunday handed over four youths to Ramna police for distributing leaflets about Joy. The leaflets carried angry remarks about his so-called anti-Islamic statements. The young men, who identified themselves as BUET students, were Himel, Iqbal, Samad and Jahid, Ramna police chief said. The arrestees told reporters that pro-BNP Doctors Association of Bangladesh had supplied them the leaflets titled, ' Save Islam, save the country'. They said they were campaigning for BNP. bdnews2
