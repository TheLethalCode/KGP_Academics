<TEXT>
 Bandarban, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Voters in the Bandarban hill district see a neck-and-neck fight between three candidates in the constituency. The 'Prince' and two other local heavyweights are all indigenous candidates  one of them running under the grand alliance banner, another from the four-party and the third as independent. The grand alliance candidate Bir Bahadur Wu Shue Sing, an Awami League central leader, four-party representative and former district BNP president Sa Ching Pru Jerry, and independent candidate and Jono Sanghaty Samity assistant general secretary KS Maung are all residents of Madhyam Para in the town. Bandarban, a home of indigenous people, happens to be the 300th seat of the national parliament and has 1,95,995 registered voters with 1,02,930 males and 93,065 females. Sa Ching Pru being the son of Bomang circle chief (Bomang King) is popularly known as prince. He was detached from his party for a long time as he got involved in controversies and feud. The two other rivals Bir Bahadur and KS Maung have been in the good books of their parties and managed central posts. Jerry had long been Upazila chairman and then became local government council (Hill District Council) chairman during 1989-97. He was elected MP to the sixth parliament (JS) in 1996. Jerry could win this time from Bandarbans, which is known as AL stronghold, BNP leaders and workers deem. Bir Bahadur won the JS elections successively in 1991, 1996 and 2001. He was also made Chittagong hill tracts development board chairman during the 1996-2001 AL rule. Bir Bahadur won the 2001 JS election when AL experienced a humiliating defeat. JSS assistant general secretary KS Maung is vying the polls as an independent candidate since his party failed the registration bid. Known as smart and silver-tongued, Maung popularised his party at the grass-roots levels when he was the party's district president. KS Maung, though earlier supported AL, is contesting the polls and has become a factor for both rivals. A section of the indigenous people and settlers (Bangalee) will vote for him, his supporters believe. Others even hope that he will win. Chhoton Kanti Tanchangya, another independent candidate for the constituency, is a UPDF leader. His party too did not get the Election Commission registration. He says he is running to popularise his party and himself and the election is the best platform to follow the pursuit. The district administration has removed his campaign posters as they carried the name of a non-registered party. He does not plan to print fresh posters. Bir Bahadur, Jerry and KS Maung are in the main focus of the voters as observed by bdnews24.com correspondent in Bandarbans. There will be a close battle among the three candidates, they believe but Sa Ching Prue Jerry will have a share in the votes of Bir Bahadur and KS Maung, locals opine. bdn
