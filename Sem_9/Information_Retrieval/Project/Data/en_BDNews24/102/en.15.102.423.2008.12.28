<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Candidates in the four constituencies of the port city face overwhelming demands from voters on the issue of local development. Rival candidates, however, while promising solutions if elected blame each other for the staggering problems. Voters in the areas say it is evident that the main battle will be locked between the two alliances led by Awami League and BNP. But two independent candidates will be concerns for alliance candidates in two seats  Double-Mooring and Chandgaon-Boalkhali. Some 30 candidates are vying for the four seats in the city. Voters say they prioritise local growth and keeping prices down over partisan ideologies. They will vote for those who are capable of ensuring development and low prices. Considering the voters' sentiments these issues were prominent in the campaigns of both alliances. Irrespective of partisan affiliation, inhabitants of the port city resent the negligence of eight former AL and BNP ministers and state ministers over local development issue. Crisis in different sectors including water, power, gas, water-logging, communications system, education and healthcare in Chittagong  the country's second city will be reflected in the polls now knocking at the door, voters say. Mohan Babu of Muradpur told bdnews24.com, "A silent revolution could lead the big shots to a defeat as there is no scope for rigging or any other unfair means this time." "I'll vote the alliance that I can feel has the ability to develop the city further," Shafiul Alam, a retailer from Shulakbahar under Chittagong-9 (Double-Mooring), told bdnews24.com. "We don't want to hear a bunch of empty promises, we want our meals, clothes and easy accommodation to be ensured," he said. Alam, like many others, thinks former BNP minister Abdullah Al Noman will find it tougher than before "as BNP's Mir Nasir group and Jamaat-e-Islam are indirectly backing independent candidate Manzur Alam". On the other hand, AL candidate Afsarul Amin and JP candidate Morshed Murad  both of the grand alliance allies are also exerting pressures on Noman, says Khokan Sawdagar of Kusumbagh. Sharing his views with bdnews24.com, construction worker from the same area Abdus Salam says, "Acting city mayor Manzur Alam will have a slice of both AL and BNP shares of votes." He also says, "Manzur Alam is popular among the labourers and low income groups." Bakhtear and Abu Ahmed from Bahaddar Bari area under Chittagong-7 (Chandgaon-Boalkhali) have also shared their version of the views that former BNP foreign minister M Morshed Khan won three times from the area but did nothing remarkable. "We hope the new candidate (Ershad Ullah), if elected, will help recoup the damage done to BNP's image," said Bakhtear. Abu says, "Local ward commissioner Mahbub Alam backed by former minister Morshed Khan is running from the constituency as an independent candidate dealing a blow to the four-party candidate Ershad Ullah. Grand alliance candidate Moyeenuddin Khan Badal could reap benefit from the situation." Boalkhali resident Nabi Sawdagar (60) told bdnews24.com, "Though quite near the city, my area remained in the dark for long and massive price hikes have angered the people here. We all want a change." Monir Hossain and Jahangir Alam from Bakalia ward under Chittagong-8 also shared their views with bdnews24.com saying, "Four-party candidate and industrialist Shamsul Alam is a fresher in politics for which he seems to be a dark horse in the area." "But grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam BSc is well known as a close-to-people leader and he has contributions in the local development." "There would be no problem in this area if the money the two industrialist candidates are spending for campaigns were spent for local development," points out Abul Kalam Azad from Chawkbazar. Babul Chowdhury from Nimtala under Chittagong-10 (Bandar-Patenga) said, 'Water and electricity are what the mainly labourer community here wants." Election battle will be confined between four-party candidate and former minister Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury and grand alliance candidate MA Latif. Different organisations in Chittagong including Greater Chittagong Development Actions Committee had rallies and other programmes urging the voters to choose the pro-development candidates and also demanding the candidates to prioritise Chittagong development after they get the people's mandate. bdnews
