<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - BRTA boss Sunil Kanti Basu observed Wednesday that half of all licenses issued to drivers are fake. "The politicians are responsible for this," he claimed, at a discussion on the prevention of institutional corruption at the Anticorruption Commission offices. "Fake licenses were issued under the umbrella of a section of politicians," said the BRTA chairman. He also said, "The mobile courts are ineffective and are paving way for more corruption." ACC chairman Lt Gen (retd) Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, replying to some of BRTA's observations, said graft cannot be curbed from the country by formulating laws and filing cases. "You have to identify corruption in the communication ministry and in its subordinate sections." Iqbal Mahmood, secretary to the ministry of communication, said, "There is no way to deny that the ministry is affected by corruption." "We must find out ways to reduce corruption." But the secretary avoided answering questions related to irregularities in bus fare, movement of vehicles without proper fitness certificates, and mismanagement in railway. "After November 13, I sent mail to 250 persons to look into various issues, but only 3 persons responded," Mahmood stated. Referring to irregularities in tender processes, discussants suggested that they should invite tenders online. In a previous meeting on Nov 13 with the ministry of communications, the ACC identified some sectors as "absolutely corrupt". Wednesday's meeting was one of an ongoing series between the ACC and government ministries to identify measures to tackle institutional corruption. Among others present meeting were ACC commissioners Mohammad Habibur Rahman and Abul Hasan Manjur Mannan and officials of the ministry of communications and its subordinate institutions. bdnews24
