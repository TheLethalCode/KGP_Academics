 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka survived a few close calls to see off the first day at 172 for six after they decided to bat first in the first Test against Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Friday. Left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan was the wrecker-in-chief to claim three wickets for 43 as the visitors lost five wickets for 52 runs before bad light cut short the day's play with 22 overs to go. Dense morning fog had delayed the start by about two hours and umpires were forced to call off the day's proceeding 10.4 overs after tea break. Bangladesh's pace duo of Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Mahbubul Alam Robin made the most of the moisture to get movement on the wicket covered by a little bit of grass. Sri Lankan openers Malintha Warnapura and Michael Vandort would often play and miss and got hit on their pads. Mashrafee and Robin were unlucky not to get decisions in their favour until the eighth over when, Mashrafee, the strike bowler, finally trapped Warnapure leg before for 14 in the ninth over, leaving the visitors at 24 for one. Vandort along with new batsman Kumar Sangakkara saw off the new ball to go for lunch with the side 27 for one in 12 overs. The two left-handers continued from whether they had left off and looked threatening before Shakib broke the 95-run stand. Shakib, who changed end in his 10th over, had Sangakkara caught at midwicket by Mohammad Ashraful in the same over for 43 and pacer Shahadat Hossain followed Shakib to dismiss Vandort, who pulled the lanky pacer to Shakib at midwicket for 44. Sangakkara, second in the ICC Test batsmen ranking, struck 44 studded with seven fours in 101-ball knock while Vandort hammered five fours and one six facing 124 balls. Shakib continued to bowl in the right areas and was rewarded for his perseverance when he removed skipper Mahela Jayawardene and Tilakratne Dilshan in a row. Jayawardene was bowled by an arm-ball for three just before and Dilshan (14) fell to a straight delivery after tea. Shakib was backed up some disciplined efforts from Shahadat, who returned two for 47 after accounting for Prasanna Jayawardene just before the close. Shahadat pitched a short ball off stump to prompt Prasanna (6) to pull, but the wicketkeeper-batsman found Tamim Iqbal at fine leg
