<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Jukta Front has alleged more black money is being used for vote buying this time in comparison to any other election held in the past. "New 1000 taka notes are playing a significant role in buying and selling ballots", said Gono Forum presidium member Pankaj Bhattacharya at a pre-poll press conference. Bhattacharya accused the two major alliances led by BNP and Awami League, of using black money, citing his experiences during campaigns in Chittagong and Narsingdhi. He added that Jukta Front leader Dr. Kamal Hossain had already submitted a written statement of these charges to the chief election commissioner and chief adviser and "detailed information" would be handed over to the Election Commission before the election on Monday. Kamal Hyder, chief of Jatiya Jukta Front's media cell, also read out a written statement at the press conference at the alliance's Segunbagicha office. He said three candidates of the Front had faced threats, attacks and obstacles in canvassing votes. Hyder said the life of Kalyan Party candidate Ferdausul Alam from Chapainawabganj-2 was threatened and Gono Forum's candidate Golam Rabbani from Chapainawabganj also faced obstacles in his campaigning. He further alleged that workers of the four-party alliance had attacked supporters of Jukta Front candidate for Rajshahi-3. The alliance sought the intervention of the Election Commission and head of the government in this regard, said Hyder. bdnew
