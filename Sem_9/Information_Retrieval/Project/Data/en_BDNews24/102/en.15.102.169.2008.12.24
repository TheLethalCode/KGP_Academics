"On approval of the Supreme Court the law ministry has already appointed 284 judicial magistrates," EC joint secretary (law) NI Khan said to bdnews24.com . The ministry sent a letter on Tuesday to the EC, which will take decisions on the issue on Wednesday, he said. The magistrates are empowered to dispose cases off-hand through summary trial and punish the violators, Khan said. "Meanwhile, over 700 executive magistrates have been appointed in two phases," he added. The EC empowered some 396 administrative cadre officials and assistant commissioners (land) as executive magistrates, EC officials said.
