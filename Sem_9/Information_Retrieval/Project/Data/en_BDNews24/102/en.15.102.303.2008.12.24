<TEXT>
 Sumon Mahbub Senior Political Correspondent Pirganj, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked the citizens of Rangpur to elect her, their daughter-in-law, to the parliament. Hasina went to the northern district for electioneering on Wednesday. She is contesting polls from Rangpur-6 (Pirganj). "I have come to you to seek vote. I have to give time to all constituencies. It might not be possible for me to come here again. I leave all my responsibilities with you," Hasina said at an election campaign rally at Pirganj High School ground. "I have a demand as a daughter-in law of Rangpur. My prestige now depends on you." "My husband is ill. My children are staying abroad. I hope you will save my prestige." Hasina contested from the same constituency in 2001 election and lost to Jatiya Party candidate Noor Mondol by 12,000 votes. The AL chief pledged to construct Kaizzar Bridge in Pirganj and extract coal from Pirganj coal mine. Among others, Hasina's sister-in-law Rawshan Ara Wahed and nephew Shahbaz Hossain spoke at the rally. Pirganj Upazila BNP general secretary Abul Kashem joined the AL at the rally. Hasina left her Sudha Sadan residence shortly before 8am for the northern districts in the morning, addressing a number of rallies on her way to Rangpur. After her motorcade crossed the Bangabandhu Jamuna Muti-purpose Bridge just outside Dhaka, hundreds of supporters of Jannat Ara Henri, the AL candidate for Sirajganj-2 constituency, intercepted it. She urged them to vote the AL-led grand alliance to power. Reaching Bogra, Hasina addressed her first public gathering at Sherpur bus stand. She sought votes for AL's Bogra-5 candidate Habibur Rahman. "I urge you to vote for the 'boat' symbol and we are with you," she said. She attended a second rally at Matidali in Bogra, where BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is running against AL's Md Momtaz Uddin and others. Hasina is scheduled to address another rally in Dinajpur before returning to Dhaka on Wednesday night. The former prime minister formally launched her election campaign on Dec 13. She toured the southwest on a four-day campaign trip last week. bd
