 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)Over 600,000 law enforcers will be strategically deployed across the country ahead of the election on Dec 29, in the home ministry's security measures for a trouble-free vote. The Election Commission, side by side, has formed a law and order maintenance cell that will keep abreast of the security situation from the day ahead to the day after the election. Dhaka will get 'five-tier security' this year, says commissioner Nayeem Ahmed. "There will be a five-tier security in 15 constituencies in the capital and parts of Dhaka-2 constituency," he said. Nayeem mentioned that the range of security measures had been enhanced for the city this time as the number of constituencies and polling centres had swelled. "Past experiences, re-demarcation of constituencies and the law and order situation have been considered in drawing out the security plans." The home ministry and law enforcing agencies had earlier assured that a three-tier security system, at least, would be ensured countrywide. The largest single force throughout the country will be 466,000 Ansar, in addition to 80,000 police, 50,000 armed forces, 25,000 BDR and 6,000 Rapid Action Battalion personnel. Some 284 judicial and some 715 executive magistrates have also been appointed with the power to hold summary trials. A total of 35,216 vote centres and 177,107 voting booths will serve 81,058,698 registered voters around the country. The EC had renamed voting centres in the lead up to polls this year as 'normal' and 'critical' from the previously 'non-risky' and 'risky' categories. Home ministry officials say 16 law enforcers, including three from army and one armed Ansar, will be stationed at each 'normal' voting centre in city areas with 14 law enforcers per centre elsewhere. 'Critical' centres will have 18 law enforcers including two more army personnel. Army, BDR, RAB and armed police personnel will carry out their duty as striking forces till Dec 31 in line with home ministry orders. They were deployed from Dec 24. A total of 18 striking forces combining Navy and Coastguard will work across the coastal districts. BDR forces, instead of armed forces, will carry out their duty as striking forces in 70 upazilas on the country's borders. Besides, BDR and army combined will act as striking forces in another 17 upazilas where border areas need extra surveillance. The striking forces will take prompt actions in order to avoid any untoward or violent incident in line with directives from civil administration, say officials. Every district of the country will also hold one army battalion that includes 650-750 members. Armed forces will remain constantly vigilant at strategic points so that presiding and returning officers can contact them at all times. They will assist police and Ansar on demand in maintaning law and order for polling centre security. Massive drives had also been launched countrywide in the lead up to polls to arrest 'trouble makers' and suspected terrorists so the security of the Dec 29 vote should not be hampered, the officials say. bdnew
