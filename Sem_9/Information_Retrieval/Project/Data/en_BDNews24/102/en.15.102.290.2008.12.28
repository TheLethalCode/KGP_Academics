 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com) - The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) on Sunday approved the Tk 1,480 crore Begunbari-Hatirjheel development project. "The caretaker government approved the project in its last moments considering its importance," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said emerging from the meeting. "With the implementation of the Begunbari-Hatirjheel project, traffic problem in the city will ease a great deal, while the area will also be rid of land grabbers," the finance adviser said. Replying to a query, he said the present government will not hold any more sessions of ECNEC, unless any urgent issue arises. The work of Begunbari-Hatirjheel development project began in July 2007 and scheduled to end by June 2010. Sunday's ECNEC meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed also approved a school feeding programme project under the primary and mass education ministry. bdnews2
