 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - The chief election commissioner backs mobile phone networks remaining active across the country on Election Day. "I personally think, mobile phone networks should run as usual on voting day," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on Wednesday at the Election Commission. "But the Election Commission is yet to reach a decision on whether the cell phone networks will run normally," the CEC said. "It would be preferred if the they are working, as returning officers and assistant returning officers will be able to communicate easily," he added. Huda said the commission is still reviewing opinions in favour and against the issue, before reaching a final decision. "Whatever the decision on the issue, the EC will make it by Dec 27," he added. Mobile phone networks were inoperative during the 8th Jatiya Sangsad vote in 2001. bdnews2
