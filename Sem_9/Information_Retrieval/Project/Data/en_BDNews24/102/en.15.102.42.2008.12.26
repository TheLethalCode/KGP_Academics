<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)- Ricky Ponting hit a rapid century but Makahya Ntini struck late on as South Africa edged the opening day of the second Test against Australia. After the out-of-form Matthew Hayden had fallen to Ntini for eight, Simon Katich (54) and Ricky Ponting (101) shared 107 for the second wicket. Ponting, dropped on 24, raced to his century, before falling to Paul Harris. But Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin all failed to build on starts as the hosts finished on 280-6.
