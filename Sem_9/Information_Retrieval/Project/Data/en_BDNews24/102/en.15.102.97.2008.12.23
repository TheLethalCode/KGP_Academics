<TEXT>
 Comilla, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia again said on Tuesday a conspiracy was still on to sabotage the next week's general election. "Only a few days are left to the election. Still conspiracies are there to foil the polls. "Everyone has to be on the alert for the plots because if the election is subverted an irreparable damage will be done to the country ," observed the former prime minister at an election rally at Comilla Town Hall. She left her Dhaka Cantonment home for Feni at 11am. On the way, she sought votes for four-party alliance candidates M Shamsul Islam for Munshiganj-3, Khorshed Alam for Munshiganj-7, Majeda Ahsan Munshi for Comilla-3 and Shah Mofazzal Hossain for Comilla-4. "For the cancelled Jan. 22, 2007 polls I was a candidate for this seat but I am sorry that this time I could not compete from here," Khaleda said to a large gathering and asked the people to vote for Aminur Rashid Yasin for Comilla-6. She refuted her rivals' claims that BNP had done no development when in power. "Everywhere you look, there is some development work done by BNP including schools, colleges, bridges, universities." Talking about the measures to prevent religious extremism during her tenure, the former prime minister claimed, "When we were in power we dealt with terrorism strongly and never compromised with extremism." She pointed at famines, lack of press freedom and the 'autocratic' one-party system during previous Awami League rules. "[Late president Ziaur Rahman] established multi-party democracy and press freedom and that is the reason why the country has so many journalists and newspapers." In the last two years, the economy of the country became stagnant; exports declined and the country was made a market for products of another country, she alleged. Khaleda also said that the harassment of people in the name of preventing corruption needed to be stopped and the arrest of those really corrupt ensured. "During our rule, submarine cable was launched and we established a separate ministry for the development of information technology." The rally at the Town Hall was presided over by BNP joint president Rabeya Chowdhury. On her way to Feni from Comilla, Khaleda is scheduled to address rallies at Habiganj of Chandpur, Ramganj of Laxmipur, Pratapganj, Choumuhuni of Noakhali, Sonapur, Kibir Haat, Boshur Haat and Dagonbhuiyan of Feni. On Monday, on her way from Sylhet, she addressed the last rally at Kapasia, Gazipur and came back to the capital at 3:30am. bdne
