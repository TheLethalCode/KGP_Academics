 Grant McCool and Martha Graybow NEW YORK Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Could the Bernard Madoff scandal, alleged to be the biggest-ever Wall Street scam, really have been the act of just one person? Fraud experts say they think it's impossible. White-collar crime experts who are following the Bernard Madoff case say they doubt that the money manager, who authorities say has confessed to the fraud as "all his fault," could have carried out such a massive scheme alone. They say that based on their experience investigating complex financial cases, the suspected $50 billion fraud was too lengthy and involved too many phony documents to have been carried out by only one individual. No charges have been brought against anyone except Madoff, who was charged with securities fraud on December 11. He has not formally responded to the accusations in court. Authorities are continuing to investigate. A lawyer for an accountant at the small auditing firm that Madoff used, Friehling & Horowitz in a suburb of New York City, told Reuters that his client had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors requesting documents. "He is going to comply with that subpoena," attorney Andrew Lankler said of his client, accountant David Friehling. The U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, which is prosecuting the case, has declined to comment on the probe. Legal experts not involved in the case, including fraud investigators and former federal prosecutors, say it is hard to believe no one else associated with Madoff knew of the suspected scheme. "PREPOSTEROUS" "His claim that he was the only one involved is preposterous," said James Ratley, president of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in Austin, Texas. "The amount of transactions, the number of dollars that are involved in the Ponzi, I just don't see any way he could be the only one involved," Ratley said. A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients. Ponzi schemes collapse when a large number of redemptions are requested and investors have not put in enough funds to cover them. Madoff's investors say they received detailed financial statements over many years showing consistently high returns. His purported investing success drew a worldwide clientele. Carrying out such a detailed scheme "is not doable on his own," said Ellen Zimiles, a former federal prosecutor who is chief executive officer of Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, a New York firm that works with corporations on compliance. "That process alone of managing the statements is not a one-person job, and certainly not a person who is going from Palm Beach to Nice to Abu Dhabi," she said. In court papers, FBI agent Theodore Cacioppi has said Madoff told him "that he personally traded and lost money for institutional clients, and that it was all his fault." Madoff, 70, is quoted in the documents describing the investment arm of his Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC as "basically, a giant Ponzi scheme." His securities firm employed numerous family members, including his brother Peter, two sons and a niece. "They may not necessarily have known," said Pravin Rao, a former federal prosecutor who now is an attorney at law firm Perkins Coie LLP in Chicago. "Sometimes family members are shielded from the fraud in a perverse way of protecting them." "HORRIFIC FRAUD" His sons, Andrew and Mark Madoff, who both worked at their father's firm, have said through their attorney that they were not involved in the asset management side of the business and were shocked to learn of the suspected scheme. The lawyer said the Madoff sons turned their father in to authorities after he confessed to them. Another family member, Shana Madoff, who is Bernard Madoff's niece and was a compliance lawyer at the firm's market-making unit, has also said through a spokesman that she had no prior knowledge of the "horrific fraud perpetrated" and is fully cooperating with the investigation." An attorney for Peter Madoff did not return calls for comment. Madoff's wife, Ruth, was ordered to surrender her passport as a condition of the money manager being allowed to stay out of jail on bail. Ruth Madoff has not spoken publicly about the case, and Madoff's attorney, Ira Sorkin, has declined to answer questions about her. A lawyer for a top official at Madoff's firm, Frank DiPascali, has said that "we are trying to sift through the facts like everybody else." DiPascali dealt with client accounts and worked for Madoff's firm for more than 30 years, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter. The alleged fraud appears to have itself lasted 30 years, the newspaper said. Investigators are likely pressing Madoff for names of other people who might have been involved, said Aitan Goelman, a criminal defense attorney at law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP in Washington, D.C. But even if the money manager cooperates with the federal probe, given his age, he is still likely to get what could in effect be a life sentence if he decides to plead guilty in the case, said Goelman, a former federal prosecutor. He and other experts said additional charges may not come soon. They said authorities have months of work ahead examining computer records and documents that are being made available to them. "I don't believe that they are going to rush," Goelman said. "They will try to be thorough and try to talk to everybody who needs to be talked to."
