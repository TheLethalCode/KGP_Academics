 Gaibandha, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has accused Awami League candidate for Gaibandha-5, Fazle Rabbi, of betraying the 'grand alliance'. He said the alliance, which JP is part of, had endorsed JP presidium member Rowshan Ershad, but Rabbi was campaigning ignoring the decision of the alliance. "I made him state minister while I was in power. But he betrayed me and joined Awami League and is now betraying with the grand alliance," the former president said on Thursday at a public rally at Kalir Bazar under Fulchhari Upazila in the district. Rabbi, when reached by bdnews24.com, said he had not betrayed the AL-led alliance. "The party has nominated me as a candidate and I will run elections," he said. Rabbi was a lawmaker for Gaibandha-5 for three times from 1988 to 1996 and a minister in Ershad's unelected cabinet. He joined AL before 2001 election. Rowshan, Ershad's wife, was elected lawmaker in 2001 from the constituency. Ershad introduced Rowshan to the public and urged them to vote for plough, the JP's polls symbol to elect her. The JP chairman also asked Rabbi to step aside from the race. Ershad pledged if the alliance won they Dec. 29 polls, it would take permanent measure to save Fulchhari Upazila from the erosion of the river Jamuna. It would also create employment for the impoverished people of the char lands, he added. bdnews
