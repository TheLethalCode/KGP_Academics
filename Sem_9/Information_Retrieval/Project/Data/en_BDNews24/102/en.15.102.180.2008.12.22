 ISLAMABAD, Mon Dec 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistani air force conducted an exercise on Monday causing delay to two civilian flights, an airline official said, as tension with old rival India simmered over last month's attacks in Mumbai. "Two of our flights were delayed for some time because the PAF was conducting some exercises but now everything is back on normal," said Muhammad Latif, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines, referring to the air force (PAF). The flights were delayed at the airport in the eastern city of Lahore, near the Indian border, Latif said, while dismissing television news channel reports of a high alert at Pakistani airports. An air force spokesman declined to comment when asked about an exercise saying only: "In view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance." Pakistan last week summoned a senior Indian diplomat in Islamabad to protest against recent alleged airspace violations by Indian warplanes. Indian fighter jets had crossed into Pakistani airspace over Kashmir and Punjab province, the government said on Dec. 13. Pakistan said its own fighter jets were scrambled to chase off the intruders, but it also played down the incident by describing the violations as "technical" and "inadvertent". India denied any violation of Pakistani airspace
