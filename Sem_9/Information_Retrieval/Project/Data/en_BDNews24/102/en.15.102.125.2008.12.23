 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)Relations between George W Bush and the New York Times have rarely been pleasant, if not downright frosty, over the past eight years. Since his controversial election in 2000, the Bush administration has repeatedly taken exception with Times reports and editorials concerning its policies and actions ranging from foreign affairs to domestic issues. In recent months, since the deteriorating credit crisis threatened to engulf the entire US economy, the paper has examined the role of the Bush administration thought by many independent analysts to be responsible for the crisis. Unsurprisingly, the White House has been fuming with anger. But what appears to have particularly riled President Bush in his final weeks was an article published on Sunday, headlined: "White House philosophy stoked mortgage bonfire". The 4,800-word story appears to have generated so much anger within the Oval Office that a blistering attack was launched against the paper, which is widely respected for its accuracy and objectivity. On Monday, the White House formally accused the New York Times of "irresponsible reporting," "gross negligence'' and giving "kid glove treatment to Congress''. Tony Fratto, White House deputy press secretary, told reporters on Monday: "Our concern with the article yesterday was that it had a narrow focus, and that was to simply blame the housing crisis and the resulting financial crisis on this administration's push for homeownership.'' "That is about as myopic as you can get, and unsophisticated as you can get," he added. Fratto's remarks followed an unusual two-pronged broadside delivered by the Bush administration on Sunday, when press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement accusing the Times of relying "on hindsight with blinders on and one eye closed.'' The White House followed with a lengthy critique of the story called "Setting the Record Straight." In response to the unusually harsh reaction, New York Times editor Bill Keller said, "The piece that has driven the White House spokesmen to such a show of apoplexy was based on on-the-record interviews with dozens of current and former officials of the current administration.' He also pointed out, "[The piece] is part of an ongoing series that examines in depth the accountability of numerous players in the economic meltdown, including Congress, rating agencies, brokerage houses and the Fed". The Bush story was indeed the latest installment in the series called The Reckoning, which studied the causes of the financial crisis from many angles. Previous stories had examined the role of lawmakers like Democrat Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, and former Republican senator from Texas Phil Gramm. For the Bush installment, a team of three Times reporters set out to determine what the administration did well, and what it might have done better, in the run-up and response to the crisis. The result was a look at the president's housing policies, his de-regulatory agenda and his intense effort to persuade Congress to strengthen regulation of Fannie Mae and its sister company, Freddie Mac. The series also looked at other leading figures, including Henry Cisneros, housing secretary to Bill Clinton; Daniel Mudd, the former chief of the government-sponsored mortgage giant Fannie Mae; and Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. b
