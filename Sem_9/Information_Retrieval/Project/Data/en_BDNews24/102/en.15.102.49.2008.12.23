 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked industrialists and business entrepreneurs not to cream off exports and imports, but start raising manufacturing plants based on local needs. The AL chief urged the business leaders to create jobs for the rural poor to ensure effective development of society, addressing a meeting on her pary's 'Charter for changing days: Vision 2021' at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel on Tuesday, "Poverty is our greatest problem. Whatever success you attain as a community, no market at home will ever emerge unless you help the rural poor pull themselves out of poverty and increase their buying power," said Hasina, urging the business bosses. "Only pocketing profits through exporting the same merchandise for years together woould not lead you or the country anywhere. You must consider producing commodities locally, sell locally, create employment and help the grassroots rid themselves of poverty." Salman F Rahman, former FBCCI president and AL's private sector development adviser, organised the event. FBCCI president Annisul Huq had said earlier, "Realising that economic prosperity is indicative of political stability, we appreciate Awami League's election manifesto very much." "If Awami League comes to power, we expect the government then will attach due priority to the gas and power generation and distribution, and render BAPEX effective. "We'll provide funds for gas exploration and infrastructure development, as necessary." Corruption and procrastination in decision making are worse impediments to industrial development than dearth of funds in the country, said Huq. "Raising the GDP to 8-9 per cent should no be a problem when political terrorism and extortion can be handled successfully," he said. Adressing Hasina, the FBCCI chief said,"Madam, look at these people present here, noone would want another hartal or total closure suspending all activities countrywide." All the business leaders present raised their hands and chanted in unison, "No, we want no hartal." Former FBCCI president Yousuf Abdullah Harun said, "The upcoming government will have to take care of the problem-ridden business sector which suffered considerably during the past two years." He alleged that the BNP-led government had only favoured a counted few business houses during its regime. Women chamber president Selima Rahman said, "Days will really change when the political parties will evaluate the business people." Hasina said at last, "I'll not read out my prepared speech. I understand that overall economic development will warrant your support." "Only profiteering and living well will not do. We expect you to set up factories, employ the rural poor, produce commodities for the local people and help them rid themselves of insolvency." Describing how the country had been thriving during the AL rule, she said, "If voted to power, we'll urge you to undertake certain actions to uplift the poor." Responding to the businessmen's demands, Hasina assured them of undertaking the construction of a dual highway from Dhaka to Gazipur and a new airport. "Annisul said, 'money is no problem'. Well, we would like to leave enterprises like the construction and maintenance of a new airport and a dual highway with private entrepreneurs," the former prime minister said. "We would like to spend government money on social development. We' would specially support the development of small and medium enterprises and handicrafts." Reiterating that private sector initiatives were the main driving force in mainstream development, Hasina said, "No development is possible to sustain without the involvement of the private sector." "Besides readymade garments, you must search out demands for other products such as agricultural produces and processed food products. Then Bangladesh will no more be poor." Assuring special budget allocation for development of women entrepreneurs, Hasina said, "We'll try decentralising things so that people from all over will not have to rush to Dhaka all the time for every decision." As businessmen unanimously said they had not been so happy during the past couple of years, Hasina said, "I know. You have experienced extortions of other kinds." "You stop bribing people in power to secure business contracts. Refuse to oblige the extortionist. Then you'll have fewer things to complain about." About terrorism and terrorists, she said, "It's the military dictators who introduce terrorism. You saw me landing in jail as soon as I said a few words." Salman F Rahman also spoke. Business chiefs hailed Slaman for organising the meet. bdnews
