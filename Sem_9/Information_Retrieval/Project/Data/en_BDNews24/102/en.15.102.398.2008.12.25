 Gaibandha, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Gaibandha police on Thursday arrested four more alleged activists of the banned Islamic militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a district police official said, just a day after arrests of three JMB suspects and a huge haul of explosives. SM Moniruzzaman, Gaibandha police superintendent, told bdnews24.com that RAB, Detective Branch and local police jointly arrested the four, based on information from the three alleged JMB members arrested Wednesday night from Gaibandha villages. During Wednesday night's hauls, police retrieved huge quantities of bomb ingredients, electronic equipment, batteries, grenade casings, chemicals and books from the raids. Police said at least 55 grenades could be made using the seized materials. The arrestees are being quizzed at Govindaganj Police Station. SM Moniruzzaman had said, without elaborating, that the grenades were being made possibly for some 'special mission'. The four arrested on Thursday are Rawshan (30) son of Shuruzzaman Mian from South Harinsingha village in Ramchandrapur, machinist Mostafizur Rahman (32) of Bakadaha village in Govindaganj, Nannu Mian (32) from Chadpara and Amzad Hossain (40) who is a teacher of Afruza Anam Dakhil Madrasa in Govindaganj. Police seized books and leaflets from their houses. On Wednesday night police picked up three suspected JMB activists from Bhatparha Gopalpur in Gaibandha and Talukkanupur and Parhakachua villages in Govindaganj. SM Shibli, Govindaganj police chief, said, acting on a tip-off, police conducted raids first in Bhatparha Gopalpur village and arrested 25 year-old Rezaul Hasan Shihab. Acting on clues derived from Shihab, police raided Talukkanupur and Parhakachua villages and nabbed Al Amin (20) and Manjurul Islam Manjil (22). Of the arrestees, police say Rezaul Hasan is an 'ehsaar' category member of JMB, who is also the northern regional commander of the banned militant outfit. Police chief Shibli said a case has been filed with Govindaganj Police Station. bdnews24.co
