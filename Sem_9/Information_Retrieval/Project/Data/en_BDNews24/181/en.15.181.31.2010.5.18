 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) chairman Abdul Malek to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for obstructing the implementation of a court directive that ordered removal of all establishments on the four rivers that run along Dhaka. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Gobindra Chandra Thakur on Tuesday asked for the explanation following a petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB), a human rights and environmentalist organisation. The same explanations have been sought from the BIWTA deputy director Saidul Islam, a leader of the edible oil importers, MA Rauf Chowdhury, and the edible oil refinery businessmen leader, Golam Mostafa. The four have four days to submit their explanations. The High Court had given a directive on June 25, 2009.to remove all the establishments. The petition claimed that different steps by the four men were obstructing the implementation of the court order. Advocate Manjil Morshed, who represented HRPB at the hearing, argued that the BIWTA chairman had written to the shipping secretary on Feb 28 stating that the permissions given to different organisations to build jetties on the bank of the river Shitalakhya were legal. A similar letter was also sent to the Narayanganj deputy commissioner by the BIWTA deputy director on Mar 15 this year Morshed also said the two businessmen, involved in the edible oil sector, had sent letters to the prime minister on Feb 25, appealing to her not to remove their establishments on the river. "These actions have obstructed implementation of the court order. They have committed contempt of court," he added. Deputy attorney general Rajik Al Jalil represented the government at the hearing. bdnews
