 LILONGWE, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Amnesty International on Tuesday called for the immediate and unconditional release of Malawi's first same sex couple after a court found them guilty of unnatural practices between males and gross public indecency. A Malawi gay couple, who got engaged in a traditional ceremony late last year, was found guilty of buggery and indecency on Tuesday in a trail viewed as a test case for gay rights in the country.

The men have twice been refused bail during their trial and are being held in a maximum security prison.

Kagari said that the conviction of the couple is a step backward for Malawi. "Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga have done nothing wrong and should be released immediately." Peter Thatchell, a gay activist from Britain, also condemned the conviction. Thatchell, who has been helping the couple in prison and organising global support described the two as brave.
