<TITLE> Jamaat to contest CCC polls separately </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Jamaat-e Islami has decided to contest the Chittagong City Corporation election separately, after it received no response from BNP, its partner in the four-party alliance, on choosing a common candidate. Jamaat-supported mayoral candidate Afsaruddin Chowdhury, party's Chittagong unit chief and daily Karnaphuli editor, collected nomination paper from the district election office on Tuesday. M Shamsul Islam, party's Chittagong city unit chief, told reporters: "We've decided to participate in the election separately since we've got no response from BNP regarding CCC polls." He said six parties--Jatiya Ganatantrik Party, a faction of Islami Oikya Jote, Bangladesh Jatiya Party (Manju), Khelafat Mojlish and National People's Party -- are supporting the Jamaat candidate in the election. Asked whether they would withdraw their candidate if BNP approaches them for a common candidate, he said: "We've collected the nomination paper for participating in the polls, not for withdrawal." He, however, said: "It's premature to comment on contesting the polls unitedly." BNP and Jamaat had participated in the 2001 and 2008 national elections under the four-party alliance. They secured a landslide victory in 2001 but were defeated in 2008. b
