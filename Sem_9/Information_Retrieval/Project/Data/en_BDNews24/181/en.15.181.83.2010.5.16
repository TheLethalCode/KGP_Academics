<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Nazrul Islam Khan says the opposition party is facing police harassment in doing publicity ahead of May 19 rally at Dhaka. The policymaker made the allegation while briefing journalists about the preparations for the Paltan ground meeting at metropolitan BNP's office at Naya Paltan. BNP chief Khaleda Zia is scheduled to outline the anti-government campaign programme from the rally. Also the rally's convenor, Khan said, "Workers are being harassed by the police while distributing leaflets." "We also have news of police threatening party activists at their residence at night including in Keraniganj." The standing committee member said these undemocratic activities were meant to obstruct the rally. He also asked the government to stop obstructing the activists. BNP has already completed rallies in Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Barisal divisions. The date and location of the rally of Sylhet division is yet to be set. Claiming that the rally would be peaceful, organised and the largest to be held yet, Khan said, "Leaders and activists of the party from all districts, upazila and municipalities under the Dhaka division will be attending." Khan also revealed that the party has chosen four locations to park vehicles carrying supporters from outside the city. They are- Sishu Park Avenue, Chankharpul Avenue, Kamalapur Biswa Road and the road next to Rajdhani Market near Nagar Bhaban. Activists will head towards the rally from these locations. He also said that the interests of the country and its people are being disrupted. Referring to the issue of 10KW of power needed for the event, KHan said their application to the Dhaka Power Distribution Company is yet to be accepted. On Saturday, AL's acting general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif warned the BNP against deliberately creating "indiscipline" at Wednesday's Dhaka meeting and then blaming the government for it. Another BNP policymaker ASM Hannan Shah said it was a baseless and ill-motivated accusation made to secure partisan interests. BNP senior joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, joint secretary general Aman Ullah Aman and other senior leaders were also present at the briefing. bdne
