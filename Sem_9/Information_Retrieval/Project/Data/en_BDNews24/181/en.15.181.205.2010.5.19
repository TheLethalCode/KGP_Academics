<TITLE> Afghan peace deal hard, but crucial - NATO envoy </TITLE>

 KABUL, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reconciliation efforts with insurgents is critical for Afghanistan's stability, NATO's top diplomat for the country said on Wednesday, but he warned against compromises with hardline Taliban factions. Mark Sedwill said the international community was behind President Hamid Karzai for reaching out to those Taliban who are willing to renounce violence. Karzai will host a grand assembly of Afghans later this month to present his draft for negotiations with the Taliban and to seek advice from delegates on peace moves. "There won't be stability in Afghanistan if there is just some side deal with members of the Taliban or certain factions within the Taliban that compromises those rights, because then other communities within Afghanistan won't accept the outcome. "So, there has to be a settlement that is genuinely inclusive and respects the rights of everybody ..." he told a news conference. Back from talks with US leaders in Washington, Karzai said on Tuesday the West was starting to realise the Afghan war cannot be won militarily and that the peace process must involve talks with the Taliban. More than nine years after their ouster from power by US-backed forces, the Taliban have made a comeback despite the presence of some 140,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the US military in Afghanistan. Karzai's latest peace plan pushes for the reintegration of Taliban's foot soldiers and proposes the removal of the names of insurgent leaders from a UN sanctions list and possibly giving them asylum overseas. "Reconciliation will be hard and there will be some difficult moments, but all of us believe it is a critical element in bringing stability to this country," Sedwill said. The Taliban have repeatedly rejected Karzai's peace overtures in recent years, saying they will not engage in any peace talks as long as foreign troops remained in Afghanis
