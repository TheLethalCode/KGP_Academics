 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Weavers have called off their indefinite strike after the government decided to allow import of low-price yarn through Benapole land port. Bangladesh Handloom and Power loom Owners Association chief Mohammed Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com on Friday night that they will be starting work from Saturday. He said, "The government has declared to open the Benapol land port for yarn import. So we will go into production from [Saturday]." Bangladesh's top body of knitwear manufacturers and exporters (BKMEA) also expressed solidarity with the strikers. Leaders of the weavers also demanded the prime minister's intervention to meet their six-point charter of demands. A government committee, formed to negotiate with the striking weavers, on Thursday recommended withdrawal of the embargo on import of a few categories of yarns. Agitated weavers of Pabna, Sirajganj and Narsingdi took to the streets and blockaded the Dhaka-Sylhet highway in Narsingdi for four hours. Some 5000 weavers blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway In Narsingdi from 10:30am to 2pm Thursday bringing traffic to a halt. Weavers have for long been demanding yarn import through Benapole following the dramatic rise in yarn for weeks. Local yarn producers, however, say that resumption of yarn import through the land port would bring down prices and eventually ruin the industry. The handloom association president last Saturday said the price of yarn started to rise from October last year following the ban on imports through Benapole. One pound of 40 count yarn cost had been available at Tk 65, which has increased to Tk 115 now, he said. He alleged that the minister for jute and textiles did not keep his word about opening up the land port. According to BKMEA, the country's annual yarn demand is 10 lakh tonnes  of which seven lakh tonnes is consumed by the knit sector and the remainder by the weavers. The production capacity of the 266 spinning mills is however only six lakh tonnes. bdnews2
