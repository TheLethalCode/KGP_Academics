<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Resumption of the operation of the two power generating units, that were out of order last week, will help reduce the loadshedding that took place last week. The two plants  a 200MW unit of the Ghorashal plant and the 450MW Meghnaghat plant  that were shut down on May 8, came into operation on Thursday and Friday respectively, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) spokesperson told bdnews24.com Saturday. The country's maximum generation stood at 4,230 MW on Saturday. It had been around 3,700 MW during last week. Load shedding on Saturday night decreased to 470MW, from 611 on Friday, according to BPDB. But there remained a shortage of 400MW on Saturday as eight plants failed to work to their capacity due to maintenance problems. The current generation capacity of 49 plants stands at 5,400MW  though lack of gas means that these plants cannot generate at this level.
