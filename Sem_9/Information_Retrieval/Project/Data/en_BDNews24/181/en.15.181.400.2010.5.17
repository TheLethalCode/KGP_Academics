<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government is in trouble, says former president H M Ershad, a close ally of the ruling Awami League government. Indicating a rift between his Jatiya party and the Awami League, he directed his party men to prepare to run in the CCC elections independently from the current 'grand alliance'. However, suggesting his desire to play a more active and prominent role in the government, the sidelined former military strongman said that his party was ready to help the government over the current difficulties. Chairman of his faction of the Jatiya Party, Ershad said on Monday that the next elections could be disastrous if the government did not fulfill its campaign pledges. Ershad made these observations at the Dhaka South conference of the Jatiya Party at the Kazi Bashir auditorium. Venting his frustration over not being given a prominent office although he had been hopeful of responsibilities, Ershad said that the Jatiya Party would not accept disrespect and neglect. He reiterated that the government could use its alliance with them for the country's benefit. "Ershad and Jatiya Party could be of great use for building a digital Bangladesh." Turning to the government, Ershad said, "You are in trouble. There is no water, electricity and gas in the country." He said the Jatiya Party had nine years of experience pointing to his own tenure as a leader of a military regime in the 1980s "If you want, we can help," Ershad said addressing the government. His words strongly suggested hat he was threatening to break out the allicance unless the government sought his help. Ershad said his party would contest the Dhaka and Chittagong city corporation elections under the party banner. JP presidium member and civil aviation minister GM Quader said, "People are saying that we did not face such traffic congestion, water, power and gas crisis during Ershad's regime. There was also no tender-grabbing during Ershad's time." In relation to press reports saying that he had declared in Rangpur that his younger brother GM Quader would be the next president of Jatiya Party, Ershad said, "I went to Rangpur to give him responsibility for the district. Some presidium members commented that giving power to him violated the chain of command." "There is nothing called chain of command in Jatiya Party. The chairman's directive is the chain of command," said the former military dictator. "I want to remain chairman of the party as long as I live. After my death you can choose your party leaders," he said. Kazi Firoz Rashid and Jahirul Alam Rubel were made Dhaka Metropolitan Jatiya Party (South) president and general secretary respectively. Ershad also announced that Kazi Firoz Rashid would contest in the DCC mayor polls. bdnews24
