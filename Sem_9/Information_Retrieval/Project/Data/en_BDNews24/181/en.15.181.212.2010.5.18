<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has quashed the frigate purchase corruption case against prime minister Sheikh Hasina, taking the tally of cases rejected since her government came into office early last year to eight. The bench of justices Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui on Tuesday gave its verdict on the case after Hasina challenged the proceedings of the case. The most recent corruption case against Hasina quashed by the High Court was the 'Meghnaghat power plant' case, on April 22. The other cases include the 'NIKO' case, the 'Mig-29 purchase' case, the 'barge-mounted power plants' case, and the 'Novo theatre' case. Hasina's lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh told reporters after the ruling that the process of purchasing the frigate started before the Awami League government assumed power in 1996. He added that the case has been quashed since it was filed to harass her. The frigate case was filed with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and four others by a former Bureau of Anti-Corruption official, Mir Mohammed Joynul Abedin Shibli, on Aug 7, 2002. The case alleged between 1996 and 2001, the Hasina administration had procured a frigate for the Navy at a cost of nearly US$105 million, causing the government Tk 447 crore in losses. The investigators pressed charges against the suspects on Aug 3, 2003. The High Court, however, stayed the proceedings following an appeal from Hasina that same year. Advocate Abdul Matin Khasru also argued for Hasina while Syed Mizanur Rahman represented the Anticorruption Commission during the proceedings. bdnews24
