<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Weavers called off their indefinite strike after the government agreed on yarn imports through Benapole land port on Friday. A statement of the National Board of Revenue on Saturday said that those involved with the weaving industry and genuine consumers of yarn could now import yarn of 30 counts or more. Even though yarns are generally imported through waterways, the knit garment producers can conditionally import yarn from India through the land port. However commercial import of yarn through land port is still banned. Bangladesh Handloom and Power Loom Owners Association recently called for an indefinite strike after prices of yarn went up demanding permission to import yarn from India through the land port. bdnews
