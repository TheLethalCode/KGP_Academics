 Jahangirnagar University, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Discussants at a meeting called for the boycott of men who sexually harass women. The event was organised at the university's Teachers-Students Centre on Saturday, following a recent allegation against the chairman of the international relations department. Those at the meeting also sought full implementation of the guidelines for the investigation of such incidents, in line with the High Court directives. The discussion, on 'Harassment at Educational Institutions and Work places: What to do', was hosted by several teachers of the university. Masuda Rehana Begum, leader of the country's oldest women's group Mahila Parishad, said, "The voice against harassment should come from the family." "The society should be sympathetic to the complainant," she said. Dhaka University professor Akmal Hossain said, "Those involved in harassment should be rejected socially." Professor Anu Mohammad, chairman of economics department at JU, said that such incidents recurred as there was no effective resolution to the previous instances. The current chairman of the drama and dramatics department at JU, Sanaul Huq Sunny, is also facing allegations - but.the matter remains unresolved. Tanjida Mohsin from the drama department of JU, said, "In our society, harassed women are usually degraded socially." "This perception needs to be changed," she added. Sayma Khatun of the anthropology department read out the statement, prepared by the teachers. bdnews24.com/
