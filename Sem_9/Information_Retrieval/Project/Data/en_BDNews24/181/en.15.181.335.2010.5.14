 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) A government committee, formed to negotiate with the striking weavers, on Thursday recommended withdrawal of the embargo on import of a few categories of yarns as the strike rolled into the second day. On Thursday, agitated weavers of Pabna, Sirajganj and Narsingdi took to the streets and blockaded the Dhaka-Sylhet highway in Narsingdi for four hours. Textile and jute secretary Ashraful Makbul said the committee, headed by the handloom board chairman, had already submitted their recommendations. He told bdnews24.com, "The committee recommended that four categories of yarn which are above 80 counts (a measure of yarn's quality) can be imported." The National Board of Revenue has been asked to take necessary steps. The NBR is collecting information on yarn production, its present demand and the total amount of yarn import. The government, with NBR's consent, will start trading in yarns after it got the necessary data, Makbul said. The secretary said the Indian textile minister and Indian high commissioner in Bangladesh had also been requested to inform the government abpout the current yarn prices. Bangladesh Handloom and Power-loom Owners' Association convened the strike on May 12 demanding resumption of tax-free yarn import from India through Benapole land port. Association's general secretary Ayub Ali told bdnews24.com that the government had not contacted them. "Therefore, we will continue with our programmes," he added. Some 5,000 weavers of Narsingdi blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway near Madhabdi from 10:30am to 2pm, bringing traffic to a halt. They only withdrew the blockade upon the district authorities' assurance. Handloom association president, Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan, on May 8 said the price of yarn had started to rise from October last year following the ban on imports through Benapole. The cost of one pound of 40 count yarn, which was then available at Tk 65, had now increased to Tk 115, he said. He alleged that the minister for jute and textiles did not keep his word about opening up the land port. According to BKMEA, the country's annual yarn demand is 10 lakh tons, of which seven lakh tons are consumed by the knit sector and the remainder by the weavers. The production capacity of the 266 spinning mills is, however, only six lakh tons. bdne
