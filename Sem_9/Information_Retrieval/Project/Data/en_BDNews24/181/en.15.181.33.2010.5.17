 Seoul, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina championed the cause of the Least Developed Countries on Monday, urging the international community for quick establishment and disbursement of funds for poor and vulnerable countries so that they are to able tackle the adversity caused by climate change. The prime minister also asked for increased voting rights of the poor countries within multilateral lending agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. She was presenting the keynote address at the inauguration of ESCAP's 66th session at Seoul's Songdo Convention Centre on Monday morning, press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. Hasina called for fast establishment of a global fund and its quick disbursement among the LDCs, allowing them to tackle adversities of climate change. "The fund promised in Copenhagen must be disbursed immediately under separate arrangement for the most vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, among others," Hasina said. She also pointed out that although the LDCs have negligible greenhouse emissions, they are most affected by the adversity caused by such emissions. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon gave a speech through video conference in the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) session. South Korean prime minister Chung Un-chan, Vanuatu's prime minister Edward Natapei and UN under secretary and ESCAP executive secretary general Dr Noeleen Heyzer also spoke at the session. The session concentrated on "Addressing Challenges in the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: Promoting a Stable and Supportive Financial System and Green Growth". The Bangladeshi prime minister also urged development partners to work with and fulfil their promises to LDCs. Hasina also insisted on increased voting rights of LDCs in multilateral institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank. "Much needs to be done to increase the quantity of assistance as well as to improve its quality while foreign direct investments need to flow more to the LDCs' productive sectors, which can generate employment for the local populace," she added. The prime minister also emphasised on the need for strong partnership amongst LDCs' development partners for meaningful and coordinated development towards a 'better' world. She also highlighted that development efforts in the LDCs need to be sustained and increased in order to address poverty as performance remains fragile, even though it is seemingly satisfactory considering constraints. Stressing on the importance of empowering people to allow them to build a country from poverty, hunger, ill-health and illiteracy, the prime minister said "Special attention is needed to empower the weaker segment of people in the society and to remove gender discrimination and inequity." DHAKA OUTCOME DOCUMENT She also urged to consider the Dhaka Outcome Document and endorse it for the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs. "We need to speak with a single voice to articulate our development aspirations for the decade 2011-2020," she said, adding "solidarity gives strength". The Dhaka Outcome Document is an accumulation of the findings of the Asia- Pacific Policy Dialogue on the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries jointly arranged at Dhaka by the Bangladeshi government and ESCAP in January 2010. She also said that the document underscores one significant finding of the dialogue that the Brussels Programme remains an unfinished agenda for the Asia- Pacific LDCs, despite significant progress in several areas, such as targeted growth rate and increased investment in productive sectors of a number of countries. It also shows that LDCs generally lagged behind others in the region in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally-agreed development outcomes, she said. The prime minister also urged the attendees of ESCAP's 66th session to endorse the Dhaka Outcome Document as the regional input for the global review to be conducted at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Istanbul in May 2011. Hasina also said that Bangladesh endorsed the Copenhagen Accord with the hope that it will lead towards a legally-binding agreement in COP 16 to be held at Mexico this year. "We hope that the COP 16 outcome will address our critical concerns- particularly those of the least developing countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal - and will give adequate consideration to the Kyoto Protocol and the Bali Plan of Action," she said. "Globalization has increased world trade on the aggregate, but the share of the benefits to the low income countries has been anything but equitable." GOVT STEPS ON CLIMATE CHANGE She also detailed on the current government's steps to combat adversities of global climate change and said that a $100 million Climate Change Fund has been formed with assistance from friendly countries and donor agencies. Bangladesh has also adopted 134 climate change action plans, including river dredging, plantation of crops resilient to drought, salinity and floods. "We are following a low carbon path to development and creating a large carbon sink through forestation," she added. UN ESCAP session at Korea is being attended by this regions political leaders and targets to reach an agreement over future step for the recovery of Asian economy along with developing strategies for a sustained and 'greener' future. bd
