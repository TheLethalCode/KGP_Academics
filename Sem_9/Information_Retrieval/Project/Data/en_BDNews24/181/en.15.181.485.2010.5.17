 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League presidium member Obaidul Quader says some leaders in the ruling party and Bangladesh Chhatra League work for themselves without heeding prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "These elements are to be identified." He considers tender-grabbing and extortion are hurting the government more than the water, electricity and gas crises. He called for identifying the culprits and ensuring their speedy trial. Quader said, "Tender-grabbers and extortionists are more terrible than the problems of gas, electricity and water. The image of the government is being tarnished. "Their trial has to be ensured under special tribunals." He made the observation at a discussion organised by the Bangabandhu Academy at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Sunday. On BNP's statement prior to the May 19 rally in Dhaka, he said, "An elected government cannot be brought down by holding big meetings." That would require constructive criticism of the government and popular programmes, he said. He said BNP was holding a meeting at every division to work up their leaders and workers and said the government had not created obstruction to any BNP programme. "They had themselves created a mess and blamed the government." He said Hasina was working for the welfare of the people braving many hazards. bdne
