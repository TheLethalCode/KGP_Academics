<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)The agreement with Russia on the construction of the 2000MW nuclear power plant at Rooppur will be signed in September when the prime minister tours that country, the technology minister says. Yasef Osman also said Dhaka and Moscow will sign the framework agreement on May 21 and that the project would be developed through a joint venture. Osman was speaking to the media after a meeting of the technical committee on the implementation of the project at the ministry on Sunday. He also said two memorandums of understanding have been signed between the two countries on May 13 last year. "A primary agreement was also reached between the two countries then," the minister said. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and senior science and technology ministry officials will attend the framework agreement signing ceremony. The cabinet had earlier given the go-ahead to the treaty with Russia. Bangladesh has been trying to implement the Rooppur power plant since 1961 when the country was a part of Pakistan. Successive post-independence governments tried to exucute the project, but failed for various reasons. The Awami League government in its election manifesto pledged to start the nuclear power project to match the ever-increasing power demands. According to power ministry sources, the country produces around 4,000MW of power every day against the daily minimum demand of 5,000MW. Asked how long the project will take to complete, Osman said "It normally takes five to seven years to implement such projects. But, since the site has already been selected, we will take less time." "We plan to produce 1000MW initially from the plant and after two years, we will be raising the production by another 1000MW." But, the minister did not give a direct answer on the project cost. "We have not determined it yet. However, the costs can be covered within 10-15 years from the start of production." The project's director Shawkat Akbar told bdnews24.com that the two countries will share the cost of the project. He also said around 400 people would be required for the maintenance of the plant, who will be trained by Russia. bdne
