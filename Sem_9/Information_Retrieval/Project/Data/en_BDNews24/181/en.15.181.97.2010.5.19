 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The Pakistan Cricket Board will announce the squads for next month's Asia Cup and the tour of England on May 22 and opener Salman Butt is likely to get the Test captaincy. Sources said the acting on the advice of former coaches Intikhab Alam and Aaqib Javed, the PCB has ruled out selection of banned seniors like Muhammad Yousuf, Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik from selection, the Press Trust of India reported.

Butt, meanwhile, said no decision has been made as yet on who will lead the team in the Asia Cup and on the England tour.
