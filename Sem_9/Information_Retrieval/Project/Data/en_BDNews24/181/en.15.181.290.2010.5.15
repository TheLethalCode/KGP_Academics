 Dhaka, May (bdnews24.com)  Specialists have urged for public awareness about posthumous organ donation to save dying patients. The speakers of the first national scientific seminar of the Society of Organ Transplantation (SOT) made the call on Saturday. Due to lack of awareness and social superstitions, there is a dearth of willing donators, they said. Hundreds of poor dying patients could be saved if there were more organ donations. The seminar was held under the banner 'Donate organ, save lives' in the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Neurologist and chairman of SOT Dr Harun-Ar-Rashid said that although Bangladesh has developed organ transplantation, posthumous organ donation has not been possible yet. "Until now, only 800 kidney transplants have been done in the country." Similarly, even though disabled hearts and livers can be transplanted, it is yet to be done in the country. "If posthumous organ transplantation starts, one donor could save five persons by donating kidneys, heart, lungs and liver," said Harun. Vice chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, professor Pran Gopal Datta said that the lack of public awareness was a major obstacle in cadaveric or live organ donation. He also stressed on the need for motivating the public on organ transplantation as mentioned in the current law. Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) president Dr Hasan Mahmud said that even though treatment through organ transplantation like kidney and cornea has been going on for quite some time, the chance to transplant other organs has not been there yet. "The major reason behind this is the lack of donors. Lack of awareness and social superstition are the main barriers." SOT general secretary SA Hasan said, "Recent statistics show that in a month there about 80 deaths from accidents at Dhaka Medical College Hospital who could be saved." He said that roughly 720 patients could be saved every month through kidney, lever, pancreas, heart, lungs and cornea transplants through proper management and awareness about organ transplantation. "Kidney transplant started in Bangladesh from 1988 through the donation of a living person. Currently this process is going on in eight institutes and nearly 120 transplants are done every year." BMA general secretary professors Sharfuddin, Anwarul Islam and others spoke at the seminar. They agreed that there was a law on posthumous organ donation. The required specialists were also there. Only initiatives were needed, they said. bdne
