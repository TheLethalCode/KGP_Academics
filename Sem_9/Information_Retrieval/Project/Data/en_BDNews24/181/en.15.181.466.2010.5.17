 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  A fire broke out on Monday morning at a building at the secretariat, the country's administrative hub. Officials said the fire broke out at around 10am on the third floor of the seventh building in the secretariat complex, but was doused within half an hour. The finance ministry is housed on the nine-storey building. Shazadi Sultana, station officer of the fire service, told bdnews24.com that the fire had originated from a short-circuit at the electric sub-distribution room on the third floor of the building. She said that the loss was very negligible while some goods in that room worth a paltry Tk 3,000 were burned. bdnews2
