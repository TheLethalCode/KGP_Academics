 Rangamati, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  A leader of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) was shot dead by unknown assailants at Rajasthali Sadar Upazila in Rangamati on Sunday night. The deceased was identified as Usinu Marma, 25, the organising secretary of Gainda section of Rajsthali upazila PCJSS. A member of Pahari Chhatra Parishad, Ubaisingh Marma, 24, was injured in the shootout. He was sent to Chittagong Medical College Hospital. According to police, the incident occurred at around 11pm Sunday, when the criminals opened fire at the Rajsthali Sports and Cultural Association Club in the upazila sadr bazaar. JSS has blamed the anti peace accord United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF) for this attack. But the UPDF leaders rejected the accusation. Rajasthali police chief Rezail Haque said a group of unknown assailants fired indiscriminately at a local club room at around 11pm where some 20 to 25 members of the PCJSS and Pahari Chhatra Parishad (PCP) were preparing to go to bed. Usinu died on the spot with a bullet wound in his head, he said. Police recovered seven bullet casings from the scene, said Rezail. The body of Usinu was sent to Rangamati general hospital for post mortem. PCJSS publicity secretary Sajib Chakma has blamed the UPDF for the killing of Usinu. In protest, PCJSS brought out a procession and held a rally in Rangmati town on Monday morning. The procession started from their district office and ended at the district administration office via Banarupa. The rally in front of the district administration office was presided over by PCJSS district president Gyanendu Bikash Chakma. PCJSS central vice president Lakshmi Prasad Chakma and PCP district president Padmalochon Chakma spoke among others. The PCJSS leaders accused that a group of 10-12, led by Kalaiy Chakma, alias Diamond, of UPDF, committed this murder. They demanded immediate arrest of the criminals and banning of UPDF. Michael Chakma, a leader of Rangamati UPDF, told bdnews24.com that they were not involved in the incident and they do not have any activist named Diamond. He also claimed that the murder was a result of conflict within PCJSS over distribution of funds. bdnews24
