 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Stripped of their jobs on charges of partisan recruitment to the Election Commission three years ago, 85 people were reinstated on Monday. An appeal tribunal on Apr 12 this year gave the verdict in their favour. Following the court order, the Commission issued a circular on May 13 and ordered them to join in their posts within office hours on May 17. All of them reported to their posts. The circular was signed by the Commission's deputy secretary Md Shahjahan Mia. It mentioned that these officials will have been deemed to be working in their posts from Sept 06, 2007 until May 16, 2010. They will also get all the arrears for that period. The circular stated that in accordance with the verdict of the administrative appeal tribunal case and decision of the 294th meeting of Commission on May 11, the Commission cancelled the circular of Sept 3, 2007 ending the probation of 85 upazila election officers. They were recruited during the tenure of BNP-led government in 2005. There were reports that these appointments were made under political consideration. A total of 303 people were appointed to the post. After assuming power in mid-January of 2007, the military-backed interim administration decided to retake tests on their efficiency. On May 18, 2007, all but one of these officials took the tests. As many as 218 people passed the hurdle while the rest failed. Muhammad Shahinul Islam, an election officer posted to Shatkania upazila in Chittagong, currently posted at Keraniganj, told bdnews24.com: "According to the order of the Election Commission I reported to the senior assistant secretary Ferdous Raushan Ara at the commission secretariat on Monday morning." Ashraf Ali, another election officer, said that most of them had done the same and reported to the Commission after joining. Their training will start at the election training institute from May 18, he said. bdnews
