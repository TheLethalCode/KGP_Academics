 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  One BCL activist was injured in a clash between two factions of pro-ruling student organisation in Dhaka University over entering a function at Teachers-Student Centre. Witnesses said the clash ensued as Bangladesh Chhatra League activist of Jashimuddin Hall Enamul Haque Prince tried to enter a debate function at TSC at around 12pm, but was stopped by some volunteers of Bangabandhu Hall. They had a heated exchange of words and Bangabandhu Hall BCL activists chased Prince to Madhu's Canteen. Fellow activists of Jashim Uddin Hall then joined Prince to attack Bangabandhu Hall BCL men. Mirajul Islam Miraj, a BCL activist of Bangabandhu Hall, was injured in the clash. He was admitted to the university medical centre. Prince told bdnews24.com that he entered TSC to meet some students of his home district, Magura, with the permission of some volunteers of the function. But some Bangabandhu Hall BCL men forced him to get out of TSC and chased him to Madhu's Canteen, he said. However, president of Jashim Uddin Hall unit of BCL Abdur Rahman Jiban and general secretary Kazi Enayet in statement said Prince is not a member of BCL. The statement given in a BCL DU unit pad said Prince is not involved in the politics of BCL in the university. "BCL would not accept the liabilities of his misdeeds". In another incident, correspondent of Ekushey TV Mizan Rahman, a residential student of Bangabandhu Hall, was assaulted by teachers and BCL activists while entering the hall. Mizan alleged that he was beaten by assistant residential teacher SM Mafizur Rahman, some other teachers and BCL cadres in front of the hall provost and was stopped from entering the hall, although they knew his identity. When contacted, hall provost Dr Baitullah Qadri admitted the incident. He said it had happened because Mizan had neither shown his journalist's identity card nor the university identity card. b
