 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  The homecoming day of prime minister and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina is being observed on Monday. Hasina returned to Bangladesh from exile on this day in 1981, six years after the brutal assassination of her father, independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of her family members on August 15, 1975. Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana had survived the assassination as they had been living abroad. Prior to her return, the AL national council formed in February 1981 elected her president of the party. On her arrival in Bangladesh, Hasina launched the reorganisation of the party. Awami League and its associate organisations have taken up a number of programmes to observe the day. A discussion meeting will be held at the party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue in the afternoon. b
