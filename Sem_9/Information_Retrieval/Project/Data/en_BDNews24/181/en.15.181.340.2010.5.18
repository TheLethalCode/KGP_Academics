 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP has alleged that the Awami League government is continuing to place obstacles in the way of it organising a successful rally in Dhaka on Wednesday. Standing Committee member Nazrul Islam Khan said on Tuesday that BNP activists had been barred from hanging posters in different areas, including Kamrangirchar and Tongi. Khan said that activists have also faced obstruction in erecting gates ahead of the rally, even though the BNP had paid Dhaka City Corporation for their construction. He added that he had been informed that buses from different districts "are not being allowed to take local leaders and activists to the rally." "All these problems indicate the undemocratic attitude of the government," he added. Despite this, Khan, who is coordinating the rally at the Paltan ground, said all preparations for the rally were complete. The BNP leader apologised in advance to Dhaka residents that they may face traffic problems for several hours because of the meeting. Huge gridlocks occur during any grand meeting at Paltan ground, one of the busiest areas of the capital. bdnews
