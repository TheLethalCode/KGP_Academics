 LONDON, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Before every major tournament England's refrain is the same: we really can win it this time. To update the words of the Euro 96 anthem, England have now suffered "44 years of hurt" since winning their only major honour, the World Cup in 1966. However, a superb qualifying campaign, the prodigious form of Wayne Rooney and the weather in wintry South Africa have given England hope of becoming world champions again. Manager Fabio Capello, who succeeded Steve McClaren after the failure to qualify for Euro 2008, has given England back their self-belief while keeping the talented nucleus of the side that came up short two years ago. England qualified for the World Cup after winning their first eight games although things have not run smoothly for Capello since then, with off-field headlines involving former skipper John Terry and Ashley Cole giving him headaches. Injuries to important players such as Glen Johnson, Aaron Lennon, Rio Ferdinand, Cole and Gareth Barry have added to his problems while David Beckham's absence because of a ruptured Achilles tendon has deprived him of the former captain's unique qualities. Despite those setbacks England's prospects remain good if Rooney can carry his domestic form into the finals. Rooney scored 34 goals in all competitions for Manchester United before niggling injuries affected the end of his season. Capello's likely starting line-up will have Robert Green in goal, behind a back four of right-back Glen Johnson, centre-backs Ferdinand and Terry with Cole on the left. In a four-man midfield, Steven Gerrard will start on the left with Barry, if he recovers from an ankle injury, and Frank Lampard across the middle and either Shaun Wright-Phillips, Lennon or Theo Walcott on the right. Rooney, with support from the muscular Emile Heskey, will spearhead the attack and the team should be able to take first place in Group C from Algeria, Slovenia and the United St
