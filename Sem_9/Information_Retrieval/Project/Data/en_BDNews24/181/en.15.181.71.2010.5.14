 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)--Weavers across the country stopped their work on Wednesday morning on an indefinite strike demanding resumption of tax-free yarn import from India through Benapole land port. Bangladesh Handloom and Power-loom Owners' Association had announced the strike on Saturday. The association's general secretary Ayub Ali told bdnews24.com that they had not seen any sign of an initiative from the government to address their demand for lower yarn prices. bdnews24.com Narsingdi correspondent has confirmed that the weavers in the district have stopped working. Bangladesh's top body of knitwear manufacturers and exporters (BKMEA) also expressed solidarity with the strikers. Weavers have for some weeks been demanding permission to import yarn through Benapole port following the dramatic rise in yarn price. But the import of yarn through the land port remains banned. Leaders of the weavers also demanded the prime minister's intervention to meet their six-point charter of demands. Local yarn producers, however, say that resumption of yarn import through the land port would bring down prices and eventually ruin the industry. Association president Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan on Saturday said the price of yarn started to rise from Oct last year following the ban on imports through Benapole. One pound of 40 count yarn had been available at Tk 65, which has been increased to Tk 115 now, he said. He alleged that the minister for jute and textiles did not keep his word about opening up of the land port. According to BKMEA, the country's annual yarn demand is 10 lakh tonnes  of which seven lakh tonnes is for the knit sector and the remaining three tonnes for the weaving industry. The production capacity of the 266 spinning mills is however only six lakh tonnes. bd
