Judge S M Aminul Islam of Dhaka's First Special Judges' Court on Tuesday set Jun 15 for the next hearing on the framing of charges. Jalil's counsels Arifur Rahman and Mokhlesur Rahman Badal appealed the court for an extension. The previous deferrals were made on Jan 18, Feb 10, Mar 21 and Apr 5. The petition said Jalil was undergoing treatment at a Singapore hospital. National Board of Revenue deputy commissioner Bazlur Rahman Khan filed the case with the same court on Oct 15 last year. He accused Jalil of dodging tax worth Tk 407,000 on his concealed income of Tk 5,460,000. The case details say the disgruntled leader had concealed the savings and fixed deposits, in the name of his wife and children, in his income tax returns statement. An arrest warrant was later issued against him but Jalil secured bail from the High Court in the case three days later. b
