<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) BNP chief Khaleda Zia's counsel Ahmed Azam Khan on Thursday threatened to take NBR to court if it did not explain the disclosure of 'secret tax documents'. He pointed out that article 163 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, stated that income tax returns and Tax Identification Number information should be kept confidential. "The ruling party, however, secured them from the National Board of Revenue, using its undue influence," Khan said at a press briefing at the Naya Paltan headquarters of the main opposition party. BNP demands clear explanation on how (the ruling Awami League) got them from the NBR, he said. "Or we will take the NBR to court." On May 12, prime minister Sheikh Hasina told a rally in Brahmanbaria that Khaleda and her family had whitened a huge amount of black money and later, acting Awami League general secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif provided the details. Khan, in reaction to the statement, claimed that Hasina, in disclosing Khaleda's tax details, had breached the law. He said the statement was ill motivated. He reiterated that Khaleda had no back money. "She did not really have 'black money'. It was her legally earned money that had not been disclosed." Khaleda, however, in line with a military-backed interim government's declaration, had later disclosed the amount and paid due taxes, Khan added. He alleged that the government was just trying to exploit the issue. Azam Khan claimed that 'this example set by the former prime minister' was 'unprecedented in history'. He, however, did not make it clear what he meant by 'unprecedented'. Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the BNP secretary general, refuted the allegations of Hasina and acting Awami League general secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif. "The prime minister is making these statements to confuse the countrymen and cover up her failure in ruling the country." Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif said on May 9 that Khaleda had whitened Tk 13.31 million between 2002-03 and 2006-07 fiscal years and paid almost Tk 3.4 million as tax and fine. The opposition party leader had paid fines to legalise her undisclosed income on Aug 6, 2007, Hanif said. The Awami League leader made the statement at a press conference at Awami League's party office at Dhanmandi, Dhaka in reply to comments of BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Thursday, when he claimed that Khaleda had never whitened 'black' money. According to the figures that Hanif presented, Khaleda had paid Tk 3,031,044 in 2002-03 fiscal, Tk 1,17,168 in 2004-5, Tk 82,790 in 2004-05, Tk 83,356 in 2005-06 and Tk 72000 in 2006-07 as tax and fine to the government. TAGORE Delwar termed poet Rabindranath Tagore as a 'rare milestone' in the history of Bengali literature. "It is absolutely out of question to question his talent." He went on to say that the ruling party, however, had provided a wrong interpretation of his statement branding him as a communal person. "This is not fair." "I only wanted to say that institutions should be named after our national poet Qazi Nazrul Islam and Michael Madhushudan Dutta along with Tagore." BNP senior vice-president Abdullah Al Noman, senior joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and others were also present at the media briefing. bdnew
