 Seoul, May 16 (bdnews24.com)-- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has reiterated that those who perpetrated crimes against humanity in 1971 would be tried on Bangladeshi soil. She made the remark while inaugurating the Bangladesh Festival at Zhangchu Gymnasium in the South Korean capital on Sunday, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. "The people of Bangladesh want trial of the criminals and the government has already taken measures to hold trial of those responsible for crimes against humanity during the great war of liberation," Hasina said. Korean labour minister Yim Tae Hee, president of Bangladesh-South Korea Friendship Forum Kim Chong-Hoang and Bangladesh's ambassador to South Korea Shahidul Islam also spoke. A great number of expatriate Bangladeshis joined the festivities co-organised by Bangladesh embassy, Korea Migrants Centre and the Friendship Forum. The prime minister also said that her government was working to settle issues hampering national progress in accordance to her party's electoral pledge. Hasina urged for cooperation from all quarters including the expatriate Bangladeshis to supplement the government efforts to hold the war crimes trial. She also urged expatriates to help her government in building a peaceful, prosperous and corruption-free Bangladesh. The premier asked the Bangladesh mission to look after the expatriates there, and the expatriates to develop a good image to help other Bangladeshis get jobs in Korea. She thanked the expatriates for sending millions of dollars in remittance from across the world during the global economic recession and said it kept the country's economy alive. Bangladesh's foreign currency reserve now stands at an all-time high of over $10 billion, according to her. Hasina said the excellent bilateral relation between the two countries is the result of the initial efforts of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She urged the Korean government to increase investments in Bangladesh, import more Bangladeshi products and recruit more Bangladeshi manpower. Hasina also sought Korean support to establish more manpower development institutions in Bangladesh and said her administration was unrelenting in its effort to turn Bangladesh into a mid-income country by implementing the 'Vision 2021'. Commerce minister Faruk Khan, ambassador at large M Ziauddin were among those present at the programme.
