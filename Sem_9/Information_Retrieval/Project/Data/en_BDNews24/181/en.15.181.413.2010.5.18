 Natore, May 18 (bdnews24.com) -- A Natore court on Tuesday sent the district's former civil surgeon and two other officials to jail on charges of misappropriation of government medicines worth Tk 4 lakh. Sessions judge Abdul Majid also accepted charge-sheet against them after rejecting their bail petitions. The accused are former civil surgeon Dr Mizanur Rahman, former residential officer of Notore civil surgeon office Dr Rajikul Hasan and storekeeper Probhas Kumar Vaduri. Mizanur and Provas have gone on retirement, while Rajikul is now a deputy director of Bogra Medical College Hospital. According to the case details, government medicines worth Tk 4 lakh was misappropriated from the store of Natore Civil Surgeon office on June 3, 1992. Mizanur had filed a theft case with Natore Sadr police station in this connection. But investigation officer Rafizuddin, a sub-inspector of Natore Sadr police, found no sign of theft. In his report, he mentioned: "It can never be a case of theft. The medicines were misappropriated in a planned way." On the basis of the report, Criminal Investigation Department of police and Anticorruption Commission conducted further investigation into the incident and found that the storekeeper had misappropriated the medicines in connivance with top officials of the civil surgeon office. The ACC's assistant director Sheikh Faiaj Alam pressed charges in the court in April against the three. The hearing on the charge-framing was set for Tuesday, when the accused appeared in the court and pleaded for bail. bd
