 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Former Awami League MP Mokbul Hossain was released on bail from a corruption case on Monday. He was under treatment in a hospital under jail custody. A Dhaka Central Jail official, on condition of anonymous, told bdnews24.com that Mokbul was released on Monday evening after his bail order, issued on Sunday, reached prison authorities. Anti-corruption Commission's deputy director Akhter Hossain filed the corruption case with Mohammadpur police on Aug 16, 2007. He was convicted, in absentia, on May 9, 2008 for amassing illegal assets worth around Tk 5.34 crore and concealing wealth worth roughly Tk 2.85 crores. Mokbul was jailed for 13 years on the charges by Dhaka's Special Judges Court-3. He had been absconding since then. Mokbul on May 6 appealed for bail after appearing before the HC bench of justices Mohammed Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddique, which ordered him to surrender within seven days. After he turned himself in to court on Sunday, judge Mozammel Hossain of Dhaka's Special Judges Court-3 allowed his treatment in the jail custody. A bail petition was submitted immediately to the HC bench. His lawyers were then ordered to submit his affidavit, while being under judicial custody, along with the proof of his surrendering to the lower court, to the High Court. His petition was granted after the affidavit, undersigned by Mokbul, was submitted to the High Court in the afternoon, Mokbul's lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru told bdnews24.com on Sunday. He was under watch by prison guards during his treatment. The watch was removed after the bail order reached prison authorities, said the prison official. Meanwhile, hearing on the petition against the sentence order against him is currently stayed. Sunday's bail will be effective until resolution of the petition. b
