 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka stocks continued its record-shattering rally for the third straight session in a fluctuating market on Wednesday. The market opened on a strong note as the benchmark index climbed 92 points by the first two and a half hours, only to fall by more than 50 points in the next 50 minutes. It, however, recovered and went through some ups and downs before closing 44 points higher at the end of the session. The premier bourse's general index or the DGEN rose by 0.764 percent to end at 5921.49 points, reaching a new high from Tuesday's record of 5876.55 points. The day's surge was mainly driven by hike in banks, power and fuel shares. Banking shares are largely held by investors on speculation of further higher prices in the wake of conversion of face values, according to brokerage firms. Market analysts have long been saying that face value conversion, from Tk 100 to Tk 10, would not change the fundamentals of the listed companies. To caution potential investors about the unscrupulous practice of some listed companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, on the DSE website, advised that investment decisions be "based on proper judgment". "Any remarkable change in the market price of shares for such change is not logical," reads the SEC post. About 70 percent of the banking shares gained while all power and fuel shares shook off the previous day's losses except Khulna Power Company Ltd, which lost as its corporate declaration failed to meet investors' expectation following Tuesday's gains. Mutual funds ended mixed with most of the insurers ending in the red. On the other hand, shares of most of the non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) went up, with 13 out of traded 21 gaining from the previous day. The turnover board was dominated by banks, NBFIs, power and fuel shares along with Aftab Automobiles. The engineering sector scrip saw heated trade as the regulator approved the raised paid-up capital of its subsidiaries, Navana Furniture and Navana Batteries. The lone telecom issue Grameenphone, considered as a market heavyweight, edged down 0.24 percent. The daily turnover continued to slide, amounting to Tk 19.39 billion from Tuesday's Tk 20.41 billion. Of the traded 239 scrips, 128 fell, 104 advanced and seven held steady
