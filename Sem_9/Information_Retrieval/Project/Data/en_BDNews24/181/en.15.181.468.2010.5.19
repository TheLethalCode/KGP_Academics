 Chittagong, May 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Incumbent Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiduddin Chowdhury has been picked as mayoral candidate of Nagorik Committee and has secured the ruling party's support for the ensuing Chittagong City Corporation polls. Chittagong University vice-chancellor Abu Yusuf named him as the committee candidate at a meeting at Muslim Institute on Wednesday. Chittagong district unit president of Workers Party, Abu Hanif, also extended support of the ruling alliance at the meeting. CCC polls will be held for June 17. Earlier on Monday, Mohiuddin told an Awami League rally organised to mark party chief Sheikh Hasina's homecoming anniversary that he would contest in the election from Nagorik Committee or under the party banner as decided by the party. Speaking as chief guest, he said Chittagong would be turned into a self-reliant city free of violence and communalism. Meanwhile, pro-BNP Chittagong Development Movement has nominated ward commissioner M Manzur Alam as its candidate. Manzur had told reporters at BNP chairperson's office in Dhaka after Monday midnight after meeting her that he had secured BNP's support.
