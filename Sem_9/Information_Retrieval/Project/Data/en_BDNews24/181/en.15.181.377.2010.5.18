 MUNICH, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal will stay with the German champions and Cup winners even if they win the treble, reversing a decision he had taken some months ago, the Dutchman said on Monday. Van Gaal, with a contract until 2011, has led Bayern to a German league and Cup double in his first season in charge and could also win the Champions League title when his team faces Italy's Inter Milan on Saturday in Madrid.

"This team can become even better. We have not yet reached our full potential," said the 58-year-old coach, adding that Bayern had played a disciplined game against Bremen for 70 minutes.
