<TITLE> BMET to be strengthened </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training will be turned into a more efficient manpower agency, overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said on Sunday. "However, BMET will not fully play its role as BOESL does," he said in reply to a reporters' query. The country's image is being tainted abroad. They charge higher rates so women will be sent abroad through the BMET, Mosharraf Hossain said. The government has moved to export 'trained female workers' and BMET will arrange their training. Under the initiative, the government is thinking of exporting 15000 women, he said. Immigration cost needs to be reduced in Bangladesh as it is more in comparison to other countries, he also said. The overseas employment minister pointed out that the prime minister has ordered to send 'more skilled' people abroad. Mosharraf Hossain said immigration cost will not surpass Tk 1500-2000 per worker because employers of concerned countries will bear the total cost of workers. He said a total of 37 technical training centres are currently training 50,000 people. But the government wants to increase that to 100,000 which would require 35 more training centres to be set up.
