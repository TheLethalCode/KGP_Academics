<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 16 (bdnews24.com)-- England beat arch-rivals Australia by seven wickets to win the ICC World Twenty20--their first-ever world title in cricket--at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown on Sunday. England won their first world event on the back of a fine half century from Man of the Match Craig Kieswetter (63) and a good supporting knock from Kevin Pietersen (47) as their century partnership helped the team to a resounding win. The inventors of the game finally broke the hoodoo, winning their first-ever ICC title after three failures in World Cup finals going back to 1975. At a sun-blessed Kensington Oval, England restricted Australia to 147 for six before knocking off the runs with little trouble to claim their first world title in limited overs cricket after 35 years of trying. Australia slipped to 8-3 after being put in by Collingwood but recovered to post a competitive 147-6, with David Hussey top-scoring on 59. Craig Kieswetter (63) and Kevin Pietersen (47) took England to 118-1 but then fell in quick succession. But Collingwood eased his side home with exactly three overs remaining. David Hussey's intelligent 59 had helped Australia recover from a dreadful start where they lost their opening three wickets inside three overs . Australia, the current 50 overs World Cup and Champions Trophy holders, were searching for a unique treble of limited overs world titles. Australia were favourites but England responded well to losing opener Michael Lumb early, as Pietersen and Kieswetter set about destroying Australia's bowling Even when both lost their wickets, Eoin Morgan and Collingwood kept their nerve to see England to glory without any of their customary nerves. In their barren years England lost three times in World Cup finals, in 1979, 1987 and 1992 and also were defeated on home soil in the 2004 Champions Trophy final. The Aussies were in serious trouble at eight for three and made only 24 runs from the opening six over powerplay. The stuttering start began when Shane Watson was caught by Graeme Swann at slip off Ryan Sidebottom after keeper Craig Kieswetter had spilled the ball. Hard-hitting left-hander Dave Warner was run out after a hesitant call from skipper Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin was controversially ruled caught behind when replays showed Sidebottom's leg-side delivery brushed his hip. After Clarke went, superbly caught by Paul Collingwood off the excellent Graeme Swann, Cameron White (30 off 21) and Hussey led the recovery with a 50-run partnership in 6.2 overs. David Hussey had been dropped by Stuart Broad when on just 25 but Broad made amends by taking a fine catch to remove the dangerous White. Mike Hussey, whose sensational 60 against Pakistan earned Australia their place in the final, joined his brother and the pair put on 47 from 22 balls to help take Australia, bidding for a unique treble of one-day titles, to a competitive score.
