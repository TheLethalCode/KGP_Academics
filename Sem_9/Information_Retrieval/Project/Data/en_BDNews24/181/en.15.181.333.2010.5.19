 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)The resignation of the chief of the inquiry panel on crimes against humanity during the nation's 1971 independence war is not hurting the investigation, the law minister claims. "Investigation is going on well," Shafique Ahmed said on Wednesday after his meeting with a delegation of International Centre for Transitional Justice (ICTJ). War crimes investigation chief Abdul Matin quit on May 5 over allegations that he was involved Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party's student front Islami Chhatra Shangha in his student days. Top leaders of Jamaat are widely accused of war crimes and the ICS members have been accused of abduction of intellectuals mainly on Dec 14-15, 1971, hours before the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16. Matin has however strenuously denied any involvement in Islamist politics. Shafique had said in April that charges would be pressed against some war crime suspects by this month. Asked about the publication of the investigation report, he said on Wednesday: "The investigation agency can say well about this." ICTJ Asia Pacific regional director Patrick Burgess and deputy director of its prosecutions programme Caitlin Reiger met with the law minister at his office. They talked about the trial process, relevant laws and defence of the suspects. Shafique said the ICTJ team assured the government of help with necessary copies and documents of verdicts on other war crimes trials. They also showed interest in sharing experiences with Bangladesh on bringing the war criminals to trial and ensuring justice. Pointing to the killings, rape, looting and other anti-humanity crimes, the minister said: "These types of crimes committed at wartime must be differentiated from those of other times as a special situation was prevailing in 1971." "All the crimes were committed in a planned way, so investigation should be different," he said. On Mar 25 this year, the government formed a tribunal to try people alleged to have committed war crimes during the freedom struggle. The same day the seven-member investigation agency was also constituted, with Matin as its chief. bdn
