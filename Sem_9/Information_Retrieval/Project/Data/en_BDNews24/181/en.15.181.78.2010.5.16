<TITLE> Biman 'impeding' irregularities probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has alleged that Biman Bangladesh Airlines is not cooperating in an ongoing investigation into the flag carrier's irregularities worth $100 million. The parliamentary standing committee on civil aviation ministry at its meeting on Sunday observed that it could not complete its investigation as the authorities refused to sponsor overseas trips of two committee members. Civil aviation minister G M Quader, however, told the meeting that Biman management would provide all necessary documents for the parliamentary inquiry. But, Biman was unable to foot the bill for the members' trips to London, Rome and Dubai, he said. "We have identified irregularities in the Biman's purchase and maintenance practices. The irregularities are worth about $100 million (Tk 7 billion)," Moinuddin Khan Badal, a committee member, told reporters after the meeting. But Biman management was reluctant to provide necessary support for the inquiry, said Badal, an MP of the left-leaning Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. "They don't want the irregularities to come out," he alleged. "Neither the ministry, nor Biman has the official authority to sponsor such trips," Quader told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said if the parliamentary body came up with specific findings of irregularities, the ministry would take stern actions against the persons responsible. As per the decision of the committee, Badal said, he and whip Mujibul Haq were supposed to visit Biman's overseas offices in Rome, London and Dubai. "But the Biman management has been dilly-dallying in its response on whether it would sponsor the trips," he said. "The managing director has been telling us that he will place the proposal for approving the cost at Biman's management board, a sovereign body." The committee would summon the top Biman officials in future to clarify how Biman was a "sovereign" body. The 10-strong standing committee earlier formed a five-member inquiry committee, headed by Badal, to investigate the allegations of corruption in Biman since 1990. bdne
