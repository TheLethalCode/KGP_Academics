 Dhaka, May17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP is pitting once the very own man of incumbent mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury against him in the race for the top Chittagong city office. Manzur Alam, a close confidant of Mohiuddin and former acting mayor, has been picked as the main opposition party's mayoral candidate for the Chittagong City Corporation polls, several sources high up in theparty confirmed. Arriving in Dhaka on Monday afternoon, Alam, a long-serving councillor, told bdnews24.com that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had summoned him. "I am supposed to meet her at the Gulshan office in the evening," said Alam, who saw his relations with the mayor strained since the interim government's regime. The BNP standing committee held a 3.5-hour meeting on Sunday evening until 11:30pm following which Khaleda Zia sat in another more, intimate session with two top leaders from Chittagong. Several members of BNP standing committee had told bdnews24.com that Khaleda had been given the charge of selecting a candidate for the upcoming CCC polls on June 17. Alam has been involved with Awami League politics for a long time. Councillor for North Kattoli Ward (no 10), he filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. In the 2008 national elections, Alam ran for a Chittagong constituency as an independent candidate but lost. The last date for filing nominations of the June 17 CCC polls is May 20 and June 1 for withdrawals. Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury had said on Sunday that known leaders are unlikely to run against Mohiuddin, tipped to get the go-ahead from the ruling Awami League. He and another BNP stalwart from Chittagong, MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, met with the party supremo behind closed doors just before Sunday midnight to discuss a possible candidate. A meeting of the BNP's policymaking standing committee earlier in the evening at the chairperson's Gulshan political office had decided to contest the elections. Emerging from the last meeting, Salahuddin Quader told bdnews24.com that the party chief would make the announcement in due time. Khosru, former commerce minister, told journalists that he had never desired to run for the Chittagong mayor's office. "Nor do I want to run for that office now." The tenure of the current city council runs out on June 25 and incumbent Mohiuddin Chowdhury has already indicated his desire to seek an unprecedented fourth term in office. bdnews2
