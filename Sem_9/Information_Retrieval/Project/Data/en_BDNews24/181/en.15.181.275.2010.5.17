 BANGKOK, May 17 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thousands of protesters in the Thai capital defied a deadline to leave their fortified encampment Monday despite the threat of a crackdown after street clashes that left at least 35 people dead. Government demanded on Monday an end to protests. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said in response that rioting and violence against troops must end first. "The government is ready to go forward with negotiations when the situation is defused, when the protest ends, violence ends, attacks on authorities end." That seemed to leave the talks at a dead end and final crackdown feared, with both sides demanding the other stops acting violently first. A renegade Thai general allied with the anti-government Reds died in hospital on Monday, days after he was shot during an interview with a foreign reporter on the edge of the demonstrators' main rally base. The escalating violence has turned parts of the city into no-go zones as troops use live ammunition against protesters, who have blocked streets with burning tyres and fought back, mainly with homemade weapons. Protesters were ordered to leave by 3:00 pm (0800 GMT) Monday. Authorities dropped leaflets from a small plane flying overhead asking people to evacuate the area, which remained calm soon after the deadline passed. Red Shirts were seen dancing and a Buddhist monk led prayers on the stage inside the rally site, which stretches for several kilometres (miles). Police estimated 5,000 people remained there despite the threat of forced dispersal by the security forces. "The operation (to disperse) will be executed as soon as possible," said Satit Wonghnongtaey, minister attached to the prime minister's office. "CRES will explain to the public after the operation is completed," he told reporters, referring to the government unit set up to deal with the crisis. "The authorities will do everything possible to inform (the Reds) to leave, including broadcast radio messages, police loudspeaker trucks and leaflets," Satit said. Three times on television the government broadcast its warning for the thousands of demonstrators to evacuate their base in the Ratchaprasong upscale retail and hotel district in the heart of the city. Those who stay face two years in prison, said the broadcast, warning also that their lives are at risk from "terrorist attack" at the rally site. Thai authorities said Sunday they would send the Red Cross to help evacuate the area of women, children and the elderly who wanted to leave. But there was no rush to leave the camp where men, children and women -- including a breast-feeding mother -- remained on Monday. Earlier in the day, behind a Red Shirt barricade on the edge of the camp Vinit Virangtong, 43, dragged a suitcase deeper inside the danger zone. "I'm staying here but I'm moving inside," he said. "The situation is now dangerous. They're shooting into here and it's not safe." Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, a key Red supporter known as Seh Daeng, died in hospital on Monday as the toll from three days of street violence hit 35 dead, excluding the general, and 244 injured, officials said. The government has ordered schools not to reopen after summer holidays, and it declared two days of national holidays to keep civilians off the streets. Commuter train services were shut for the third straight day and large parts of the city -- including the Silom financial and entertainment district -- remained too risky to enter. "Very dangerous," one soldier said Monday as small explosions sounded at his position, while other troops kept a Red blockade under surveillance through binoculars. Early Monday, guests at a luxury hotel in the city of 12 million people were forced to shelter in the basement after the building came under gunfire and was rattled by an explosion on the fringes of the Red camp. The Reds called Sunday for UN-mediated talks with the government, which swiftly rejected the idea, saying it was an internal matter. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has shelved a plan to hold early elections -- which the Red Shirts initially agreed to -- because the protesters refused to disperse. The Reds consider the government illegitimate because it came to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote after a court ruling ousted elected allies of their hero, telecoms tycoon turned former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Australia became the latest country to close its Bangkok embassy to visitors. The crisis has now left 66 people dead, including Seh Daeng, and about 1,700 wounded. Twenty-five people died in a failed army crackdown on April
