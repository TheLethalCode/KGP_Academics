 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh hailed the tripartite nuclear deal involving Iran, Turkey and Brazil, reiterating its support for peaceful use of nuclear technology. Foreign minister Dipu Moni voiced Dhaka's support Wednesday for the deal at the conference of the OIC foreign ministers in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. Diplomatic observers say the tripartite deal-- opposed by the US-led western countries-- signed Monday in Brazil, may contribute to resolving Iran's stand off with the western powers over its nuclear activities. As per the agreement, Iran will dispatch much of its stockpile of low enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for higher grade fuel for a research reactor, according to a report of the AFP. Islamic republic of Iran and the western states have been at loggerheads over Tehran's alleged nuclear ambition with a view to developing nuclear weapon. "She (Dipu Moni) hailed the recent agreement between Iran, Turkey, and Brazil of the nuclear fuel swap and said that Bangladesh always supports peaceful uses of nuclear energy," said a foreign ministry press statement Wednesday. According to media reports, the Obama administration is moving ahead with its plan of slapping fourth round of UN sanction on Iran after the signing of the deal with two US alliesTurkey and Brazil. Washington claims the proposed US resolutions in favour of sanctions have the backing from all permanent members of the UN, including Iran's allies-- Russia and China. In her speech, Dipu Moni referred to the growing number of incidents which shows Islamophobia in the West. "We should not over-react, but engage thoroughly, systematically, persuasively showing why such actions are prejudiced and discriminatory," the statement quoted the foreign minister as saying
