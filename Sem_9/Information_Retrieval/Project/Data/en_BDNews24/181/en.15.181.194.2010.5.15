 GROS ISLET, May 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's batsmen should be sent back to the national academy to learn how to deal with short-pitched bowling, former great Sunil Gavaskar said in St Lucia on Friday. India, who lost all three of their Super Eight games and were eliminated from the Twenty20 World Cup, struggled in Barbados against the aggressive bowling of Australia and West Indies.

"Where I think it probably went pear-shaped for India was that instead of looking to bat out the frontline bowlers ... that approach was not there and that was a little bit disappointing," he said, noting how many batsmen were out trying to hook or pull. Gavaskar said England and Australia, the two form teams at the tournament, had more options than India and were stronger in the field. "(They have) plenty of options ... in terms of batting floaters up and down (the order), options in terms of bowling, that have made both these teams stand out," he said. "I think Australia have the flexibility and both they and England have an outstanding combination in the field and have made it difficult for teams to take easy singles. They put the pressure on that
