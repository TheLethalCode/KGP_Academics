<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)Most union council chairmen and members do not have a clear understanding of the role of Village Courts, a survey report has found. The report said that public representatives at the lowest administrative unit of the government, the Union Parishad, are confused about the functions of village courts. It also notes that gender discrimination is widespread in village courts, where poor womens' appeals are often 'neglected' and advocated a prioritised 'gender responsive policy planning' for the courts. The survey, part of a UNDP and European Union supported Activating Village Courts in Bangladesh project, was published on Sunday in Dhaka. This survey was conducted amongst 10,000 people through questionnaires, group discussions, case studies and interviews covering 500 unions across the country  constituting about one tenth of all the unions. Respondents to the survey included citizens as well as public representatives at the union level and included an equal participation of both men and women. The concept of village courts can be traced back to the Pakistan period, when the Conciliation Courts Ordinance, 1961 was enacted. In 1976, it was repealed and the Village Courts Ordinance was promulgated, which was also superseded by the Village Courts Act, 2006. The only difference in the 2006 Act, was that the ceiling for disputes that could be taken to the village courts was raised from Tk 5000 to Tk 25,000. The study found that only 24 percent of people knew about the village courts It also identified that violence against women constituted a substantial proportion of the cases considered by the village courts  even though this issue did not fall directly come within the court's jurisidication. "This indicates that there is a need for an awareness raising programme so that people can harness its benefits," the report states. The study says most rural people still depend on the informal Shalish or conciliation process, regulated by local Matbar or community leaders. The view of the report was that, close and effective control and monitoring of village court activities must occurr to make it effective and acceptable to people. Accountability of the village courts was also a concern for most of the respondents along with a high emphasis on "proper investigation" of the cases dealt with. They also suggested that the jury should include educated people and the court itself should be free from 'political influences'. A major drawback for the proper functioning of the village court was that they are being run without any budget and inadequate logistic support. The survey noted that about 81 percent of the UP chairmen and members thought that a provision for honorarium would help as an incentive. The report recommends a comprehensive strategy for developing the legal policy framework to review and reform the village court system, aligned with the present needs of the rural population. It also stressed capacity development of the village court officials through legal training and logistics. The launching ceremony of the report held at Sheraton Hotel was addressed by state minister of local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak and UNDP country director Stefan Priesner among others.
