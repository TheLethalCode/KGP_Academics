<TITLE> Inter's Zanetti desperate for Mourinho to stay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Evergreen Inter Milan captain Javier Zanetti knows more than anyone else what a Champions League final means to the club and how important it is to hang on to restless coach Jose Mourinho. The 36-year-old Argentine talisman, whose boundless energy and mind-boggling fitness at full-back or in midfield put younger players to shame, has worked under 13 coaches since joining Inter in 1995.

The long-time charity worker, left out of Argentina's World Cup squad by Diego Maradona to the bemusement of Inter fans and most of Serie A, is likely to play at left back on Saturday and could come up against Bayern's wing wizard Arjen Robben. "They are a very strong team. They are physically strong and above all they have players upfront that can decide the match at any moment," Zanetti added through his broad but endearing Argentine accent.
