<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has adjourned until May 24 the hearing on a writ petition of opposition chief Khaleda Zia challenging the legality of a government order asking her to vacate her cantonment house. The bench of justices Iman Ali and Obaidul Hasan gave the order on Monday following an application for time extension by Khaleda's lawyers. Lawyer Moudud Ahmed had told the judges that the hearing should be deferred for two weeks since an application was now with the chief justice asking for the case be heard before another bench. On May 11, acting chief justice Md Abdul Matin had directed the BNP leader's counsel to place the application before chief justice Md Fazlul Karim on his return from abroad. Earlier, the bench of justices Ali and Hasan had rejected an application by Khaleda's lawyers to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and had twice rejected subsequent applications that the case be heard before another court. bdnew
