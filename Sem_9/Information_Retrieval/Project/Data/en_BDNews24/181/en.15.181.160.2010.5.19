 LONDON, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- England's transformation in just over two years from a side going nowhere to one counted among the World Cup favourites is largely down to Fabio Capello. The 63-year-old Italian art lover and opera fan has overseen a renaissance in the national side, restoring a sense of pride, discipline and self-belief that has been lacking for too long. Capello was appointed after England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008, the lowest point in their fortunes since their absence from the 1994 World Cup in the United States. From the first day he met the players, they knew the easy affability of the Steve McClaren era was over. Capello did not refer to his players as 'JT' (John Terry) or 'Becks' (David Beckham) in news conferences and his message was crystal clear: "We need to improve, the players know it, I know it...and we will." Capello was one of Europe's most successful coaches, winning four Italian titles with AC Milan, one with AS Roma and two with Juventus, plus two Spanish titles with Real Madrid. He also won the Champions League with Milan in 1994. He had been successful as a player, winning four titles with Milan and Juventus and playing 32 times for Italy, and he has brought that winning mentality to England, paying as much attention to off-field details as to what happens on the pitch. "Respect is everything," he told reporters. "And attention to detail is everything too. We can leave nothing to chance." While on England duty, the players eat together, arriving and departing at the same time. Mobile phones are banned and casual clothes have been replaced by team blazers. Although the nucleus of the squad is much the same as it was when he took over, he has got England to play as a tighter unit when they are without the ball, closing down the opposition quicker and defending in greater depth. As a consequence results have improved. Nine wins out of 10 qualifiers prove that, and they included 4-1 and 5-1 defeats of Croatia who ended McClaren's reign with a 3-2 win at Wembley. In hindsight, that defeat could be regarded as a blessing in disguise for, without it, McClaren would probably have stayed. Without Capello, England's chances of success in South Africa would be far lower than they
