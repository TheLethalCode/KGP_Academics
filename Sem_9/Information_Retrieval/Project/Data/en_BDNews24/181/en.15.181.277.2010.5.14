 Dhaka May 14 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League will have no problem if opposition BNP takes the NBR to court as it believes more information will be revealed there about Khaleda Zia and her family's 'corruption'. The ruling party's acting general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif also said BNP is planning to unleash chaos on the pretext of anti-government movement. Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif said, "We have no objections if BNP takes legal action against the National Board of Revenue." "More information on the corruption by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her family would be revealed through the legal battle. "The people also want that the truth be revealed," Hanif said at a press briefing on Friday at the AL president's political office in Dhanmondi. Khaleda's counsel Ahmed Azam Khan on Thursday threatened to take NBR to court if it did not explain the disclosure of 'secret tax documents'. He pointed out that article 163 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, stated that income tax returns and Tax Identification Number information should be kept confidential. BNP demands clear explanation on how (the ruling Awami League) got them from the NBR, he said. "Or we will take the NBR to court." The press conference was arranged in response to Khaleda's speech in divisional meeting of BNP where she declared that they will take legal action against NBR. "The opposition is now trying to spread propaganda against the government which are far from reality, obscene, false and disdainful," alleged Hanif. In a speech at Barisal's divisional meeting of her party, Khaleda said that thief have come out from the mine of thieves. Hanif said on May 9 that Khaleda had whitened Tk 13.31 million between 2002-03 and 2006-07 fiscal years and paid almost Tk 3.4 million as tax and fine. The opposition party leader had paid fines to legalise her undisclosed income on Aug 6, 2007, Hanif said after BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain claimed that Khaleda had never whitened 'black' money. According to the figures that Hanif presented, Khaleda had paid Tk 3,031,044 in 2002-03 fiscal, Tk 1,17,168 in 2004-5, Tk 82,790 in 2004-05, Tk 83,356 in 2005-06 and Tk 72000 in 2006-07 as tax and fine to the government. On Friday, Hanif said during the nearly one-and-half-year tenure of this Awami League-led government there has been no corruption accusations against any of the ministers or MPs. But the corruption by Khaleda and her sons during the four-party coalition government's rule exceeded graft by all post-liberation governments, he said. Hanif dismissed Khaleda's allegation at the Barisal rally that the government-backed launch workers had been staging the strike to bar BNP activists from joining the gathering. He said BNP-backed workers have called the strike to destabilise the democratic government
