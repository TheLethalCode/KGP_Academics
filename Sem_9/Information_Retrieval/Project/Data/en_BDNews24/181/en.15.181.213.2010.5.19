<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP has officially supported M Manzurul Alam as the main opposition party's man for the Chittagong mayor race. After over-an hour-long meeting with party chairperson Khaleda Zia, Chittagong city BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury confirmed bdnews24.com at around 2am on Wednesday about the nomination. Khosru said, "The party chief has ordered the leaders and supporters of all tiers to ensure the election of Manzur." Manzur on Monday said, "BNP has supported me as the mayoral candidate. I will collect nomination paper [on Wednesday]." Since Chittagong City Corporation is a local government body, no candidate can contest the election directly on any party ticket. The official declaration came just a day after Manzur, who is to run for the mayor's office as a candidate of the Chittagong Development Movement, a newly formed body of pro-BNP professionals, met with the BNP chief. A long time confidant of incumbent mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Manzur, however, has evaded questions whether he had joined BNP. The formal announcement of Mohiuddin's candidature under the banner of Chittagong Nagorik Committee will come Wednesday, one of its members Mohammad Emdad told a views-exchange meeting at Chittagong on Tuesday. Amid the hullabaloo, a Chittagong BNP leader has alleged that it was Amir Khosru who had "misguided" Khaleda into deciding on Alam. Khosru, however, told bdnews24.com that he did not "want to create a debate on this by making any comment." Alam has been involved with Awami League politics for a long time. Councillor for North Kattoli Ward (no 10), he filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. In the 2008 national elections, Manzur ran for a Chittagong constituency as an independent candidate but lost. The last date for filing nominations is May 20, with the deadline for withdrawal being June 1. bdnew
