 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)--The deep depression over the southeast and nearby areas of the Bay of Bengal has intensified into cyclonic storm, Laila, The Met Office in a special bulletin on Tuesday said the storm moved slightly towards the west-northwest over the same area around midday and was centered about 1305 km southwest of Chittagong port, 1230 km southwest of Cox's Bazaar port and 1220 km south-southwest of Mongla port. The Met Office advised the maritime ports to hoist 'distant warning signal number two.' All fishing boats and trawlers along the northern part of the Bay and deep sea have been asked to stay close to the coast and move with caution until further notice.
