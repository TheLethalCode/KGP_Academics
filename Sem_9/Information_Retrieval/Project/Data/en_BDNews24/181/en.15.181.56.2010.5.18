<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, May 18 (bdnews24.com) Industries minister Dilip Barua says there is no alternative but to set up coal-based power stations. "The government wants to establish a modern North Bengal through building coal-based power plants and fertiliser factories," he said emphasising the need for industrialisation. Speaking at a meeting at Dinajpur's Lokbhaban on Tuesday, Barua alleged that during the BNP-led coalition government's tenure the mills and factories were handed over to its party cadres. "They shut down the Adamjee Jute Mills in the name of justice and kicked 34,000 workers in the stomach." MP Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, Monoranjan Shil Gopal, Dinajpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Nurul Main Minu, Dinajpur Rice Mills Association president Mossadek Hossain also spoke at the meeting, which was presided over by Dinajpur's additional district magistrate Makbul Hossain. The industries minister visited Dinajpur's Shetabpur Sugar Mill following the meeting. bdnews24.
