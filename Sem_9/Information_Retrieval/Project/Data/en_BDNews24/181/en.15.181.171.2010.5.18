 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  International relations are more influenced by international NGOs and multinational companies than political parties, a visiting German professor said on Tuesday. In his keynote speech at a roundtable, Dr Ulrich von Alemann said transnational parties within the European Union were weaker than their national parties. BNP's M K Anwar MP, however, disagreed with the professor, saying that the political parties of bigger countries could influence international relations. "Traditionally the national government, especially heads of government, foreign ministries, diplomats and the United Nations (since 1945) are the players in international relations," Alemann, a professor of Heinrich-Heine-University of Dusseldorf, said. "More recently, international NGOs and multinational corporations are playing stronger roles than political parties in the international relations," he said. "Political parties play a negligible role." Local english language newspaper The Independent and private think-tank the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies jointly organised the discussion meeting at BEL Tower in Dhanmondi. Alemann said the 27-member European Union had experience of having parties such as the Green Party which go beyond national boundaries. "They are loosely organised 'party families' or federations made up of national parties. "But national issues and performances are often highly relevant for voters in the European Parliament elections," said Alemann. Awami League's Suranjit Sengupta, also the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry, said the political parties need not have international branches. "The political parties like the Awami League have a commitment to the international community; they have respect for international human rights. "Each political government respects the international treaties signed by their predecessors," said Sengupta. Former minister M K Anwar said the political parties of smaller countries like Bangladesh must take into consideration the interests of its mighty neighbours and other big countries. "I humbly disagree with the professor. The political parties of the US and the UK can influence international relations. Their decision affects us," said Anwar, a bureaucrat-turned politician. "But the political parties of Bangladesh cannot influence international relations," he said. Mahbubul Alam, The Independent editor, presided over the discussion meeting while former ambassador Ashfaqur Rahman moderated. Former state minister Abul Ahsan Chowdhury, Holger Michael, former secretaries M Moquammel Haq and Suhel Ahmed Chowdhury, ambassadors Sirajul Islam and Nasim Ferdous also spoke
