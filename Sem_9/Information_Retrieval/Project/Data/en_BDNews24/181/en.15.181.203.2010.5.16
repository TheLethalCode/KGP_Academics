<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) Law minister Shafique Ahmed has termed baseless suggestive speculations about the pending oath of two newly appointed judges to the High Court. He added that they would soon take oath. President Zillur Rahman appointed 17 additional judges to the High Court on Apr 11. But the oaths of former Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) leader Ruhul Kuddus Babu and deputy attorney general Khasruzzaman were not administered when the others took oath on Apr 18. Chief justice Fazlul Karim administered the oath of 15 judges. A press release from Supreme Court had stated that the chief justice administered oaths of newly appointed 15 additional judges, leaving out the two, due to 'unavoidable circumstances'. Some newspapers reported that regulations had not been properly maintained while appointing the judges. The reports alleged that Babu was a suspect in a murder case which was later withdrawn and Khasruzzaman was engaged in vandalism at the court premises. Having returned home after 15 days abroad, the law minister attended his office on Sunday. Replying to a question, the minister said, "The allegations brought against the two judges were proved false after investigation." "The two were appointed in line with the constitution and they will take oath within a few days." "There is no deadline for administering oath," Shafique added. Referring to another newspaper report that many of the recently appointed judges had third class in their academic life, the minister said, "Many get third divisions but the question is whether having a third class prevents that person from performing satisfactorily as a judge." He also said that skill and honesty were of the essence for conducting trials. "No one can be evaluated by the result of one examination alone," he said. bdnews24.com/pc
