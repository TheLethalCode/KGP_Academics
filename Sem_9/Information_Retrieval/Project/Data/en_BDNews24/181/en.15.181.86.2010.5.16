 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday granted bail to former Awami League MP Mokbul Hossain in a corruption case after he had surrendered to the trial court. The bench of justices Mohammed Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddique gave the order after Dhaka's Special Judges Court-3 sent him to prison earlier in the day. The High Court on May 6 asked Mokbul to surrender to the trial court within seven days. He was convicted, in absentia, on May 9, 2008 for amassing illegal assets worth around Tk 5.34 crores and concealing wealth worth roughly Tk 2.85 crores. Mokbul was jailed of 13 years. He had been absconding since then. Anticorruption Commission's deputy director Akhter Hossain filed the corruption case with Mohammadpur police on Aug 16, 2007. Mokbul on May 6 appealed for bail after appearing before the same bench, which ordered him to surrender within seven days. The former MP of Mohammadpur area is currently under treatment at the capital's Shamarita Hospital. After he turned himself in to court on Sunday, judge Mozammel Hossain of Dhaka's Special Judges Court-3 allowed his treatment in the jail custody. The bail petition was submitted immediately. His lawyers were then ordered to submit his affidavit, while being under judicial custody, along with the proof of his surrendering to the lower court, to the High Court. His petition was granted after the affidavit, undersigned by Mokbul, was submitted to the High Court in the afternoon, Mokbul's lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru told bdnews24.com. The jail authorities said Mokbul was still in hospital as the order had not reached the lower court. Meanwhile, hearing on the petition against the sentence order against him is currently stayed. Sunday's bail will be effective until resolution of the petition. bdnews2
