 WARSAW, May 17 (bdnews14.com/Reuters) - Flash floods triggered by days of heavy rain have killed at least four people, forced mass evacuations and cut off power to thousands in central Europe and weather forecasts offered no hope of respite in coming days. In southern Poland, one woman in her 60s and a 45-year-old man perished on Monday in separate incidents after being washed away by flood waters, officials and local media reported.

A 69-year-old woman also died on Monday in the neighbouring Czech Republic where hundreds had to be evacuated, including 90 from a hospital in the town of Bohumin, Czech media reported.

Parts of southern Poland also suffered power cuts. Unseasonably cold weather also drove up spot power prices. More than 2,000 people were forced from their homes in northern Hungary as heavy weekend rains blocked off villages and cut power supplies. One man was killed there on Sunday after an earth wall collapsed onto a house. In Hungary's third-biggest city of Miskolc, the mayor imposed emergency tap water restrictions and residents were building makeshift dams using logs, rocks and debris. "It's hard to predict when the situation will normalise because of the weather. We have not seen such floods in the valleys of the (rivers) Sajo and Hernad since 1974," said Csaba Csont, a spokesman for the water management authority in northern Hungary. In Slovakia, the government deployed troops alongside emergency services in the worst affected areas in the east and northwest of the count
