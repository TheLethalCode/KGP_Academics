 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)--A submarine cable link cut threw Bangladesh off the World Wide Web for about three hours on Sunday. The country's only terrestrial overseas communication lifeline was put back on at about 3pm. The international telephony, internet and private international data circuits went down around 12:30pm, users said. Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd attributed the connectivity failure to a problem in the underground transmission link. Mir Mohammed Morshed, the public relation officer of BTCL, told bdnews24.com at 4pm that the optical fibre, near Chiringa area of Cox's Bazaar, was cut. The trans-national-SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cable has landed at Cox's Bazaar. The cable landing station has been connected with BTCL's international exchange in Dhaka via Chittagong through an optical fibre line that has been laid by the highway. Since installation in 2006, submarine cable has been disrupted numerous times due to cut resulted from works by other agencies and occasionally, from theft. The optical fibre line connects Bangladesh to the information superhighway and serves as the backbone of international communication, while satellite services act as backup with limited bandwidth. bdnews24.
