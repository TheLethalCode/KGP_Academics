 Kuala Lumpur, May 19 (bdnews24.com)--Malaysia will consider legalising Bangladeshi workers, a senior official says. Malaysian prime minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak gave the assurance on Wednesday afternoon during a meeting with his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina in Kuala Lumpur. "We will put forward the issue (of Bangladeshi workers) before the government's recruitment committee soon," Najib told Hasina, who is on the last leg of her Asia tour. Her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told journalists that the Malaysian leader had appreciated Bangladeshi workers, saying that they are playing an important role in his country's economy. Azad quoted prime minister Hasina saying that her government had taken massive programmes to impart training to the Bangladeshi workers intending to work abroad. "We'll impart training to our people on the language of host countries and their rules and regulations before sending them abroad for work," the prime minister was further quoted as telling Najib. She sought Malaysian investment in sectors like power, gas, telecommunications and infrastructure, saying "an excellent investment-friendly environment is prevailing in Bangladesh". She promised maximum support to Malaysian entrepreneurs who will invest in Bangladesh and presented data of Bangladesh's economic performance before him to earn his confidence in the economy. The prime minister said despite the ongoing global economic crisis, Bangladesh achieved a 6.5 percent growth last year and the government is trying hard to raise the growth rate. Hasina expressed her government's willingness to work together with Malaysia to fight poverty, a common enemy in the Asian region, and tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. Azad told reporters the Malaysian leader lauded Hasina for taking the lead in compensation negotiations during the climate change summit in Copenhagen. Najib assured her of extending his country's support in tackling the climate change impacts and mitigating the sufferings of the people.
