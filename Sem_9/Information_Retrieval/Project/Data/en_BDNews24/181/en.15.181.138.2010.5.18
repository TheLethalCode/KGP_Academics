<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona's World Cup career has been marked above all else by Argentina's 1986 victory in Mexico and his expulsion for doping from the 1994 finals in the United States. In between, there were tears of frustration and despair in Rome after Argentina's defeat in the 1990 final. Maradona has pursued the World Cup since he told an interviewer as a 10-year-old that it was his dream to win the trophy. He goes to South Africa with that goal in mind once again, hoping to emulate Germany's Franz Beckenbauer by winning the trophy as coach having done so as captain.

Argentine Football Association president Julio Grondona also named the 1986 World Cup-winning coach Carlos Bilardo as technical director of national teams in a move seen as giving the inexperienced Maradona coaching back-up. However, the proud Maradona likes to do things his way and has not wanted to take advice or help from Bilardo, preferring as he has done all his life to surround himself with yes-men. Argentina could go all the way, or a well-drilled team with the right tactics could dump Maradona's side out early on. Maradona's reaction to such an outcome is anybody's guess but he has the safety net of having signed up until next year's Copa America, the South American championship, in Argen
