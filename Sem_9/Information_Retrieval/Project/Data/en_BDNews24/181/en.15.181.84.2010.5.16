 MADRID, May 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manuel Pellegrini spoke as if he suspected his days were numbered as Real Madrid coach when he gave his pre-match news conference on Saturday ahead of the last game of the season at Malaga. The nine-time European champions are one point behind La Liga leaders Barcelona, who host Real Valladolid at the same time on Sunday.
