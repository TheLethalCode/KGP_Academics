 Chittagong, May 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Manzur Alam says he will run the Chittagong mayoral election as a candidate from the Chittagong Development Movement, a newly formed body of pro-BNP professionals. At a news conference at the Chittagong Press Club on Tuesday, he was asked if he had formally joined the main opposition party, which nominated him on Monday. Manzur said, "BNP has supported me as the mayoral candidate. I will collect nomination paper as a Chittagong Development Movement candidate [on Wednesday]." Since Chittagong City Corporation is a local government body, no candidate can contest the election directly on any party ticket. Abul Kashem Chowdhury, convenor of Chittagong Development Movement and president of the Chittagong University Teachers' Association (CUTA), had introduced him as "the BNP candidate" at the press conference. Chittagong Development Movement joint convenor Abul Kalam Azad, also a teacher of the University, told the meeting that incumbent mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury was using the corporation to serve his own interest. He said Manzur has been picked as mayoral candidate because of his "honesty, efficiency and uncompromising attitude". Though no top leader of BNP's Chittagong city unit other than its vice-president Abu Sufian was present at the event, around 500 ward-level leaders and activists attended it. International Islamic University vice-chancellor Dr Mahbub Ullah, advocate Kabir Chowdhury, CUTA general secretary Nasrul Kadir, university teachers ANM Munir Ahmed Chowdhury and Hasan Mohammad, advocate SUM Nurul Islam and journalist Iskandar Ali, among others, were also present at the meeting. Earlier in the day, Chittagong city unit general secretary of BNP Shahadat Hossain alleged that party chairperson Khaleda Zia was "misguided" into picking Manzur. Hossain, a mayoral nomination aspirant, made the allegation a day after his party selected Manzur, formerly a close confidant of the incumbent mayor, as the mayoral candidate. He blamed Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury for misguiding the party chief. Manzur had told reporters at BNP chairperson's office in Dhaka on Monday night that he had secured the support of Khaleda to be the BNP's mayoral candidate. Top BNP leaders from Chittagong, including Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Amir Khosru, Gias Quader Chowdhury and Zafrul Islam were present at the chairperson's office when the decision was made. Manzur, involved with Awami League politics for a long time, is the councillor of CCC ward number 10. He filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. Meanwhile, Mohiuddin has announced that he will seek an unprecedented fourth term in office from Nagorik (Citizen) Committee as he did in the previous election. bdn
