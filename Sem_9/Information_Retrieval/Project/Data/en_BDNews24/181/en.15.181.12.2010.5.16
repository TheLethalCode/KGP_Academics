<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has rejected an application by Channel 1 authorities challenging the validity of a government order that had stopped it from broadcasting. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Gobinda Chandra Tagore gave the order on Sunday. Channel 1 was represented by Barrister Rafiq Ul Haq and Advocate Ahsanul Karim at the hearing of the petition. Following the rejection, Ahsanul Karim told reporters that they will appeal the ruling if the channel's authorities agree. Channel 1 director Mazidul Islam filed the application on behalf of the TV station on May 2. The TV station was taken off air on Apr 27 by the regulators alleging that the station had broken the law. The station, established by Tarique Zia's business partner and friend Giasuddin Al Mamun, started transmission on Jan 24, 2006 during the regime of the BNP-led government. Earlier on Apr 27, when the station was taken off air, BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed said that the private television channel has violated telecommunications legislation as it had handed over its broadcasting equipment to another entity. He said that despite several notifications and show cause notices from the BTRC the private television channel had failed to respond. More than 400 workers have participated in various programmes including human-chains urging that the channel be allowed to broadcast. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued for the state at the hearing. bdnew
