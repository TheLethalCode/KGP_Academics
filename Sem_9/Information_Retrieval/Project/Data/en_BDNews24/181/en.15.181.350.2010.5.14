 Dhaka May 14 (bdnews24.com) -- River transportation has become normal on Friday after six days of strike, the BIWTA claimed. An officer of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, on duty at the Sadarghat launch terminal, said that there is no strike now and that every single one of the southbound launch is on the move. Most of the launches sailed from Sadarghat as scheduled on Friday. However, no members of the Noujan Sramik Federation were present at the terminal. Only the Nou Sramik League and Jahaji Sramik Federation leaders-workers were there. All the launches scheduled to sail till 12:00 has done so, M Mahmud Hossain, Sadarghat's BIWTA traffic inspector told bdnews24.com. "From Thursday morning to midnight, 51 launches have sailed from Sadarghat." "On Friday, 38 launches have sailed from Sadarghat until 9pm, while another 41 came to the port from areas in the country." "However some launches are at hold due to the bad weather", the BIWTA official said. On the other hand, Noujan Sramik Federation leaders alleged that BIWTA's claim of 80 percent of the launches being driven by the masters and drivers is false and that most of them are being handled by the sukanies (assistants of the masters), without any master or driver. The strike called by the Noujan Sramik Federation began on May 6 after they rejected the new wage structure. Their 22-point charter of demands included an acceptable wage structure and increasing the validity of the master's license to life from the current five-year duration. On Monday, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan claimed that the strike was politically motivated and asked the workers to resume work within Thursday afternoon. Those who will not join will get their professional licenses cancelled, warned the minister. In reaction to the minister's threat, the joint secretary of Noujan Sramik Federation's Dhaka unit, Mohammed Alam told bdnews24.com over phone that they would not resume work. He pointed out that the demand to increase the masters' license's validity is a key demand, saying "Currently the master's license is valid for only five years. It has to be renewed every five years by taking part in new tests", the launch worker leader said. The new wages structure was finalised in a tripartite meeting among workers, owners and the government on May 5. Though the wages were increased by 50 to 100 percent, the federation is demanding for a 300 percent rise. The strike of launch workers started to weaken from Tuesday morning on its fourth day after the government threatened action, with eight out of 10 scheduled launches leaving Sadarghat terminal. Shah Alam, president of the Noujan Sramik Federation, was arrested on Monday on charges of vandalising Bangladesh Noujan Sramik League's office. b
