 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Thirteen members including the acting president of the Noujan Sramik Federation, a section of water transport workers that initiated a strike last week, have secured bail in a case. Metropolitan magistrate Abdul Majid granted them bail on Monday. Those who got bail are acting president Shah Alam, members Md Khokon, Manik, Abul Hossain, Din Muhammad, Mofazzal Hossain, Babul Sikdar, Awal, Md Akkas, SM Shahjahan, Mamun Bepari, Abu Taher and Md Monir Hossain. Alam was arrested on May 10 at the capital's Paltan in a case filed against him for vandalising an office of the pro-government water transport workers during the strike. Advocate Dipankar Goldar, who argued for the workers, told bdnews24.com that nine other workers who were accused in the same case got interim bail from the High Court on May 14. The lawyers for the workers told the court at the hearing that there was no seizure list or evidence against the suspects and so they can get bail. The Noujan Sramik Federation called off their strike on Saturday after a meeting with the parliamentary standing committees on shipping, and labour and employment ministries. Federation secretary Ashikul Islam had said on Saturday the government had agreed to release the detained federation leaders, withdraw cases against them and review the new pay scale. bd
