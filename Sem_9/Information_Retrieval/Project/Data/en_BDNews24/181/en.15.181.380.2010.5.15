 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  AL's acting general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif has warned the BNP against deliberately creating "indiscipline" at Wednesday's Dhaka meeting and then blaming the government for it. He was speaking at a press conference on Saturday at Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's political office at Dhanmondi following a joint meeting of central AL and its associate organisations. His comment came in response to a meeting held by BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain earlier in the day where the veteran BNP leader had said that BNP will hold the government responsible for any incident over its planned rally in Dhaka on May 19. The AL leader claimed that BNP had earlier called meetings at Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal and the government had not created any obstruction as the opposition party was practicing its democratic rights. Hanif claimed that the BNP was now trying to create trouble for which they would then blame the government. "The BNP leaders had earlier attempted to misguide the country by arranging a press meet before the Bhola by-election. Now they are trying to do the same with by arranging this press conference before its general meeting in Dhaka," said Hanif. Hanif gave an assurance that his party members will not attempt to obstruct the opposition's democratic and peaceful activities. Addressing the BNP leader he said, "Do not attempt to hatch a conspiracy. Do not create indiscipline yourselves and later blame the government." Hanif also claimed that the BNP wanted to disrupt the government plan's to hold war crimes trials. The joint meeting presided over by acting chairperson Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury was held to finalise activities to remember the occasion of Hasina's homecoming from exile on May 17, 1981. The meeting was attended by AL's presidium members, central leaders and leaders of its associate organizations. AL will be starting off its celebrations on May 17 at around 7.30 am by placing a wreath at the effigy of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mijibur Rahman at the museum at Dhanmondi's road 32. A meeting is also to be held at Awami League's central office in the afternoon. The acting general secretary of the party said that district AL leaders across the country had been urged to undertake activities on May 17 to celebrate the current prime minister's homecoming. bdnews2
