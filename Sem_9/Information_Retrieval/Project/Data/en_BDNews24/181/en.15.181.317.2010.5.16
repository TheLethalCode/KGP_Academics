 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  Delays in the dispersal of funds has meant that the government had not built boundary pillars to mark the river boundaries even after illegal structured were cleared. The shipping minister Shahjahan Khan was speaking after a meeting of the taskforce on navigability and protection of natural flow of the main rivers. He said that the finance minister would be contacted to ensure that the money necessary to build the pillars was disbursed. Statistics presented at the meeting showed that over the last three months 108 illegal structures have been cleared from the rivers in Dhaka and Narayanganj. Currently the authorities are trying to clear illegal structures from Aminbazar to Sadarghat. The minister said that he hoped the work would be finished in July. On May 3 the Supreme Court upheld a High Court ruling that ordered the dismantling of illegal structures on the banks of four rivers in and around Dhaka city. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by Chief Justice Md Fazlul Karim gave the order on Monday. The High Court on June 26, 2009 ordered the government to demolish all illegal structures encroaching on the four riversthe Buriganga, Turag, Sitalakhya and Baluon a petition filed by rights group Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Shahjahan Khan also said that a project of Tk 0.75 million was approved at the meeting to create awareness on protecting navigability of the rivers and removing waste. bdnew
