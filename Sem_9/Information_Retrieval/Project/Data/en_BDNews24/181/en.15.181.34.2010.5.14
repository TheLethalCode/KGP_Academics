 BISHKEK, May 14 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  One person was killed and over 60 wounded in clashes in Kyrgyzstan Friday as the interim government regained control of official buildings seized by supporters of ousted president Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Shots rang out in the southern cities of Osh and Jalalabad, where hundreds of Bakiyev supporters battled factions loyal to the government with sticks and stones, medical officials said. In Jalalabad, one person was killed and 63 people were wounded, 32 of them with gun-shot wounds, the health ministry said. Government supporters retook the regional administration headquarters in Osh earlier in the day, and later Friday also took control of the equivalent building in Jalalabad from Bakiyev supporters, government officials said. In Bishkek, interim government head Roza Otunbayeva said authorities were "taking all measures to peacefully resolve the situation." The capital is calm, she said, adding the government is "taking measures to restore order in Jalalabad." Several Bakiyev allies, including the former head of his office, Usen Sydykov, were detained during the clashes, Otunbayeva said. Bakiyev supporters had on Thursday seized regional administration buildings in Osh, Jalalabad and the town of Batken. They occupied the airports in Osh and Jalalabad. The US embassy in Bishkek, in a statement, expressed concern about the violence, urging "the peaceful resolution to the problems that have caused this situation." The interim government, which took power after Bakiyev was ousted in an uprising last month, has so far avoided using security forces against protesters in a bid not to inflame tensions. Otunbayeva said that the gunfire had come from Bakiyev supporters who had "again spilled the blood of citizens of Kyrgyzstan". A spokeswoman for Bakiyev's supporters, Zhanara Moldokulova, told AFP that around 1,500 of them had occupied the regional administration building in Jalalabad before leaving for a nearby village. "We do not intend to retreat until the legitimate president Bakiyev returns to Kyrgyzstan," she said. Omurbek Tekebayev, a leading member of the interim government, accused Bakiyev of being behind the unrest and said its organisers "wanted to ignite an inter-ethnic conflict in the country. Another top interim government official, Azimbek Beknazarov, said there was information that Bakiyev supporters planned mass protests on May 17. "Popular militia groups are forming throughout the country with the aim of thwarting a destabilisation of the country," he added. He claimed that the "south of the country is completely under the control of the authorities." The protests that ousted Bakiyev left at least 86 people dead and the interim government has since struggled to impose its authority. Bakiyev, who drew the bulk of his support from southern Kyrgyzstan, has since taken refuge in Belarus, which has so far not responded to calls for his extradition. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned last month that Kyrgyzstan risked civil war but the situation calmed with the departure of Bakiyev. Bakiyev's support committee in Kyrgyzstan said Thursday that 25,000 supporters of the ousted president were making their way to Bishkek to "settle scores with the interim government". There was no immediate sign of this in the capital but his Bishkek-based support committee said 10,000 people were expected later in the day. Bakiyev came to power in the so-called Tulip Revolution uprising of 2005 which ousted the previous president Askar Akayev -- but became increasingly unpopular amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement. The mountainous ex-Soviet state is in a key strategic location and houses a US airbase used for the transit of supplies for the conflict in Afghanistan as well as a Russian military ba
