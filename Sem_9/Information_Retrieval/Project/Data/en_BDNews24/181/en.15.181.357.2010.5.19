 Sylhet, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  No import or export took place through Sylhet's Tamabil land port on Tuesday due to a workers' strike in India. However, travellers were able to use the port. Tamabil's assistant customs superintendent Apu Barua quoted Indian customs officials as saying that the import and export activities were halted because of a three-day strike of Indian workers that began on Tuesday. The strike was called over a clash between Nepalese and Khashia workers on the other side of the border. He also said the Bangladeshi port authorities were informed of the matter by Indian customs officials on Monday afternoon. "However, immigration was normal with nine people, including two foreign tourists, going to India and one Bangladeshi returning to the country through the land port," Barua said. The Bangladeshi customs official also said that the government has counted around Tk 10 lakh in lost revenue due to Tuesday's halt in business. Bangladesh imports coal, leather and limestone from India and exports pickles, juice, chips and other goods through Tamabil port at Sylhet's Goainghat upazila.
