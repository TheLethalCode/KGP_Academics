 BANGKOK (AFP)  Thai troops opened fire on protesters Friday after a military lockdown of their vast rally site in the heart of the capital sparked fierce clashes that left seven people dead and more than 100 wounded. Security forces moved to regain control of a road close to the Suan Lum night bazaar, a popular spot with tourists, after "Red Shirt" demonstrators spilled out of their fortified rally base, which was under siege by troops. The protesters, who are trying to bring down the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, threw stones, used slingshots and launched fireworks at the troops as the two-month standoff descended into more violence. As night fell, gunfire continued to ring out close to the protest site, which was still occupied by thousands of demonstrators. Several blasts were heard in the nearby financial district but the cause was unclear. Six men and one woman, all civilians, were killed in the violence, which also left 101 people injured, including three foreigners, according to the official Erawan emergency centre. Three journalists, one of them a Canadian with the France 24 television channel, were shot and wounded while covering the unrest. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said security troops had come under attack as they moved to seal off the rally area late Thursday to prevent more Red Shirts from entering. "The soldiers... had no choice but to respond to these attacks," Panitan told a news conference, adding that troops were authorised to use live ammunition in self-defence, for warning shots or against armed gunmen. Troops would step up security measures in the coming days to search for weapons and reduce the number of people entering the area, he said, warning of the risk of more instability in the capital. Soldiers used tear gas Friday against the demonstrators, who set fire to piles of tyres in the road, torched an empty police bus and vandalised army vehicles in their efforts to disrupt the lockdown. At one point troops fired directly at protesters and then advanced up a road, shooting into the air, according to an AFP reporter. Nelson Rand, a reporter who was covering fighting between troops and protesters for France 24, was hit by three bullets from a military assault rifle and "gravely wounded", his network reported. At least 37 people have been killed and about 1,000 injured in Bangkok in a series of confrontations and attacks since the protests began in mid-March. The mood was tense inside the demonstrators' encampment, which has been fortified with razor wire, truck tyres doused with kerosene and sharpened bamboo poles. "Abhisit has already started civil war," top Red Shirt Nattawut Saikuar told reporters. "We urgently demand the government withdraw the military and stop all violence," he said. "I don't know how we can survive tonight if Abhisit does not agree to a ceasefire. We hope that Abhisit does not want war." The Reds consider Abhisit's government illegitimate because it came to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote after a court ruling ousted elected allies of their hero, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was unseated in a 2006 coup. Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a jail term at home for corruption, called on the government to pull back troops and restart negotiations with the demonstrators. "The government's actions clearly constitute grave infringement of human rights and criminal offences," Thaksin said in a statement. Defence Minister General Prawit Wongsuwon said the military operation was meant to force the movement's leaders back to talks with the government. A renegade general allied with the Reds was fighting for his life after being shot late Thursday close to the protest site. His supporters said he was targeted by a sniper. The army, which had warned Thursday it would deploy snipers around the Reds' protest site, denied any involvement in the shooting of Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, better known by his nickname "Seh Daeng". Khattiya, who had been accused of trying to block government moves to reconcile with the protesters, was unconscious in the intensive care unit of Vahira hospital with a head wound. He had a "low" chance of survival, said Chaiwan Charoenchokethavee, the hospital director. The violence came after Abhisit scrapped a plan to hold November elections as peace efforts broke down, with the Reds demanding the deputy premier be charged for his role in overseeing an April 10 crackdown in which 25 people died, including a Japanese cameram
