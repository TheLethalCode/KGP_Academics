 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission will arrange televised electoral debate among the mayoral candidates of Chittagong City Corporation next month, an official said. Commissioner Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com that the debate might be held on June 7 and 8, and will be aired live on BBC Bangla and state-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. BBC Bangla Service will moderate the debate while BTV will extend technical assistance. Sakhawat said he had a meeting with BBC Bangla Service chief Sabir Mostafa and Kamruneesa Hasan of BTV on Thursday at the EC secretariat to finalise the programmes. He said the commission had previously held election dialogue among the mayoral candidates. "This time there will be no dialogue. There will be debate among the candidates, apart from answering questions by the electorate." He said the EC would neither allow the candidates to hold election rallies nor will it arrange any projection meeting for them this time. "In such a situation, the debate will facilitate their projection as well as war of words against one another." Sakhawat said similar electoral debates would be arranged among candidates in the next general elections. BBC Bangla Service's Waliur Rahman Miraz told bdnews24.com that BBC had started preparatory works like survey on key facts for the debate. He said the programme would be aired for 70 minutes every day after the radio station's news at 8pm. "There will be five candidates and around 150 voters in each programme." He, however, said the duration of the programmes would depend on the number of candidates. Election in Chittagong City Corporation will be held on June 17. The last date for submission of nomination papers has been set for May 20 and withdrawal of candidature for June 1
