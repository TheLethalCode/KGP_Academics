 Pabna, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Activists of pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League on Monday broke down a foundation stone laid by a former Jamaat-e-Islami minister at the Circuit House in Pabna, police said. The foundation stone was installed during the term of four-party alliance government on Nov 19, 2006, when Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami was a minister. Motiar Rahman, officer in charge of Sadar Police Station, told bdnews24.com that a faction of BCL activists, who came to meet state for home minister Shamsul Huq Tuku, had done that. He said they had broken the stone before the police could do anything around 2:30pm. BCL's former district president Mostafizur Rahman Sweet said some agitated activists had broken down the foundation stone seeing the name of 'war criminal' Nizami there. Witnesses said the junior minister, who was in Pabna to attend different programmes marking prime minister's homecoming day, went to the Circuit House at 2pm to get some rest. Some 20-25 BCL activists at 2:30pm dismantled the stone with hammers and crowbars, when Tuku was then speaking to the local leaders and visitors. bdnews2
