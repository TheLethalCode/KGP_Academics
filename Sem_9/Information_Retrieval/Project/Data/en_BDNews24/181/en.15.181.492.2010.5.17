Sylhet's Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal judge Mahbub-ul-Islam on Monday set May 24 for the submission. Investigation officer in the case Md Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com: "Preparations to finalise the further probe report has made good progress. "But several suspects in the case are not arrested yet. "The report will be submitted to the court after their arrest ," added Rafiqul, also the senior ASP of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). State counsel and special public prosecutor of the court Kishore Kumar Roy said it was the 29th time the extension was granted. He said the extension was asked to identify the real culprits.

Local Awami League leader Abdul Majid filed the case with Habiganj Police Station against unnamed people after the killing.
