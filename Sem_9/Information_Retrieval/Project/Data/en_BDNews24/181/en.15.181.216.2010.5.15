 Narayanganj, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Students and teachers of a school in Narayanganj on Saturday brought out a procession protesting the killing of one of their students by a speeding bus. During the demonstration, the aggrieved students vandalised two buses and a truck. Afsaruddin, 17, a student of tenth grade of Mandalpara Ganabiddya Niketan School, was run over by a speeding bus while trying to cross the road on Thursday afternoon. The students of the school brought out a procession and hosted a meeting boycotting classes and examinations in protest of Afsaruddin's death and demanded the bus driver's arrest. The teachers also joined the demonstrations and participated in the procession. The procession started from the school and ended in front of Narayanganj Press Club, where the demonstrators held a meeting. The school's head master MA Quaiyum, assistant head master Ahmed Hossain and the students voiced their demands for arrest and exemplary punishment of the bus driver at the meeting. Ahmed Hossain said, "The buses on Narayanganj-Dhaka route do not obey traffic rules. Generally, unskilled drivers drive the buses in the road. So accidents occur frequently causing loss of valuable lives. We want exemplary punishment of the responsible driver and helper of the bus." Narayanganj Sadr Model Police Station's chief Akthar Hossain said that a case was filed with the police station in this concern. "We are trying to arrest the driver and the helper of the bus," said the police officer. bdn
