 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has again extended time for BNP chief Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco's court appearance in a tax-dodge case. Judge Mohammad Ismail Hossain of Dhaka's Senior Special Judges Court set July 16 for the appearance upon a petition by Coco's lawyer Taherul Islam Touhid. On May 11, the home ministry extended the parole by 60 days in an executive order signed by its senior assistant secretary Rukhsana Hashin. Coco went to Thailand for treatment in 2008. Lawyers for Coco, according to the case, had earlier applied once for time extension in the same tax evasion case. Deputy tax commissioner Shahin Akhter Hossain of the National Board of Revenue filed the case with Dhaka Metropolitan Session Judges' Court on Mar 1 this year. Hossain accused Coco of evading income tax on Tk 5.2 million from 2002-03 to 2006-07 FY. Coco is supposed to appear before a Dhaka court on July 18 in a money laundering case, his lawyer told bdnews24.com.
