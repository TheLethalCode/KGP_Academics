<TITLE> Khaleda to pick Ctg mayor runner </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) BNP chief Khaleda Zia will choose who will mount the challenge for the Chittahong city mayor's post up for grabs on June 17, senior party leaders said. But, known leaders are unlikely to run against popular incumbent Chittagong mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury, strongly tipped to get the go-ahead from the ruling Awami League, said Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury. He and another BNP stalwart from Chittagong, MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, met with the party supremo behind closed doors just before midnight to discuss a possible candidate. A meeting of the BNP's policymaking standing committee earlier in the evening at the chairperson's Gulshan political office had decided to contest in the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation elections. Khosru, a former commerce minister and MP from Chittagong, made it clear to journalists that there had been no headway in deciding upon a formidable mayoral candidate. Emerging from the last meeting, Salahuddin Quader told bdnews24.com that the task of selecting a candidate for Chittagong mayor had been given to the party chief and she would make the announcement in due time. Khosru told journalists that he had never desired to run for the Chittagong mayor's office. "Nor do I want to run for that office now." The tenure of the current city council runs out on June 25 and incumbent Mohiuddin Chowdhury has already indicated his desire to seek an unprecedented fourth term in office. The standing committee meeting concluded around 11:30pm after which the BNP chairperson convened the other meeting.
