 Chittagong, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has said that he will resign before filing his nomination papers on Thursday, the last date for submission. He made the announcement at a City Corporation meeting on Wednesday. The Awami League leader is contesting for the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls as a candidate of the Citizen Committee. On Monday, he said that he had no objections to resigning if the Election Commission so required. The Commission had stated that incumbents would have to relinquish their current positions before the elections. According to the law, a person cannot contest for the post of mayor whilst holding that position. Mohiuddin has already indicated that he will be seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure as mayor in the election scheduled on June 17. His current CCC tenure expires on June 25. Mohiuddin said on Wednesday that he had not received any direction as to whom he would hand over his responsibilities as mayor. However, "the panel mayor may be given the responsibility", he added. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, he said this time the nature of the polls is a bit different. "People will vote after evaluating which candidate can be an efficient mayor, rather than whose election symbol they prefer." bdnews
