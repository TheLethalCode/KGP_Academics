 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Former military dictator H M Ershad's lawyer questioned his estranged wife Bidisha about her two passports during a cross examination at a Dhaka court on Monday. Ershad's chief councillor Sheikh Mohammad Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that Bidisha had two passports with different birth dates and different names for husbands. The cross examination was part of a case relating to Bidisha demanding custody of Eric Ershad, their son. She gave her testimony to judge Shammi Akhter of Dhaka's 15th Assistant Judge and Family Court. The case was filed with Dhaka District Judges Court on May 27 last year. Since the testimony was not over on Monday, the judge set June 1 for the next hearing. Bidisha on Mar 18 this year filed a case against her former husband for Tk 60 crore in damages. She alleged that the former strongman had tortured her and that her reputation had been damaged from the "false cases" filed by him. Ershad was asked to submit his written statement on May 25 in this case. bd
