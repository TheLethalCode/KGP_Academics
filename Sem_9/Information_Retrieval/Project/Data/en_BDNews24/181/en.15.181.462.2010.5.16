 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)-Telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu says a new law is coming by the next month to open up the market to more companies to make telephone calls over the internet, or VoIP. "The government will then issue more licences for the VoIP business to new companies allowing people to make international calls at very cheap rates," he said at a meeting on Sunday at the National Press Club to mark the World Telecommunication Day on May 17. Currently, only five companies--Novotel Limited, Bangla Trac Communications Ltd, Mir Telecom, M & H Telecom and Getco Telecommunications-- are licenced to use Voice over Internet Protocol, the technology that allows free phone calls over the internet. However, the revenue made by the five licenced operators is taxed by 54 percent, raising their costs and making illegal operations lucrative. The government is losing an estimated Tk 2 crore a day in revenue to rogue VoIP operations, according to the chief of parliamentary watchdog on telecoms. Around 70-80 million minutes of calls are received daily in Bangladesh, 40 percent of which are illegally operated through VoIP, Hasanul Haque Inu recently said. The telecoms regulator BTRC last week cancelled the licences of five private land-phone companies for their involvement in the illegal internet telephony. Razu said, "Those who disobeyed the laws will have to face the consequences. There are no other reasons behind the closures." The new law will allow more companies to enter the market with government nod. Inu, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on telecoms ministry, has been advocating that the market for VoIP should be opened up. Last week he said VoIP must be brought under proper legal regulation and more licences need to be given out to increase the revenue. The telecommunications minister also revealed that the government was working to have its own satellite. However, setting up the satellite will take about two years and cost around $300-400 billion. The government cannot afford the cost alone and is seeking public-private partnership, he said. "Many overseas companies are interested in sponsoring the installation. But in that case, they will be renting out satellite frequency, which Bangladesh does not need, to others." "However, the government feels the need to have control over the satellite and is thus stressing public-private partnerships," Razu said. Responding to a query about setting up a second submarine cable connection, the minister said that the government has taken initiative to add another connection. He also said the government will provide internet connections to 1000 unions to allow the children internet access. bdnews
