 GHILJO, Pakistan, 17 May (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban militants attacked a security checkpost in a restive northwestern Pakistani region on Monday, sparking clashes in which 19 insurgents and one soldier were killed, officials said.

But militants have shown resilience and carried out a wave of suicide and bomb attacks, mainly in the northwest. Officials say a large number of militants fleeing offensives in South Waziristan and Swat have taken shelter in Orakzai and neighbouring Kurram and Khyber regions. Security forces have stepped up crackdown on insurgents in these regions in recent months, keeping up pressure on the al Qaeda-backed Taliban fighters who want to topple the state. Suspected militants dressed as policemen on Saturday kidnapped at least 60 people in two incidents in Kurram. Forty hostages were freed by the militants while 10 escaped from their custody on Sunday, an official said. Khalid Khan Omarzai, a senior regional government official, said the militants had freed all remaining hostages on Monday. "They are on their way back home," he told Reute
