 LONDON, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Labour Party gave itself four months on Tuesday to elect a new leader who will face the task of rejuvenating a party out of power for the first time since 1997. The position became vacant when Gordon Brown stepped down a week ago as prime minister and party leader. A Conservative-Liberal Democrat alliance, the first coalition since World War Two, came to power after the May 6 election. "(The leadership contest) is going to be a very important opportunity for us to reflect on the result of the general election, to renew the Labour Party and to re-engage with the British people," interim leader Harriet Harman told reporters. The frontrunner is David Miliband, 44, who was foreign minister in Brown's government. A former adviser to Brown's predecessor Tony Blair, the cerebral Miliband is seen as the candidate of the party's "Blairite" or centrist wing. The only other candidate to come forward so far is his brother Ed Miliband, 40, the former energy and climate change minister. His supporters say he is a unity candidate who would end years of tension between the so-called "Blairite" and "Brownite" wings of the party. Former schools minister Ed Balls, 42, a close Brown confidant who is popular with the more left-leaning elements of the party, will announce his candidacy on Wednesday, according to the Guardian newspaper. Left-wing backbencher John McDonnell, who made an unsuccessful challenge to Brown for the Labour leadership in 2007, will also enter the race on Wednesday, the paper said. "The contest is David Miliband's to lose. He's the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers, he's seen as the intellectual heavyweight candidate within the party," said Jonathan Tonge, head of politics at Liverpool University. "FOUR MONTHS FOR THINGS TO GO WRONG" But Tonge said the decision to have such a long leadership contest could harm David Miliband's prospects. "It's like a horse race. When you've got a leadership contest this long, it's rare for the horse that's out in front to stay out in front all that distance. It's four months for things to go wrong for David Miliband's campaign," he said. Labour said leadership candidates would declare themselves from May 24 to 27, hustings would take place in June and July and balloting would run from Aug. 16 to Sept. 22. The winner will be announced at the annual party conference on Sept. 25. Interim leader Harman dismissed suggestions that such a long process could allow divisions to fester, inflicting further damage on the party at a time when it should be adapting to the new political landscape of a Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. "I don't think there will be instability. One of the ways in which members will judge the candidates is how responsibly they play their part in the leadership election," she s
