<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)--Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has asked prime minister Sheikh Hasina to reveal her source of income. "People want to know the source of income of the prime minister," Chowdhury told the Dhaka divisional rally of the main opposition at Paltan ground on Wednesday. "People know about my source of income." His statement comes on the heels of comments by ruling Awami League leaders, including Hasina, about BNP chief Khaleda Zia legalising undisclosed money. Acting Awami League general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif on May 11 said Khaleda had paid Tk 33.87 lakh as fines from 2002-03 to 2006-07 fiscal years to whiten black money worth Tk 1.33 crore. BNP has been claiming that she had legalised 'white money'. Prime minister Hasina earlier in a meeting in Barguna alleged that Khaleda had whitened a large amount of black money by paying fines. Chowdhury on Wednesday said the government was talking about black money. He said people also knew how his father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury had built house in Dhanmondi and that his children were studying abroad. The BNP leader said: "People who earn by extorting money from others cannot stop extortion. They will not be able to reveal the real source of their income either." He accused the pro-government student wing of rampant extortion and the ruling party members of corruption. "This is not fair that some will have the advantage and some will not." He also criticised the government for 'failing' to address power, gas and water crises. The rally started around 2pm with people chanting the slogans, 'Save the country, save the people', the party's campaign slogan. Khaleda Zia, the chief guest of the rally, will announce antigovernment movement from the rally. Dhaka mayor and BNP vice-president Sadeque Hossain Khoka will preside over the really, organised by the Dhaka Metropolitan BNP. Activists of the party started to come to the rally ground from midday. BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan, also the rally coordinator, said the meeting will be peaceful and alleged that activists were being barred in Gazipur, Narsingdi and Narayanganj from coming the rally. bdnews24.c
