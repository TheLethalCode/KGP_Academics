"Girondins Bordeaux expect to hear from the FFF on the question of the compensation linked to the release of their coach." Blanc, 44, became Bordeaux coach three years ago, leading them to a Ligue 1 and League Cup double least season. A World Cup winner with France in 1998, Blanc, who played for clubs including Barcelona, Olympique Marseille, Inter Milan and Manchester United, is nicknamed 'the President' for his leadership skills.

Domenech will lead the French team to the World Cup in South Africa next month and former sweeper Blanc will take over after the tournament with the task of trying to qualify Les Bleus for the Euro 2012 fi
