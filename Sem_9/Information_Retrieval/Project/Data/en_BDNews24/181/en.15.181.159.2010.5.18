<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 18 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini is set to be handed a four-million euro walkaway payment and replaced by Inter Milan's Jose Mourinho for next season, press reports in Spain claimed Tuesday. "Bye bye Pellegrini, 'Mou' is on his way," said the headline in Spanish daily El Mundo, one of several claiming that the exit of Chilean Pellegrini from the Santiago Bernabeu after just one season in charge is only days away.

"But right now I can tell you 100 percent that it's not true that I have one-and-a-half feet at Real. Quite the contrary, I'm very far from becoming the Real coach." Inter president Massimo Moratti said on Monday he was unsure of Mourinho's intentions after the final, and for the Spanish press that is synonymous with his arrival at Real.
