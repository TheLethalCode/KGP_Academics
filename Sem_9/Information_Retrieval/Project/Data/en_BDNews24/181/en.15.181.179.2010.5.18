 MADRID, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona are in talks to strengthen their championship-winning squad with Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Valencia striker David Villa, according to club vice-president Rafael Yuste. Talks with Valencia on Villa's transfer 'are on the right track', Yuste said in an interview with Catalan radio station Ona FM quoted by Spanish news agency EFE. Bringing Arsenal captain Fabregas back to Barca, where he was a youth player, was "more complicated because lengthy negotiations with his club lie ahead", Yuste added. "But both players want to come and that makes everything easier," he said.

"I don't think the club would want to sell me unless it was necessary." Yuste also hinted that French forward Thierry Henry could be on his way to a club in the United States.
