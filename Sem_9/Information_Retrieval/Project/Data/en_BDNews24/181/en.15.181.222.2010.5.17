 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked the government to explain why it should not direct enforcement of the House Rent Control Act. The cabinet minister, chief secretary of the prime minister, parliament secretary, law secretary and Dhaka City Corporation mayor were asked to respond within four months. Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed a petition with the High Court bench of justices Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Naima Haider on Apr 25. Advocate Manzil Morshed stood for the petitioner. The appeal said that there were several regulations in the House Rent Control Act that directed the owners to provide receipts and eviction notice to tenants. But owners increase rents according to their whim defying the law and even evict tenants without any prior notice, the statement said. Effective steps are also not being taken to ensure full implementation of the rental rates approved by the Dhaka City Corporation, it added. Earlier on Apr 15, the rights organisation served a legal notice on the government. According to the Consumers' Association of Bangladesh (CAB) data, in Dhaka the rents increased by 8.4 percent in 2003, 9.96 percent in 2004, 7.89 percent in 2005, 14.14 percent in 2006 and 21.48 percent in 2007. b
