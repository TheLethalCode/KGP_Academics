 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)Manzur Alam has secured BNP's support as the mayoral candidate in the Chittagong City Corporation elections slated for June 17. The former acting mayor told waiting journalists that he would be running for the mayor's office as a candidate of the Chittagong Unnayan Shangram Parishad. After almost an hour-long meeting with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and the opposition party's top brass from Chittagong, he made the comments at about 1.10am early on Tuesday. Chittagong metropolitan BNP chief Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury said the party will declare its nomination from Chittagong. When asked about BNP's nomination at around 2am, the former commerce minister said Khaleda had decided on the mayoral candidate. "We will make the official declaration later from Chittagong." A long time confidant of incumbent Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Alam, however, evaded questions whether he had joined BNP. Thrust into the limelight, Manzur waited for almost five hours outside the BNP chief's political office in Gulshan in a Pajero as she held a meeting through Monday evening that ended just after midnight. Long-serving councillor Alam, arriving in Dhaka on Monday afternoon, told bdnews24.com that the BNP chief had summoned him. "I am supposed to meet her at the Gulshan office in the evening," said Alam, who saw his relations with the mayor strained since the interim government's regime. The BNP standing committee held a 3.5-hour meeting on Sunday evening until 11:30pm following which Khaleda Zia sat in another more, intimate session with two top leaders from Chittagong. Alam has been involved with Awami League politics for a long time. Councillor for North Kattoli Ward (no 10), he filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. In the 2008 national elections, Alam ran for a Chittagong constituency as an independent candidate but lost. The last date for filing nominations of the June 17 CCC polls is May 20 and June 1 for withdrawals. The tenure of the current city council runs out on June 25 and incumbent Mohiuddin Chowdhury has already indicated his desire to seek an unprecedented fourth term in office.
