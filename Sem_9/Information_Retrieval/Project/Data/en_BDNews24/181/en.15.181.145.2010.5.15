 Rohan Ziad Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  The government is projecting the improved results in this years SSC and equivalent exams as a success. The 9 percent rise in the pass rate compared to the previous year was due to special efforts of the government, said the education minister on Saturday. However, scratch the surface of these statistics and you find another story  which should be more troubling for the government. This is because the 916,180 students who took the SSC exams under eight boards (not including those who took the Madrasa and the Technical boards) comprise only 18% of the original batch of students who were in Class II in 2001. According to the website of the primary and mass education ministry, in 2001  when the batch of students who took this years exams were in grade II  there was a total of 4,049,640 students enrolled in the country's primary schools Therefore, a staggering 82 percent of the students dropped out between 2001and 2010. By 2008, when these same students were in Class VIII, the total number had already shrank down to 1,155, 863. In the two years before the exams, a further 240,000 students had dropped out. Academicians say that the high dropout rate between the primary and secondary schools is caused mainly due to poverty, as well as due to problems in the system. "The prime reason for the dropout is the socio-economic condition," says Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, a professor of the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. Most of the students of the primary schools belong to the ultra-poor sections of the society, he said. "It's quite natural if they cannot continue with their schooling as it is not completely free," added Iqbal, also a noted writer and columnist. He pointed out that the education quality in primary schools is not enough to ensure successful completion of high school education. "Most of the students [of primary schools] cannot read or write Bengali properly or do simple math, let alone English." Iqbal said he thought that the introduction of Primary Education Terminal Examinations from 2009, would help address this problem. "This way the teachers would feel encouraged to provide a good education because in this case, the reputation of the school would be at stake," he added. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, co-chairman of the government's high-powered committee to formulate an education policy, echoed Zafar Iqbal saying that the main reason behind high drop out was poverty. "Furthermore, poor education quality provided by the teachers also contributes to the high level of drop out." Ahmad, also a former president of the Bangladesh Economic Association, said that more support programmes for school children like stipends, mid-day meals should be introduced to prevent dropouts. "It has been like this for years, it needs to be changed." Former caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan said that the problems of the educational system vary from one region to another. "For us, the main problem is that our educational system is too centralised." The existing system cannot keep track of the problems, which are specific to regions. "In a decentralised system it would have been easier to understand and address the problems." He also suggested introducing assistance programmes in the secondary schools similar to those at the primary level.
