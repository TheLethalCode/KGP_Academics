 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com)  Combined results of SSC and equivalent exams published on Saturday show that almost 80 percent candidates passed. This is an increase of about 9 percent compared to that of last year. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid announced the results at a press briefing on Saturday afternoon. Earlier at 11am, Nahid handed over copies of the SSC results to the prime minister at her office. This was the first time that the SSC exam questions followed a more creative format coming away from the previously followed multiple choice questions. Results are available on the education ministry website at http://www.educationboardresults.gov.bd. Of over 1.2 million candidates 627,672 were male and 578,347 were female. A total of 916,180 candidates appeared in the SSC exams under eight boards, 211,860 in Dakhil examinations under the Madrasa board while 77,979 students appeared under the Technical board. According to official statistics 960,492 candidates passed out of 1,206,019 who took the exams. This year, the number of schools with a 100 percent pass rate is 2,927 compared to last year's 2,726. Number of the educational institutions with no passes is 72 which is 23 less than last year. Referring to the higher number of candidates passing the exams Nahid said, "We initiated some steps to prevent drop-out of the students. This is the reason behind the boost in pass rate." Indicating the increased number of institutions with 100 percent pass rate, Nahid said this was a sign of improvement. "Our target is to gain 100 percent pass rate in all the institutions," he said. The minister added that for the first time ever, results were sent to schools through e-mails. The prime minister sent e-mails to two schools. A total of 15000 schools were sent results through e-mails. The creative format of questions has brought 'positive results' this year, said Nahid. "Maximum students are weak in Mathematics and English, which was the main cause of the low pass rate. This year, we asked teachers to give extra emphasis on these two subjects." The minister said that in Dhaka board 87.08 percent passed in English and 88.02 percent passed in Mathematics. A total of 62,134 students secured that highest grade point average of 5.
