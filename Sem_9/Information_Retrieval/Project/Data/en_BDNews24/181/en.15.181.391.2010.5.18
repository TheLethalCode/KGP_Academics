 Chittagong, May 18 (bdnews24.com)--A Chittagong BNP leader has alleged that Khaleda Zia was "misguided" when she selected the party's mayoral candidate for the City corporation polls slated for June 17. Shahadat Hossain, general secretary of Chittagong metropolitan chapter of the main opposition party and a mayoral nomination aspirant, made the allegation a day after his party picked Manzur Alam, formerly a close confidant of the incumbent mayor, as the mayoral candidate. Shahadat blamed Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury for misguiding party chief Khaleda into making the decision. Khosru told bdnews24.com that he did not "want to create a debate on this by making any comment." Speaking at a press conference in the port city on Tuesday, Shahadat said that though there was discontent among the local activists they would support Alam following the decision of the central committee. However, it was later learnt that a friend of Shahadat collected a nomination paper for him after the press conference. The deadline for submitting nominations is May 20 and for withdrawing a nomination is June 1. Alam, who has long been involved with the Awami League, is taking part in the election as a candidate for the Chittagong Unnayan Sangram Parisad. In the 2008 national elections, Alam ran for a Chittagong constituency as an independent candidate but lost. Shahadat alleged that Alam did not even have primary membership of the BNP and that during a meeting on the elections, the Chittagong leaders had proposed three names -- Amir Khosru, Gulam Dostogir Chowdhury and Shahdat Hossain. He said that Alam's name never came up. He suggested that the BNP could easily win in the polls if it picked a veteran leader of the party. Shahadat also claimed that the grassroots level leaders of 41 wards and 11 thanas of Chittagong were demanding an explanation for the decision, but Khosru was failing to give a satisfactory response. "He could have discussed the matter with people rather than showing an autocratic attitude," the BNP leader said. Manzur told reporters early on Tuesday that he had secured the nomination of BNP after a meeting with the BNP chairperson and the opposition party's top brass from Chittagong. bdnews24.com/m
