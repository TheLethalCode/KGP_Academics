 May 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Noujan Sramik Federation has ended its strike after it said that the government has agreed to meet some of its demands. However, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan has said that the federation's decision to end the strike shows that its programme was 'irational'. The federation went on strike on May 7 pressing for implementation of their 22-point charter. The federation leaders declared the withdrawal after discussion with the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water transport, Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton, at the secretariat on Saturday. The federation secretary Ashikul Islam confirmed bdnews24.com that the withdrawal was effective immediately and said, "The government has agreed to release arrested federation leaders, withdraw cases against them and review the new pay scale." Commenting that the strike has been withdrawn, the federation's acting president Zinnal Ali said, "The workers have resumed work from Saturday afternoon." However, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said at a press briefing in the BIWTA office that the decision to release the federation leaders, withdraw cases and review the new pay scale would only be taken after discussion with the labour and home ministers on Sunday. This group of water transport workers had been observing an indefinite strike since midnight of May 7 having rejected a new pay scale that the shipping minister, Shahjahan Khan, announced on the afternoon of the same day. The new pay scale was finalised in a tripartite meeting on May 6 among vessel owners, workers and the government. However, representatives of the Noujan Sramik Federation were not at the meeting. Despite wage increases between 50-100 percent under the new scale, the federation rejected it and called for the strike demanding a minimum raise of 300 percent. The federation president, Shah Alam, was arrested during the strike and cases were filed against more than a hundred water transport workers. Demands for their release and withdrawl of cases were added to the list of the federation's charter of demands. bdnews24.
