<TITLE> 'Frustrated' Younis demands suspension of ban </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, May 16 (bdnews24.com/AFP) --Frustrated former Pakistan cricket captain Younis Khan on Saturday demanded that his indefinite ban be suspended as the allegations against him were unfounded, his lawyer said The one-man tribunal of retired justice Irfan Qadir adjourned the hearing on Younis' appeal until May 29, while a similar appeal against a one-year ban on fellow former captain Shoaib Malik was deferred until May 22. "Younis is frustrated at the delay in hearing and has demanded the ban should be suspended with immediate effect," his lawyer Ahmed Qayyum told AFP. Younis along with another former captain Mohammad Yousuf was banned indefinitely on charges of 'infighting which resulted in a negative influence on the team'. Malik and Rana Naved-ul Hasan were banned for a year and fined two million rupees (24,000 dollars) on discipline breaches. Pakistan's Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi and Kamran Akmal were fined three million rupees (35,000 dollars) and placed on probation for six months, also on discipline violations. Umar Akmal was fined two million rupees. The penalties came after an evaluation committee investigated on and off-field problems on Pakistan team's tour of United Arab Emirates, New Zealand and Australia between November 2009 to February this year. Pakistan lost all three Tests, five one-day and a Twenty20 on their tour of Australia, prompting the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to investigate the defeats. Except for Yousuf, who retired from cricket in protest, all six penalised players have lodged appeals. The PCB last month appointed a one-man tribunal to hear the appeals. Qayyum criticised the working of the PCB. "As per the tribunal orders the PCB has yet to give us full documents and the documents given to us do not include audios and videos of Younis' statement before the evaluation committee," said Qayyum. "Similarly, we want to argue (against) all those people who have accused Younis of being 'arrogant and causing problems', an opportunity not given to us yet," said the lawyer. Qayyum also demanded the proceedings of the tribunal should be open to media cove
