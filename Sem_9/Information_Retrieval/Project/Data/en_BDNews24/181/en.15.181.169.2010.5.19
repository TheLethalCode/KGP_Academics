 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)--Police refute the opposition BNP's allegations that ruling Awami League activists have placed obstacles on roads to prevent its party activists from arriving at its rally in Dhaka on Wednesday. Kholilur Rahman, president of Kapasia chapter of the BNP, told bdnews24.com that buses were being obstructed on Fakir Majnu Shah Bridge in Kapasia and in Maouna crossing in Sripur. "Awami League activists stopped our vehicles by putting up a barrier on Fakir Majnu Shah Bridge," Rahman said and cited this as the reason why many Paltan ground-bound vehicles have failed to arrive. However, Jamaluddin Mir, officer in charge of Kapasia Police Station, told bdnew24.com there were no barricades on the bridge; rather "a vehicle broke down on the bridge causing disruption in movement". Rahman also alleged that at about 11:30am leaders of Sramik League attacked their motorcade at Maouna crossing and beat up BNP activists. Nazmul Hasan Bhuiyan, officer in charge of Sripur Police Station, confirmed that activists of both the BNP and Sramik League, a pro-government labour organisation, were involved in chasing each other but said that the incident was short-lived. BNP leaders also alleged that hundreds of buses were stuck in Rupganj, Tarabo Bishwa Road, Gauchhia and Araihajar areas due to the barricades put up by government supporters. Rupganj Police chief Forkan Sikder, however, rejected BNP allegations and claimed that the situation was under control and that no barricades were put up anywhere. Allegations made by president of Narayanganj district BNP Taimur Alam Khandaker that vehicles headed for Dhaka were halted by trucks parked haphazardly on the road could not be checked with the police. Similiarly, claims made by the Naranganj district BNP president that a procession of BNP had come under attack at Chandmari New Court in Narayanganj, where five people, including BNP legal affairs secretary Monowar Hossain Selim, were injured could not yet be corroborated. BNP leaders in Gazipur, Narayanganj and Narsingdhi have also claimed that the administration had set up mobile courts on the road to check paperwork simply as a way of stopping vehicles bound for the rally. Local residents have said that there was a 5-km-long traffic jam on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway from Kanchpur to Narsingdi in Sonargaon Upazila. bdnews24.com/cor
