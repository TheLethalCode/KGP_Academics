<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 15 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP will hold the government responsible for any incident over its planned rally in Dhaka on May 19. The opposition party's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Saturday that his party would not accept any responsibility of what he hinted might be untoward incidents if the government tried to create obstructions. He told the reporters on Saturday, "Our grand rally will be peaceful." "The government is yet to solve the issue of temporary power supply at our venue." Delwar said he hoped that the government will not create a hassle over the opposition's public meeting. On Friday BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan alleged that the Dhaka Power Distribution Company had rejected an application to supply adequate power for big screens and sound systems needed for the Dhaka rally. BNP chief Khaleda Zia has already addressed divisional grand rallies at Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Batisal. She is expected to declare the programmes for a strong anti-government campaign from the grand rally at Dhaka. bdnew
