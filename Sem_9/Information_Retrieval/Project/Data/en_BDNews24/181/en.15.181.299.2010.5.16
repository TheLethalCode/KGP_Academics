 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday stayed the construction of a BIWTA 'Recreation Centre' on the river Buriganga at Kamrangirchar area of the city. The bench of justices H M Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain gave the order based on a writ petition filed by the rights organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The court also asked the government to explain, within three weeks, why the construction should not be declared illegal and subsequently ordered to be moved elsewhere. The shipping secretary, BIWTA chairman, directors, chief engineer, executive engineer, Dhaka deputy commissioner and the director of DoE were told to respond. Advocate Manzil Morshed, who argued for the rights organisation, said that the HC had given quite a number of directives since June 25 last year to protect the rivers Buriganga, Turag, Shitalakhya and Balu. "But, BIWTA, according to a national daily, is implementing a project on the river, which violates the court orders." He also said that no one was above the law and therefore the construction should be termed 'illegal'. bdne
