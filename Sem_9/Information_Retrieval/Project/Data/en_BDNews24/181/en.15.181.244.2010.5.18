 Fardipur, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Interns at Fardipur Medical College Hospital joined their work after two days of strike. They went on strike from 8pm on Sunday after a patient's relatives assaulted a doctor. President of the interns' council, Hridoy Barman, told bdnews24.com that they have started working from 1:30pm after the authorities assured them of meeting all their demands. After the failure of the first negotiation meeting on Monday the authorities sat with the strikers on Tuesday again to break the deadlock. Doctors said that leaders of the ruling Awami League were also present at the meeting. Barman said that they got promises from the hospital authority of introducing passes for visitors and increased security with police and RAB. He also said that they were informed that the authorities were considering deploying Ansar on the campus to ensure overall security. Superintendent of the hospital Gurudas Sikdar said that hospital function returned to normal as the interns joined work. bdnews2
