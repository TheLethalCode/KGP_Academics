 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said that there was "nothing wrong" with the government's appointment of Abul Matin, who recently resigned as the chief of the agency investigating war crimes trials. The minister on Sunday said, "It was not wrong to appoint Abdul Matin to the investigative agency. "He resigned willingly when an accusation arose against him," he told reporters at his office. Matin's resignation came days after a government advisor alleged that Matin was an activist of the Islami Chhatra Shangha (ICS), student wing of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. ICS members have been accused of taking part in war crimes during 1971, in particular relating to the abduction of intellectuals mainly on Dec 14-15, 1971, hours before the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16. Matin has however strenuously denied any involvement in Islamist politics. On Mar 25 this year, the government formed a tribunal to try people alleged to have committed war crimes during the 1971 independence war. On the same day the seven-member investigation agency was also constituted, with Matin as its chief. In reply to another query, the minister said that more time will be required before charges will be laid against those suspected of war crimes. Last month, he had said they would happen this month. "I have not been able to inform myself about the agency's activities since my return from abroad," he added. Shafique also told reporters that the hundred year-old jail code will be updated to improve the situation there. Comparing the situation in Bangladesh to Germany and Britain from where he had just come, he said "Many people in our country are held in jail for a long time simply due to the lengthy trial process. "Sometimes those detained in jail fail to meet their relatives or their lawyers to push for proceedings to take place." He also said that in Germany and Britain, many cases are resolved before legal proceedings have to start. The police and community leaders often act as intermediaries, he added. "Many people will be freed from cases if such a process could be adopted in our country," the minister hoped. bd
