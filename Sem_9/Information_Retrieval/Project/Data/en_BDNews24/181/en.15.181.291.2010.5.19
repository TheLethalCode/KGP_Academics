 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury now wants to know who will be the acting mayor when he resigns before filing his nomination paper. He had previously asked for 'specific instructions' from the Election Commission. Mohiuddin told bdnews24.com on Tuesday night that he had written to the Commission and the government on Monday seeking a decision on the stand-in mayor. "I have sent a letter to Election Commission and the government wanting to know how should I resign from mayoral position and hand over charge," he said by telephone around 8pm. "But I have not been told anything on the matter." He declared at a meeting in the port city on Monday that he would submit his nomination paper on May 20 for the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls. He further said that he had no objection to resign if the Election Commission so required. "I will accept all EC decisions." Earlier, the Commission had stated that the incumbents would have to resign from their current positions before the elections. But the mayor's reply had suggested that he would not step down without a more concrete directive from the Commission. Mohiuddin has already indicated that he will be seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure. The current CCC tenure expires on June 25. Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Tuesday noon, "[Mohiuddin] will have to resign and hand over charges to the panel mayor as required by the law." But no instruction will be sent to him on the handover in the response of Monday's letter. When asked about Mohiuddin's claim, returning officer of CCC polls Jesmin Tuli told bdnews24.com around 9pm that the Commission had given reply to Mohiuddin's letter with specific directives and that the mayor's personal secretary had confirmed its receipt. The copy of the Commission's letter had been sent to the local government ministry, she said. In line with the Local Government (City Corporation) Act 2009, the Commission sent a letter to Mohiuddin on May 13 with the directives for resignation. Mohiuddin had also copied the chief election commissioner, local government secretary and returning officer for CCC polls in the letter. The Commission letter undersigned by deputy secretary (election) on May 13 stated that incumbent mayor must resign before submitting nomination if he wanted to run in the election. Sources close to ruling Awami League confirmed that Mohiuddin would get party's green signal. Awami League joint general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif told bdnews24.com that it had not taken any decision as it was a non-party election. "Decision will be finalised in consultation with the leaders at the grassroots level after prime minister Sheikh Hasina returns home," he said. A highly placed local government ministry official, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday night that the law has clear directives about resignation and transfer of charges. A letter has already been prepared. It will be sent to Mohiuddin if the minister says so. The Commission officials said that the letter cites the definition of 'beneficial', according to the Local Government (City Corporation) Act 2009 and that the High Court ruling in 2009 has termed the mayor post as 'beneficial'. bdnews24.co
