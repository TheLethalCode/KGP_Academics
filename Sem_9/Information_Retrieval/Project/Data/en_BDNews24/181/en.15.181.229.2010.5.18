 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com) The home ministry has approved settlement of five sensational cases. The 67th meeting of the monitoring cell for deciding the fate of different cases, headed by home minister Sahara Khatun, gave the go-ahead on Tuesday. The minister said the cell has settled 345 such cases since its formation. Investigating officers of the five cases would soon press charges in courts, she added. The five cases are-murder cases of Mafizur Rahman of Lohagarha in Narail, Lokman Hakim of Shahrasti in Chandpur, an unidentified woman in Dhaka's Sutrapur and of Mahbubur Rahman Liton of Jatrabari. The government also has decided to bring three other cases including murder of police sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy, Rajshahi University student Faruk and of Adabar's Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Ramiz. Police and RAB so far have arrested two Zakir Hossain for their alleged involvement in Gautam's killing. Sahara was asked whether the cell will consider the murder cases of private television channel ATN Bangla's cameraman Shafikul Islam Mithu and assistant sub-inspector Mizan. She said these cases would not be included in the list as they were already being investigated. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, RAB director general Khandaker Hassan Mahmood, among others, were present at the meeting.
