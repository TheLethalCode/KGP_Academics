 Dhaka, May 16 (bdnews24.com) --Two BNP stalwarts from Chittagong have sat with chief Khaleda Zia behind closed doors after a two-and-a-half hour meeting of policymaking standing committee late on Sunday night. Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, former commerce minister, and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, an influential leader of the party, were meeting with Khaleda until midnight. The meeting of the BNP top brass, which began at 9pm, decided that the opposition party would take part in the Chittagong City Corporation elections slated for June 17. Standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman told bdnews24.com after the meeting that BNP believed in elections. Regarding the CCC polls, he said, "We will take part." The policy-level meeting will discuss the planned campaign to unseat the government and the Chittagong city elections, another standing committee member, Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com before the meeting. Mahbubur Rahman, however, said that the mayoral candidate was yet to be decided. He said Khaleda would pick the candidate herself. The closed-door meeting, it was said, would attempt to finalise a candidate for the upcoming CCC polls.
