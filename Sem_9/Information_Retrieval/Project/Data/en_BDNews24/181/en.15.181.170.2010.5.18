 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has urged authorities to ensure safe passage for voters in the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation election. He gave the directives at a joint meeting of law enforcers, ahead of the polls scheduled on June 17, at the Election Commission office on Monday. The two-hour long meeting, beginning at 3pm, was attended by election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, IG Noor Mohammad, RAB chief Hasan Mahmud Khandaker, BDR's Lt Col Md Nasimul Alam, DGFI's Col Md Tarikul Islam, principle staff officer of the armed forces Lt Gen Abdul Wadud among others. The CEC, after the meeting, told journalists: "We want a peaceful election in Chittagong." "Until now, we don't see any problem with law and order." He said that measures were underway so that the voters could cast their votes without fear. Four check-posts have already been installed in Chittagong ahead of the polls, he added. Regarding the deployment of forces, he said some 20,000 members of different law enforcing agencies would be on duty. There would be 22 members from police, Ansar and VDP at the risky polling centres, and 20 for those deemed safe. Two companies of BDR personnel will be deployed in the entire area between June 9 and June 16. Six companies of the army would be on the field from June 14 to 18, one each under every police station area covering the city corporation. They would carry out duties as a strike force and a reserve force accompanied by judicial magistrates. Between June 3 and June 18, there will also be 41 executive magistrates operating in the area. The CEC ordered the magistrates to punish every offence through summary trial instantly. When asked, Huda said, "Polling agents of the centres must be the voters of that area and they have to take permission from the presiding officer before leaving." "They must carry their identity cards too," he added. Meanwhile, the commission decided to introduce electronic voting machine (EVM), for the first time in any election in Bangladesh, in ward 21 during the CCC polls. The decision was taken at Monday's meeting, an EC official told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), manufacturer of the EVM, was asked to assist installing the machines in 79 booths under the ward. bdnews
