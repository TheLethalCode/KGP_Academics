 Chittagong, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is likely to resign by Thursday before submitting his nomination paper. Mohiuddin declared at a meeting in the port city on Monday that he would submit his nomination paper for the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation polls on May 20. He further said that he had no objection to resign if the Election Commission so required. "I will accept all EC decisions." He said, "There has been much discussion regarding my resignation. But I'm not tempted to cling on to it." Earlier the EC had stated that the incumbents would have to resign from their current positions before the elections. But the mayor's reply had suggested that he would not step down without a more concrete directive from the commission. Mohiuddin has already indicated that he will be seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure as mayor in the election scheduled on June 17. The current CCC tenure expires on June 25. The last date for filing nomination papers is June 20. The BNP has decided to nominate Manzur Alam, a long time confidant of Mohiuddin and also a former acting mayor as its mayoral candidate. Chief election commissioner Shamsul Huda, regarding the subject of the letter, sent to Mohiuddin, said, "[Mohiuddin] wanted clear declarations from us and we did so once on Sunday and again today (Monday)." Huda said, "The issue of resignation in these cases is clearly settled by the local government law. He should resign before submitting the nomination paper." The meeting in Chittagong, to mark the homecoming day of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, turned into an election publicity meeting. Metropolitan AL vice president and a Chittagong MP Nurul Islam BSC, also known as Mohiuddin's rival, and presidents of Chittagong north and south units Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury and Mosharraf Hossain did not attend the programme. Regarding his candidature, Mohiuddin said, "I'll go for the election following the decision taken by the party's central wing, either under the banner of Nagorik Committee or the party." But he did not hint about the party's decision. According to presidium member Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser, Mohiuddin will be nominated for the CCC elections centrally. "Since many of the metropolitan leaders were absent, nothing can be said without a hint from the prime minister." An election management committee, consisting 501 members, headed by former MP Ishaque Mia, was formed at the meeting. bdnews24.
