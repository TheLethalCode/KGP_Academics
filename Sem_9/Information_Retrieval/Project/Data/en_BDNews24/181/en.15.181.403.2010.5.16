<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May16 (bdnews24.com)  The government will impose strict restrictions on public movement along the border at night, home minister Sahara Khatun said on Sunday. The ministry has already asked Bangladesh Rifles and the local administration to take immediate measures to enforce its decision. The minister informed the media after attending an inter-ministerial meeting on Bangladesh-India border on Sunday. State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku and representatives from different ministries were also present in the meeting. The decision was apparently taken to address Indian allegations that the BSF fire on their own citizens as they cross borders at night. "To reduce such incidents, a decision was taken to restrict public movement at night along the border points," Sahara said. She did not specify whether Section 144 would be imposed in those areas. "BDR and police have been directed to take strict measures over public movement," she said. The meeting also called for an increase in public awareness and the formation of a committee to stop smuggling. Smuggling generally takes place at night  which is when the shootings tend to occur. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar said, "Even if we make announcements through loudspeakers, the government can not be responsible if the people move at night and something happens," he added. Sahara also said a decision had been taken to create a coastal unit, controlled by the BDR, on the river Roymongal at Satkhira. The secretary said Bangladesh and India share 17,158 acres of enclave land of which Bangladesh has 10,048 acres under its control The meeting also decided to request the Indian government to shut down the Phensidyle factories adjacent to the Bangladesh border. The minister said there are some Phensidyle factories across the border. "We protested earlier too. Now we will ask the Indian government to relocate the factories immediately." The minister said the meeting had discussed issues relating to Bangladesh-India enclaves, land dispute, and the delay in implementing the 1974 Indira-Mujib agreement. "As per the agreement, no country can construct any installation within 150 yards of the zero point along the borders. "But India, in some places, has constructed barbed fencing within 150 yards of the border." She remarked that they were trying to cross the boundary on geographical ground. She however, did not elaborate what that meant. The minister said "We will hold bilateral talks on the issue". Sahara also said the joint border working group's meeting would discuss the matter, which would help implement the 1974 agreement and the memorandum of understanding prime minister Hasina signed with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh during her recent visit to New Delhi. BDR director general Maj Gen Rafiqul Islam said, "We do not want to think about the past. We are working, considering the Indira-Mujib agreement as our guideline. "We will discuss the issues at the meeting of the Joint Boundary Working Group, likely to take place within one or two months," he said. bdnews24.c
