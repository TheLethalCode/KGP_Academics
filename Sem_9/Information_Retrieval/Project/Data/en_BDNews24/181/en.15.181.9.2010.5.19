 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) The Election Commission has warned BNP's Chittagong mayor candidate M Manzurul Alam for violating electoral code of conduct even before he collected his nomination paper. The Commission on Wednesday sent a letter to the BNP nominee. Former acting mayor and long-time councilor of Chittagong City Corporation, Manzur got the green light from the main opposition party on May 17. Supporters of Manzur allegedly took out a procession on Jamalkhan road in Chittagong on May 18 after a meeting. Farhad Hossain, district election officer and CCC assistant returning officer, said the procession was in breach of the code of conduct even though he was yet to collect his nomination paper. "We came to know about it from the media. As a consequence, we sent a letter to him warning him against any further violation," Hossain told bdnews24.com. No campaign is allowed before 21 days of the June 17 election. Manzur collected his nomination paper at 3pm on Wednesday. The deadline for filing nominations is May 20 and withdrawals June 1. Ruling Awami League's incumbent mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office. Manzur, involved with Awami League politics for a long time, is the councillor of CCC ward number 10. He filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. He ran in the ninth parliament polls as an independent candidate from a Chittagong seat and finished third. b
