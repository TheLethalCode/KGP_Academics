<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Stock Exchange made a dual record on Monday as both the single day turnover and the benchmark index touched a new high. The premier bourse's turnover amounted to Tk 23.05 billion only two trading sessions after hitting a record-breaking all-time high of Tk 22.82 billion on Wednesday. Huge selling in banks, non-bank financial institutions and energy shares contributed to the high turnover. The benchmark general index or the DGEN closed at its highest ever on 5839.15 points rising by a meager 0.44 percent, breaking the pervious high of 5828.38 points on February. Since Monday, the market came out from a long bearish trend on the news of the finance ministry's green signal to convert face value of shares from Tk 100 to Tk 10. Market participators, however, felt that the decision of a uniform face value will not change the market. "It [change of face value] will cause a psychological impact on share prices," said a fund manager and added that the Bangladeshi market is mainly driven by sentiments. "There will be no change in the fundamentals or financials of companies." The market's momentum last week carried into this week as well, with banking and energy securities leading the rally of dominating the turnover board. Banks ended mixed due to selling pressure after gaining 3.67 percent on average the previous day. Profit-taking caused all the bigwigs in fuel and energy to drop except Khulna Power Company Ltd (KPCL), after the sector gained 3.21 percent on Sunday. KPCL has announced 10 percent cash dividend and 15 percent stock dividend. Insurers ended mixed while mutual funds lost as investors went to rein in profits out of the gains it experienced last week. Market heavyweight Grameenphone, the lone telecoms issue, gained 0.94 percent. Out of the traded 245 issues, 147 declined, 92 gained and six remained unchanged
