 TOKYO, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's government came under fire in domestic media on Tuesday for its handling of a worsening outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the latest headache for unpopular Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama with an election just months away. Voter doubts about Hatoyama's leadership have already slashed his ratings to around 20 percent ahead of an upper house election his party must win to avoid policy paralysis as Japan struggles to keep a recovery on track while reining in its huge debt.

Japan suspended beef exports on April 20 after three cows were of suspected of being infected with the disease, the first cases since 2000. Domestic media said local officials had checked a farm in the area some three weeks earlier but dismissed the possibility that water buffaloes there had the disease. The prefectural official said the animals had not shown the usual symptoms. Agriculture Minister Hirotaka Akamatsu also came under fire for travelling abroad during Japan's "Golden Week" holidays in late April-early May. Some media also suggested the government was distracted by a feud over a US airbase on the southern Japan island of Okinawa, with Hatoyama's perceived mishandling of the matter contributing to his sinking support rates. "It would be hard to say that the official response has been sufficient," the Yomiuri newspaper said in an editor
