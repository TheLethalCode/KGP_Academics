 Khulna, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan has ordered authorities to take legal steps against seven leaders of Noujan Sramik Federation's Khulna unit for leading a water transport strike. The order came on Friday morning from a meeting at Khulna's deputy commissioner office on the seventh day of the strike. Noujan Sramik Federation started an indefinite strike on May 7 to press home their 22-point charter of demand, including raising their wages. They also rejected the new wage structure finalised on May 6. The minister, in the meeting, said that launch communications had returned to normal though there was no resolution of it in Khulna. Some of the water transport workers called the strike to embarrass the government and they are causing chaos across the country, he added. Khan ordered the deputy commissioner to take steps against the federation's Khulna unit's joint president Baharul Islam, Kashem Master, Delwar, Ali Asgar, Ali Akbar, Didar and Jahangir for inciting workers to call the strike. The minister also asked for the formation of a committee headed by Khulna city corporation mayor Talukdar Abdul Khalek to normalise launch communication. The minister went to Khulna by road and met with the Khulna mayor, and RAB, police, district administration officials and the launch owners. At the meeting, he mentioned the extension of the deadline for joining work to Friday afternoon and urged workers to reject the strike. Khan on Wednesday termed the strike politically motivated and asked the workers to join their respective works by Thursday afternoon or face cancellation of their professional licence. Mayor Khalek, deputy commissioner Jamshed Ahmad Khandakar, Bagerhat district Awami League's general secretary Kamruzzaman Tuku, Khulna city Awami League's general secretary Mizanur Rahman Mizan, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority's (BIWTA) owners groups' president Wahiduzzaman Khan Pintu and its general secretary Saiful Islam were present in the meeting. bdnews2
