The Election Commission has already sent a letter to that effect to Mohiuddin, chief election commissioner Shamsul Huda told reporters on Monday. Mohiuddin Chowdhury, the incumbent Chittagong mayor has already indicated that he will be seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure as mayor in the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation election scheduled on June 17.
