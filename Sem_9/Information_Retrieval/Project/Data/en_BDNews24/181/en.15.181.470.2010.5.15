<TITLE> Hussey takes Australia to final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gros Islet, St Lucia, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Micheal Hussey inspired the greatest escape in Twenty20 international history to pull Australia back from the brink and stun a fabulous Pakistan by three wickets to reach the final of World Twenty20 on Friday. Hussey launched a thrilling counter-attack to hammer a swashbuckling 60 off only 24 balls at the Beausejour Stadium. He whacked spinner Saeed Ajmal for three stunning sixes and a four off consecutive balls in the final over, to earn his team a dramatic win in the second semi-final. Earlier, brothers Kamran and Umar Akmal both scored fifties as defending champions set Australia an imposing 192 to win. Australia, who looked down and out, eventually made 197 for seven with one ball to go in the match of the tournament so far. They will face England, who beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the first semi-final, in Sunday's final in Barbados. Man of the Match Hussey hit six sixes in total and shared a 34-run hope-reviving stand with Cameron White who smashed 43 off 31 deliveries including five sixes. A shell-shocked Pakistan, for their part, knocked off the Aussie top order with little on the board and appeared favourites when the game went to the wire in the 20th over. But Australia found a saviour in even the most unlikely of circumstances as Hussey played one of the greatest T20 innings ever seen. Teenage left-arm fast bowler Mohammed Aamer took out dangerman David Warner (0) with the second ball of the chase before getting the scalp of the other opener, Shane Watson (16) in his second over. Watson and Brad Haddin (25) briefly revived the Australians by taking 15 from the over of Abdul Razzaq, Haddin and Michael Clarke took their side to 53-2 after the six powerplay overs but Haddin was drawn out of his crease expertly by slow left-armer Abdur Rehman and easily stumped, leaving the required rate at almost 11 per over. Kamran's outstanding match continued as he smartly whipped off the bails when Clarke lunged at one from Afridi in the next over. White then struck three sixes in four balls off Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez as the requirement became 100 from 49 balls, promptly reduced by six as David Hussey launched Hafeez over long-off. Australia's unlucky number struck as with 87 needed Hussey got a leading edge to give Rehman a simple return catch but a 90 metre six from White gave Australia a glimmer of hope with 70 needed from the final five overs. Mike Hussey then hit successive sixes as Afridi dropped short and astonishingly the pressure appeared to be back on Pakistan. But White hit a low full toss from Aamer straight to long-off in the 17th over and four balls later, the wily spinner Saaed Ajmal drew Smith out of his crease to allow Kamran another stumping. The indefatigable Hussey pulled his third six to leave 34 from the final 12 balls then managed to flick the final ball of the penultimate over for four, leaving 18 from the last six, bowled by Ajmal. After Johnson gave Hussey the strike with a single, however, victory seemed inevitable as the next two balls were thumped into the legside for six and Hussey won the match with his sixth maximum. In an innings that began with a Dirk Nannes maiden, opener Kamran made exactly 50 before big-hitting younger brother Umar followed up with a blistering 56 not out as Pakistan made 191 for six. Pakistan, sent in by Australia captain Michael Clarke after rain delayed the scheduled start and threatened to bring the Duckworth-Lewis system, thought to favour the side batting second, into play, made a fine start. Australia beat Pakistan by 34 runs in a first round group clash here on May 2. Kamran and left-hander Salman Butt (32) shared a first-wicket stand of 82 as Australia's pace trio of Nannes, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson failed to make an early breakthrough. That gave Pakistan the platform to cash in against Australia's second-string bowlers with all-rounder Shane Watson's two overs costing 26 runs and leg-spinner Steven Smith conceding 23 from two. Even Australia's normally fine fielding became ragged by the end, with usually tidy keeper Brad Haddin conceding 10 byes in an extras total of 20. Nannes's second over saw the match's first boundaries when Kamran Akmal, stepping away to leg, lofted him high over the covers. Next ball Akmal drove Nannes straight down the ground for another four. Butt then twice square cut Tait for two boundaries in as many balls. Akmal then pulled Tait down to fine leg as 13 runs came in the fourth over. First change Johnson, like Nannes a left-arm quick, was then carved high over point by Butt. At the end of the six-over powerplay, Pakistan were 40 without loss. It was then that Clarke turned to Smith and his third ball was edged over short third man for four by Akmal. But a far cleaner strike off the bowler's fifth delivery saw Akmal clear long-off with a six as Pakistan took 15 runs off the over. Smith was replaced after an over by Watson but his first ball back was driven for a huge straight six by Akmal. Akmal, giving himself room, then cover-drove the fifth ball of the over from the all-runder for four and, off the last, cut the medium-pacer for another boundary to complete a fine fifty, his fifth at this level, off just 32 balls with two sixes and six fours. But Akmal was out for exactly 50 after David Warner, running round from the extra-cover boundary, took a fine diving catch off Johnson. At the halfway mark Pakistan were well-placed for a large total at 85 for one and it, seemed that, at the very least, this would now be a closer match than the first round group fixture between the side that Australia won by 34 runs on this ground. After Butt was out, Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi and Khalid Latif both fell cheaply but it scarcely mattered as 106 runs came in the second 10 overs. Umar smashed Johnson for two enormous sixes, the second a crunching pull over midwicket that saw him to fifty in just 32 balls. With report from AFP
