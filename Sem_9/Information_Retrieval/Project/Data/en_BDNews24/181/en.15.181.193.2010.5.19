 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)--- The Police Criminal Investigation Department missed its 13th BDR mutiny investigation report submission deadline on Wednesday. Most recently the department failed to meet the deadline of April 21. AKM Enamul Haque, a chief metropolitan magistrate, scheduled June 30 as the next date of submission to submit the probe report on the penal code offences that were committed during the BDR mutiny that occurred at the Dhaka Pilkhana on February 25 & 26, 2009. The mutiny left around 70 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary border security force, dead. Abdul Kahar Akhand, a special superintendent of CID, is investigating the case. The case was initially filed with Lalbagh Police Station for murder, loot and arson, but was subsequently transferred to the New Market Police Station. In all 2,264 BDR soldiers and another 34 people, not professionally affiliated with the BDR, have been arrested in the case - including former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu and Awami League leader Torab Ali. Among the arrested, 2,240 people were taken into remand for questioning and, so far, 533 have given their statements to the court. Later 36 more BDR members and two civilians were arrested. Ten other have given confessional statement. Any trials that come out of the investigation will be in addition to those taking place for mutiny in the special BDR court. bdne
