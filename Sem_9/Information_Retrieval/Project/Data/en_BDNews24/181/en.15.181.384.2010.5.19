 Pabna, May 19 (bdnews24.com)An Awami League MP of Pabna reportedly assaulted a railway stationmaster early on Wednesday, as he was not given a ticket for a deluxe cabin, police said. Train movement remained suspended for an hour after the incident. According to Ishwardi Railway Police, Shamsur Rahman Sharif Dilu, the MP for Pabna-4 constituency, had sent one of his men to buy a 'deluxe' ticket for him. However, the man failed to manage the ticket and bought a general ticket instead. Ishwardi Railway Police chief Shyamal Chandra Pal said when the MP reached the station around 2am and realised that he did not have a ticket for the deluxe room. He became furious and assaulted the stationmaster, Abdur Rashid, and the Sundarban Express guard, Amir Afzal Ali. A seat was hurriedly arranged for him in the deluxe room, the police chief added. Senior officials of Bangladesh Railway have been informed of the matter, said Pal. The Bangladesh Guard Council has protested the incident. The council's president, Md Afjal Hossain, told bdnews24.com that such incident is in no way acceptable from a public representative. The MP was not available for comment. bdnews
