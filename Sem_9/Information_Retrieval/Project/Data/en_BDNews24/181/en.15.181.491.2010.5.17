 Faridpur, May17 (bdnews24.com) -- Interns at Fardipur Medical College Hospital continued their strike for the second day on Monday to press home their seven-point demand, including arrest of those responsible for assaulting a doctor. They went on strike from 8 pm on Sunday after a patient's relatives assaulted a doctor. Interns said that the strike is continuing on Monday as a meeting with the hospital authorities failed to reach a resolution. "We've gone for indefinite strike as authorities did not take any initiatives to fulfil our demands even though they assured us earlier of doing so," intern physician council president Hridoy Barman told bdnews24.com. He said they would wait until 10am on Tuesday to see what the authorities do about the demands. "If the demands are not met we will announce our next programme." Their demands include restriction on free movement of patients' relatives and agents (dalal), setting up of police camp on the campus, and buying new ambulances. They have also included demands for construction of a hostel for interns, improvement of the hospital's isolation ward, and stop internship of students from private medical colleges at the hospital. Superintendent of the hospital Gurudas Sikdar said a case had been filed against the attackers. He said they had not called off their strike although the authorities assured them of fulfilling their demands by turn. bdne
