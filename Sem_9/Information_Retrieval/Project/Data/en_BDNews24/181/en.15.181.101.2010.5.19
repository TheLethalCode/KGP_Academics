In an immediate reaction, AL joint general secretary Mahbub-ul-Alam Hanif said people would protest if the BNP looks to destabilise the country. He claimed that BNP had not been able to develop the power sector, "but they want to go for a strike pretending to put the blame on us." Hanif said, "We believe in democratic programmes."
