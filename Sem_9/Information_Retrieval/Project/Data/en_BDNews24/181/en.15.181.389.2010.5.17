 Manikganj, May 17 (bdnews24.com)  At least 15 people were injured in a clash between activists of the ruling Awami League and its associate organisation Juba League at Daulatpur upazila in Manikganj on Monday noon, police said. Those who took part said that the clash which took place at around midday occurred over how money given to elected representatives for development projects, including that for 'test relief', should be divided between supporters of Awami League's upazila unit general secretary Faridur Islam and Juba League's general secretary Humayun Kabir Shaon. Both sides used sticks and sharp weapons, the police said adding they later brought the situation under control. Daulatpur police chief Shawkat Hossain told bdnews24.com that five, among the injured, had been admitted to Daulatpur Upazila Health Complex. The five were identified as assistant general secretary Anisur Rahman Titu, 42, of upazila Juba League, Jobon Khan, 32, Abdul Hai, 34, Abdul Hakim, 38, Sumon Miah, 32. Upazila Awami League president AKM Azizul Haq, however, denied that the groups clashed over sharing of the money of test relief and food for work programmes. He said it was because of their internal conflicts. In protest against the clash, a procession, led by Daulatpur Upazila vice-chairman Aminur Rahman, was taken out at around 1pm. JOURNALIST ASSAULTED A journalist, upazila correspondent of the daily Amar Desh Jalal Uddin Dipu, was assaulted allegedly by Juba League and Chhatra League men as he went to glean news of the clash. bdne
