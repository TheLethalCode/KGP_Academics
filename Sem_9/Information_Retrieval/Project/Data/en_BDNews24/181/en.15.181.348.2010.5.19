 KARACHI, May 19 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi on Wednesday urged fans to back the team after the defending champions' semi-final finish in the World Twenty20, saying public support would spur the squad on. "I am proud of the team, which played as a unit," said Afridi, who led Pakistan in the competition won by England. "I would request fans to support us because we have seen difficult times in cricket and only unity can help us," said Afridi upon the team's return from the West Indies.

Yousuf retired from cricket in protest. Appeals from Younis and Malik are pending with a one-man tribunal of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Pakistan now feature in the four-nation Asia Cup in Sri Lanka from June 15-24, before playing two Twenty20 and two Tests against Australia and four Tests and five one-day matches against England -- all in England.
