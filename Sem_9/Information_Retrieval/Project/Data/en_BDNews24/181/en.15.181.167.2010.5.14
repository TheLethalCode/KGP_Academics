<TEXT>
 Gros Islet, St Lucia, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Pakistan rode on two swashbuckling half-centuries from Akmal brothers to score 191 for six in 20 overs against Austrlia in the second semi-final of the ICC World Twenty20 at the Beausejour Stadium on Friday. Opener Kamran Akmal made a scintillating 50 off 34 balls to put up 82 for the first wicket with Salman Butt (30 not out). Younger brother Umar played gen of an innings to remain unbeaten on 56 off 34 balls. Australian captain Micheal Clarke won the toss and decided to bowl in overcast conditions to give his pace bowlers better chance to make early inroads. Overnight rain and persistent showers through the day delayed the start of the match on the spin-friendly surface. With more rain expected, batting second could become more advantageous. Australia were unchanged from the side that knocked hosts the West Indies out of the tournament with a six-wicket win here on Tuesday. Defending champions Pakistan were also unchanged from the team that defeated South Africa by 11 runs, at Beausejour on Monday. Rain delayed the scheduled 11am local time (1500GMT) toss by 40 minutes. However, organisers have given themselves an additional two hours in which to complete this match, which means that not until approximately 1.30pm (1730GMT) will the fixture start being reduced from a 20 overs per side contest if the semi-final has not already started by then. Should no result at all be possible because of bad weather, Australia will be in the final as they have won more matches at the tournament than Pakistan. The teams have already met once in this competition, with Australia beating Pakistan by 34 runs in a first round group clash here on May 2. Whoever wins this match will face England in Sunday's final at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, after Paul Collingwood's side convincingly defeated Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the first semi-final at Beausejour here on Thursday. Teams Australia: David Warner, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin (wkt), Michael Clarke (capt), David Hussey, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait, Dirk Nannes Pakistan: Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Mohammad Hafeez, Shahid Afridi (capt), Umar Akmal, Misbah-ul-Haq, Khalid Latif Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Mohammad Aamer, Saeed Ajmal Umpires: Billy Doctrove (WIS) and Ian Gould
