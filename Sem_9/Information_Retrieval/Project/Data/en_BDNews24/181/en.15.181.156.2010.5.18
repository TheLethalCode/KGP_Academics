 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The benchmark index of Dhaka Stock Exchange touched a new high again on Tuesday, only a day after hitting an all-time high. The premier bourse's general index or the DGEN rose 37 points or 0.64 percent to end on 5876.55 points, riding on shares of banks and blue chip issues. The DSE-20 index, which keeps track of the blue chips shares, gained 1.76 percent in the day. But the daily turnover edged down from Monday's highest ever of Tk 23.05 billion to Tk 20.41 billion. Market experts said the banks are topping investors' buying basket due to their conversion of face values to Tk 10 from Tk 100. "The perception of the investors is that shares of banks that have decided or even proposed to convert face value will rise further," said a top official of a brokerage firm, preferring anonymity. Market participators, however, said that ideally the change in face value should not have an impact on share prices as it would not change the companies' financial fundamentals. Some of the investors told bdnews24.com that they feel the market is getting overheated due to the influx of undisclosed income--"black money" in common parlance. Banks dominated the turnover board, with 13 out of the top 20 coming from the sector. Energy and fuel shares made their place on the board, though they continued to fall on profit-taking. British American Tobacco Bangladesh Ltd also came out as one of the turnover leaders with its price gaining 4.32 percent on its corporate declaration. The company has announced 300 percent cash dividend for the year. Market heavyweight Grameenphone rose by 1.25 percent, but the lone telecom issue was not a turnover leader. Out of the 242 traded issues, 144 lost, 89 gained and nine held steady
