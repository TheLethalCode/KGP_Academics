 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)-- BNP policymaker Moudud Ahmed says he is against calling general strikes to force the government to step down since such destructive programmes cause public sufferings. "We should not cause sufferings to the people by opting for destructive programmes like hartal. Rather we have to go for the programmes that will force the government to step down without causing public sufferings," he said on Friday. His opinion came five days before party chairperson Khaleda Zia is scheduled to announce anti-government programmes at a rally at Paltan ground on May 19. Speaking at a discussion meeting titled "Farakka day and current perspective" organised by National People's Party at the National Press Club, Moudud said: "The people have experienced hartal and siege programmes in the name of movement. Such programmes often result in violence." Taking a swipe at the government, he said: "An invisible power is running this government. They are influencing the judiciary and controlling the public administration. They now do not feel the need to introduce one-party system by enacting law." There is a controlled democracy functioning now in the country, he observed. Moudud called upon the like-minded parties to stand united with BNP. On the government's attitude towards the mass media, he said Channel 1 and Bangla Vision's talk show, 'Point of Order', has been stopped. "They are controlling private television channels' talk shows this way." Moudud said Bangladesh is being depriving of its fair share of water in the Padma due to the agreement signed during former Awami League government. "The country's interests will never be protected by the Awami League-led government due to its policy of pleasing India." National People's Party's president Sheikh Shaukat Hossain Nilu presided over the discussion. bdnews
