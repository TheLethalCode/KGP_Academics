 Jhenaidah, May 18 (bdnews24.com)An alleged leader of an outlawed extremist outfit was killed in a "shootout" with police in Chuadanga early on Tuesday. Md. Nazrul Islam, Superintendent of Chudanga Police, claimed, Asadul, 40, was a regional leader of the Purbo Bangla Communist Party (ML). Islam said that that the police organised a raid at the Nehalpur village of the Sadar upazila at around 3am following a tip-off that the extremists were holding a meeting there. Sensing police presence the criminals allegedly opened fire at the law enforcers and a gun battle ensued with the police. At 15 to 20 minutes after the gunfight started, the men fled the scene leaving Asadul's body behind, Islam added. Police said that they recovered a gun and three bullets from the location. According to the superintendent, Asadul was a fugitive who had formed his own criminal gang six months ago. He faced four murder cases and had also been convicted in an arms case, for which he was facing a life sentence. bdnews24.com
