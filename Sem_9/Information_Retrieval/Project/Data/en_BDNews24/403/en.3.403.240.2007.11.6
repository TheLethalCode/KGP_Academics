 PORT OF SPAIN, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago's ruling party appeared to have handily won an election on Monday, holding onto power despite public disquiet over rising crime in the energy-rich Caribbean country and a regional trend of ousting incumbents. With 52 percent of the votes counted, projections of preliminary results from the national Election and Boundaries Commission gave Prime Minister Patrick Manning's People's National Movement 25 seats, enough to control the newly expanded 41-seat parliament. The PNM draws most of its support from voters of African descent in a country where politics has long been divided along racial lines. It has been in charge of the twin-island nation for all but 11 years since the party was founded 51 years ago. Manning has ruled Trinidad and the smaller island of Tobago for 10 of the last 16 years and appeared to have bucked an anti-incumbent trend in the English-speaking Caribbean. "I would like to assure you that the next five years will be better than the last," Manning told cheering supporters at his constituency offices in San Fernando, south of the capital. He said his party would have a "comfortable" 11-seat majority. The main opposition party, the United National Congress, which results showed winning 16 seats in parliament, has its base of support among Trinidadians of East Indian descent. An upstart third party, the Congress of the People, led by former central bank governor Winston Dookeran and which presented itself as multiracial, was competing in a general election for the first time. Though political analysts said the fledgling party had won broad support among Trinidad's burgeoning middle class, it apparently failed to win any seats in parliament. "This battle has been lost but we will continue to fight to make our country what we want it to be," Dookeran told his supporters in a somber concession speech. Dookeran, a former leader of the United National Congress, did not elaborate on plans for the Congress of the People and its challenge to the country's racially-divisive politics. While Dookeran's bid may have ended in frustration, many voters appeared to share his view that Manning has done too little to rein in ruthless criminal gangs, which have expanded because of Trinidad's growing role as a transshipment point for South American cocaine. "I think he's crime minister, not prime minister, but crime minister," William Ramlal, a 59-year-old limousine driver and Dookeran supporter, said of Manning. "Since he's been in power the crime rate is always going up, up and up and up," he said. Located just off the coast of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago is the top exporter of liquefied natural gas to the United States. Its natural gas and energy resources have made it the envy of the Caribbean with economic growth last year of 12 percent.
