 LISBON, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal sees no reason to change plans to have European Union leaders fly to Lisbon to sign a new EU treaty and then head to Brussels for a summit on the same day, despite widespread criticism from environmentalists. By signing a long-awaited treaty on Portuguese soil to reform the EU's institutions, the current holder of the EU presidency will ensure the document enters the history books as the Treaty of Lisbon. "The signing of the treaty was proposed and accepted at a meeting of heads of state and governments that took place (in Lisbon)," Portuguese Foreign Minister Luis Amado said. "I see no reason to alter its date at this time." Friends of the Earth has branded the initiative as "silly" in a EU that prides itself as leading the fight against global warming. The leaders would fly to Lisbon in the morning and then jet to Brussels in the afternoon for a scheduled summit. Danish Foreign Minister Stig Moller was quoted on Tuesday as saying it made no sense for the leaders to travel to both destinations. The split ceremony will contribute between 10 and 15 tonnes of CO2 to the carbon footprint, according to an online carbon footprint calculator. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates tried to avoid the one day flying marathon by proposing to hold the December summit in his country right after signing of the treaty. But Belgium, home of the EU's main institutions, was equally determined to enforce its right, won in the 2000 Treaty of Nice, to host all formal summits of the Union.
