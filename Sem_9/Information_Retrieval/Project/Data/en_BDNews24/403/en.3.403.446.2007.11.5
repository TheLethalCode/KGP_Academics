 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)  The police are set to run a special unit under the Criminal Investigation Department to fight cyber crime, a rising crime pattern across the world in the digital age, a senior police official said Sunday. Naba Vikram Tripura, additional inspector general of police, made the statement at a news briefing, a day before officials from several Asian countries are going to discuss the issue in Dhaka. Sponsored by the UNDP under its Police Reforms Project, the officials from Australia, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh will gather at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel for a three-day discussion through Thursday to find out ways to fight cyber crimes and what should be their cooperation strategy. Cyber crimes such as posting pictures online of having sex with young boys or girlsoften with childrenare big problems in many developed countries. In recent months the issue made a stir in some Southeast Asian nations. "Cyber crime has emerged as an escalating form of criminal activities. Child pornography, computer hacking, virus attack are different types of cyber offences," Tripura said at the briefing in the Police Headquarters. He said when the developed countries could fight such crimes it could be a challenge for the developing countries since the effort involves huge resources. The problem is sometimes more critical than drug trade, he said. Replying to a question if Bangladesh is vulnerable to such crimes, he said: "The country is not facing the crisis yet. But there is a very possibility that it will emerge here too." Referring to a 2005 report, Tripura said cyber crimes can hinder business and investment while security system could be another vital victim. He said the country's police department, which is often accused of human rights violation and pervasive corruption, is struggling to earn people's confidence. Reforms measures have been taken to improve the department's services quality, he said. bdnews24.c
