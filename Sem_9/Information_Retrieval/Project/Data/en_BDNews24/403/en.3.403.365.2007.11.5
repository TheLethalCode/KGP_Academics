<TITLE> Japan opposition asks leader to stay on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior officials of Japan's main opposition party struggled on Monday to persuade their leader to stay in his post, trying to avert the possibility of him quitting the party and backing the government bloc. Analysts said that even if Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa did defect, it was not clear whether he would take enough lawmakers with him to restore a government majority in the upper house, where the opposition has the numbers to stall legislation. Ozawa tendered his resignation on Sunday after his Democratic Party rejected an offer from the prime minister to talk about forming a new grand coalition. "We decided to ask President Ozawa to stay on," party secretary-general Yukio Hatoyama told reporters after party officials met in emergency session, adding that Ozawa had earlier not insisted on forming an alliance with the ruling bloc. Hatoyama, who later met Ozawa, said the leader had thanked him for the request to stay on, but had asked for more time to make a decision. Hatoyama added that, as in the past, the Democrats were prepared to discuss specific policies with the ruling coalition, an apparent nod to Ozawa's call for such talks. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Friday he had suggested a new political framework to resolve a policy stalemate created when the opposition won control of the upper house in July. Democratic Party executives quickly rejected the coalition invitation, a decision Ozawa likened to a vote of no-confidence as he had favoured discussions with the government. "The Democrats are trying not to upset Ozawa and push him into leaving the party with other lawmakers," said Yasunori Sone, political science professor at Keio University. "The question is, how many 'Ozawa children' are there in the upper house. "We don't know." POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY Ozawa also told Hatoyama that the Democrats' priority should be to prepare for a general election, although he repeated a point he made forcefully on Sunday: that winning would be tough. Fukuda's month-old government has been unable to push policies through parliament and has had to halt a naval mission in support of U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan after the Democrats vowed to oppose it in the upper house. Some financial market players said they were watching for clues to whether Japan's policy stalemate would end. Speculation also simmered over the possibility that Ozawa might create a new party with disaffected members of both the Democratic Party and Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Ozawa is a veteran strategist who left the LDP in 1993 but then joined hands with the long-ruling party a few years later, only to break ranks again and finally merge with the Democrats. The Democrats are a fractious amalgam of former LDP members, ex-Socialists and hawkish younger lawmakers who differ on security matters and other important policies. Analysts have long said they were at risk of unravelling. Still, many thought the party had its best chance of taking power in the next general election after its stunning performance in the July upper house poll. "The Democrats' logic is simple. If they win the next lower house election, the distorted situation in parliament will be resolved," Sone said. "Ozawa didn't have confidence in that, but Fukuda isn't confident about an election either." Ozawa's resignation offer -- which mirrors the sudden decision by Fukuda's predecessor Shinzo Abe to quit in September -- has clouded forecasts of when the next lower house election will take place. No poll need be called until 2009. Some analysts said the Democrats' disarray meant an early poll in January or February was now less likely than one after the national budget is enacted in late March. Others said a lower house dissolution in December could not be ruled o
