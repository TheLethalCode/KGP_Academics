 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) The Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League saw three of the four-dayers end in draws at different venues Monday. The Dhaka-Barisal match, however, spread excitement before bad light forced a call off of the final day's play to end in a draw at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Other two matches -- Chittagong vs Rajshahi and Khulna vs Sylhet -- experienced dull draws at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium and Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Despite the draws, Rajshahi topped the table with 38 points from three outings, five points ahead of second-placed Khulna, who earned 33 points from three matches. Dhaka vs Barisal Chasing 111 runs to win in 51 overs, Barisal went close to losing the match before bad light forced it to end with Barisal at 103 for nine. At one stage, Barisal were reduced to 38 for six as new-ball pair Mohammad Sharif and Mahbubul Alam Robin shared six wickets. However, Arafat Salahuddin (20) and Shaheen Hossain (30) took their side to 101 for seven before Mosharraf Hossain Rubel broke the seventh wicket having Arafat caught by Riad. In the same over, Mosharraf bowled Shaheen, and Sharif removed Talha Jubaer in the next over to reduce Barisal to 103 for nine in 35.2 overs, but the umpires called the match off after the 36th over due to bad light. Chittagong vs Rajshahi Hosts Chittagong were 130 for three at the close of the final day, chasing winning target of 310 set by visitors Rajshahi. Aftab Ahmed and Faisal Hossain remained unbeaten on 45 and 17 after Nafis Iqbal (14), Masumullah (33) and Nazimuddin (23) returned to the dressing room. Earlier, Rajshahi resumed the day on 78 for one and declared their second innings at 232 for five, setting Chittagong to chase 310. Mushfiqur Rahman (50) and Farhad Reza (69) remained unbeaten to help Rajshahi cross the 200-mark on the final day. Khulna vs Sylhet The match between Khulna and Sylhet was set to end in a draw after almost two days were ruined by rains at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Khulna set Sylhet to chase 223 after being bowled out for 174 in the second innings, but both sides agreed to end the match in a draw due to a short time of play. Barisal did not bat in the second innings. Sylhet were bowled out for 225 in reply to Khulna's first innings total of 274 all out. Khulna skipper Habibul Bashar scored 73 as Khulna scored 174 all out in their second innings.
