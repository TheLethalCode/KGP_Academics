 Dhaka, Nov 05 (bdnews24.com)  A seminar organised by the police on cyber-crime kicked off in Dhaka Monday. The regional seminar at Dhaka's Sheraton Hotel will provide a talking shop for representatives from Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and Nepal to exchange views and increase regional cooperation to combat the increasing threat from cyber crime. "These days crime knows no borders, with criminals using the latest technology available," said local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal in his inaugural speech. "Cyber crime has become international. This new form of crime is expensive for developing countries to combat, but it remains a very important issue to confront," Anwarul said. The adviser said that increasing cyber crime compromises online information, which is proving to be a great challenge to law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh. Naba Vikram Tripura, acting inspector general of police, attending the programme, said cyber and tech-based crimes are increasing at an alarming rate. "It can be assumed from the trend that in future these issues will become a severe problem for South Asian countries," Tripura said. The seminar stressed the importance of adequate police training and strengthening international cooperation between developing and developed countries. Cyber-crimes range from downloading child pornography to computer hacking and spreading viruses. Analysts estimate that illegal money generated worldwide through the internet may top $105 billion in 2007 alone. Bangladesh Police officials said they are viewing the seminar as an opportunity to bring themselves up to date with the latest tactics to combat the insidious effects of cyber-crime. Bangladesh Police in conjunction with the UNDP and DFID launched the Police Reforms Programme in 2005, aiming to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Bangladesh Police force. bdnews2
