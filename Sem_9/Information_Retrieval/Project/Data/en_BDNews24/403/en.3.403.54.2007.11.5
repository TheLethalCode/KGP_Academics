 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) will hold its election on January 19 next year. The decision was taken at an emergency meeting at the BFF House Monday. The meeting also decided to hold the elections of the district football associations (DFA) by December 5 and the elections of the divisional football associations by December 14. "The FIFA directed us to keep the government officials excluded from the DFA councillorship and the meeting accepted the FIFA's observation and finalised the DFA constitution," BFF president SA Sultan told reporters emerging from the meeting. "The government officials, however, will able to become observer councilors and can involve themselves in different tournaments at district and divisional levels," said Sultan. "We will tell the higher authority to take proper move to complete the DFA elections immediately," said the BFF boss. The BFF election was deferred four times due to different problems and the FIFA extended the tenure of the BFF committee to one year. The BFF had earlier prepared a draft constitution for the DFA keeping different government officials on the committee, but the FIFA, world's football governing body, asked the BFF to revise the constitution on nine points. Later, the BFF in line with the guideline, sent the revised DFA constitution to the FIFA in the last week of October for approval, but it again directed the BFF to revise the constitution on one point about the involvement of the government officials on the DFA committees. Mentioning criticized reports on the BFF, Sultan told reporters, "Let us allow working coolly in coming days as I want to say confidently that none of us has any will to grab the chair."
