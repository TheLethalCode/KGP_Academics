<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed Monday claimed that detained chairperson Khaleda Zia had asked the EC to invite Khandaker Delwar Hossain to talks. "[Khaleda] told her lawyer Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas that Khandaker Delwar was the lawful secretary general of BNP and that the EC should send him the invitation letter, as all party activities should be run by him," said Rizvi to reporters at a news briefing at his Shyamoli home. The pro-Delwar Rizvi said: "The BNP chairperson has clearly told her lawyer that she is in no way involved with the Saifur-Hafizuddin committee." He said that he expected the EC would send the invitation to Delwar, who had been deposed as secretary general in a standing committee meeting on Oct 30, and no one else. "People will push the aberrant elements out of the [mainstream BNP] when the time comes," he added. The two opposing BNP factions have been fighting a war of words over who should receive the dialogue invite from the EC. Delwar Sunday petitioned to the High Court for a ruling on who should represent the party to the electoral reforms talks. The court has ordered the government and the EC to explain within two weeks why the BNP representatives would not be invited to join the dialogue as prescribed by the law and the BNP constitution. bdnews24.com
