<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com) At least 30 percent of teachers in nongovernmental educational institutions must be women, the government has said in an order. The order dated Nov 1 by the Ministry of Education said if the institutions failed to go by the order they would not be listed under the government's monthly pay order (MPO). The order however said the decision would not be applicable to some specific posts such as principal, vice principal, headmaster, assistant headmaster, superintendent and assistant superintendent in nongovernmental schools, colleges, madrasas and technical institutions. The decision was made in 1999 to give a good share of the teaching posts to women candidates but it did not get through. The interim government after coming to power in mid-January revived the order to create new scope for women. The ministry also said the order would not apply to the teachers of mathematics, physical education, Arabic, the Quran and the Hadith until Dec 31, 2009 for now. To implement the decision, the institutions have been asked to recruit only women candidates to any vacant post after a teacher resigns, dies or retires. The institutions must advertise in newspapers to recruit women candidates with a mandatory announcement that "Male candidates need not apply". If there is no response to the first advertisement from a female candidate, the institutions have to advertise for a second time inviting only women candidates. If there is no response to the second announcement, the institutions have to advertise for a third time inviting both male and female candidates to fill vacancies. bdnews24.com/
