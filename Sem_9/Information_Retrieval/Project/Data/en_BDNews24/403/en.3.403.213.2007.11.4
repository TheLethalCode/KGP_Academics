 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has deferred the launch of the unitrack education system for secondary level students for a third straight year. The decision was taken Sunday at a meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by Fakhruddin Ahmed, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters. Munaim said the system's launch had been deferred to Dec 31, 2008 as it needed a huge amount of preparation and required more scrutiny prior to implementation. The BNP-led alliance government originally announced the launch of the unitrack system in 2006. It spent around Tk 150 crore and trained some 348 officials and teachers in an attempt to implement the new system. Under the system there would be no groups such as science, commerce or humanities on the secondary level. However the proposed system was successively postponed in face of widespread mistrust. A senior official of the education ministry said the National Curriculum and Textbook Board sent a letter to the ministry in September asking if the unitrack education system would be launched in 2008 as it would have to start printing its text books. The official added that the new system would require sufficient teachers in science, commerce and humanities in every school. However, there are currently no teachers for commerce subjects in 7,047 schools and no science teachers in 1,512 schools out of a total of 14,552 secondary schools across the country. bdnews24.c
