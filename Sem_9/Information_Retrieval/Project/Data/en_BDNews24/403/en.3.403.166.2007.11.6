<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Patrick Manning bucked an anti-incumbent trend in the English-speaking Caribbean when he was elected to another five-year term on Monday, according to preliminary results. The following are some facts about the prime minister of the energy-rich Caribbean nation. Manning's biggest accomplishments over the last five years include attracting about $6 billion in investments in Trinidad and Tobago's petrochemical industries. He has also overseen a surge in per capita income from $7,100 in 2002 to $14,790 in 2006. The poverty rate in the twin-island nation has dropped from 35 percent in 1990 to 16.7 percent last year. Born Aug. 17, 1946, the 61-year-old prime minister is a geologist by profession - a useful background in a country that is the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to the United States. His main electoral promises included developing a plastics and aluminum industry in Trinidad. In winning Monday's race, Manning and his People's National Movement bucked a trend that has seen four ruling parties ousted in recent elections in the English-speaking Caribbean. Manning, who served his first full-term as prime minister from 1991 through 1995, was criticized by opponents because of concerns over crime, rising prices and proposed constitutional reforms that some had branded as dictatorial.
