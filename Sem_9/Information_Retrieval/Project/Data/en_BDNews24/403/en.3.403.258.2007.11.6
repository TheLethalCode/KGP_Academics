 LONDON, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British-based directories business Yell said on Tuesday it expects its full-year results to be in line with market expectations as it posted a 19 percent rise in underlying first-half earnings amid intense US competition. Shares in Yell initially jumped 2.7 percent, one of the best opening performances across the European media sector, before easing back to trade 2.3 percent lower at 417 pence at 0840 GMT. The company, which generates around half its revenues in the United States, reiterated its full-year US and UK guidance of around 3 percent underlying growth. Sticking with the existing US outlook forecast was key as analysts were concerned ahead of the interim results that the intense US competition from directories rivals and regional US telephone operators would put pressure on Yell's full-year view. "There should be a collective sigh of relief on Yell's H1 results," said ABN AMRO analyst Paul Gooden in a research note. Yell Chief Executive John Condron said the company was doing well amid ongoing pressures in the United States where housing market and advertising weakness has been a burden for many. However, U.S. directories rivals had been very aggressive in cutting prices -- in some cases, discounting by up to 75 percent or doubling the amount of advertising space they made available for the same price. "The market is stabilising a little bit. It is fiercely competitive but not getting more competitive than last year," Condron told Reuters in an interview. An example of this, Condron said, was the drop in the number of new directories launches in the United States from around 560 two years ago to around 360 this year. Yell said that in the six months to end-September adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to 319.8 million pounds ($666 million) with revenue rising 13.7 percent to 965.4 million pounds. Analysts had expected underlying first-half earnings of 304 million pounds and revenue of 956 million pounds, according to a Reuters Estimates poll. "The interim results confirm that the US division is on track to meet the revised targets," said Cazenove analysts. "Spain is seeing slightly lower organic growth but higher margin and we do not expect to make any material changes to our EPS forecasts of 36.9 pence in 07/08 and 43 pence in 08/09." The company raised its interim dividend by 10.5 percent to 6.3p. The interim dividend rise last year was 11.8 percent. In the UK, Yell said interim revenue rose 3 percent to 362.3 million pounds with a 52 percent rise in online revenue more than offsetting the expected 4.4 percent print revenue fall.
