<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto said on Tuesday she will not meet or negotiate with President Pervez Musharraf, after the military ruler invoked emergency rule at the weekend. "No and nor do I intend to meet Musharraf," she told reporters at Karachi airport before boarding a flight to Islamabad, when asked if she will negotiate to join a caretaker government. Bhutto, leader of the largest opposition party, the Pakistan Peoples' Party, said she still intended to address a public meeting in Rawalpindi, next door to Islamabad on Nov. 9. Bhutto said she was going to Islamabad for a meeting of the opposition Alliance for Restoration of Democracy. Musharraf's cabinet was due to meet on Tuesday, while former prime minister Bhutto -- who the United States had hoped would end up sharing power with the president after January's poll -- was due in Islamabad soon. Bhutto has denounced the emergency as "mini-martial law", but she has not mobilised her street power so far. There was no indication of when Musharraf would lift emergency rule, which he justified by citing a hostile judiciary and rising militancy. However he said on Monday he planned to give up his military role in nuclear-armed Pakistan. "I am determined to execute this third stage of transition fully and I'm determined to remove my uniform once we correct these pillars, the judiciary and the executive and the parliament," he told foreign diplomats. Several judges were held incommunicado at their homes after refusing to back emergency rule. Among them was dismissed chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who became a symbol of resistance to Musharraf's rule after defying pressure to quit in March. "Lawyers should convey my message to the people to rise up and restore the constitution. This is a time for sacrifices. I am under arrest now, but soon I will also join you in your struggle," Chaudhry told lawyers outside the courts in Islamabad by telephone relayed over a loudspeaker. bdnews24.com/lq/1702
