 Dhaka, Nov 05 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting BNP chairman M Saifur Rahman Monday thanked the Election Commission for inviting them to dialogue on electoral reforms on Nov 22. "The EC sent us a letter reviewing the situation. The BNP will work to develop the country as a united party," said Saifur at a press briefing at his Gulshan home. EC secretary Humayun Kabir told reporters earlier that the commission had invited acting secretary general of the BNP Hafizuddin Ahmed to take part in the reform talks. Saifur who will lead the troubled party's delegation in the upcoming talks said: "The nationalist party needs to be united to protect the sovereignty of the country. Our task, at present, is to unite the BNP and prepare for the election." "Khaleda Zia is my leader, although I have been carrying this responsibility in her absence. I have travelled from Teknaf to Tentulia with my leader to strengthen the party." "I feel embarrassed when people say we are divided and the Awami League is united," Saifur said. Acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed also termed the EC's decision 'legal', saying: "There is no faction or conflict within the BNP." Saifur said senior BNP leader Dr RA Ghani's remark Monday that the standing committee was "clearly split" in view of the deepening leadership crises was inaccurate. Ghani, a BNP standing committee member, had earlier said: "The-much-talked-about standing committee meeting, held on October 29, wasn't a valid one as it was not convened or conducted according to our party's constitution." However, Saifur retorted: "The main agenda of the October 29 meeting was how to unite the BNP. Decisions made by standing committee members in this matter were noted down. Every member signed the papers." The controversial acting chairman also trashed BNP leader Rizvi Ahmed's remark that the EC's decision on who to invite for reform dialogues was illegal: "Rizvi Ahmed has no right to make any comment on this issue." bdnews24.
