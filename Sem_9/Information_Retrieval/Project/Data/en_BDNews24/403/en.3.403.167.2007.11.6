 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Tuesday they did not take sides by inviting Hafizuddin Ahmed to the electoral reforms talks slated for Nov 22. He said the Election Commission just followed the "doctrine of necessity" to make the decision. "We have sent the invitation (to Hafizuddin) using our judgment after reviewing the precedents and the BNP constitution," Huda told reporters. He said their decision came since it was neither possible nor appropriate to invite the two factions of the BNP. Asked why they had sent the invitation to Hafizuddin when there was no post of acting secretary general in the BNP constitution, Huda said: "It's not imperative that everything will have to be in the constitution. He has been sent the invitation letter following the doctrine of necessity." Hafizuddin was made acting secretary general of the troubled BNP at a meeting on Oct 29 at the home of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman amid outright rejection by followers of detained party chief Khaleda Zia. The Khaleda followers led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain denounced the appointment and had been asking the EC to invite them to the reforms talks. The Awami League has labelled the changes in the BNP as a "midnight coup". Huda said the EC had to take a decision to rest the feud in the BNP over the issue. "If anybody does not like it he can go to court or talk inside the party. If the dispute persists efforts to unify the party could also be made," he said. The CEC said the issue could resurface when the political parties get registered with the commission. "The dialogue is a phase only. Still they have time, they can resolve the problem before the registration," he said. The top election official said it was bad luck for them to have been dragged into "a dispute". "But we have no way but to follow the election roadmap," he said. Huda also talked about the expulsion of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, saying Bhuiyan did not get "natural justice" from the party chief. Bhuiyan, who was expelled from the post of the secretary general by Khaleda hours before her arrest on Sept 3, could not defend himself, Huda said. "Major (retired) Akhtaruzzaman had had the chance to explain his position before he was expelled by the party. But Mannan Bhuiyan has not been given that scope even two months after his expulsion," he said. Huda also clarified the EC's position about the letter from Khaleda follower ASM Hannan Shah to the commission for inviting them to the planned dialogue. "The party chief is in jail but the party can no way sit idle. So the shuffling of the party posts through the Oct29 meeting of the standing committee was right. "Hannan Shah is nobody in the BNP standing committee. So we didn't take his Sunday's letter into consideration," he said. bdnews24
