 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Secretaries Tuesday asked the government to raise to 62 the retirement age for civil servants, pay full basic salary when they go into retirement and frame civil service act. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, who chaired the meeting with the secretaries to ministries and heads of departments, preferred a separate meeting to look into the proposals, the government spokesman said. Citing that average life expectancy of Bangladeshis had increased, establishment secretary Md Abdus Salam Khan proposed the extension of the retirement age. He also proposed framing of the civil service act. Press secretary to the chief adviser Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting that 11 secretaries spoke at the meeting. The proposal on disbursement of full basic pay when a civil servant goes into retirement came up, he added Fakhruddin said his caretaker administration was working to hold a free and fair election as it had declared after taking the reins. He said work on voter list, introduction of laws and dialogue with the political parties were ongoing. The corruption suspects had been put on trial, he said and hoped that the government would succeed in curbing corruption. It was his third meeting with the secretaries since the Jan 11 changeover, with the first meeting being on Jan 23 and the second on May 21. The work on the committee formed to empower the local government had been finished, he said. The committee would make recommendations to the government by Nov, he hoped. He also said the government would form a better business forum by this week to create sound business atmosphere. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain recently called on the chief adviser and asked him to form a better business forum. Reminding the secretaries that the government was supposed to improve the lifestyle of the people, he said, "You have to work keeping in mind how the procedures can be made easy for the people to benefit." He directed the secretaries and department heads to finish public purchase by Dec for smooth implementation of annual development programme. "I believe it will boost the speed of implementation of annual development programme." Referring to the government's priority on the rehabilitation of the flood victims, the former Bangladesh Bank governor said the emphasis should be on agriculture. All should make efforts so that the next harvest comes off well, Fakhruddin said and asked authorities to ensure that supply of fertiliser reaches farmers in time. "It is not enough to reach the fertiliser to the port, it is more important to reach to the farmers." On the price hike of daily commodities, Fakhruddin said, "The rise is persistent all over the world, we have the impact here. We are taking necessary steps and continuing our activities." "Our main focus should be on the output of all works. The government has initiated a number of reforms. These reforms aim to meet the expectations of people and strengthen the basis of democracy," he told the secretaries. He asked authorities to shore up the watch on governmental activities and take steps against officials found wanting. bdnews24.com
