 Dhaka, Nov 06 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Tuesday remanded managing director of Hotel Purbani International, Mahbubur Rahman Joynal, in custody for three days in an arms case. The court also ordered him to jail in connection with three other cases filed against him. Magistrate Habibur Rahman of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka turned down bail appeals from Joynal's lawyers in four cases and ordered him remanded in custody in the arms case after police prayed for a seven-day remand. Joynal's lawyer Abdullah Al Mamun said at the hearing, "The defendant is sick and there is no possibility of his fleeing. The allegations brought against him are false. He was wrongfully arrested on Sunday while he was about to turn himself in to the court of law." Meanwhile, Joynal's 26-year-old girlfriend Jannatul Ferdous Niki was brought to the court Tuesday afternoon and kept in the lockup on the court premises. The RAB had earlier mounted an extensive search for the businessman and his girlfriend, both accused of having close ties to the Yaba drug trade. On October 29, the RAB, in an effort to arrest the two people, raided Joynal's Dhanmondi home and confiscated Tk 28.5 crore worth of foreign currencies, a huge quantity of gold and diamond ornaments, liquor, firearms and Viagra from the place. According to RAB, Niki had been living in the house with Joynal for the last couple of years as his friend. bdnews24.
