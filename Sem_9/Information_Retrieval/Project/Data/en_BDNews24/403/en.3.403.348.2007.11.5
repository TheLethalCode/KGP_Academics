COMMENTS FROM EXECUTIVES: "When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing." -- Prince, in the Financial Times on July 9, rejecting concern the boom in private equity buyouts would end soon. "I would give you long odds -- I would bet you $100 that he will be the CEO at the annual meeting five years from now, and as long past that as he wants to be." -- Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, in the New York Times on Oct 12, on whether Prince would remain chief executive. I am responsible for the conduct of our businesses. It is my judgment that the size of these charges makes stepping down the only honorable course for me to take as chief executive officer." -- Prince, in a November 4 memo to employees, as Citigroup announced a potential $8 billion to $11 billion write-down for subprime mortgages, equal to $5 billion to $7 billion after taxes. This was on top of a $6.5 billion third-quarter write-down for subprime and other losses.
