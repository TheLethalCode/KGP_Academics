<TITLE> Young Iranian escapes execution, lawyer says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian sentenced to death for killing a drug dealer when he was 16 will escape execution after the parents of the victim accepted 1.5 billion rials ($160,000) in "blood money," his lawyer said on Monday. But in another case that has put the spotlight on the Islamic state's human rights record, lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh said a higher court at least partly had upheld a sentence for a women's rights activist, jailing her for two and a half years. Sotoudeh is representing both Sina Paymard, a musician who was initially scheduled to be put to death last year, and Delaram Ali, who was convicted in July for attending a banned rally in favour of female rights. Sotoudeh initially said the court had also confirmed the part of the July ruling sentencing Ali, 24, to ten lashes in addition to imprisonment. But she later told Reuters this was not certain. Western rights groups say Iran discriminates against women and also criticise it for executing people for crimes committed when they were under 18. Iran says it does not violate human rights and that it follows sharia, Islamic law. Ali was accused of participating in an illegal gathering, propaganda activities against the system, and disrupting public order during a demonstration in Tehran in June 2006 at which scores of people were detained. Campaigners complain women face difficulties in getting a divorce and also decry unjust inheritance laws and the fact that their court testimony is only worth half that of a man's. Iran says it does not discriminate against women. Paymard, now believed to be around 19, was arrested in 2004 for stabbing a drug dealer in a Tehran park but his death sentence was postponed twice, giving the family more time to find compensation money. Under Islamic law, relatives of the victim may pardon the murderer in return for "blood money" and Paymard's family raised 1.5 billion rials in a bid to stop his execution after one benefactor contributed more than half the required amount. The victim's family first declined to accept the sum in compensation, which would allow the sentence to be commuted, and demanded the execution go ahead. But Sotoudeh said they had now changed their minds and on Sunday went to court: "They took the blood money ... Sina will not be execute
