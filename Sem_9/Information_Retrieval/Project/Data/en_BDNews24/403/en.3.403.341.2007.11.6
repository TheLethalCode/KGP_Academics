 by Ian Chua HONG KONG, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/comReuters) - Most Asian stock markets rebounded on Tuesday as investors bought back some beaten-down financials, helping whet appetite for riskier assets which halted the yen's rise against other major currencies. Oil rose towards $95 a barrel, steadying from a recent pullback from a record high of $96.24 set on November 1, while gold held within easy reach of a 28-year peak of $810.90 set on Monday. Analysts said Citigroup's bombshell on Sunday that it faced as much as $11 billion more in credit losses had mostly been discounted by markets in Monday's selloff. "Japanese stocks have pretty much priced in the Citi news during yesterday's session," said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at the equity marketing department at Daiwa Securities SMBC. At 0220 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had climbed 0.5 percent, steadying from Monday's 1.5 percent slide to a seven-week closing low, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks edged up 0.1 percent. The MSCI index had slid 2.1 percent to a 1- week closing low in the previous session and was down about 5 percent from a life high set on November 1. Investors bought Westpac Banking Group, driving the stock up 1.6 percent. Australia's top investment bank Macquarie Group added 1 percent, while Japan's Mitsubishi UFG ( 8306.T: Quote, Profile, Research) and Resona Holdings both gained more than 2 percent. "I don't think you can read anything into (today's gains). The market has been chopping around a bit lately," said Simon Doyle, head of strategy at Schroder Investment Management in Australia. Citigroup's Tokyo-listed shares, which started trading this week, fell 4.4 percent, in line with a 4.9 percent slump in its US shares after the banking giant was unable to assure investors that a potential $11 billion write-down for subprime mortgages won't grow. South Korea's Woori Financial, which has the biggest exposure to US subprime debt among Korean lenders, fell 3.2 percent. In Hong Kong, Alibaba.com more than doubled in value at its trading debut after China's largest e-commerce firm raised $1.49 billion in Hong Kong's most popular initial public offering. The stock hit a high of HK$32.00 versus an IPO price of HK$13.50. Among the region's top markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index again lagged, easing 1.5 percent to extend Monday's 5.0 percent drop as investors continued to fret that Beijing will delay plans to allow mainland investors to directly trade in the city's listed securities. YEN'S RISE HALTED Gains in stocks halted the yen's rise. Investors usually sell the low-yielding Japanese currency to fund purchases of higher yielding assets when risk appetite grows. The dollar edged up to 114.54 yen from an overnight low near 114 yen, while the euro bought 165.80 yen, up from a low of about 165 yen on Monday. Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.4475, still holding near a record high of about $1.4530 set on November 2. Japanese government bonds edged up as the market drew support from an early decline in the Nikkei. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs slipped 1 basis point to 1.57 pe
