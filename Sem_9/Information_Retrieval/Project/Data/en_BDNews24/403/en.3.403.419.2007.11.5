"Bangladeshis control 90 percent of British fusion food industry with an annual turnover of around 3.2 billion pound sterling. If Bangladesh can increase export of food stuff, we will completely dominate the huge fusion food industry in the UK," said Syed Nahas Pasha, director of communications of British fusion food festival in Dhaka. He spoke to bdnews24.com on the sidelines of the launching ceremony of the Fourth British Fusion Food Festival at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The festival runs through to Nov 7. Pasha said the Indians controlled the supply of the raw materials like rice, spices, fish, meat and other food stuff. Five super grade Bangladeshi chefs have come to Dhaka to take part in the four-day festival, co-organised by Dhaka Sheraton Hotel and Curry Life, a British magazine on UK's fusion food industry. Robert Evans, a European Union lawmaker, attended the ceremony as chief guest while British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury was special guest. Organisers said the festival aimed to let people know the successes of British Bangladeshis serving 12,000 restaurants in the UK.
