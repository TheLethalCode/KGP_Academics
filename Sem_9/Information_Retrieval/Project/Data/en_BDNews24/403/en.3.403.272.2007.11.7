<TITLE> Japan stocks erase gains, undermined by strong yen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average hit a seven-week closing low on Wednesday for the third straight day after gains were undermined by a surging yen, prompting selling of exporters such as Canon Inc that led to wider sales. Shares in auto companies also slid, though they had helped buoy the market earlier ahead of Toyota Motor Co earnings announcement just after the close. Growing uncertainty on the global economy after a string of bad news from banking giant Citigroup, which faces rising losses from the credit crisis, was fed by higher oil prices and left Tokyo stocks vulnerable as the yen began to climb. By mid-afternoon the dollar had fallen to 113.89 yen from 114.70 yen earlier in the day. "The strong yen has really been putting investors off, with the market starting to fall as soon as the dollar broke through 114.50," said Seiichi Miura, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Toyota, the world's biggest and most profitable automaker, posted a 2.7 percent rise in quarterly operating profit, with second-quarter net profit growing 11.1 percent. It also lifted its full-year forecasts after stronger-than-expected results so far and announced a plan to buy back 15 million shares, up to 110 billion yen ($960.7 million) worth, between Nov 9 and 29. Market participants said the results were not bad but warned of potential fallout should the U.S. economy chill and from the stronger yen. "The impact of the high yen is a worry and Toyota shares are not doing well due to concern about the outlook for the U.S. economy. The United States is where Toyota has generated hefty profits and is currently facing negative problems," said Tomomi Yamashita, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co Ltd. U.S. crude oil futures surged to a record high, at one point touching $98, helping shares in trading firms such as Marubeni Corp climb, along with oil-linked shares. But any further rises were seen likely to contribute to growing uncertainty over both the global and domestic economy, market participants said. "If oil goes up to $100 this will lead to rising gas prices and start to really have an impact on the things ordinary people care about, dampening domestic demand," Miura said. In its fourth straight losing session, the benchmark Nikkei ended down 0.94 percent at 16,096.68, its lowest since Sept. 18, with a loss of 152.95 points. The broader TOPIX index fell 1.14 percent to 1,556.69, also a seven-week closing low. POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY Japan's unclear political situation was also seen staying investors' hands with Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party expected to confirm later on Wednesday that he had reversed his abrupt decision to quit. Ozawa offered his resignation on Sunday after party executives rejected a coalition with the ruling bloc that he had discussed with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda. "I can't say that this situation is leading to actual selling, but it's almost certainly making it hard to buy. It's just too hard to predict what will happen in parliament from here on in," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. The dollar's tumble hit exporters such as Canon, which fell 1.6 percent to 5,720 yen and became a significant drag on the Nikkei 225. Fellow exporters suffered a similar fate, with Hitachi down 1.3 percent at 758 yen and Sony Corp down 0.7 percent to 5,520 yen. Among auto makers, Toyota managed to cling to positive territory, edging up 0.8 percent to 6,440 yen, although off the day's high of 6,500 yen. But Nissan Motor Co fell 2.6 percent to 1,260 yen and Honda Motor lost 0.2 percent to 4,120 yen. Banks, which had gained in morning trade on bargain hunting, also fell, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group slipping 2.5 percent to 821,000 yen and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group falling 2.2 percent to 998 yen. Trade was moderate, with 2 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, compared with last week's daily average of 2.1 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by nearly seven to o
