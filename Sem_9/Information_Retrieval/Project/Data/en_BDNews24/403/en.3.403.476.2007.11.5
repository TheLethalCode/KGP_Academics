<TITLE> EC has to invite us with no court bar: Hafizuddin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The acting BNP secretary general Monday said the Election Commission would have to invite them to talks since the High Court did not clamp curbs on EC about the invite. Major (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed told reporters that he hoped that the EC would write to them after reviewing the party's charter and pointed out that the court had only sought explanation from the top polls office. The court, following a writ appeal by deposed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, in a ruling Sunday asked the government and the EC to explain in two weeks why the pro-Delwar BNP representatives would not be invited to the electoral dialogue. But Hafiz demanded that they should be allowed represent the mainstream of BNP and claimed that they had the legitimate right to sit with the EC. "The standing committee is operating the party in absence of the chairperson," he said, referring to the policymaking wing of the troubled party appointing him as acting secretary general and senior leader M Saifur Rahman as acting chief on Oct 30. Hafiz, however, claimed there were no divisions in the party. "There are some differences of opinions only about the reform proposals for the party," he said abrasively. He asked party followers not to be confused by any misleading propaganda. He also brushed aside the statement given by 122 former MPs in favor of Delwar. "A good number of ex-lawmakers told me by phone that they had no link to the statement although their names are in it. The former MPs have full confidence in the committee headed by acting chairperson Saifur Rahman." bdnews24.com
