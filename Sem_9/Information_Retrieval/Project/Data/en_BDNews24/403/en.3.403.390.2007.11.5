<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) Saudi Arabia Monday said it had committed 60,000 tonnes of rice in aid to Bangladesh to help 2.1 million families affected by recent floods. Saudi Arabia imported 60,000 tonnes of rice from a third country straight to Bangladesh. "The shipment will be distributed through the government," Mohammad Bin Abdur Rahman Al-Muqualib, director general of Saudi Arabia's finance ministry, told reporters after a meeting with foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain in the foreign ministry Monday. The rice consignment has already reached Bangladesh. A three-member Saudi delegation will oversee the distribution of the rice by government agencies. The delegation is now in Dhaka. Al-Muqualib handed over the import documentation to Touhid. "We said that our people needed rice. The Saudi government agreed to provide 5 million dollars' worth," Touhid told the reporters. This is the second Saudi Arabian relief effort for those affected by flooding in August-September. Earlier, Saudi Arabia provided five cargo-plane loads of aid. bdn
