 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Visitors Barisal and Rajshahi held the superior position against Dhaka and Chittagong at the close of Day 3 of the third round four-dayer in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Sunday. Hosts Dhaka, bundled out for 157 in the first innings, were trailing by 39 runs in the second innings after Barisal declared their first innings at 304 for nine at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Defending champions Dhaka were 108 for four at stumps with Shamsur Rahman Shuvo and Mahmuddullah Riad batting on 15 and 5. Away at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, pacer Mohammad Shahazada captured five wickets as visitors Rajshahi took an overall 155-run lead against Chittagong after bowling the hosts out for just 115. Rajshahi, bowled out for 192 in the first innings, were 78 for one at stumps in the second innings with Nayeemuddin and Khaled Mashud remaining unbeaten on 26 and 6. Rains once again interrupted the Khulna-Sylhet match Sunday which was heading for a dull draw at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Dhaka vs Barisal On the third day, Barisal added 89 runs to their overnight total of 215 for four to declare their first innings at 304 for nine, taking 147 runs lead against Dhaka in the first innings. Talha Jubair quickfired 29 off 47 balls hitting three fours and one six to help Barisal cross the 300-mark before overnight batsman Raisul scored 35. Mosharraf Hossain Rubel was the most successful Dhaka bowler to return with three for 40 while Mohammad Sharif and Mohammad Ashraful grabbed two wickets each for 45 and 86. In the second innings too, Dhaka faced trouble in losing top four batsmen  Javed Omar (24), Mehrab Hossain Jr (19), Al Shahriar (17) and Mohammad Ashraful (27), and they still need 39 runs to send Barisal to bat again. To avoid the first defeat, Dhaka batsmen would certainly want to stick to the wicket throughout the final day. Rajshahi vs Chittagong It was tough for Chittagong batsmen to face lanky pacer Shahazada, who sent Nafis Iqbal (2), Nazimuddin (10) and Aftab Ahmed (0) back in a row to reduce Chittagong to 40 for three, and the host never stood straight. After the Shahazada incursion, medium pacer Farhad Reza broke the middle order to return with three for 20. Shahazada finally wrapped the Chittaong innings to return with an impressive figure of five for 24. Tareq Aziz, who earlier removed the last batsman of Rajshahi to restrict them to 192 all out, topscored with 35, followed by Sabbir Khan's 21. Khulna vs Sylhet Sylhet, having resumed the day on six for no loss, lost their both openers Golam Rahman (7) and Golam Mabud (3) as Khulna pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza removed both Golam brothers. However, Sylhet captain Rajin Saleh and Mushfiqur Rahim took their side to 105 for three from 27 for two before Rajin was out by Ziaur Rahman for 54 off 109 balls featuring 10 fours. Then Mushfiqur and Alok Kapali remained unbeaten on 47 and 25 when the bad light forced to stop the play after the tea break.
