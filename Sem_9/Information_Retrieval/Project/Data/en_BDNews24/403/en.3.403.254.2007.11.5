 LONDON, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Darfur faces new dangers from tribal battles and splintering rebel groups if no political process is launched to establish peace in western Sudan, the United Nations envoy to Darfur said on Monday. "I have seen myself the desperation, the anger, the frustration in the camps. I have seen also the beginning of tribal battles, fighting over land," Jan Eliasson told BBC radio. "And all these factors lead me to the conclusion that we have to now really take advantage of the beginning of a political process." Eliasson said he was hopeful, despite the absence of several rebel groups from peace stalks begun in Libya last month, that most rebels would join the talks shortly and the prospects for a political solution were good.

In some cases, experts say, the rebel command structure has broken down to the point that the groups represent no constituency and are nothing more than bandits. At the start of the talks, the government declared an immediate unilateral truce, but the absence of key rebels cast doubt on whether it could be implemented.

The SLA leader has said he would not attend talks until a UN force had deployed and provided security, a condition that could take more than a year to finalise. "He has important standing in the camps," said Eliasson. "We hope very much that he will make it possible for the voices of the camps to be hear
