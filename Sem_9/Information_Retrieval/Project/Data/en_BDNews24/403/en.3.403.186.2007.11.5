<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven-times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong reached his New York City Marathon goal on Sunday, by breaking two hours, 50 minutes in his second race over the distance. Armstrong, who retired from cycling after his 2005 Tour victory, ran 2:46:43, nearly 13 minutes faster than his marathon debut here last year of 2:59:36. "I think I came in better prepared," said Armstrong, who fittingly wore a yellow jersey in the race through New York's five boroughs. "I feel better than I did last year leaving here. Last year it took me about four or five months to actually be able to run again because of my shins." "Last year I had no idea what to expect with 26.2 miles (42.16 km), and I paid for it. "I'll continue to run," said the 36-year-old, who was unofficially the 698th to cross the finish line among the 39,085 runners that started the race. "For me running is the best type of workout right now because with a busy lifestyle and travel, all you need is a pair of running shoes and you can do it in any city in the world." Armstrong headed a marathon 'team' of more than 130 runners contributing to support cancer research. He overcame the disease to win the Tour de France for the first time in 1999
