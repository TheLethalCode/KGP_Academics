 HONG KONG, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks on Tuesday recouped some of their losses, a day after a broad sell-off, with property stocks gaining ground amid an outlook brightened by recent rate cuts and bullish broker calls. The day's top traded stock, Alibaba.com nearly tripled its share price, China's top e-commerce firm exceeding expectations on its debut after it raised $1.47 billion in Hong Kong's most popular initial public offering. Alibaba.com shares gathered momentum throughout the session, ending at HK$39.5, near their intraday high for a 193 percent gain above their HK$13.50 IPO price, valuing them at more than 300 times this year's earnings. "I suppose people are drawing parallels between Google and Internet valuations and that's proving to be a benchmark," said Miles Remington, sales trading director at BNP Paribas. "What seems like crazy valuations today may not be tomorrow. However, on the first day of trade, it does look overbought." The benchmark Hang Seng Index see-sawed between positive and negative terrain, earlier testing the 28,500 support level. It finished up 1.7 percent, or 495.81 points, at 29,438.13 on mainboard turnover of HK$169.6 billion (US$21.7 billion) compared to Monday's HK$158.8 billion. The China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed mainland shares gained 1.1 percent to 18,484.50. Tuesday's rebound ended two straight sessions of declines, and came a day after Hong Kong blue chips posting their worst loss in six years. The fall was sparked by comments over the weekend by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who cited numerous preconditions for the launch of a programme allowing mainlanders to invest directly in Hong Kong stocks. "The direction (of the market) is not so clear right now," said Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities. "What I'm sure of is that we're in a correction phase. The momentum will be decreasing gradually. If the market goes up, it will not be as easy to sustain (as before). If it goes down, the selling pressure won't be that great. We'll probably be locked in range for November." Property shares were among the day's top gainers, with the Hang Seng Property sub-index surging 5.8 percent. Bargain hunters picked up shares battered in Monday's sell-off, with Cheung Kong (Holdings) bolting 7.5 percent to HK$142.80. Sun Hung Kai Properties shot up 6.6 percent to HK$141.6. Merrill Lynch released a voluminous research report on the sector on Tuesday, saying it was "maximum bullish" on Hong Kong's residential sector because a structural housing shortage and rising incomes could raise home prices 50 percent by the end of 2009. Mainland lenders also recovered some of Monday's lost ground, with Bank of Communications leading the way with a 7.4 percent gain to HK$13.04. Bank of China was close behind, vaulting 5.3 percent to HK$4.81. Some China plays continued to decline, with oil producer PetroChina Co Ltd dropping 2.8 percent to HK$17.5. CNOOC Ltd slid 2 percent to HK$14.50. (US$1=HK$7
