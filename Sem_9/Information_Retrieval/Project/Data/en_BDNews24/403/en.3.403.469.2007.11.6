 LONDON, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The state of emergency in Pakistan breaks international law and human rights standards enshrined in the constitution, Amnesty International said on Monday. Condemning Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency on Saturday and decision to suspend the constitution, the human rights group called for an immediate return to constitutional rule and the release of hundreds of detainees. "General Musharraf's actions constitute a direct assault on Pakistan's judiciary, its vibrant human rights community, independent media and peaceful political dissent," Irene Khan, Amnesty secretary-general, said in a statement. "Measures that have been portrayed as necessary to protect Pakistan are in fact a wholesale abrogation of fundamental human rights protections and dismantle the very institutions and checks and balances that underpin the country's stability." Musharraf cited spiralling militancy and hostile judges to justify his decision to impose emergency rule. Amnesty International said Musharraf had suspended the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of life and key elements of the right to a fair trial. "Under international law and human rights standards, reflected in the Constitution of Pakistan, these rights must be fully and unconditionally respected in all circumstances, whether or not a public emergency exists," it said. Amnesty fears emergency rule "will exacerbate existing patterns of human rights abuse, including torture and other ill-treatment, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and use of excessive force to suppress peaceful dissent," Khan said. Musharraf has imposed reporting curbs on the media in a bid to stop outrage spilling onto the streets amid Pakistan's biggest crisis since he took power in a 1999 coup.
