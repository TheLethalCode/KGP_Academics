 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Monday sentenced wife and son of former BNP MP Salauddin Ahmed each to eight years in jail for not paying tax and concealing information on undeclared assets. The court handed down five years for hiding wealth statement and another three years for suppressing wealth information. The convicts, however, are to each serve five years in prison as the punishment on both counts would run at the same time. The verdict will be come in force from the day they are arrested or surrender. Both of them are evading arrest.
