 Dhaka, Nov 06 (bdnews24.com) -- India has asked Bangladesh to formally request a withdrawal of its export ban on food essentials such as rice, said a senior commerce ministry official after a two-day joint-secretary level meeting on trade. Bangladesh also responded positively to the Indian trade delegation's request for removal of its export ban on Hilsa fish. "India's ban on the export of rice, and some other essentials, is not country-specific. The move was taken after a fall in production," Abdul Wahab Mian, joint secretary at the Ministry of Commerce, told reporters after the meeting. "We have informed them of our concerns," said Mian, following the conclusion of the fifth joint working group on trade between the two countries. The sharp rise in domestic demand for consumables following the recent flooding in India pushed the authorities to impose the ban, said Mian, quoting the Indian delegation. India also assured Bangladesh that they would endorse the recognition of 'quality certificates' for products issued by Bangladeshi laboratories seeking access to the Indian market. "An Indian delegation visited the Bangladesh Standards Testing Institute last September to evaluate the quality of testing at the institution," Mian said. Some Bangladeshi products such as leather, cement, fruits and processed food may gain market access to India, provided India recognises the domestic certificates. The Indian delegation, headed by joint secretary of commerce Rajeev Kher, also agreed to allow some 101 Bangladeshi products zero-tariff status from Jan 2008, which were previously on their sensitive list. The move complies with their commitment to provide duty-free access to products from least developed countries under Safta, a trade agreement between eight South Asian countries. The Bangladesh team also urged India to remove non-tariff and para-tariff barriers for the export of Bangladeshi products such as betel nuts, Jamdani saris, dry-cell batteries and toiletry products. According to the commerce ministry, India is the second largest trading partner of Bangladesh after China, in terms of both imports and exports. Bangladesh currently imports Indian products worth approximately $2 billion a year, while it exports less than $300 million worth to India. bd
