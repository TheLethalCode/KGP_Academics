 SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil jumped more than a dollar, rebounding to above $95 a barrel on Tuesday, as Asian stock markets steadied and traders bet that falling US inventories and the approaching winter could help restart oil's rally. US light crude for December delivery rose $1.23 to $95.21 a barrel by 0647 GMT, climbing back toward the record-high of $96.24 touched last week after tumbling on Monday on the prospect of more fallout from the US subprime crisis. London Brent crude jumped $1.26 to $91.75 a barrel. Asian stock markets eked out gains early on Tuesday after tumbling world markets dragged oil $2 lower just a day earlier, with traders fearing the subprime crisis could temper economic growth and oil demand in the world's top consumer. Citigroup, the largest US bank, said it was unable to assure investors a potential $11 billion write-down for subprime mortgages will not increase. Tokyo's Nikkei stock market average gained 0.5 percent on Tuesday, recovering some ground after a 1.5 percent slide, while US markets had also clawed back some losses late on Monday. "Today the stock market is steady, which is supporting NYMEX," said Ken Hasegawa, commodity derivatives sales manager of Fimat Japan Inc. Crude's surge from below $70 in mid-August has been aided by the weak dollar and speculative inflows into oil and other commodities, and extended lately by a renewed focus on signs of thinning oil supplies ahead of peak winter demand. US crude oil stocks are expected to have fallen by another 1.6 million barrels last week due to disruptions to short-haul Mexican shipments, a preliminary Reuters poll found. Stocks normally rise heading into the winter peak season. Distillate inventories were seen falling by 700,000 barrels and gasoline stocks by 100,000 barrels. Inventories in Japan, the world's third-largest consumer, are also running below comfort levels. "The temperatures in December in the north are expected to be below normal, so that is also a concern for us with the low inventories," said Hasegawa. US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said current prices were a "terrible problem" for consumers, adding he hoped oil producer group OPEC would ramp up output to ease prices, although most cartel officials have rejected that call. Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez on Monday echoed other officials, saying high prices were due to speculation and geopolitical tensions, not a shortfall in supplies. Markets have been eyeing tensions in the Middle East including a recent flare-up between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, although signs of a softening tone added to the market's sell-off a day ago, analysts said. Iraq said on Saturday it was ready to arrest Kurdish guerrilla leaders responsible for cross-border raids to avert a major incursion, while US President Bush told Turkey's leader he was committed to countering the militants.
