<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's incoming government is ready to continue talks with the United States on a missile defence system but wants to engage European partners in the process, prime minister in waiting Donald Tusk said on Tuesday. Tusk, whose centre-right Civic Platform party won parliamentary elections last month, said Poland and the European Union had to see clear security benefits for Warsaw to agree to host the "missile shield". "We don't have a rigid doctrine on this issue. We are open to arguments for and against (the shield)," Tusk told a briefing for foreign journalists. "If the missile shield is going to increase our security, we will be open to negotiations. If we judge jointly with our partners in the EU and NATO that this project is ambiguous, we will have to consider that." The United States want to place an anti-missile battery in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic as part of a planned global system able to shoot down nuclear missiles from potentially hostile countries such as Iran. Washington argues the shield will protect Europe as much as the United States but the plan has run into vehement opposition from Russia, unsettling some EU governments who fear a return of an arms race on the continent. Poland's outgoing cabinet of Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, as well as his twin brother Lech, the president, have dismissed such concerns. They refused to seek broader EU support for the shield, arguing it was a bilateral issue. They presented the shield almost as a done deal even though detailed negotiations were still going on in the run-up to the Oct. 21 election, in which Tusk's Civic Platform defeated the Kaczynskis' conservatives. Tusk has already signalled he would rebalance Poland's foreign policy more towards the European Union although he stressed on Tuesday the United States remained a strategic ally for the ex-communist nation. "The future government will consistently continue the strategy of very close ties with the United States," Tusk told a briefing for foreign journalists. TIGHTROPE WALK Analysts say Tusk faces a tightrope walk as under the Polish constitution he will have to cooperate on foreign policy with the EU-sceptical and staunchly pro-U.S. president, whose term does not end until 2010. Kaczynski is due to nominate Tusk for prime minister this week but they have already aired their differences on foreign policy issues such as keeping Polish troops in Iraq. Tusk reiterated on Tuesday he will seek a pullout next year, while the Kaczynskis have argued against setting a rigid deadline. Tusk and Kaczynski were due to meet later on Tuesday to discuss the formation of the next government, which could be ready next week. They were also due to talk about Iraq, the missile shield and whether the new prime minister or the president should represent Poland at the December EU summit in Lisbon, due to approve the revised EU trea
