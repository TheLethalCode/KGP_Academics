 BAGHDAD, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five US soldiers were killed in two separate roadside bomb attacks in Iraq on Monday, the US military said, making 2007 the deadliest year for U.S. forces in the country. The deaths took the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq this year to 851, according to icasualties.org, an independent Web site that monitors US troop deaths. The worst previous year was 2004, when 849 deaths were recorded. In total, 3,854 US soldiers have been killed since the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Web site icasualties said 38 US soldiers were killed in October, the lowest death toll since March 2006. The deadliest month so far in 2007 was May, when 126 US soldiers were killed, and the deadliest quarter was April to June, when 331 died. US forces completed their build-up of an extra 30,000 troops in mid-June and swiftly launched a series of military operations against al Qaeda in Iraq, other Sunni Arab militants and Shi'ite militia groups around Baghdad. Troops were moved out of their large bases into smaller combat outposts in neighbourhoods. Soldiers also went into areas previously viewed as no-go zones, exposing them to frequent roadside bomb and sniper attacks that took a deadly to
