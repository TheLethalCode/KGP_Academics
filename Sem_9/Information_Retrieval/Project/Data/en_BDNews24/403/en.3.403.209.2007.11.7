 New York, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New York City's real-life Mr Big -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- is set to star as himself in "Sex and the City: The Movie." Bloomberg will film an appearance in the movie at Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday evening, his spokesman Stu Loeser said in a statement. He gave no other details about the mayor's role in the movie. Filming of the movie, based on the Emmy-winning HBO television series, began in September with Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon returning to reprise their respective roles as Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. The hit TV series, which ended in 2004 after six seasons, was based on the work of best-selling author Candace Bushnell. It followed the tales of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker), a fashion-conscious New York columnist who writes about dating. Chris Noth plays Mr. Big, Bradshaw's frustrating commitment-phobic love interest. Bloomberg is following in the footsteps of former New York Mayor Ed Koch, who made dozens of television and film appearances, including a role playing himself in a "Sex and the City" episode in 2001. U.S. presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, a Republican who was Bloomberg's predecessor as New York mayor, appeared on "Law & Order" and "Seinfeld.
