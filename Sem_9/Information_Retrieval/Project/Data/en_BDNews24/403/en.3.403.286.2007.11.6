<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar said on Tuesday he did not want to take on the job of India's test captain again at present. "I don't feel right about it at the moment," Tendulkar was quoted as saying by the CNN-IBN news channel, two days before selectors meet to name Rahul Dravid's successor. Batting great Tendulkar, 34, and one-day captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni were in the frame for the job after Dravid relinquished the post two months ago, saying he wanted to focus on his batting. Tendulkar has led India twice before without much success. Selectors, who postponed a decision on the captaincy last month, must now decide whether to hand the test reins to Dhoni, 26, who led a young team to success at the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Keeper-batsman Dhoni's leadership abilities were lauded during the home series against Australia which the visitors won 4-2 but he has played in just 20 tests since his debut in December 2005
