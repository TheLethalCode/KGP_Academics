 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Monday she believed a US-led conference would launch Palestinian statehood talks and voiced hope for a deal before President George W Bush leaves office. "I am very pleased that we now seem to be moving towards an an understanding that Annapolis can indeed be the launching pad for serious, sustained, continuous negotiations that will lead to the establishment of two states living side-by-side in peace," Rice told a news conference. Rice said the gathering, in Annapolis, Maryland, would take place "before the end of the year" but again gave no final date, a sign that Israel and the Palestinians were still at odds over how to proceed in a new chapter of US-brokered peacemaking. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, standing at her side, sounded a note of caution, saying at the news conference: "Negotiations are difficult and will remain difficult until the last minute but there are encouraging things taking place. He said the Annapolis meeting presented a "genuine opportunity" for peace. Setting a timeframe for a peace deal, a Palestinian demand that Israel opposes and Washington has not embraced, is a key point of contention as Israel and the Palestinians try to put together a joint document to be presented at the conference.

Rice said the creation of a Palestinian state was "everyone's goal". Rice and Israeli leaders have said it was more important what happened after the Annapolis meeting, when tough negotiations on issues such as borders and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees are expected to begin. "There is more talk about the day-after now than I have heard in any of my other trips here," Rice said on Sunday, at the start of her two-day visit. Abbas, whose Fatah faction lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas Islamists in June, said at the news conference he was seeking the release of more Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. An Israeli government official said Israel was weighing the matter. Israel freed 250 prisoners in July and another 86 in October. The release of prisoners is highly emotive for Palestinians, who regard their nearly 11,000 brethren held in Israeli jails as fighters against occupation. Many Israelis fear such amnesties encourage Palestinian militants to strike aga
