 DAMASCUS, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria on Tuesday condemned US sanctions against two influential officials accused by Washington of undermining Lebanon's sovereignty and described the action as "pitiful". Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, a general dealing with security, and Colonel Hafiz Makhluf, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad, were the latest Syrian officials targeted by the US Treasury Department on Monday. Washington said the two were linked to Syrian efforts to "undermine Lebanon's democratic process" and support what it termed international terrorism. Two Lebanese were blacklisted for the same reason. "This pitiful decision is not targeted against individuals as much as it is aimed at exerting pressure on Syria and Lebanon to bow to the US project," a statement from the office of Vice President Farouq al-Shara said. "It shows the failure of the US administration in the Middle East and its inability to score a single achievement in Iraq, Palestine or Lebanon," the statement said. The new sanctions prohibit American nationals from doing business with Khayrbik and Makhluf and freeze any US assets they may have. Khayrbik, an adviser to Shara with close ties to Assad, worked on strengthening Syria's alliance with the Shi'ite movement Hezbollah in the period when Damascus managed Lebanese politics and maintained an armed presence in Lebanon. The US Treasury said Khayrbik met regularly with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last year. Syrian forces ended a 29-year presence in Lebanon under international pressure after the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese premier Rafik al-Hariri, but the United States says Syria has continued to interfere in Lebanon. Syria rejects the accusation and says US backing for pro-Israeli and anti-Syrian politicians is destabilising Lebanon. Washington imposed economic sanctions on Syria in 2004, mainly over its support for Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. It has since blacklisted several Syrian officials, including Assef Shawkat, Assad's brother-in-law and one of Syria's most powerful men. Khayrbik and Makhluf were blacklisted two days after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Syria not to interfere in Lebanon's presidential elections. Syria said Rice was against efforts that it backs to chose a comprise candidate acceptable to pro-Syrian opposition parties and the pro-US government
