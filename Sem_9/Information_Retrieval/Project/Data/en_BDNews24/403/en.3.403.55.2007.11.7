 ISLAMABAD, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities have stopped sales of satellite dishes in two Pakistani cities to block access to private news channels, salesmen said on Wednesday. The channels were taken off air on Saturday after the government imposed emergency rule, leaving only state television to run and re-run President Pervez Musharraf's address to the nation justifying his decision.

Hours after declaring emergency rule, Musharraf came out with sweeping reporting curbs to rein in the media. Under the new rules, the media is prohibited from broadcasting or publishing statements ridiculing him, top government officials and the military, on pain of up to three years' jail or fines up to 10 million rupees ($167,000).
