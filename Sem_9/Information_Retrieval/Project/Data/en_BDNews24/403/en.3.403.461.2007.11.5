 ISLAMABAD, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States embassy in Islamabad said it was "gravely concerned" by the curbs placed on Pakistani media and detentions of lawyers, politicians and rights activists following the imposition of emergency rule. "We urge the government of Pakistan to quickly lift the detention orders and immediately permit broadcasters to resume their programming, thereby ensuring that all citizens can take a constructive role in peaceful progress toward democratic elections," the embassy said in a statement released on Sunday evening.
