 BEIJING, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union would like a worldwide alert system to warn of food safety problems, a senior EU official said on Tuesday, adding it was still worried about weaknesses in the Chinese surveillance network. The quality of Chinese products has aroused international concern following a series of scandals involving tainted or substandard goods, including toys, pet food, fish and medicine. The European Union already has what it calls a Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), which notifies not only member states but other countries of problem goods so they can remove them from the shelves and protect consumers.

"We need a more integrated information exchange network on the national level to ensure food safety and a rapid response," he said, adding China welcomed international help. Yet, Europe was also worried about confusion in China's food safety command chain, said Raimondo Serra, agricultural counsellor at the European Commission delegation in Beijing. "The other element that can sometimes show weaknesses is the number of agencies responsible for food safety in China at different stages of the chain, and this can sometimes create problems," he said. China needed a more rounded approach to food safety, Serra added. "The European approach is from the farm to the fork," he said. "Sometimes in China there is much more emphasis on the final product instead of the raw materia
