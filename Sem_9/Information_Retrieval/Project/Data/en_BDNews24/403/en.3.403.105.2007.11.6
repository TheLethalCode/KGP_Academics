<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sent controversial businessman Nayeem Mehtab Chowdhury into five-day remand, a day after he was arrested on charges of misappropriating Tk 46 crore in loans by forgery. Metropolitan magistrate Golam Rabbani rejected an appeal by defence counsels for bail, and issued the order for remand after a RAB official sought seven days to quiz Nayeem. The RAB Monday arrested Nayeem, the managing director of World Communications Investment that operates WorldTel Bangladesh, on charges of misappropriating the money by forging the signature of a bank-loan guarantor. Nayeem was the managing director of World Communications Investment, but he introduced himself as the managing director of WorldTel Bangladesh to get the loans, according to case details. The case was filed by WorldTel Bangladesh chairman Amjad H Khan on June 11, 2007 with Motijheel Police Station. RAB-3 official Mohammad Abdul Awal, also the investigating officer of the case, Tuesday placed the case details in the magistrate's court and pleaded for remand to extract more information about the alleged fraud. Awal argued that they need to question the accused to know details about his accomplices. The officer said the Embassy of the United Sates in Dhaka helped unearth the fraud by verifying the signature of the chairman of telecoms company WorldTel Holdings. The RAB Monday claimed that Nayeem admitted his offences, saying former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar had "directly helped" him. Nayeem had allegedly taken Tk 15 crore in loans from the head office of Sonali Bank and Tk 31 crore from the National Bank of Pakistan in Motijheel to buy fixed-telephone network equipment. At Monday's press conference in the RAB-3 office in Tikatuli, commanding officer Sultan Mohammad Nurani had said that Nayeem had cited the chairman of telecoms company WorldTel Holdings as guarantor for the loans. A police investigation found that the signature of the WorldTel Holdings chief and the one submitted by Nayeem were not the same, Nurani said. WorldTel obtained the country's first private-sector fixed phone operating licence in what appeared to be a controversial manner at the twilight of the Awami League rule in 2001. But the company failed to launch its services due to shareholders' conflict over controlling issues. bdnew
