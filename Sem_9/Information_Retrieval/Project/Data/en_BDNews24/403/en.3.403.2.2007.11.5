 Dhaka, Nov 05 (bdnews24.com) -- The Rapid Action Battalion Monday arrested a businessman on charges of misappropriating Tk 46 crore by forging the signature of a bank-loan guarantor. Nayeem Mehtab Chowdhury, the arrested businessman and the managing director of World Communications Investment that operates WorldTel in Bangladesh, admitted that he had committed the offences and former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar "directly helped" him. At a press conference in the RAB-3 office in Tikatuli Monday, commanding officer Sultan Mohammad Nurani said that Nayeem had cited the chairman of telecoms company WorldTel Holdings as guarantor for the loans. Nayeem was allowed to speak to reporters when he was paraded before them. Nurani said Nayeem took Tk 15 crore in loans from the head office of Sonali Bank and Tk 31 crore from the National Bank of Pakistan in Motijheel to buy fixed-telephone network equipment. "Nayeem later misappropriated the money," Nurani alleged. WorldTel Bangladesh Limited chairman Amjad H Khan filed a case against Nayeem on June 11, 2007 with Motijheel Police Station. An investigation found that the signature of the WorldTel Holdings chief and the one submitted by Nayeem were not the same, Nurani said. Nayeem said a man named Badal helped him meet Babar in Singapore and their "relationship grew". The RAB officer said Nayeem was the managing director of World Communications Investment, but he introduced himself as the managing director of WorldTel Bangladesh. WorldTel obtained the country's first private-sector fixed phone operating licence in what appeared to be a controversial manner at the twilight of the Awami League rule in 2001. But the company failed to launch its services due to shareholders' conflict over controlling issues. WorldTel was created with the blessings of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) with an objective of rolling out telecoms infrastructure in the rural areas of underdeveloped countries. But the company deviated from its philosophy and pursued the venture of deploying 3,000 telephones in Dhaka city and its adjacent areas. bdnews24.
