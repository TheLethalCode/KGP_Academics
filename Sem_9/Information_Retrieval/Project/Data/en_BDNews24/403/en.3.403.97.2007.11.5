 BRUSSELS, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov began a visit to Brussels on Monday to discuss closer energy ties and a leading Turkmen rights group urged the European Union to link any agreements to civil liberties. Berdymukhamedov, in power almost a year since the death of Saparmurat Niyazov, is seeking to reduce his gas-rich nation's export dependence on Russia and has vowed to open up to foreign investment and liberalise key sectors. The EU is keen to reduce its dependency on Russian supply by boosting ties with Central Asia, a strategy that has raised concerns given the rights records of countries in the region. The Vienna-based Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR) said closer ties would be beneficial for both sides but stressed that conditions for Turkmens remained "appalling". "We are concerned with the fact that Turkmenistan remains a totalitarian state with a single-party political system and non-transparent economy," it said in a statement. "We call for the leaders of the European Union to link all potential agreements with the President of Turkmenistan to the feasible positive reforms in the area of human rights..." The TIHR was set up by prominent Turkmen rights campaigner Farid Tukhbatullin, now exiled in Europe. In Brussels, Berdymukhamedov is to meet European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and the commissioners for external relations, trade and energy. He will also meet EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and officials of NATO. The Turkmen group said rights of Turkmens remained curtailed despite the change in leadership. "...the activities of mass media, non-governmental organisations, religious associations, trade unions in Turkmenistan are not only controlled by the state, but in practice are governed by the governmental agencies." Amnesty International urged the European Union to call on Turkmenistan to meet its rights obligations, including the release of dissidents and granting access to rights monitors. The EU, which buys a quarter of its gas from Russia, is keen to persuade Turkmenistan to join the long-delayed 4.6 billion euro ($6.7 billion) Nabucco pipeline project, at the centre of its efforts to diversify energy supplies away from Russia. Russia buys most of Turkmenistan's gas at below market prices and Berdymukhamedov has expressed willingness to heed Western calls to explore new export routes. The state Turkmen Khabarlary news agency, which conveys the official line, said last week Berdymukhamedov saw Europe as "a key priority in Turkmenistan's foreign strategy". "The visit...will pave the way for a new phase in Turkmenistan's partnership with EU member states," it said. He has irritated Russia by courting the West but has not ruled out deepening ties with Russia as well as other traditional regional players. On Sunday, he is due to receive Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Ashgab
