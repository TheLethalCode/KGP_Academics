 LONDON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Wednesday, hitting a fresh all-time low against the euro and a basket of currencies after comments from senior Chinese officials stirred concerns the central bank might shift reserves away from the US currency. The euro surged versus the dollar after a senior Chinese politician said China should balance its forex reserves so that strong currencies like the euro offset the weaker dollar. The greenback was also put under pressure after a Chinese central bank official said the dollar is losing its status as the major global currency. "A lot of chat out of China pushed the dollar to new levels," said Geoff Kendrick, currency strategist at Westpac. "It will take something significant to turn it around, people are selling the dollar at every opportunity." The euro rose as high as $1.4663 according to Reuters data, before easing to $1.4630 by 0836, still up half a percent on the day. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a basket of major currencies, touched a record low of 75.490. bdnews24.com/lq/1539hrs The dollar also fell 0.7 percent to 113.85 yen, around two-week lows. Sterling rose to a fresh 26-year high above $2.0950. The currencies of natural resource-rich countries such as Australia and Canada were the biggest gainers from a rally in commodities that pushed gold to a 28-year high and U.S. crude oil futures to a record high above $98. AUSSIE, LOONIE AT HIGHS The Australian dollar hit a 23-year high after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised rates by 25 basis points to an 11-year high of 6.75 percent and said inflation would likely be above its 2-3 percent comfort zone by the first quarter of 2008. Market players said the RBA's statement suggested the central bank may raise rates further and gave a boost to the Australian dollar, which climbed as high as US$0.9389. The Canadian dollar, which is at its strongest since the 1880s against the dollar, rose to a new high at 90.83 Canadian cents. "We believe ... that the market has taken refuge in these currencies given the general desire for credible stores of value at a time of great uncertainty," said Bank of New York Mellon in a note to clients. The euro was also supported by lingering market expectations for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in December, and for the European Central Bank to keep euro zone interest rates steady for a while. US federal funds futures pricing on Tuesday implied a roughly 65 percent chance of a Fed rate cut in December. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank will announce policy decisions later on Thursday and are expected to hold interest rates steady. The BoE is expected to keep them at 5.75 percent
