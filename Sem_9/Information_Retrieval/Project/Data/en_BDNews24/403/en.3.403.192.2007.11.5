<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi came off the bench in the second half to earn Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan in Turin on Sunday. Camoranesi, on for captain Alessandro Del Piero, found the net from the centre of the penalty area in the 77th minute after Vincenzo Iaquinta's header. Inter took the lead in the 41st minute through Argentine striker Julio Cruz, who controlled midfielder Cesar's defence-splitting pass with his chest and slotted the ball past Italy keeper Gianluigi Buffon. Inter have 25 points from 11 games, two points more than second-placed Fiorentina, who won 1-0 at Lazio on Saturday. AS Roma dropped to third with 22 points after being held 2-2 at struggling Empoli earlier on Sunday. Juve are fourth with 21 points. "When you don't take your chances you end up drawing and sometimes you risk losing," Inter coach Roberto Mancini told Sky television. "I'm sorry we didn't wrap up the match because we were deserving the win. It'll be a lesson for us for the future." Anticipation among fans was high for the first meeting between the bitter rivals since Juve were demoted for match-fixing two seasons ago and stripped of the 2005/06 title, which was awarded to Inter. Del Piero had a penalty appeal turned down in the fifth minute, when Ivn Crdoba appeared to hold him in the area, and he forced a save out of Julio Csar in the 25th with a powerful free kick. Former Juve striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the chance to double the lead three minutes after Cruz's opener, but the Swede's control let him down when he was clean through on goal. After the break Ibrahimovic blasted a shot at Buffon from a good position, while Inter keeper Julio Csar did well to keep out a scuffed effort from David Trezeguet at the other end. Juve hurled themselves forward, frequently leaving themselves exposed to Inter's counter attacks, and were rewarded with Camoranesi's deserved equalizer. "It was a bit of an uphill battle, but we played with spirit," said Juve boss Claudio Ranieri. "Inter are better than us and so are some other teams, but we want to compete for the title. We have pride. We want to keep going as we are." At Empoli, Roma's French midfielder Ludovic Giuly opened the score in the 13th minute with a precise shot into the far corner after some neat passing at the edge of the box. Matteo Brighi headed in a cross from Brazilian winger Mancini to double the lead in the 32nd. Ighli Vannucchi pulled one back for Empoli with a long-distance strike in the 67th and Sebastian Giovinco stunned title contenders Roma with a splendid stoppage-time free kick. AC Milan, ninth with 14 points, are still looking for their first league win of the season at the San Siro after Saturday's goalless draw with Torino
