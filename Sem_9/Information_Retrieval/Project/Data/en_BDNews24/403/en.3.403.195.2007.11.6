 BEIJING, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A team of US technicians began disabling North Korea's nuclear complex on Monday under a multinational disarmament deal, the State Department said. Here is a timeline showing some key steps in the past 13 years of negotiations on North Korean nuclear disarmament: 1994: -- Oct. 21: The United States and North Korea sign deal known as Agreed Framework where Pyongyang freezes its nuclear arms programme in return for fuel oil and two civilian reactors. 2002: -- Oct: US confronts the North with evidence Washington says points to a covert uranium-enrichment programme. -- Dec: North Korea says it plans to restart its reactor.

Pyongyang calls confession a lie. Second round of six-party talks held in Beijing. -- June: Third round of talks. U.S. proposes fuel aid and security guarantees if Pyongyang scraps its nuclear programmes. 2005: -- Feb: North Korea officially says for the first time it has nuclear weapons, adding it is quitting six-way talks. -- Sept: North Korea promises to end its nuclear arms programme in exchange for aid, security guarantees and better diplomatic ties. 2006: -- July: North Korea test-fires seven missiles, including the long-range Taepodong-2. -- Oct: North Korea explodes its first nuclear device. 2007: -- Feb. 13: North Korea agrees to shut Yongbyon and allow nuclear inspectors to visit. -- July 16: International inspectors confirm North Korea has shut down Yongbyon. -- Oct 1: A tentative year-end deadline is set for disabling three facilities at Yongbyon. -- Nov 5: A team of U.S. technicians begin disabling the nuclear complex.
