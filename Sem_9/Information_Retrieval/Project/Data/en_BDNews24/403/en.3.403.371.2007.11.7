 LONDON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil stormed towards $99 a barrel on Wednesday, closing in on a triple-digit all-time high, driven by a slumping US dollar and concern about a fuel supply crunch heading into the peak demand winter season. The surge brings oil within a hair of the inflation-adjusted record peak of $101.70 hit in 1980 when war between OPEC producers Iran and Iraq ignited an oil supply crisis.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) flagged the risk to winter supply on Tuesday, saying stocks in industrialised nations would drop some 20 million barrels below the five-year average by the end of this year amid robust demand and continued caps on output from producer-group OPEC. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting countries, source of more than a third of the world's oil, has agreed to raise production by 500,000 bpd from Nov. 1 and shrugged off calls to expand on that, blaming the rally on speculators and politi
