<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Retired lieutenant general Mir Shawkat Ali Tuesday claimed that he was misquoted by newspapers when he was asked to comment on the house arrest of former president Ziaur Rahman. Shawkat said it was one captain Hafizullah not Hafizuddin Ahmed (BNP's new secretary general) who led a team to put Zia under house arrest on Nov 3, 1975. Shawkat who distanced himself from the BNP because of its links to Jamaat-e-Islami, Saturday was reported to have said that Hafizuddin had led the team to arrest Zia. In a statement Tuesday, Shawkat said he was "wrongly quoted" by the media, adding that he was not "on the scene" when Zia was arrested. He said he just told reporters Saturday that he had only heard about Hafizuddin's involvement. The retired army officer told bdnews24.com by phone that he phoned Hafizuddin, a retired major, Tuesday evening to clear his position on his previous statement to the media. Saturday's comment by Shawkat created a stir in the BNP as Hafizuddin was made the party's secretary general amid disapproval by another faction known as the followers of detained party chief Khaleda Zia. His Saturday comment came after a statement by Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah that Hafizuddin was involved with the army coup in 1975. bdnew
