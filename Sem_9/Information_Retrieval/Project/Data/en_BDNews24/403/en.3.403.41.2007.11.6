<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah Tuesday asked the Election Commission to withdraw invitation to acting secretary general Hafizuddin and threatened to move the court in a day or two if it did not. His demand came a day after the EC invited acting chief M Saifur Rahman-led BNP faction to the dialogue on electoral reforms slated for Nov 22. "The decision of the commission is illegal. Doubts will appear about whether a free and fair election is possible under the commission if they do not withdraw the letter," Hannan said to reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home. Claiming themselves as mainstream BNP, he said, "Khandaker Delwar Hossain is the secretary general of BNP under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. Those who the commission has sent letter to are not the mainstream." He said the Hafizuddin-run BNP faction had 'mugged' the leadership of the party with the aid of a certain quarter. The leaders and activists of BNP would reject the decision through movement, he claimed. Referring to EC secretary Md Humayun Kabir's briefing on Monday, Hannan said, "He gave false statements. No meeting of the standing committee was held on Oct 31. "The so-called reformists held their meeting on Oct 29. In that meeting a number of members of the standing committee were forced to put their signatures on a white paper." The retired brigadier general alleged that the draft of statement of the Oct 29 meeting was prepared by a certain quarter, without naming that 'quarter'. "A group has been plotting to defeat the nationalist forces since 1975. A plot was failed on Nov 3, 1975. Even Ershad could not split BNP. Now conspiracy is again going on against BNP," Hannan claimed. The EC has thrown itself into question by "getting involved in such intrigue", he said. He called upon party followers to offer tribute at the grave of late president and party founder Ziaur Rahman on Nov 7, the day the General led a coup by ordinary soldiers against the army's chain of command. "All should be aware so that no conspirer of the Nov 3 can go there tomorrow." bdnews2
