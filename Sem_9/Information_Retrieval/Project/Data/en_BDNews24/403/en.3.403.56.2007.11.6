<TITLE> First 'eco-conference' on Haor region slated for Dec 8-9 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, November 6 (bdnews24.com)NGOs and people of the Haor region have organised a two-day conference from Dec 8 to identify the ecological consequences of frequent flash floods in this northeastern area of the country. The first ever such conference has been arranged with a view to tackling the problems straddling the Haor region covering 48 upazilas of the country, conference convenor Mostafa Jabbar said Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference in Dhaka, Jabbar said the two major Bangladesh citadels of natural beauty and resources in the country are the Sundarbans and the Haors at the Garo foothills. The latter covers an extensive region encompassing Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazaar, Habiganj, Sunamganj and Brahmanbarhia. Submerged under water through eight months of the year, the major crop production of the Haor area is boro . But devastating flash floods, originating from Assam and Meghalaya hill ranges in India, are a recurrent phenomena causing immense damage to the standing boro crops, and endangering to lives and property every year. Erosion of riverbanks and silting of riverbeds also have immense impact on the ecology and water management in the area as flash floods are becoming more frequent. The envisaged development plan for the region, to be drawn up by the ensuing conference, will have to be implemented through correct policy and political will, Jabbar said. He said that about 20 papers on the region prepared by the four organising NGOs and local environmentalists will be presented at the conference. bdnews
