<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has not been included in the US government's 2007 Special 301 Report for copyright violations, a senior American embassy official in Dhaka said Tuesday. The inclusion in the list would have discouraged US investment, trade and commerce in Bangladesh. "Bangladesh is not in the US Watch List 2007," Heather Variava, chief of economic and commercial office in the US embassy, told bdnews24.com. She spoke at a press conference on the launch of a study on software piracy in Bangladesh conducted by IDC. American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh organised the briefing. IDC is a leading global market research and forecasting firm in the information technology industry. The IDC global software piracy study covers piracy of all packaged software that runs on personal computers, including desktops, laptops and ultra-portables. This includes operating system, system software, business applications and consumers applications. "Although Bangladesh has no obligation to follow the IPR strictly at the moment, we want to encourage Bangladesh to address the issue at an early stage," Heather said of the intellectual property rights. Bangladesh as a least-developed country is enjoying a waiver in the application of WTO copyright rules until 2013. Earlier, Bangladesh was put in the US 2007 Special 301 Report that provides Washington with an effective arsenal of trade and investment sanctions against foreign countries that it deems to have infringed its intellectual property rights by unabated piracy. Abdul Gafur, executive director of American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh, Roland Chan, marketing director for Asia of Business Software Alliance (BSA), which promotes a safe and legal digital world and Raisuddin Khan, copyright examiner, spoke at the function. Syed Ershad Ahmed, president of AmCham, was present. The IDC study 2006 finds 92 percent software piracy rate in Bangladesh, the fourth highest in the world. "This means that more than 9 out of 10 software installed on new personal computers in 2006 in Bangladesh was unlicensed or obtained illegally through software theft," the report said. The high software piracy rate has resulted in $90 million in retail revenue losses to the local industry, it found. The report stressed the need for government action against software piracy in Bangladesh. The speakers said education and awareness and pro-active government-led enforcement efforts only could curb piracy. b
