 Dhaka, Nov 05 (bdnews24.com) -- A two-day joint working group between Bangladesh and India got underway Monday in Dhaka to discuss mutual trade barriers and facilitate commerce between the two countries. Abdul Wahab Mian, joint secretary at the Ministry of Commerce, heads the Bangladesh team while Rajeev Kher, joint secretary at the Indian Department of Commerce, heads the visiting delegation. The meeting will discuss non-tariff and para-tariff barriers related to bilateral trade, the commerce ministry said in a statement. Para-tariff barriers are a compromise between full-tariffs and non-tariffs. The draft agenda of the meeting says Bangladesh has listed some 14 non-tariff and para-tariff barriers, including the approval of certificates issued by Bangladeshi testing laboratories for its export products and delays in issuing test certificates by Indian labs. Other barriers Bangladesh has raised for discussion are the ban on the export of pulses, onions and rice and India's restrictions on the import of betel nut from Bangladesh. Also on the agenda are the stringent requirements for registering drugs and compliance to the Food Adulteration Act 1954. India has listed nine technical barriers to trade, including a ban on the export of cotton yarn, milk powder, rice and sugar by land routes from India to Bangladesh. Also included are the ban on the export of Hilsa, the imposition of a travel tax by Bangladesh and the ban on importing some specified items through Narayanganj Port. According to commerce officials, Bangladesh will also ask the Indian delegation to improve inadequate infrastructure at land customs ports in India and allow Bangladeshi trucks to carry export cargo into Indian territory. A press briefing will be held on Tuesday after the talks have been completed. bd
