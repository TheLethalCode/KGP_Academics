 YAOUNDE, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon's football federation are refusing to accept Otto Pfister as their new coach, rejecting the announcement of his appointment by the country's sports ministry last week. FECAFOOT president Mohamed Iya has told sports minister Augustin Edjoa, who made the announcement, that the football federation would not sign a proposed contract with the 70-year-old German coach, local media reported on Monday. The refusal is an unusual flexing of independent muscle by the football federation, who had previously bowed to government control because of their reliance on state funds to pay for team expenses and coaches' salaries. Pfister, who is working at Sudanese club Al Merreikh, is due to arrive in Yaound in midweek to sign a contract to take charge of the Indomitable Lions at next year's African Nations Cup finals
