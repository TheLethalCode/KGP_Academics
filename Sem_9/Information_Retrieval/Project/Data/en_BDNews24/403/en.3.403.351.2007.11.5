<TEXT>
 Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protests erupted in Pakistan on Monday against emergency rule, two days after President Pervez Musharraf suspended the constitution for the second time during his eight years in power, citing spiralling militancy and hostile judges. Here are some questions and answers on the situation. WHAT MOVES HAS MUSHARRAF MADE? -- Musharraf suspended the constitution on Saturday, and ordered Supreme Court justices to take an oath to abide by a provisional constitutional order or face dismissal. -- Paramilitary troops have been deployed on the streets, reporting curbs placed on the media and hundreds of opposition supporters, lawyers, politicians and rights activists detained. -- Musharraf gave sweeping powers to police to arrest and detain people and suspended fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech and expression, and rights of assembly have been curtailed.

HOW IS MARTIAL LAW DIFFERENT FROM EMERGENCY RULE? -- Martial law typically involves removal of the civilian government and sweeping powers for the military. -- Giving the military control of police, courts and legislature, it is usually imposed during wartime, after a natural disaster such as flooding or an earthquake, or during the occupation of a country. WHEN WAS PAKISTAN LAST IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY? -- In Oct. 1999. Then army chief, Musharraf proclaimed emergency rule when he deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, suspending the constitution, dissolving the National Assembly and bringing Pakistan under the control of the armed forc
