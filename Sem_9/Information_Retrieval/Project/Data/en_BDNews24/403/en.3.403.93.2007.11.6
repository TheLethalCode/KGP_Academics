 LONDON, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar hit record lows against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as concerns persisted about the impact of the credit crunch on the US economy, while shares rebounded and gold hit a 28-year peak. Risky assets took a beating on Monday after a shock warning from US banking giant Citi on billions of loan losses reignited credit concerns and worries about the health of the US economy. In Asia and Europe investors scooped up recently beaten-down shares but the dollar came under renewed pressure due to expectations that the US Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again -- which would lower the yield the currency offers. "There are renewed concerns about credit problems ... It increases the downside risk to growth and suggests this will be more important moving ahead relative to inflation risks," said Adarsh Sinha, currency strategist at Barclays Capital. "Sentiment versus the dollar is very, very bearish. As far as the euro/dollar goes... we are seeing momentum selling and it is likely to continue." The dollar had fallen to a record low of $1.4532 per euro, bringing its losses this year to around 10 percent. The dollar was down a quarter percent on the day against a basket of six major currencies. Interest rate markets expect a more than 60 percent chance of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December. "The Fed seems to be underestimating the impact of the financial market turmoil on the domestic economy. Financial institutions' marked write-downs suggest that corporate lending activity has potential to tighten significantly in the coming months," BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. BARGAIN HUNTING The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.5 percent, helped by gains in financial and mining shares. MSCI main world equity index was up 0.4 percent, after hitting a 1-1/2 week low on Monday. It was only last week when the index hit all-time highs. The iTraxx Crossover index, mostly-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, tightened 4 basis points to 351 bps, having widened from below 230 in the past few weeks. It was a blowout in this index in August which triggered credit concerns. The December Bund future was down 0.2 percent. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 4 basis points, while stocks were up 0.8 percent, supported by firmer commodity prices. US light crude rose more than 1 percent to $95.10 a barrel, climbing back towards the record high above $96 set last week. Gold surged to $815.40 an ounce, its best level in 28 years, drawing support from strong oil prices, dollar weakness and safe-haven buying
