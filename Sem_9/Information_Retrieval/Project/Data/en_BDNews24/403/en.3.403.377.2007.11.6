 PARIS, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Tuesday, bouncing back from a three-session losing run as investors scooped up beaten-down financial and mining shares. HSBC was the heaviest weighted gainer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index with a 1.5 percent rise, while miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton followed close behind with an increase of more than 2 percent. But BMW moved in the opposite direction, falling 3.4 percent after the German carmaker posted lower-than-expected quarterly results. At 0913 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.5 percent at 1,557.63 points. The benchmark index had lost about 3 percent over the past three sessions, hit by renewed fears that banks have not yet revealed the full impact of the crisis in the credit market on their books. The DJ Stoxx European banking sector index was up 0.8 percent, with Deutsche Bank gaining 2.4 percent. The banks index is down 12.5 percent on the year, while the FTSEurofirst 300 is up 5 percent over the same period. Banks worldwide have taken charges totalling billions of dollars on holdings in mortgage-backed securities, which have been hit by a rising tide of defaults in U.S. subprime mortgages -- loans extended to borrowers with patchy credit histories. Citigroup Inc Chairman and CEO Charles Prince became the latest casualty of the turmoil in the credit market, resigning on Sunday as the bank said it may write off $11 billion of subprime mortgage losses on top of a $6.5 billion write-down last quarter. Euro zone services growth jumped back in October led by a pick-up in new demand, but financial services continued to lag, while cost pressures rose to a 17-month high, a survey showed. RATE DECISIONS AWAITED Investors will have to digest key European macroeconomic data on Tuesday that could shed light on the outlook for interest rates, including Eurozone producer price index and retail sales for September. "The European markets are keen to glean any short-term clues from real activity data which might throw some better light on this week's ECB and Bank of England rate decisions -- with the ECB expected to stay steady and with just an outside chance that the BOE may spring a surprise cut," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. Interest rate decisions by both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are expected on Thursday. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.4 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index rose 0.6 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 0.3 percent. Shares in Heidelberger Druck fell 5.5 percent after the world's largest maker of printing machines reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings. Yell dropped 1.7 percent after announcing broadly in-line interim results and repeating its full-year revenue growth outlook. On the upside, Invesco rose 2.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the investment manager to "overweight" from "equal weigh
