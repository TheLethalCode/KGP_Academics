<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday adjourned for a week the hearing on a writ petition challenging the legality of the appointment of Debapriya Bhattacharya as Bangladesh's permanent representative to the WTO and United Nations Offices in Geneva. A High Court bench of Justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubair Rahman Chowdhury heard the appeal partially. As the lawyer for the writ petitioner failed to produce some necessary papers, the court advised him to produce them following the adjournment. The lawyer, Mohammad Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan, told bdnews24.com: "The High Court heard the appeal partially. For lack of necessary papers, the court adjourned hearing for a week. I hope the hearing will begin after a week." Researcher Mostafa Minhaj of the BUET Computer Science and Engineering Department and resident of Malibagh Chowdhurypara, filed the petition in "public interest" arguing that he cannot be appointed in the diplomatic service as he is married to a foreign national. Debapriya was scheduled to fly to Switzerland Monday to take up his new assignment. bdnews24.com/
