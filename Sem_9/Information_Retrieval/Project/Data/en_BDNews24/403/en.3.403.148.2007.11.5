 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone, the country's leading mobile phone operator, has retained the sponsorship of the national cricket team for the next two years, offering Tk 6.15 crore. The Bangladesh Cricket Board announced the sponsor's name after examining the tenders at a city hotel Monday. BCB will sign an agreement in a few days, but the two-year contract will be effective from Nov 1, said BCB chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman. "Apart from the sponsorship money, GP will also spend another one crore to provide sports kits, team's transport and running camps at home in the next two years," said Rahman. The two-year contract worth Tk 3.3 crore with GP expired in June, and the company was given the interim sponsorship for four months following the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka and the India tour of Bangladesh. For the interim sponsorship, GP has to pay Tk 1 crore more as the mobile phone operator had agreed to pay according to the new contract. Only two organisations -- Grameenphone and Axiom Technologies -- dropped their tenders for the Bangladesh national team's sponsorship, and the BCB opened the tender box in front of the bidders and journalists Monday. Grameenphone offered Tk 40 lakh more than Axiom's Tk 5.1 crore. "Grameenphone offered Tk 5.5 crore, but later, having discussed with them, we increased the amount to Tk 6.15 crore," said the BCB CEO. "We feel proud of sponsoring the Bangladesh national team again as GP always wants to remain with the Bangladesh national team," said Mir Nawbat Ali, head of market communications at Grameenphone. bdn
