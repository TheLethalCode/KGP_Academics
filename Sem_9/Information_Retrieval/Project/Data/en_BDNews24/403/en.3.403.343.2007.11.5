 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Stock Exchange Monday halted the trading of Rupali Bank shares to check the volatility in their prices. The premier bourse suspended trading of the bank's shares on both public and spot markets. "We have halted the trading of Rupali Bank shares to stop the volatile movement in its prices," said Sahaluddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. Trading of the bank's shares was scheduled to begin on the spot market where transactions take place in cash dealsfrom Monday ahead of its book closure starting Nov 15. The DSE halted the trading of Rupali shares for two days last week, on Oct 30-31, due to unusual fluctuations in its share price. Rupali Bank, one of the biggest shares by market capitalisation, soared early last week following reports that representatives of its highest bidder, Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, had arrived in Dhaka to start negotiations to close a final deal by Nov. But its stocks plunged the following day as the Privatisation Commission set Nov as the final deadline to sign the sale and purchase agreement, which comprises about 94 percent of the bank's shares at $458 million. The share price rose again on reports that representatives of the Saudi prince had met army chief Moeen U Ahmed. The DSE chief said prices of Rupali Bank were fluctuating based on newspapers reports. "But we need confirmation. We have yet to receive any confirmation." He added the decision to freeze trading of Rupali shares was made in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock market regulator. bdnew
