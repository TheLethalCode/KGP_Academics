<TITLE> Citigroup up in Tokyo debut after CEO quits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup Inc rose 5 percent in their first day of Tokyo trade on Monday, a day after the head of the US bank resigned to take responsibility for spiraling losses on subprime-related investments. Charles Prince stepped down after four years as Citigroup's chief on Sunday, as the bank said it may suffer an $11 billion write-down for subprime losses, on top of the $6.5 billion it wrote off three weeks ago. The Tokyo listing is part of Citigroup's campaign to rebrand itself as a local firm, and improve an image tarnished three years ago when Japanese regulators shut down its private banking operations for violation of banking laws. But the listing, news of which had been closely followed by market participants for months, was overshadowed by Prince's resignation. Citigroup had scheduled a news conference to follow the end of trade on Monday but called off the briefing. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment on the reason for the cancellation. At a bell-ringing ceremony at the Tokyo exchange, Citigroup's chief executive in Japan, Douglas Peterson, said the listing was a "natural next step in our long-term commitment in Japan". Peterson declined to answer reporters' questions following the ceremony. Even as the bank weathers rising subprime losses, its strategy of targeting millions of affluent Japanese is unlikely to change, said Graeme Knowd, a banking analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Tokyo "I think Japan, for them, has been relatively successful." Knowd said. "Citigroup is still the only foreign bank that has a large retail presence here." THIN TRADE Shares of Citigroup were at 4,550 yen on the Tokyo bourse as of 0420 GMT on Monday, up 5.1 percent from their tentative starting price of 4,330 yen. That price was a conversion into yen of the stock's closing price in New York on Friday. But like other foreign shares on the Tokyo exchange, trade in Citigroup was light. Just 8,300 shares had changed hands by early afternoon, a sliver of the more than 30 million traded in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, Japan's largest bank. Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist at Shinko Securities, said he was paying little attention to the listing in Tokyo, with his focus much more on Citigroup's shares in the United States. Citigroup plans to use its shares to buy out minority shareholders in Nikko Cordial Corp, Japan's third-largest brokerage, for $4.6 billion, and has said it is moving to become the leading comprehensive banking and securities group in Japan. That would give the US firm full control of more than 100 brokerage outlets and a name well-known to domestic investors in the world's second-largest economy, which has an estimated $13 trillion in household financial assets.
