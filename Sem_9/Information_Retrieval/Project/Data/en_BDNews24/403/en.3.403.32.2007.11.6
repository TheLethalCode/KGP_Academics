 NOUAKCHOTT, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 47 migrants died trying to reach Spain's Canary Islands after drifting for more than two weeks off the west coast of Africa in two boats, police sources in Mauritania said on Tuesday. Mauritanian authorities discovered the bodies in the sea off the northern port of Nouadhibou, but managed to rescue 96 other West African migrants, who were due to be repatriated within the next 48 hours, the police sources said.
