<TITLE> HC asks NBR to explain refusal to accept Khaleda tax </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday asked the National Board of Revenue to explain in three weeks why its refusal to accept tax on the undeclared income of Khaleda Zia would not be declared illegal. The ruling came a day after the detained former prime minister filed a writ petition with the HC. The HC asked five people, including the NBR chairman, to respond to the ruling in three weeks. The HC bench of justices Mohammad Abdur Rashid and Md Miftah Uddin Chowdhury issued the order. The petitioner's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul Huq said the NBR did not accept the income tax as it was "absolutely motivated". Khaleda sent the tax administration Tk 9.45 lakh in tax on Tk 26 lakh in earnings from house rents, but the NBR in a letter refused to accept the tax. The NBR in a notice on June 4 said the undeclared income would be made legal if an additional 5 percent tax is paid besides normal tax. Many politicians, including former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, submitted income tax on undeclared income in line with the order. Khaleda had earlier deposited Tk 1 crore in income tax on undeclared income following the notice. bdnew
