 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission Monday invited Hafizuddin Ahmed, acting secretary general of BNP, to reform dialogue set for November 22, an official said. M Saifur Rahman, acting chief of the troubled party, will lead the delegation to the talks on election reforms, as part of the main election office's series of dialogues with political parties. EC secretary Humayun Kabir told reporters that an invitation letter was sent out by a special messenger to the party's main office in Naya Paltan and Hafizuddin's Banani home. The EC secretary said the commission took the decision after examining two lettersone on the appointment of Khandaker Delwar Hossain as acting secretary general and the other on the expulsion of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the BNP. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled Bhuiyan from the party as secretary general and Ashraf Hossain as joint secretary general on Sept 3, the day she was arrested in a graft case. Khaleda also appointed Delwar as secretary general, promoting BNP's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed to send a letter to the EC on behalf of Delwar. On October 29, seven members of the BNP standing committee held a meeting where Delwar was relieved of his responsibilities and BNP vice-president Hafizuddin Ahmed was appointed to his post. In the meeting, Saifur was appointed to the BNP as acting chairman in absence of the party chairperson. Delwar opposed the decision. Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah had earlier met chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and asked him to invite Delwar to the dialogue on election reforms. bdnews24
