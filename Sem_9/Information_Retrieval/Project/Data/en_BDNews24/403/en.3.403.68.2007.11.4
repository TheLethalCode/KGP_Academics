 LONDON, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A teenage boy has died in hospital after being attacked with a martial arts weapon outside a party, police said on Sunday. The 15-year-old suffered serious injuries in the attack in Horsham, West Sussex on Saturday. A boy of 16 was taken to hospital with head injuries. Police said the victim was attacked with a pair of "nunchuks", a weapon made up of two wooden sticks connected by a short metal chain. "This was a very serious assault involving a number of people who had been at a party," said Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert, leading the investigation. "We would like to hear from anyone who attended the party." An 18-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police appealed to the public to help find the murder weapon.
