 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  A four-day inter-club footballers' transfers for the First Division Football League will start on November 27. The decision was taken at a joint meeting among the participating clubs, Dhaka Metropolis Football League committee (DMFLC) and the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) at the BFF House Tuesday. The First Division Football League, now named Senior Division Football League, remains suspended for two years, and the booters are scheduled to gather at Dhaka University ground Wednesday with their demand for beginning the league immediately. "All three parties have agreed to start the players' transfers from November 27 to 30, and the DMFLC will finalise the league's date later," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. Representatives of all 13 clubs, BFF vice president Abdur Rahim, DMFLC chairman Mozzammel Haq Mukta, its secretary Azfaruzzaman Shuhrab and Malu attended the meeting.
