 LONDON, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil leapt more than $2 a barrel to a new record high of $96.44 on Tuesday, as a weak US dollar and tight fuel stocks prompted buying by speculators. Investors, wary of global equity markets where the full impact of the credit crunch has yet to become clear, see oil as a good bet, especially given tight fuel supplies in the run up to the northern hemisphere winter. U.S. crude rose $2.23 to $96.21 a barrel by 1346 GMT, putting it on course to test the $100 mark. London Brent crude rose $2.08 to $92.57 a barrel after earlier setting a new record high of $92.65.

Distillate inventories were seen falling by 700,000 barrels and gasoline stocks by 100,000 barrels. Inventories in Japan, the world's third-largest consumer, are also running below comfort levels. "The temperatures in December in the north are expected to be below normal, so that is also a concern for us with the low inventories," said Ken Hasegawa of Fimat, Japan. U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said current prices were a "terrible problem" for consumers, adding he hoped producer group OPEC would ramp up output to ease prices. Many OPEC officials have rejected that call. Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez on Monday echoed other officials, saying high prices were due to speculation and geopolitical tensions, not a shortfall in suppli
