 BANGKOK, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's majestic royal barge procession, held to celebrate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's coming 80th birthday, swept along Bangkok's Chao Phraya river without him on Monday. King Bhumibol, the world's longest reigning monarch, has been in hospital since Oct. 13 after suffering a blood clot in his brain and more than 1 million yellow-clad Thais have signed books wishing him a speedy recovery. Daily palace statements have assured Thailand's 56 million people their revered king is improving slowly but give no indication of when he will be able to go home. Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, his only son, presided over the 700-year-old ceremony revived by King Bhumibol in 1957 after a 25-year hiatus following a coup to transform Thailand into constitutional monarchy. The parade of a glittering flotilla of war barges powered by 2,100 chanting oarsmen was also held to celebrate the end of the three-month Buddhist Lent and was marked by the royal family presenting new robes to monks. In the 15 processions during his 61-year reign, the king has only missed riding on the main barge twice -- once in 2003 when it was staged for Asia-Pacific leaders and then in 2006, when it celebrated his 60th anniversary on the throne, and he watched with visiting monarchs. King Bhumibol celebrates his 80th birthday on Dec.
