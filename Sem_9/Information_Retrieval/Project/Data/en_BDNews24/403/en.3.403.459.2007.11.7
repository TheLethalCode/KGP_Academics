 SANAA, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Yemeni court sentenced 32 militants on Wednesday to terms of between 2 and 15 years over al Qaeda attacks on oil and gas facilities last year. The prosecution said it planned an appeal to seek harsher punishment. "The penalties do not correspond to the crimes the convicts have committed," said prosecutor Khaled al-Maouri. The court, which tries state security cases, also acquitted four of the 36 suspects who were charged in March with "forming an armed gang aimed at carrying out sabotage attacks" and involvement in the attacks on the installations in the Marib and Hadaramout provinces. Six of the militants were charged in absentia, including three al Qaeda members who had fled from a Sanaa prison in February 2006.

There was no damage to the state-owned facilities. In a March hearing, the suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges, and six of them said that they were tortured in custody and forced to sign confessions.

The September 2006 attacks were the first on oil industry targets in Yemen since the 2002 bombing of the French oil supertanker Limburg off its coast. In 2000, a suicide attack on the US warship Cole killed 17 US sailors.
