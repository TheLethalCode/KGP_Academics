 NEW YORK, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a chronology of recent events at Citigroup Inc, and how it got where it is: November 4, 2007: Charles Prince, Citi's chairman and chief executive, resigns after the company calls an emergency board meeting. Robert Rubin, chairman of Citi's executive committee, is named chairman. Sir Win Bischoff, head of European operations, is named acting chief executive. A board committee consisting of Rubin, Alain Belda, Richard Parsons and Franklin Thomas is formed to search for a new chief executive. Prince will remain a Citi adviser.

October 31, 2007: CIBC World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney says in a note to investors that Citi may have to cut its dividend, sell assets, or issue securities to raise some $30 billion of capital. Citi's shares fall nearly 7 percent the next day. October 15, 2007: Citi posts a 57 percent decline in third-quarter profit, hurt by $6.5 billion of write-downs and losses in areas including subprime mortgages.

Trading chief Thomas Maheras leaves, as does Randy Barker, one of Citi's three heads of fixed income. July 20, 2007: Citi boosts quarterly profit a higher-than-expected 18 percent.

July 2006: Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the largest individual Citi shareholder, demands "draconian" measures to cut costs.
