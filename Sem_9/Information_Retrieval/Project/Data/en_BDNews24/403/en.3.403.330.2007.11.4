 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Sunday threatened to cancel contracts of two power plants unless work is done by the deadline. Slow pace of the completion of the projects has created the commotion inside the government, officials of the power ministry said. After a meeting held to discuss overall activities of the ministry, power adviser Tapan Chowdhury said they would be forced to cancel the projects, one at Baghabari in Sirajganj and the other at Fenchuganj in Sylhet, unless the work is complete in time. Chowdhury also said the government was planning to set up Meghnaghat-2 power plant involving local entrepreneurs. "Legal obligations of the project are being examined," Chowdhury said. Separately, an official who attended the meeting said the projects were discussed in detail. The official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the government was disturbed by the reports that some power plants that are being repaired would not be able to generate electricity in time. The power plant in Baghabari in Sirajganj is designed to produce 40 megawatt of electricity and the implementing agency is Westmont. The company has completed 85 percent of the work but it is not clear if the agency could complete the construction by December, the deadline. The officials claimed the government had earlier warned the company several times to complete the work by the deadline. "Now if they fail to meet the deadline, the contract would be cancelled," the official said. The second project in Fenchuganj involves three units and is meant to produce 90 megawatt of power. The implementing agency, China's Harbin Power Company, is in charge of the project financed by the Power Development Board. According to official statistics, the power generation fell to 3300 megawatt from 4130 megawatt recently. Officials with the PDB were grilled in the meeting about why the situation deteriorated. According to a PDB explanation, power generation fell by 210 megawatt in Ghorashal Power Plant, 210 megawatt in Siddhirganj, 80 megawatt in Tongi and 125 megawatt in Baro Pukuria Thermal Power Plant. On the other hand, the production declined to 220 megawatt from 242 megawatt in Kaptai. The PDB explanation, however, failed to please the power adviser, the meeting sources said. The meeting also reviewed progress in repair work of some power plants. Agreements for three private power plantsBibiana, Sirajganj and Meghnaghat-3will be signed by October, according to the meeting details. Another 300-megawatt rental power plant agreement is expected to be signed by April. The meeting decided to spend $5 million on manpower training in the sector. bdnews24.
