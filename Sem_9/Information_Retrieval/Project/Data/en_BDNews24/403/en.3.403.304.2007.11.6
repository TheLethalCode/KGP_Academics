RAB-3's commanding officer Sultan Mohammad Nurani told Ekushey TV in an interview Tuesday: "We are not sure the medal is in Bangladesh. But we have gathered some information that indicates the medal is in Bangladesh." Monday night, the elite force raided Rokhshana Pearls Handicrafts in Gulshan and arrested its owner Abul Hossain and two of his employeesone of them a woman. Nurani said Abul Hossain was the centre of the hunt. Another RAB officer, asking not to be named, confirmed the news about the raid to bdnews24.com. The officer said the RAB widened its hunt to arrest two sons of Abul Hossain: Ali Hossain and Shiplu. In 2004, police in the Indian state of West Bengal said the Nobel medal was stolen from a museum, part of the Visva Bharati university which was founded by Tagore in 1921. The Nobel medal for literature and certificate as well as some personal possessions were taken from a locked glass showcase in the museum. Tagore became the first non-Westerner to win the literature prize in 1913. bd
