 MILAN, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan's Luis Figo fractured his shin in Sunday's 1-1 Serie A draw at Juventus, tests showed on Monday. "The midfielder has fractured the fibula in his right leg," the Serie A champions told their Web site (www.inter.it). "Figo will undergo surgery tomorrow." The former Real Madrid and Portugal player came off in the second half after a foul by Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved, who was booked. Inter, who entertain CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, did not say how long Figo would be out. The 34-year-old joins the club's long list of injured midfielders. France captain Patrick Vieira is expected to be sidelined until the end of the year with a calf problem, Serbia's Dejan Stankovic is missing with an ankle strain and Chilean Luis Jimenez is also out because of a thigh injury
