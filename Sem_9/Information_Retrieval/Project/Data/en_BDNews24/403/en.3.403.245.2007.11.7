 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP followers led by acting party chief M Saifur Rahman Wednesday paid respects to the late president Ziaur Rahman at his grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in observance of what they term the National Revolution and Solidarity Day. The BNP faction led by deposed secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain also laid wreaths at Zia's grave at noon. Security measures at the Zia Udyan were scaled up early Wednesday, with the Crescent Lake approach road closed by a contingent of police and RAB personnel. The security personnel allowed no more than a hundred visitors there at a time after carrying out a thorough search. Parliament speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhtar Ahmed Siddiqui laid flowers at the late president's grave at 9:50am and offered prayers. While leaving, they shook hands and exchanged greetings with Saifur and acting secretary general Hafizuddin, who were waiting outside. Saifur and Hafizuddin and some 50 other leaders offered flowers next. "Our chief responsibility now is to keep the nationalist elements united, as there have been some discords apparent in the BNP of late. But these should be resolved soon," said Saifur to reporters. "We are all united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. We hope all will forget the differences and take part in the elections as a united BNP," he added. He called upon all BNP workers to stay united following the late Zia's ideals. Hafizuddin expressed hope that the BNP followers would continue to work together while upholding the Nov 7 victories. He expressed his gratitude to the armed forces on the anniversary of the "army-people revolution". Sadek Hossain Khoka, the Dhaka mayor and president of BNP's Dhaka metropolitan unit, offered flowers next at the grave. bdnews2
