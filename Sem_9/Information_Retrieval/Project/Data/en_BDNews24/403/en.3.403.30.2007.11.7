 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP supporters loyal to deposed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday harassed standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman as he went to place wreaths at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman. The activists of the party's youth wing Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal and student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal threw shoes at him when Mahbubur, an ex-army chief, was on his way back after placing the wreaths. Police used batons to disperse the angry supporters and arrested three of them from the scene. More than 100 supporters led by acting chief M Saifur Rahman went to the grave at Zia Udyan in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar to show their respect to the late leader. Mahbubur was with them but he was harassed by the followers of Delwar. Some supporters approached and exchanged greetings with him before they suddenly harassed him as he was about to get in his car. The former lieutenant general quickly left the scene sensing further trouble. The detained people are DCC ward-98 BNP leader Ali Ashraf, expatriate BNP leader Zakir Hossain, Chhatra Dal activist Mamun Ahmed "I am a soldier. I am fighting to keep the BNP united.
