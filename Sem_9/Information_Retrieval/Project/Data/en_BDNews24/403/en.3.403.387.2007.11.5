 TBILISI, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four opposition activists declared a hunger strike on Monday to try to force Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to resign, as crowds chanting for his ouster formed a human chain around parliament. Saakashvili, a close US ally, faces the biggest challenge of his four-year rule from a newly united protest movement. It has criticised the president for an authoritarian style of government and for failing to tackle poverty and corruption. "I'm starting a hunger strike today," People's Party leader Koba Davitashvili told protesters. "My life is the only thing I've got. So, if my Georgia needs my life, I'm ready to sacrifice it." Levan Gachechiladze, an opposition member of parliament, also vowed to stop eating. "We are ready to carry on the hunger strike until we win and the president resigns," she said, according to Interfax news agency. As they spoke, protesters were gathering outside the parliament for a fourth day of demonstrations against Saakashvili, angered by his refusal to consider their demands for his resignation and for early parliamentary elections. Around 10,000 people had massed in the area by early afternoon, many of them wearing the opposition's symbolic white ribbons on their arms, according to a Reuters reporter. About 3,000 formed a human chain around the parliament building. Many shouted "Misha, go away!", using the familiar form of Saakashvili's first name. Others yelled: "Misha, the roses have wilted!" -- a reference to the popular movement, dubbed the "Rose Revolution", which swept the president to power in 2003. RECLUSIVE SAAKASHVILI Saakashvili, who has not appeared in public since the mass protests started on Friday, rejected all the demonstrators' demands and accusations as a "campaign of lies" in a pre-recorded television interview broadcast on Sunday evening. "No concessions to these dark, absolutely 100 percent negative forces at the expense of the Georgian people, at the expense of Georgia's fundamental interests, at the expense of Georgia's future, at the expense of the Georgian economy have been made, are being made now and never will be made," Saakashvili said. "I want everyone to fully comprehend this." Opposition politicians dismissed his remarks and asked why he had not appeared in public since the demonstrations began. "I have the impression that an ambulance is waiting for the president and that people in white coats (will come) because he lives in a completely different country," Goga Khaindrava of the anti-government Equality Institute, a former minister for conflict settlement, told Rustavi-2 television on Sunday. They also accused a police colonel of poisoning at least 30 anti-government demonstrators with adulterated wine during protests on Sunday night, saying they had seen him handing out the drinks from his car. Officials agreed that some demonstrators had been taken to hospital but rejected any suggestions of foul play, saying the protesters had simply drunk too much. The whereabouts of the man whose dramatic allegations against Saakashvili sparked the protest campaign remained unclear on Monday. Former defence minister Irakli Okruashvili broke with the president after being sacked from the cabinet. In September, he accused his former boss of massive corruption and plotting a businessman's murder, provoking big demonstrations. Saakashvili rejected the charges emphatically and Okruashvili was arrested then released a few days later after making a televised "confession" in which he withdrew his allegations. His lawyer said the statement was made under duress. Opposition politicians said last week that Okruashvili had intended to attend their mass demonstration on Friday but was deported secretly on Thursday to a country in western Europe, probably France. The government said he left for medical treatme
