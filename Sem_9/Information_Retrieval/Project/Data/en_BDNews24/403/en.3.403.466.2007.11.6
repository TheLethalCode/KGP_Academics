<TITLE> North Korea nuclear reversal off to good start-US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea's first ever steps to roll back a nuclear programme launched about 40 years ago are going well, a U.S. official said on Tuesday after visiting the North's plutonium-producing atomic complex. Destitute North Korea struck a deal with regional powers last month to disable its Soviet-era nuclear complex in exchange for aid and an end to its international ostracism. "I think we are off to a good start," US State Department official Sung Kim said at Incheon airport near Seoul, according to a pool report. Kim was with a team of US nuclear specialists who arrived in North Korea last week. He said there have been steps to reverse the operations at all three of the key facilities -- the North's ageing reactor, a plant that produces nuclear fuel and another that turns spent fuel in arms-grade plutonium. The deal calls for North Korea to disable these three plants by the end of the year, provide a complete list of its nuclear arms activity as well as account for all its fissile material. In exchange, the impoverished North will receive 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid. The United States will also move toward taking North Korea off a US terrorism blacklist. bdn
