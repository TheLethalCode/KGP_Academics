<TITLE> RA Ghani says BNP's Oct 29 meeting wasn't valid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)Dr RA Ghani Monday said the BNP standing committee stood "clearly split" as the row over leadership deepened. "The much-talked-about standing committee meeting held on Oct 29 wasn't a valid one as it was not convened or conducted constitutionally," the BNP standing committee member told reporters at his Dhanmondi home. "The decisions adopted there don't mean anything to me. Khandaker Delwar Hossain remains the secretary general of the party," Ghani said, answering a query. He claimed that the party's senior colleague M Saifur Rahman invited him to "tea" on Oct 29 and it was only after reaching his place that he found other standing committee members there. He however did not explain why he delayed clarifying his stance on the issue. "It was no regular meeting of the standing committee as it was not convened formally with the chairperson's approval. Therefore, no decisions taken at that meeting will be applicable to the party." BNP's policymaking body at the Oct 29 meeting appointed Saifur Rahman as acting chief of the troubled party and Hafizuddin Ahmed as acting secretary general, further deepening the crisis in the BNP. bdnew
