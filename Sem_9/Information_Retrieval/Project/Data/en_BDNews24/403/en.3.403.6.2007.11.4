<TITLE> Smaller heart pump works well in women - US study </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ORLANDO, Fla., Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small, implantable device that helps the heart pump blood offers the promise of keeping alive more women with advanced heart failure until a donor heart is available for transplant, researchers said on Sunday. Researchers said Thoratec Corp's HeartMate II device performed as well in women as in men. They said it has the advantage of being much smaller than the bulkier devices that now perform the same function. Those devices, intended to keep alive patients in need of a heart transplant, previously were too large to be implanted in many women and some smaller men, researchers said. The findings were presented at an American Heart Association meeting in Orlando ahead of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of Thoratec's application seeking approval of the device. Thoratec funded the study. The devices are considered a "bridge" until a donor heart becomes available. "If we didn't have a donor heart available, many of these women previously died," said Dr. Roberta Bogaev, medical director of heart failure and cardiac transplantation at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, who headed the study. This one is about the size of a D battery, removing those size barriers, the researchers said. It may benefit twice as many women who are waiting for heart transplants, they added. The device, powered by a battery-run unit outside the body, is an implantable left ventricular assist device for people with severe congestive heart failure and few medical options. The study involved 231 patients with advanced heart failure, 52 of them women, treated at 40 US heart transplant hospitals. The women generally had a weakened heart from cancer chemotherapy, a viral infection, pregnancy or unknown cause. Among 194 patients with six-month follow-up data, survival was virtually identical for men and women. The study showed 79.5 percent of women and 80.6 percent of men survived, having undergone a transplant, having had the device removed after regaining heart function without a transplant, or having remained on the device still awaiting a transplant. Women remained on the pump for an average of 175 days, while men did for an average of 130 days. "The women benefited equally well," Bogaev said. "We now have a technology that is small enough to offer women and smaller men the opportunity to benefit from mechanical circulatory support." Thoratec said in August an FDA advisory panel will review its application seeking approval for the HeartMate II as a bridge to transplants. The Pleasanton, California-based cardiovascular device maker said the Circulatory Systems Device Advisory Panel is tentatively due to review the application at its Nov. 30 meeting.
