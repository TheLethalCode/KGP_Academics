 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday granted bail to Awami League's industry adviser and businessman Salman F Rahman in a fraud and embezzlement case. The High Court bench of justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury also issued a rule on the Anticorruption Commission and the government, asking them why the proceedings of the case would not be declared illegal following a writ petition filed by Salman. The ACC filed a case on Sep 30 with Motijheel Police Station against vice chairman of Beximco Group Salman F Rahman, his brother and chairman of the group Sohel F Rahman, former managing director of Shinepukur Holdings Mahmudur Rahman and four others. The case alleged that the accused amassed about Tk 108 crore in bank loans by fraud and forged land documents. There are allegations against Mahmudur Rahman of applying for Tk 74 crore in loans by submitting forged land documents for 83 acres in Gazipur. Barrister Rafiqul Haque represented Salman in filing the writ petition that challenged the case's legality. On Oct 9, a vacation bench of the High Court granted bail in advance to Mahmudur Rahman in the case. The HC granted bail to Salman in a corruption case filed by the ACC on Nov 4. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on Oct 1 against Salman on charges of amassing Tk 182 core by rescheduling a loan of Tk 192 core from AB Bank by forging documents for six plots of land in Gazipur. bdnews
