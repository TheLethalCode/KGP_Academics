<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc Chief Executive James Owens said on Tuesday there was a "high probability" for a soft landing for the US economy after a period of slower growth. "We think there's a high probability that we'll get a soft landing after a period of slower growth, or re-acceleration of growth, late next year, going into '09," Owens said in an interview with CNBC television. On Oct. 16, Owens told Reuters the downturn in the US housing market was the worst since World War II and was likely to weaken further next year. Three days later, the company's chief financial officer, Dave Burritt, told Reuters the company saw as much as a 50 percent chance the US economy could slip into recession next year.
