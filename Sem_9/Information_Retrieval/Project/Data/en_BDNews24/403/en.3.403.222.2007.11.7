 LONDON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index rose early on Wednesday as higher raw material prices lifted commodity shares, offsetting losses in British Energy after it said it had no restart date for its nuclear reactors. At 0843 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 32.4 points, or 0.5 percent, at 6,507.3, after ending a three-day losing streak in the previous session with a 0.2 percent gain. European shares also rose in early trade. "The world economy clearly is going to slow, and earnings may well come in a bit lower than currently expected in 2008. Under those circumstances, you can imagine that equities give up a little bit," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. "I wouldn't be pessimistic about the future of equities, but I am not massively optimistic either. All investors are in wait-and-see mode to determine what's going to happen." Commodity shares were in the spotlight after raw material prices climbed, with crude surging deeper into record territory to touch $98 a barrel as the dollar plumbed new lows. In the UK, sterling scaled 26-year highs against the dollar. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell gained 1.2 percent, while gas producer BG Group added 1.1 percent. Despite trading without dividend rights, BP was up 0.5 percent. In the mining sector, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Anglo American, Lonmin Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys climbed between 1.9 and 4.6 percent. Rio was also boosted by continued market talk of a possible bid from rival BHP. Banks were mixed, still heavily influence by renewed concerns over the extent of the damage from the U.S. subprime crisis after Citigroup said it may write off a further $11 billion of its subprime exposure over the weekend. In the UK, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Northern Rock gained. But Alliance & Leicester and HSBC slipped. British Energy fell 7.3 percent to top the FTSE 100 losers after the nuclear power generator said it was still too early to say when four nuclear reactors at Hartlepool and Heysham might resume operation, following their closure for wiring problems last month. Next fell 2.8 percent after the clothing retailer said the outlook remained uncertain, even though trading had improved in the last eight weeks and it still expected full-year profits to be in line with market expectations. ITV, Old Mutual and Unilever fell after trading without the right to their next dividends. Vodafone rose 0.5 percent after ING raised its price target on the stock to 185 pence from 165 pence. Rolls-Royce put on 1.8 percent after the aircraft engine maker said it had won an $800 million order for Trent XWB engines from International Lease Finance Co
