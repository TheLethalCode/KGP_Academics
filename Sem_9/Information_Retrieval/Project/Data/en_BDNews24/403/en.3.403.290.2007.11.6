<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Akbar Ali Khan, chief of the Regulatory Reforms Commission, said Tuesday that nongovernmental organisations must go through massive reforms to benefit the poor. Khan, a former bureaucrat and adviser to the caretaker government, was critical of the NGOs for moving away from its original mission of empowering poor people into money-making. "Microcredit is not the only remedy for poverty alleviation. An overall economic development is a must to eliminate poverty from the country," Khan said as he opened a project, called SMILING, in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Prip Trust will implement the Small Initiative by Local Innovative NGOs (SMILING) Project, funded by the European Commission. Khan said the NGOs had started their activities to change the fate of poor people but now they are "leaning all the more toward business activity". "All big NGOs had said poor people would come to the leadership. But scope had not yet been created. All rich people occupied those posts," Khan said. Khan said the new commission under his leadership would start working next week. Recommendations have already been sought from various business chambers and associations about what they want from the commission, Khan said. On Oct 30, the interim government formed the 17-member commission headed by Khan. The commission is responsible to review all government regulations and advise the administration for changes to the official machineries. bdnews
