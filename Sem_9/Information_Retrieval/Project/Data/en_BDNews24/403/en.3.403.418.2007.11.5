 Islamabad, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf denied rumours sweeping Pakistan on Monday that he had been placed under house arrest by subordinates unhappy with his decision to impose emergency rule. "It is a joke of the highest order," Musharraf told Reuters from the Presidency building in Islamabad where he had just met more than 80 foreign diplomats to explain his decision. Media organisations received calls from cities all around Pakistan, including Karachi, where the stock market had fallen 4.7 percent on the political uncertainty.
