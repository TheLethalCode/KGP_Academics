<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Khulna and Rajshahi stretched their unbeaten run in one-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League while Dhaka tasted their second win Tuesday. A brilliant 121 from opener Imrul Kayes powered Khulna to an emphatic 59-run win over Sylhet at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Two fifties from openers Zahirul Haq and Junaed Siddique helped Rajshahi beat hosts Chittagong by six runs at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Dhaka registered a three-wicket win over visitors Barisal at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Khulna vs Sylhet Despite being reduced to 38 for two, Khulna posted a challenging total of 259 for nine as opener Kayes smashed the league's third one-day century and Tushar Imran hammered a fine 71. Kayes clubbed 11 fours and three sixes off 129 balls while Tushar hit five fours and one six from 98 deliveries. In reply, Sylhet were 203 for nine in 50 overs as left-arm pacer Syed Rasel shone once again with 4/33. Mushfiqur Rahim topscored with 55 off 72 balls before being bowled by spinner Jamaluddin Babu, who returned with two for 57. Riding on a 164-run stand by openers Jahirul Islam (89) and Jauned Siddique (68), Rajshahi piled up a huge 290 for five in 50 overs. National discard Mushfiqur Rahman chipped in with a cameo of a 30-ball 48 as the last year's runners-up they had enough runs on the board. Aftab Ahmed (65), Dhiman Ghosh (66) and Faisal Hossain (51) all struck half-centuries but Chittagong eventually were agonisingly six runs short of the target after 50 overs. Shahazada, Delwar Hossain and Mushfiqur Rahman each grabbed two wickets. Barisal captain Shahrair Nafees After decided to bat first after calling the coin right but saw his side restricted to only 151 for nine in 50 overs. One-down Imran Ahmed was most successful Barisal batsman with 38. Abul Bashar (21), Rakibul Hasan (17), Sumon Kumar Shaha (13), Hannan Sarkar (11) and Nafees (10) all had starts but failed to consolidate as Dhaka bowlers bowled superbly. It was a total Dhaka was supposed to overhaul easily but Barisal bowlers made their opponents sweat before going down. Dhaka openers Javed Omar (46) and Al Shahriar Rokon (28) put on a solid 63, but the holders lost seven wickets to limp home. Mohammad Ashraful (11) and Sajjad Kadir remained unbeaten to take Dhaka to 152 for seven with three overs remaining. b
