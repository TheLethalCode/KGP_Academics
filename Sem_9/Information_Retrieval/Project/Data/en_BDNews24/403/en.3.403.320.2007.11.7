 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Telekom Malaysia has refused to comment on press reports suggesting that Vodafone is looking to acquire a 25 percent stake in its mobile phone business unit. "It is very difficult to say anything," Telekom Malaysia's spokesperson in Kuala Lumpur, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com over the phone Wednesday. "Shares in state-controlled Telekom Malaysia jumped 3 percent Monday on a media report that Vodafone was ready to spend up to US $3 billion to buy a stake in the Malaysian firm's mobile unit," Reuters said quoting Britain's Sunday Times. "TM will be responding to the article in due course. However, I believe that the article is purely speculative," TM International Chief Executive Yusof Annuar Yaacob said in an emailed response to Reuters. But the world's leading telecoms equipment vendors support Reuters' report. "Vodafone is doing due diligence on TM and the final announcement is just a matter of time," a high official of a leading vendor told bdnews.24.com requesting anonymity. An official of another equipment supplier echoed the statement. Telekom Malaysia (TM) is spinning off its mobile business into a separately listed firm, TM International, prompting speculation that it wants to bring a strategic equity partner on board to help drive the unit's international expansion. "The emergence of Vodafone as a partner should provide both technical expertise as well as deeper funding ability...," Kuala Lumpur's brokerage firm Aseambankers said in a note to its clients, according to Reuters. TM International includes its domestic Celcom unit and operations in nine other countries including India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It had about 31.8 million subscribers as of June 30. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile operator in terms of turnover and the second-largest by customers, is the frontrunner to buy a 25 percent stake in TM International, reported Reuters citing Britain's Sunday Times. TM International would be worth around 24.2 billion ringgit ($7.25 billion), based on pro-forma net profit of 1.38 billion ringgit for 2006 and an earnings multiple of around 17.5 times for the FTSE Global Telecom index. A $3 billion price tag for a 25 percent stake would value it at $12 billion. "In anticipation of a sale, TM has been courted by a range of foreign operators and private-equity firms," Reuters quoting the Sunday Times said, adding that Telekom Malaysia would announce plans this week to sell off a strategic stake in the de-merged business. Citing another foreign research house's report, Malaysia's The Star said a deal with Vodafone was "possible" and that it would come down to pricing. bdn
