<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has received 11 proposals for a submarine cable connection under private management, said BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam Sunday. "Steps were taken for an alternative submarine connection in the private sector to create a competitive market and take the internet to rural areas," Alam told bdnews24.com. The internet in Bangladesh is vulnerable to frequent cuts and more so because of its dependence on a single undersea cable network. Also, bandwidth charges in Bangladesh are higher than in neighbouring countries. Companies grouped into consortiums to make proposals: some foreign companies teamed up with local ones. A senior BTRC official said India's Tata Telecommunication, Reliance Communication, Mahanagar Telecommunication and Hong Kong's PCCW submitted proposals as partners. The telecoms regulator invited proposals for setting up submarine cable connections under private management in March, with June 15 as the deadline for submission of proposals, which was later extended to June 29. A BTRC official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com: "One or more submarine cable connections may be given. However the commission will take a final decision after scrutinising the proposals. The BTRC will hold a public hearing after scrutiny of proposals. Bangladesh is connected with the "SEA-ME-WE-4" cable system, now used by 16 telecoms firms of 14 countries. bdnews24.
