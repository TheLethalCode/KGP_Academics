 Manikganj, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Some 50 students of a Manikganj primary school fell ill Tuesday after they were given anti-helminthiasis tablets, prescribed for the prevention and treatment of parasitic worms. The students were admitted to the Shibalaya upazila health complex, said Samir Kumar Dey, headmaster of Amdala Government Primary School. "Some 265 students were given anti-helminthiasis tablets under the school health programme," said Dey. "They took the medicine around 11am. A short while later, about 50 students suffered stomach cramps and felt nauseous." The dosage might be the cause, he said. The Shibalaya clinic's resident physician, Dr Arshad Ullah Haque, said they had launched a yearlong programme to treat students with anti-parasitic tablets and vitamin A capsules. The expiry date of the tablets was 2009, the doctor said. The civil surgeon's office had provided the tablets, he added. bdnews24.com
