 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Two leaders of a banned militant outfit, one of them the brother of the late 'Tapan Dada', were killed in a shootout during a RAB raid in Kushtia, a Rapid Action Battalion official said Friday. Golam Hossain alias Akash, brother of Tapan, and Abdur Rashid alias Tikka, the organisation's Kushtia district commander, were killed in an exchange of gunfire, RAB headquarters spokesperson Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. RAB claim to have retrieved five firearms including an automatic AK-56 rifle, shotguns and ammunition from the raid. Three RAB members also sustained injuries during the armed clash, said Abul. Akash's brother Tapan, chief of the outlawed militant outfit Purbo Bangla Communist Party (MLA-Janajuddha), was himself recently shot dead in a RAB raid. Akash had earlier been remanded in custody for seven days, to allow RAB to quiz him about the outlawed organisation's caches of arms and explosives and its members' whereabouts. "After interrogating Akash, a joint team of Rab-12 members and Rab intelligence officers took Akash along in a raid on Ganeshpur village at around 3am Friday," Abul said. "As they approached the 'eidgah' (the village prayer ground), seven or eight armed suspects opened fire and the RAB team returned fire." "Akash tried to escape and was killed in the 'crossfire'," said the RAB spokesman. "After the armed suspects fled, the RAB team found the dead body of Abdur Rashid, also known as Tikka." "They also recovered an AK-56 automatic rifle, a 303 rifle, two double barrelled shotguns and a revolver from the site," Abul told bdnews24.com. "RAB deputy assistant director Abdul Hamid, sepoy Anwar Hossain and constable Masum Billah received injuries during the shoot-out," he said. A RAB intelligence officer, not wishing to be named, who was involved in the raid told bdnews24.com: "We made a search of some houses in Ganeshpur village, acting upon the information provided by Akash." "Finding no one there, as we were returning, we found some young men sitting in the 'eidgah', which aroused suspicion and we challenged them," he said. "The young men started shooting at us and we retaliated. After the suspects fled the place, we searched the area thoroughly and found the dead bodies of Akash and Janajuddho commander Abdur Rashid Tikka." "Akash was reportedly leading the outlawed outfit after his brother Tapan was killed. After this engagement and the deaths of Akash and Kushtia district commander Tikka, the organisation might peter out eventually," he conjectured. Abdur Rashid Malita, alias 'Dada Tapan', former head of the banned militant party Purbo Bangla Communist Party (MLA-Janajuddha) died in an exchange of gunfire during a RAB raid in Kushtia on June 18. bdnews24.c
