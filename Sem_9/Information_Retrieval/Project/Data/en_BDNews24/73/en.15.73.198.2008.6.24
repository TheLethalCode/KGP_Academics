 VIENNA, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Semih Senturk has scored both his Euro 2008 goals after coming off the bench but the Turkey forward has no qualms about starting Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final against Germany. Semih looks poised to play in Basel given Turkey's crippling injury and suspension problems, with main striker Nihat Kahveci ruled out of the tournament with a thigh complaint. The 25-year-old Semih struck a second-half equaliser in the 2-1 group win over Switzerland in Basel before blasting in a last-gasp extra time leveller in the quarter-final with Croatia, which the Turks won 3-1 on penalties. "I don't think I play badly when I start a game, it's just that I score goals as a substitute," he told a news conference before Turkey training on Monday. "Of course every player wants to be in the starting XI and I always prepare myself to start." Nicknamed 'Young Semih' after coming through the Fenerbahce youth ranks and often being a substitute, he was top scorer in the Turkish league last season with 17 goals. However, he said the strike against Croatia, which followed goalkeeper Rustu Recber's punt into the box, put all his previous goals in perspective. "Maybe I will never forget the Croatia goal for the rest of my life. I thought we were going out but then our coach Fatih Terim told us to hit long balls. It was like a miracle for me," he said. Semih's cheeky smile and boyish good looks hide a sensitive side, especially when it comes to Terim. "Our coach treats every player like he is their father," he said. "When he comes to me he says 'just play football, I know your talents'. He is the best coach I have ever worked with.
