 Dhaka June 25 (bdnews24.com)The condition of Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim has slightly improved although the left side of his body still remains paralysed, a hospital official said Wednesday. "His condition has improved a bit and he may be out of danger," Dr AKM Mahbubul Hoque, coordinator of LabAid Specialised Hospital, told reporters. Nasim who had been given liquid food until Wednesday might switch back to normal food from Thursday, he said. "There was no new blood haemorrhage in his brain in the last 24 hours. But the aftermath of the haemorrhage that occurred before has remained unchanged." On whether it was necessary to send Nasim abroad for better medical treatment, he said: "The decision lies with the government. But this kind of treatment is available in LabAid as well." The left side of the former home minister is in a state of paralysis due to the haemorrhage. "His words are wobbly." On whether it would be possible for the patient to overcome the paralytic situation, Hoque said: "We will observe how much he can overcome after treatment." Nasim's son Tanvir Shakil and advocate Sheikh Baharul Islam appealed to the government for his treatment abroad. The application addressed to the chief adviser was handed to home adviser MA Matin Wednesday. The application sought release of Nasim and urged the government to make quick arrangements to send him to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. "Home secretary Abdul Karim has assured us of necessary steps," Nasim's son told reporters. Matin told reporters: "The government is very sympathetic about Mr Nasim. He was in the position I hold now." "He has been jailed for 13 years in a corruption case. The legal process is involved in the matter. If there is no legal obstacle, the government will look into the problem sympathetically." Nasim was admitted to LabAid Tuesday. Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed visited him in hospital Wednesday. Tofail told reporters: "I talked to Syed Fahim Munaim (press secretary to the chief adviser) about sending Nasim abroad." Nasim was arrested on Feb 4 last year. bdnews24.com/rb/mk/sum/
