 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com staff correspondent Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test in March 2005 that did not reveal any major spinal injury. Radiologist Mohammad Zakir Hussain, who had then worked for LabAid Hospital, prepared the MRI report, a copy of which was collected by bdnews24.com. Dr Zakir, now with Square Hospital, told bdnews24.com Wednesday that the condition of Tarique's spine was "not bad" at the time. "There was nothing serious. He had a disc problem." The radiologist said the problem might have been congenital or engendered by an old injury. But he did not explain what exactly happened to Tarique. Zakir refused to give further details. The MRI report says the dorsal kyphosis and cervical lordosis were maintained with normal vertebral alignment but lumbar lordosis was slightly straightened with a normal vertebral alignment. According to the report, D6 and D7 vertebral body heights were slightly reduced, but showed normal signal intensities variant. "The D5-6, D6-7, D7-8 and D9-10 inter-vertebral discs showed hypo-intensity on T2W1 indicating degenerative disc disease." MRI of the cervical spine says: "At C5-6 level, broad-based posterior and right posterolateral disc herniation with posterolateral osteophytes are causing corresponding theeal sac indentation and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing having right sided predominance." His bone marrow and intrinsic cord signal, and cranio-vertebral and cervico-medullary junctions were normal, according to the report. MRI of the lumbo-sacral spine says: "L4 vertebral body height is minimally reduced showing normal signal intensities, suggesting healed compression fracture." But the thoracic spinal cord displayed a normal course and dorsal spine showed normal width of the bony spinal canal, the report says. Tarique is now being treated for spinal-chord pains and other health problems at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Tarique's doctor Md Idris Ali of BSMMU: "We have sent all documents and reports to the vice chancellor. He will let you know everything. Jail authorities have also been informed." Ali said the 2005 MRI report was an old report. He refused to make specific comments on Tarique's health. BSMMU vice-chancellor Professor Md Tahir said: "Tarique Rahman is in this hospital. But I am not aware of his latest condition." bdnews
