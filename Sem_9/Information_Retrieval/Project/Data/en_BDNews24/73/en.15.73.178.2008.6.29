<TITLE> No one remembers losers - Aragones tells Spain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Luis Aragones has been motivating Spain before Sunday's Euro 2008 final against Germany by telling them no one remembers losing finalists. "I've told the players that no one remembers who comes second in any competition, so when you go out to a final you have to make sure you win," Aragones told a news conference at the Ernst Happel stadium on Saturday. "Just before they go out, I will be telling them where I think we can do damage to Germany and where we will need to be on our guard against them. I'll also think of something to gee each one of them up." Aragones will step down as Spain coach at the end of the tournament and is expected to take up an offer from Turkish side Fenerbahce to coach the team for the next two seasons. The 69-year-old said he was satisfied with what he had done since taking charge of the national side after a group stage exit at Euro 2004 and was pleased Spain had finally rid themselves of the charge of choking at major tournaments. "I helped make the players understand what it means to compete. I would say my work has been acceptable in the sense that the team is very united and in terms of the style of play. "I'm very happy to have had a group that have believed in me and the way I work. We have all had to suffer criticisms, especially me, but we are very united. There is a very good feeling between the players and myself." The Spain coach said he was not overly concerned about the possible absence of Germany midfielder Michael Ballack, who is a doubt because of a calf injury. "Ballack is a great player and the Germans might feel his absence but a great player can have a poor day. My worry is the 11 players that do play. "We will face a Germany who are a great side and they can create problems for us in the air and in set pieces, even though their football is not as fluent as ours. But we will cause them difficulties with the way we play too.
