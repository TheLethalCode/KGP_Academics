<TITLE> Malaysia Anwar denies sodomy claim; seeks refuge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Sun Jun 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's de facto opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, denied on Sunday allegations that he had sodomised an aide, but then took refuge at the Turkish embassy for what his party said were security reasons. Dismissing the charges as an attempt by the government to discredit him, Anwar told his family he feared for his life. But he is not seeking political asylum, a party official said. The sodomy allegations could worsen Malaysia's political tension after the watershed March elections. The former deputy premier who was sacked in 1998 and later jailed for sodomy and corruption has seen a revival of his fortunes since the March poll when the opposition alliance recorded its best ever election result. Anwar says he has won enough support from ruling coalition lawmakers to form a new government by September, sparking fears of policy shifts and unsettling investors. Anwar has said he would alter oil-production sharing contracts, cut fuel prices, introduce minimum wages and redistribute oil wealth to the poor and the needy. Anwar's private assistant, Saiful Bahari, lodged the police complaint. "The police report lodged against me earlier today is a complete fabrication," Anwar said in a statement read out by his lawyer as about 200 of his supporters gathered outside a hotel where a news briefing was held. Lawyer Sivarasa Rasiah said Anwar had not been arrested. An aide in Anwar's Justice Party said Anwar was waiting for police to take his statement. Anwar, who spent the night at the hotel, went to the Turkish embassy at around noon. "He is there for protection but he is not seeking political asylum," Tian Chua, the spokesman for Anwar's political party, said by telephone. "We just want to make sure that he is secure." Turkish diplomats were not immediately available for comment. Anwar accused the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition of trying to ruin him, and his wife said she had photographic evidence to show that the complainant was linked to an aide of Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak. "This is the second political conspiracy," Wan Azizah Wan Ismail told reporters. "It's a political murder against my husband." A spokesman for Najib declined to comment because of the ongoing police investigation. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi dismissed Anwar's claims. "Barisan Nasional has no intention of wanting to make life difficult for him or to harass him," Abdullah told reporters in the administrative capital of Putrajaya after launching an environmental project. "There is no such intention.
