 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim, hospitalised after suffering a stroke, is now clinically stable, said chief of medical services at LabAid Specialised Hospital, Dr AKM Mahbubul Haque, on Friday. "Mohammad Nasim has regained complete consciousness. He can talk and is eating normal food." "But the condition of such patients may deteriorate any time," Dr Haque told bdnews24.com. Three doctors examined the AL leader at the hospital's Intensive Care Unit Friday, including neurosurgeon MH Shahriar Sabet who heads the medical board formed for Nasim's treatment. Mahbubul Haque said doctors were treating the left side of Nasim's body that had become paralysed following the stroke. Asked about the brain haemorrhage that caused the stroke, Haque said there had been no new bleeding but further haemorrhage may occur any time. "We have seen such cases before," he said. Nasim's younger brother Md Rezaul Karim said the family wanted the best possible treatment for Nasim overseas, for a full and speedy recovery. He hoped the government would consider their application seeking permission to take him abroad for treatment. Nasim's son Tanvir Shakil Joy and lawyer Sheikh Baharul Islam submitted the application for compassionate parole on Wednesday. Nasim, convicted in a graft case, was admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University on Tuesday after suffering a stroke at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur. He was later transferred to LabAid Specialised Hospital. bdnew
