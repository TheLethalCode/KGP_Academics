<TITLE> Adviser sees food prices come down </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Thursday that prices of essentials will start coming down. "The International Monetary Fund has said that food prices in the international market are decreasing. We hope the impact will fall on the local markets soon," the adviser told reporters at the Secretariat, after a high-level meeting on monitoring the price of essentials. The monitoring system will be enforced to control the prices of commodities, the adviser said. Citing the example of the price of rice at Tk 70 per kg in the international market, Zillur said: "The prices in our local markets are much lower than in the international market." On whether the adviser was concentrating on political activities rather than monitoring market prices, he said: "It is not my job to reply to such a question. We are working on key national issues. The issue of controlling prices is one of them." The adviser hoped that the country would also see a good Aman harvest, as it had in the Boro season. "Some 17 million tonnes of Boro rice have been produced this year. If the Aman crop also shows a bumper harvest it will have a positive impact on the market price." "The government is offering its best efforts to boost the production of Aman," Zillur said. "We have procured nine lakh tonnes of food grains. Some 1.5 lakh tonnes of rice have already been imported from India." "We have stopped rice export. So there is no fear of a crisis," he added. bdnews24.
