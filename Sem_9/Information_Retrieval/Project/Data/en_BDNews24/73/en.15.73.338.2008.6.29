 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soccer's great and good united on Saturday to hail Euro 2008 as a huge success ahead of the eagerly-anticipated final between Germany and Spain. Sunday's showpiece in Vienna will be the culmination of three weeks of flowing attacking play rarely seen in the usually cagey international game. Michel Platini, president of European governing body UEFA, said the tournament had thrived thanks to exciting games, good organisation and colourful fans. "I am pleased and delighted that we've been able to convey this wonderful view of football broadcast throughout the world," he told a news conference. "I thank Germany and Spain in particular and hope for a wonderful match with great goals, great saves and attacking football." Former Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer, who won Euro 72, seemed pleased order had been restored following Greece's shock triumph four years ago with a series of dull 1-0 wins. "I think everyone involved in the tournament can be very happy. The final is two classic football countries in Germany and Spain. It really is a big success," he said. "I hope it will be an exciting final, an attractive and high scoring final. Maybe a draw, extra-time then penalties with Germany having the better nerves." TEAMS INCREASED Even the improved behaviour of the players towards referees has added to the enjoyment of the tournament, according to former top official Pierluigi Collina. "Respect was shown during the tournament," the Italian said. Spain and three times winners Germany were due to hold final training sessions later on Saturday at Vienna's Ernst Happel stadium where they will walk out for real on Sunday for the 1845 GMT kickoff. There was calm before the storm on the streets of Vienna with only a smattering of fans and ticket touts wandering around but tens of thousands will arrive in the city on Sunday. The only clouds on the horizon were the ones that caused torrential rain in recent days and the debate over the hosting of the next European Championship in 2012. Ukraine and Poland are due to hold the next tournament but Platini said the event would be taken off them if stadiums were not completed in Warsaw and Kiev. The 2012 finals look poised to be the last with 16 teams after a meeting of senior officials on Saturday recommended the tournament should be increased to 24 teams from 2016. In between summits and news conferences, Platini found time to invite the Spanish goalkeeper he embarrassed in the Euro 84 final to be his guest at Sunday's game. Platini scored the opening goal of France's 2-0 win over the Spanish with a free kick that squirmed under the body of keeper Luis Arconada in Spain's last appearance at a major final. "I was thinking while I was shaving this morning about how I took the trophy off the Spanish 24 years ago but could be handing it back to them tomorrow," Platini said. "When we called Arconada up to ask if he wanted to come and watch the game, he asked if it was a joke. But I think it's nice to be able to invite a former rival.
