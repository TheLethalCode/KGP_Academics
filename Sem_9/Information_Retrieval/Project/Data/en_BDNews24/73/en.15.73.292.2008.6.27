 VIENNA, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A look at the formations, strengths and weaknesses of Germany and Spain ahead of the Euro 2008 final at Vienna's Ernst Happel stadium on Sunday (1845 GMT): FORMATIONS: Germany coach Joachim Loew has to decide whether to stick with the 4-5-1 formation that worked well against Portugal but not so well against Turkey, or revert to his favoured 4-4-2. Spain's Luis Aragones stayed solidly with 4-4-2 all tournament but admitted that the switch to 4-5-1 after David Villa's injury turned the semi-final and it seems likely he will run with it and give a rare start to Cesc Fabregas. STRENGTHSADVERTISEMENT Germany's mindset should be an advantage. Their players grew up watching their compatriots competing in finals and should not be fazed by the occasion. As they showed in the last-gasp semi-final win, they always play to the final whistle. Spain's main strength is their technical quality, their familiarity and confidence in each other and a system that has taken them on a 21-match unbeaten run. WEAKNESSES Germany were unusually ragged and defensively vulnerable for long spells against Turkey. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, 38, also looked past his sell-by date. Spain have little aerial power either in attack or defence, though it has not troubled them unduly so far. DEFENCE Germany's keeper and back four are vastly experienced yet there were some worried looks between them as they struggled to plug the holes against Turkey. Central defenders Per Mertesacker and Christoph Metzelder love a big centre forward to take on but will be less happy trying to track Fabregas and Andres Iniesta pushing up from midfield. The Spanish defence has not attracted the headlines but has been resilient and efficient. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas and centre back Carles Puyol have barely put a foot wrong while right back Sergio Ramos has a huge appetite for work with his overlapping forays. MIDFIELD Michael Ballack had a game to forget against Turkey but he is a man who revels in the big occasion and will take it as a personal challenge to dominate the key area of Sunday's battle. Wide men Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski are both having great tournaments and look a constant goal threat while Torsten Frings will add some power if, as expected, he returns to the starting line-up. Spain's midfield eventually wore Russia down with their accurate passing and hard work and the addition of Fabregas brings guile and also freed Xavi to become more adventurous. The whole unit played at a much crisper pace against Russia than they did in the goalless quarter-final against Italy. ATTACK With a goal in each of the last two games Miroslav Klose is beginning to regain the confidence that made him the 2006 World Cup's top scorer and his spring-heeled heading ability will be something Germany will look to exploit. As a sole striker Fernando Torres will spend most of his time as a running outlet for his midfielders rather than hovering menacingly in the box. As in the semi, the fresh legs of Spanish league top scorer Daniel Guiza will probably take over during the second hal
