 Guahaiti, India, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful separatist group in India's restive northeast suffered a blow when half a dozen of its senior commanders decided to shun violence and declared a ceasefire, officials said on Tuesday. At least six field commanders of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Assam state decided to put their guns away. "We have declared an indefinite ceasefire with the government and we want a peaceful solution to our long-standing problem through negotiations," Jun Bhuyan, one of the rebel commanders, who signed a truce said by telephone. Analysts said the move could demoralise the remaining cadres of ULFA. In the last few years, Indian security forces stepped up its campaign against ULFA by capturing or killing many of its cadres. In September 2006, New Delhi called off a truce with the ULFA when security forces realised that rebels used the ceasefire to regroup. Security officials estimate the outfit to have around 700-800 combatants left, and its top leaders are believed to be based in neighbouring Bangladesh. The field commanders, who decided to give up the armed struggle, belonged to the ULFA's 28th battalion, one of the strongest units of the organisation. The ULFA is among more than two dozen armed groups in the region, either fighting for independent homeland, or more political autonomy. They accuse New Delhi of plundering the region's mineral and forest resources, neglecting local economy and giving them back nothing in return. bd
