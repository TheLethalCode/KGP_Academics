 CHICAGO, Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A worker at a plastics plant in Kentucky shot and killed five people inside the factory on Wednesday and wounded a sixth before killing himself, police said. Local media reports said the violence was triggered by a dispute the 25-year-old man had with a supervisor, who was among the dead. The police department in Henderson, Kentucky, said the man who did the shooting entered the Atlantis Plastics plant in Henderson and began firing a handgun. He was not immediately identified. The shooter, who died of a self-inflicted wound, and one of his victims were pronounced dead inside the plant. Four others were pronounced dead after being taken to hospitals and a sixth victim was in stable condition at a hospital in Evansville, Indiana, police said. Atlantis, which has a number of US plants, produces molded plastics at the Henderson facility. One local media report said most of the victims appeared to have been shot at random and were scattered around the plant
