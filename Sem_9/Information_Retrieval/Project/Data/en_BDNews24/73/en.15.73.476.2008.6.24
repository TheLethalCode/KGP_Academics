 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)--The government is considering ways of making stipends and other grants for social causes tax-free, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday. Azizul, however, cautioned that some individuals or firms might abuse any future benefits of this kind. "The government has to keep many things in mind to make tax-free social activities widely available, while also guaranteeing proper corporate social responsibility," the adviser told a function sponsored by Dutch-Bangla Bank to award stipends to poor and gifted students at Purbani Hotel. "Last year donations from recognised firms of up to Tk 5 lakh were kept tax-free. Earlier the amount was Tk 2.5 lakh," said the adviser. "We are reviewing the tax status of grants to all social activities relating to noble causes. There are no guidelines for this in the proposed budget." Azizul added that there was scope for a decision on the issue outside the budget, although he cautioned against potential abuses of the facility. The adviser said social responsibility is a moral obligation, and a necessary part of the social fabric in a developing country like Bangladesh. "The government itself is motivated by social responsibility, providing different kinds of assistance such as VGD-VGF, and allowances for the elderly." "In the new budget, Tk 8,900 crore has been allocated for the social safety sector," said Mirza Aziz. He added that the government had also created a new scheme to ensure 100 days of employment for the poor people. Dutch-Bangla Bank managing director Md Yeasin Ali said if the grants were made tax-free, many banking and financial organisations would provide their assistance. At the function, around 1000 students who passed their HSC in 2007 and are now studying at degree level were given stipend certificates. Each stipend holder will receive Tk 2000 a month until their degree course is completed. They will also receive Tk 5,000 a year for other expenses. bdnews24.
