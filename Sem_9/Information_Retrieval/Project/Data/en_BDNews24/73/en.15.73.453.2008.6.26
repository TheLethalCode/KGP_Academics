 BERLIN, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germans breathed a collective sigh of relief on Thursday and acknowledged how lucky their below-par soccer team had been to snatch a 3-2 win over valiant Turkey in Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final. Bild, the biggest-selling tabloid, said Joachim Loew's side would have to show an improvement of at least 200 percent if they were to stand a chance against the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between Spain and Russia. "If we lumber around in the same way we did against the Turks, we'll be completely taken apart by the subtle and speedy technicians from Russia or Spain," Bild said. Germany's biggest worry was in defence, the paper said, adding that on their current form Russia's Andrei Arshavin or Spain's Fernando Torres would destroy them. "But up to now our team has always put in a strong performance immediately after a weak one," it said. "We can therefore dream. Go get the cup, lads!" SMASHING WINDOWS Police in Dresden said a group of 20-30 black-clad aggressors had attacked three takeaway kebab shops in the eastern German city after the match, injuring two Turks, smashing windows, throwing bottles and burning a Turkish flag. Around 2.7 million people of Turkish origin live in Germany, more than in any other country in western Europe. Elsewhere, police reported no serious incidents and said fans from both sides had celebrated together into the early hours of the morning. Around 1,700 officers were deployed in the capital Berlin and 84 people were taken into custody, police said in a statement. Forty of them were charged with minor offences and 15 people were slightly injured, including three officers. Writing in Bild, former Germany captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer said he was more and more puzzled by the German team's performances. "There was too little movement from the beginning," he said. "But who cares, Germany are in the final and it will definitely be a different match in Vienna on Sunday, it will have to be a different match from our point of view." Soccer newspaper Kicker said Germany had put in "anything but a great performance" and Stefan Kuntz, a European champion with Germany in 1996, said there would have to be a massive improvement by Sunday. "A lucky, extremely lucky win by Germany that was not convincing but this time was kissed by luck," Kicker said
