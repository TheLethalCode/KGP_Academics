 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, sought permission from a special court Tuesday to be exempted from personally appearing for hearings, a lawyer said. Coco's lawyer barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan told bdnews24.com he had submitted a petition seeking exemption to the Special Judge's Court-3 on behalf of his client. "The court is expected to give an order on the matter tomorrow (Wednesday)," he said. State counsel S Golam Hafiz said he had also received a copy of the petition. Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman is also expected to make the same plea to the special court soon. Tarique and Coco have been detained in the prison ward of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, while charges against the two brothers are pending trial. Tarique faces charges of bribery linked to the murder of Bashundhara Group chairman Humayun Kabir Sabbir and Coco faces graft charges in the Gatco case. bdnews24
