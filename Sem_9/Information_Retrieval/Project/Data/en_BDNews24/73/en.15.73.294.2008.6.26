 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)-Awami League has still not reached any final decision on whether it will participate in the four city corporation and nine municipal elections on Aug 4, a senior party leader said. An AL working committee meeting held on Thursday has been adjourned to Friday acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters. The working committee meeting started at the party's political office in Dhanmondi at 11 am and continued till 2.15 pm, without reaching a decision, said Ashraful. The Election Commission announced the local polls schedule on June 20, amid objections from the two major parties. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman said on the day the party would take a decision on participating in the local polls "based on the situation". Two days later Ashraful told reporters that a final decision would be taken after discussions in the Awami League presidium and working committee meetings on June 24 (Tuesday) and June 26 ( Thursday) respectively. Due to detained AL leader Mohammad Nasim being hospitalised after falling seriously ill on Tuesday, the presidium meeting did not take any decision either on whether the party would participate in the local elections. bdnews
