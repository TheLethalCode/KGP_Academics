"We have not issued any tsunami warning so far and there is no need for widespread evacuation required because it's 6.3. We are studying the situation." The islands lie about 1,200 km (750 miles) off India's east coast. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 6.7 and occurred at 1140 GMT (7:40 a.m. EDT).
