 MOGADISHU, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali gunmen kidnapped two United Nations workers from Sweden and Denmark in the Bakool region of southern Somalia on Saturday, a U.N. source said, and local residents said a translator had been abducted as well. "One was Danish, Noefolk Nelson, and the other Swedish, Ulf Felink," a U.N. Department of Security and Safety worker who asked not to be named told Reuters. "They were both mine risk education project officers, though the Swedish man was more senior. They have been in the area for the last 3 days and were planning to establish a centre for Mine Action for UNDP (the United Nations Development Program) in the Bakool region," he added. Local resident Farah Ismail said the men were kidnapped by heavily armed Islamist militants following an attack on the town of Hudur. Another resident, Mohamed Dahir, said the foreign captives had been driven away, heading towards Bardale district, an Islamist stronghold 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Baidoa. "I saw the Islamists heading to Bardale ... I saw the foreigners in cars surrounded by Islamist fighters," Dahir said. A Somali man working as a translator for the International Medical Corps was also abducted, residents said. Kidnapping is a lucrative business in Somalia, and hostages are normally treated well in anticipation of large ransoms. Gunmen are still holding hostage four foreign aid workers -- two Italians, a Kenyan and a Briton-- abducted in April and May. A spokesman for Somalia's interim government condemned the kidnapping, but had no details. Mine Action could not immediately be reached for comment.
