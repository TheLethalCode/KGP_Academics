 KARACHI, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket boards from Australia, England and New Zealand have sent security consultant Reg Dickason to Pakistan on an inspection tour after some players expressed reservations about playing in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September. Dickason told reporters on Saturday: "I have met the Pakistan board official and the independent security consultants of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and I will be having more meetings. "The Champions Trophy is still some two months off and that is obviously work in progress. I think everybody would like to play here that is why so much work is being put into the security arrangements by the PCB and ICC security experts." Dickason is currently in Karachi to see the security drills and policy put in place for the ongoing Asia Cup. Pakistan has been hit by a series of suicide bomb blasts and attacks since last year, although the situation has eased a little since February's general election. The Champions Trophy is on the agenda of the ICC's annual meeting which starts in Dubai on Sunday
