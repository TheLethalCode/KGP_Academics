 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka University scrapped an agreement with Grameenphone Tuesday that would have seen the telecoms giant gain branding rights to all cultural activities at the Teacher-Student Centre for 30 years. DU treasurer Syed Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com that the institution's authorities had decided to cancel the agreement following demands from students. "The university will not take any decision which goes against the interests of our students," said Azad. If the agreement had come through, the TSC complex that houses a cafeteria, auditorium, reading room, art and music rooms, stage, swimming pool, store and a bank would have been used by GP for its publicity. The TSC signed the agreement with GP on June 16, but the deal ran into opposition by students. bdnew
