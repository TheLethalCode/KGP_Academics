 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)--Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain Sunday welcomed the Awami League's support to local government elections as a "positive sign". Sakhawat hoped the Election Commission would get full cooperation of political parties in the local elections. "The Awami League looks positively at city-corporation and municipal elections. I feel good about it." On the four-party alliance's declaration to resist the election, the commissioner said: "There is no last in politics. We welcome all." Although the local election is not an election of political parties, local politicians participate in it. "But it is not possible for the Election Commission alone to hold a fair election," the commissioner said. "We hope we will get full cooperation from all political parties." The commissioner predicted "festivities" in city and municipal areas during the elections. "The candidates will be able to run publicity campaigns as the state of emergency will be relaxed," said Sakhawat. Although political parties, Sakhawat said, can have support in nominating local candidates, they cannot carry out election campaigns with political identity or banner. "The election is a test-case. We want to look into obstacles and cooperation in holding an election free of muscle power and black money," Sakhawat said. "The schedule for local polls has created huge enthusiasm among people. Candidates are going from door to door, which is a positive change. It is good for the country and democracy." The election commissioner said the laws and rules would be promulgated soon for national elections. The political parties will be given three months' time to sign up with the Election Commission, after the promulgation of an ordinance. The hearing on objections against the redrawing of constituencies will be completed by June 30. The chief election commissioner and the two election commissioners have been visiting divisional towns from June 18 in connection with constituency demarcation. bdnews
