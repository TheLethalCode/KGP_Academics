 VIENNA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA president Michel Platini has invited the Spanish goalkeeper who he embarrassed in the final of the 1984 European Championship to be his guest at Sunday's Euro 2008 final. Platini scored the opening goal of France's 2-0 win over the Spanish in 1984 with a free kick that somehow squirmed under the body of keeper Luis Arconada. On Sunday, Spain will have the chance to redeem themselves when they take on Germany for the 2008 title. "I was thinking while I was shaving this morning about how I took the trophy off the Spanish 24 years ago but could be handing it back to them tomorrow," Platini told a news conference on Saturday. "When we called Arconada up to ask if he wanted to come and watch the game, he asked if it was a joke. But I think it's nice to be able to invite a former rival." Platini made reference to the bizarre nature of his goal  one of a record nine that he scored at the tournamentjoking that Arconada should have no regrets. "He has nothing to reproach himself for. My goal was impeccable," Platini grinned. "It was (Bruno) Bellone's second goal for us that was extremely lucky." Since the 1984 game, similar goalkeeping errors are known as Arconadas
