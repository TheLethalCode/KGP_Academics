 MUMBAI, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's in-form batsman Gautam Gambhir has credited captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the newfound confidence which has helped him cement his one-day spot. The diminutive opener is driving India's recent success in one-day and Twenty20 cricket, forming an explosive force with fellow Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag at the top of the order. "A lot of credit goes to MS," Gambhir told Reuters before the Asia Cup one-day series in Pakistan starting on Tuesday. "Because as a cricketer, or in any profession, you need that bit of security, where you get to know that even if you fail in an innings or two you are not going to be made to sit out. "The kind of confidence MS has shown in me, the only thing I've tried to do is try and live up to his expectations." Gambhir, 26, heads India's young batsmen who have eased into slots vacated by senior players in the one-day team after selectors opted for youth following the first-round exit at last year's one-day World Cup. Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly, members of the exclusive 10,000 runs in one-day internationals club but in their mid-30s, were dropped and Dhoni made captain of the limited-overs side. Gambhir contributed to India's triumph at last year's Twenty20 World Cup, scoring three half-centuries, including a sparkling 75 in the final against Pakistan. The left-hander was also the highest run-scorer in this year's tri-series in Australia, scoring 440 runs including two hundreds, in India's triumph. "One turning-point in my career has been the Twenty20 World Cup," Gambhir said. "It brought about a change in my confidence which reflected in my batting. I started trusting my technique more." Gambhir made his international debut in 2004 but failed to cash in on early opportunities, often dismissed playing forceful shots too early. He is now determined to reclaim a test spot. "My ultimate aim is to get back into the test squad and establish myself," he said. "To be called a successful cricketer, one needs to do well in all forms of the game. "Whatever opportunity I get, I just want to do well," he said. "For a batsman, the happiness is in scoring runs, whatever be the format.
