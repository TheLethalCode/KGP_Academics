<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Josef Hickersberger is quitting as coach of the Austrian national team, he said on Monday. Austria, like Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland, failed to progress from the group stage after losing to Croatia and Germany but drawing with Poland. Shortly after his team, ranked 92nd in the world, went out, Hickersberger said he was still pondering his future but had changed his mind, he told Austrian daily, Der Standard. "I will quit," Hickersberger was quoted as saying on its website. "I am empty, I am tiredI need some time off, I need to recharge my batteries. The chapter is closed, the mission accomplished." Asked if he would consider changing his mind again, he replied: "No. I can only really think of a few very minor arguments that would justify that. 'FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE' "The team has been rejuvenated, and this path should be continued  Everything developed fine. To have the Euro Championship at home was a fantastic experienceeven for me." Hickersberger had been in charge for two years. It was his second spell running the national team. Many Austrians feared beforehand their team would be humiliated at the tournament but defeats by only one goal by Germany and Croatia plus a 1-1 draw with Poland was regarded as a respectable display by most observers. He had been banned by UEFA for one match after he and Germany coach Joachim Loew were "sent off" to the stands for bickering during the Germans' 1-0 win over Austria on Monday in Vienna in their final Group B match. Loew was forced to watch his side's later quarter-final win over Portugal from behind a glass window and surrounded by security personnel. "They treat us like dancing bears. I don't want to be a dancing bear any more," Hickersberger told Der Standard, but added he did not want to stop being a coach all together. "I can imagine being down on the pitch every day again  somewhere.
