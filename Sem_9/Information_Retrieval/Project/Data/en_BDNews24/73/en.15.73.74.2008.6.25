<TITLE> Kremlin's new man strikes a different pose </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Wed Jun 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev played down differences with his predecessor Vladimir Putin in an interview with Reuters but the contrast in style and tone between the two men was striking. Medvedev -- a longtime Putin ally -- presented himself as a continuity figure during the presidential election campaign this year and he repeated that mantra in the interview, saying the essence of Putin's policies would not change. "Politicians are also people and they should also have their own tone and their own style," Medvedev said. "But that does not change the basic tenets of policy." That said, the new president cloaked the message from Moscow in very different words to those of his predecessor. During the hour-and-a-half-long conversation, there were none of the harsh attacks on the West which became a Putin trademark in his final years as president. Instead, choosing his words carefully, the new man in the Kremlin stressed freedom, the rule of law and private property. Analysts and diplomats in Moscow are divided over Medvedev, a trained lawyer who first met Putin when the two men worked together in the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. Putin picked him last December as his chosen successor. Some, including a number of Western ambassadors, see Medvedev as a deliberately more liberal choice, ushering in a new phase of Putin's long-term plan for Russia which will stress freedom, private property and foreign investment
