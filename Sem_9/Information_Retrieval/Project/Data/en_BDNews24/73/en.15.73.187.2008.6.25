 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)The government Tuesday held meetings with NGO representatives to better prepare for the UN Human Rights Council's review meeting scheduled for January 2009. The council under its Universal Periodical Review (UPR) process will discuss the latest human rights situation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh, one of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission, will present its position on alleged violations of human rights. Bangladesh will prepare a report on human rights in consultation with the rights NGOs and submit it to the council. "We want to be better prepared for the UPR meeting in January in Geneva. Our dialogue with the NGOs is part of the process," foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, who chaired the meeting at his ministry, told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh will submit the report to the council by November, three months ahead of the hearing. "As Bangladesh seeks re-election to the council, we will have to prepare an authentic report," said Touhid. The council started a process in April of hearing the human rights situation in every country. It will hear the human rights situation in 48 countries in a year. Each country will have to face the council every four years, meaning Bangladesh will have to face the UPR again in 2013 after the 2009 hearing. "We will not join hands with the government to prepare the position paper on human rights as it's not an elected government," Adilur Rahman khan, Odhikar's secretary, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. bdn
