<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and some social organisations Saturday condoled the death of India's former army chief Sam Manekshaw, one of the war heroes who helped create Bangladesh in 1971. The AL leaders stood in solemn silence for one minute at a meeting of the central working committee to pay homage to Manekshaw, who died Friday at 94. In a condolence message, the AL said Bangladesh would forever remember the contribution of Indian army, Manekshaw in particular, in its war of independence. The BCS Freedom Fighter Officers-Employees Central Welfare Association also mourned Manekshaw. The association arranged a condolence meeting to pray for the departed soul. Mohammad Musa, president of the association, said Manekshaw and his forces had set an example of showing respects to an independent and sovereign country and proved their trustworthiness. The Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee in a statement condoled the ex-Indian army chief's death. Professor Kabir Chowdhury, Binod Bihari Chowdhury, singer Kalim Sharafi and sector commander CR Dutta signed the statement. Manekshaw became the eighth chief of Indian Army in 1969. His years of military experience were soon put to test as thousands of refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan started crossing over to India due to the turbulent situation there. The situation got worse and soon erupted into a full-scale war in December 1971. During the war, Manekshaw displayed an uncanny ability to motivate the forces, coupling it with a mature war strategy. He masterminded the rout of the Pakistan Army in one of the quickest victories in the recent military history. The war ended with Pakistan's unconditional surrender and the formation of Bangladesh. bdnew
