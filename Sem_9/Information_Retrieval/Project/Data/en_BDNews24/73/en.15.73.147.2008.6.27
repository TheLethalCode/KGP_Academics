 JERUSALEM, Fri Jun 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel allowed fuel to reach the Gaza Strip's sole power station on Friday, but kept border crossings used to bring in humanitarian and commercial supplies closed for a third consecutive day, Israeli officials said. A European Union official said an estimated 600,000 liters of industrial fuel would be pumped through the Nahal Oz border terminal to Gaza's power station, enough to keep the plant running for several days. The EU funds fuel deliveries to the power station. Israeli military liaison official Peter Lerner confirmed the delivery of fuel but said other border crossings used to bring in supplies remained closed. Israel closed those crossings on Wednesday, one day after Palestinian militants fired rockets into the Jewish state. The Islamic Jihad militant group said Tuesday's rocket attack was in retaliation for the Israeli army's killing of one of its commanders in the occupied West Bank. Both sides have been trading blame for breaching a ceasefire agreement, brokered by Egypt and backed by the West, with the aim of advancing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The ceasefire deal, which took effect on June 19, calls for Hamas to stop cross-border rocket fire and for Israel to gradually ease its embargo on the Gaza Strip
