<TITLE> Late Turkey goal but Germany reach final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany beat Turkey 3-2 in another Euro 2008 thriller on Wednesday to line up a final on Sunday against either Russia or Spain and end their opponents' roller-coaster ride through the tournament. Turkey, who saved themselves with late goals in three previous matches, appeared to have repeated the feat when Semih Senturk equalised to make it 2-2 in the 86th minute and seemingly force extra time. But Germany, who had been second best for most of the match against a side ravaged by suspensions and injury, took a leaf out of Turkey's book and came back themselves in the final minute of normal time to snatch victory at St Jakob Park. Defender Philipp Lahm, who had failed to stop the cross that led to Turkey's equaliser, emerged as the match-winner after playing a one-two with Thomas Hitzlsperger and lashing the ball high into the net past goalkeeper Rustu Recber. "It was one of most beautiful moments in my life, getting into the final," Lahm said. "That's always beautiful. We missed that at the (2006) World Cup. Today it worked out. We want to win the title," he said. Germany's delighted coach Joachim Loew said: "It was an insane battle, incredible tension up till the last second. That makes me obviously very happy." Turkey coach Fatih Terim congratulated Germany and added: "I am proud of my players and think their will to play well, and the technical support, all came together and they were able to show the world what a good team they were. "I think we are leaving as the most colourful team of the tournament. We can say we were almost there, but that is part of football as well." Germany will need to produce a far better performance in Vienna, where Russia and Spain meet on Thursday, than they did here to be crowned European champions for a fourth time. DANGEROUSLY CASUAL Turkey took advantage of Germany's dangerously casual start and deservedly went ahead after 22 minutes through left-sided midfielder Ugur Boral. He fired the ball through goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's legs after a looping effort from Kazim Kazim came back off the bar  the second time Kazim shot against the bar in an impressive 10-minute spell. Germany, with captain Michael Ballack having a largely indifferent match in midfield, then equalised against the run of play after 26 minutes. Midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger powered through the Turkey midfield, lost his markers and deftly flicked a cross from Lukas Podolski wide of Recber to make it 1-1. Germany continued to be outplayed for long periods in the second half, though, as Turkey, inspired by Kazim and German-born Hamit Altintop, dominated them with a fearlessness of spirit and a precision in their passing that Germany rarely matched. Yet it was Germany who stole into the lead 11 minutes from time when Miroslav Klose headed home a Lahm cross after Rustu came flying out of his goal but missed the clearance. True to form, Semih levelled for Turkey seven minutes later with some near-post opportunism after Sabri Sarioglu got the better of Lahm. Four minutes later, Lahm was rejoicing at the other end after scoring the winner and giving Germany a victory that for long periods had looked unlikely
