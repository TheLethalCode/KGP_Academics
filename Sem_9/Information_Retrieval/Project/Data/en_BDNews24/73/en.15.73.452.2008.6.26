<TITLE> India inflation seen at 13-year high: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI,Thu Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's annual inflation rate is expected to have jumped to a fresh 13-year high in mid-June as the effect of higher fuel prices spread to the broader economy, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. The wholesale price index is forecast to have risen to 11.18 percent in the 12 months to June 14, which would be the highest since April 8, 1995, when annual inflation was at the same level. Annual inflation, which hit 11.05 percent in early June, is expected to remain in double digits for some time, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday, adding it was difficult to predict when it would peak. It would be the 18th consecutive week that the inflation rate has been above 5.5 percent, the central bank's target by the end of the fiscal year in March 2009. The data is due around noon (0630 GMT) on Friday. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its main lending rate and the proportion of deposits that banks must keep with the central bank, by 50 basis points each, to help rein in the galloping inflation rate that has more than doubled since mid-February. It was the second time rate increase this month after India had raised state-set fuel prices by about 10 percent on June 4. The wholesale price index is more closely watched than the consumer price index (CPI) because it includes more products and is also published weekly. The CPI is released monthly
