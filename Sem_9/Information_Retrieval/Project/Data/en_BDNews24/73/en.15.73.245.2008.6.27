 HARARE, Fri Jun 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabweans voted slowly in a one-candidate presidential election on Friday after President Robert Mugabe defied world condemnation and calls to postpone an election which the opposition says is a farce. Mugabe, in power for 28 years, is the only candidate after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew six days ago because of state-backed violence and intimidation. Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change urged people to abstain but said they should vote if their lives were in danger. "Whatever might happen, the results...will not be recognised by the world. No matter what you are forced to do, we know what is in your heart. Don't risk your life. The people's victory may be delayed but it won't be denied," he said in a statement. The MDC says Mugabe's ZANU-PF militants will force people to vote, especially in rural areas where the veteran leader lost support during the first round. People have their little finger dyed with purple ink to show they voted. Voting began shortly after 0500 GMT and turnout was thin at many polling stations in the capital Harare, unlike parliamentary and presidential elections in March when people queued from the early hours. Polling is due to end at 1700 GMT. Tsvangirai won the March 29 poll but fell short of the majority needed for outright victory. In the affluent Greendale suburb there were scores of people queuing for bread at a shopping centre but only 10 at a polling station nearby. "I need to get food first and then maybe I can go and vote...I heard there could be trouble for those who don't," said Tito Kudya, an unemployed man. Mugabe, 84, has presided over Zimbabwe's economic collapse with hyper-inflation, 80 percent unemployment, food and fuel shortages. A loaf of bread now costs 6 billion Zimbabwe dollars, or 150 times more than at the time of the first round of elections. A middle-aged man waiting for a bus said it was dangerous to talk about politics. "Your tongue can cost you your teeth," he told Reuters, adding that he would vote. "I hope that will mean the trouble that we have been seeing also goes away," he said. NOTHING CHANGED A newspaper vendor in Harare city centre told Reuters: "I am not voting in this election. We voted for change last time and nothing changed. This time, we know the outcome, so why bother?" The vote has been widely condemned both inside and outside Africa. African Union foreign ministers were discussing Zimbabwe ahead of a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "I don't think we are going to accept the result but we are still discussing," one minister said, asking not to be identified. A security committee of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed, saying Mugabe's re-election could lack legitimacy. But Mugabe, who thrives in defiance, remained unmoved. Saying he would attend the AU summit to confront his opponents, he ridiculed leaders calling for a postponement. "Even today they are saying do away with the election, what stupidity is that?" Mugabe said at his last campaign rally on Thursday, where he urged people to vote in large numbers. The Group of Eight nations (G8) said at the end of a meeting in Japan the first round results must be respected. "Any dialogue between the parties must allow a legitimate government to be formed," the wealthy nations' foreign ministers said in a statement. "We will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people." U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after the G8 meeting that Washington would consult with other members of the U.N. Security Council on what steps might need to be taken next. Analysts said Mugabe was pressing ahead with the election to try to cement his grip on power and strengthen his hand if he was forced to negotiate with Tsvangirai. Mugabe says he is willing to sit down with the MDC but will not bow to outside pressure. Observers from Western countries critical of the government have been banned, as have almost all the hundreds of foreign journalists wanting to cover the election. A grouping of local observers said its members were intimidated by government supporters and they would not observe Friday's vote. Zimbabwe's electoral authorities deployed thousands of polling officers across the country and distributed ballot boxes and papers to more than 8,000 polling stations. Police set up several roadblocks around the capital Harare and a spokesman said all leave for officers had been cancelled. The MDC says nearly 90 of its supporters have died in political violence which it blamed on ZANU-PF supporters. Mugabe says the opposition has been responsible for the violence. Since the March election, Mugabe has rallied his shock troops, veterans of the 1970s independence war and youth militia, in a violent campaign that critics say has made a free and fair election impossible
