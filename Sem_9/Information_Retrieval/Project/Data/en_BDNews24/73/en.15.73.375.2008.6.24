 REGENSDORF, Switzerland, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Roberto Rosetti will referee the Euro 2008 final in Vienna on Sunday, organisers UEFA said on Monday. The 40-year-old hospital manager from Turin had mixed feelings when he watched Italy being knocked out of the tournament by Spain 4-2 on penalties after their quarter-final finished goalless after extra time. Sunday's result, however, meant he was eligible to handle the final as only referees whose teams are not taking part can officiate. "First of all, I'm a supporter of the national team as I have been since I was a little boy. The penalty shootout was a very emotional moment and not very nice for the team," Rosetti told reporters. "But I was in the opposite situation two years ago when Italy went on to win the World Cup. Of course, it's a great honour for me and a very important day in my life. "I am a referee and so the final of the European Championship is a wonderful situation." Rosetti was a last-minute replacement at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and took charge of four matches including France's 3-1 victory over Spain in the last 16. His appointment means he would have handled the first and last of the 31 matches at the June 7-29 Euro 2008 tournament. He was referee for Czech Republic's opening day 1-0 win over Switzerland, Russia's 1-0 victory against Greece and the second quarter-final won on penalties by Turkey over Croatia after their thrilling game finished 1-1 after extra time
