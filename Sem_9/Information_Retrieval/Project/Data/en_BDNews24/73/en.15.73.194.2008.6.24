 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Turnover and the trading volume on the Dhaka Stock Exchange rose Tuesday after days of a decline in trade. An official with brokerage house Anwar Securities said panic among investors appeared to have faded as the day saw substantial buying. Indices also advanced mainly due to a 100 percent increase in the prices of ICB Islami Bank (former Oriental Bank) shares as trading resumed Tuesday after a long closure. Market analysts said the trend was encouraging but still were sceptical about its sustainability. "It's good that the past few days' trend has shifted and the volume and turnover started to increase," said Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of a private asset management company. "If the trend continues over the week investors will be back on track," Sayeed of AIMS of Bangladesh told bdnews24.com.
