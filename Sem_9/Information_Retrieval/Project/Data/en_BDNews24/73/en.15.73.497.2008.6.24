 BASEL, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia midfielder Ivan Saenko did not train on Monday because of an ankle problem, the national football union said. Russia were beginning preparations for Thursday's Euro 2008 semi-final against Spain in Vienna. Saenko, the only Russia player to play his club football abroad, started in Russia's 3-1 extra-time quarter-final win over Netherlands but was substituted towards the end of normal time. Midfielder Diniyar Bilyaletdinov and defender Alexander Anyukov took part in some individual training while the rest of the squad did a light workout. "(Coach Guus Hiddink) hopes all three players will be able to take part in the semi-final," the Russian Football Union said in a statement on its Web site (www.rfs.ru)
