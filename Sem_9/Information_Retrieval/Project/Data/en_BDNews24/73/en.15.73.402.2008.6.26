 MOSCOW, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian soccer fans bombarded Austria's consulate with last-minute visa applications on Wednesday in the hope of seeing a Euro 2008 semi-final that has inspired a wave of patriotic fervour. Hundreds of fans waited outside the consulate as inside extra staff worked into the evening to process applications from fans determined to watch the Russian side take on Spain on Thursday in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Football fever gripped the rest of the country too: in the Ural mountains city of Yekaterinburg, shopkeepers reported they had sold out of Russian flags and a television station reported a couple named their new-born son after Dutch coach Guus Hiddink. Ilya Ageyev said he had travelled overnight from the city of Kirov, just under 1,000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, to apply for an Austrian visa. "We really hope it was not in vain. We really want to go," he said as he waited in line. "Yesterday I handed in my application and today I want to receive my (visa) so I can go to Euro 2008 and cheer on our team," said Andrei, a businessman. DISMAL PERFORMANCES The team's progress to the semi-finals has inspired many Russians, who since the demise of the Soviet Union have grown accustomed to dismal performances by their national side. In Moscow alone, more than 700,000 people celebrated well into the night after their team defeated the Netherlands 3-1 on Saturday to reach the final four. Raimund Magis, head of the press section at the Austrian embassy, said he could not disclose how many fans had applied for entry visas. "We are not turning anyone away," he said. "We are really doing everything that is necessary to accommodate the fans. Many Russians credit 61-year-old Dutchman Hiddink with turning a drab and defensive Russian side into an attractive outfit that has earned widespread praise during the tournament for their attacking football. The state-run Sport television channel said the Gorodnikov family, who live in the Siberian town of Bolotnoye, had named their first child Guus in honour of the coach. In the Black Sea resort of Alushta, residents erected a Hiddink statue to commemorate his achievements, local media reported. Nadezhda Leontyeva, who works at a stationery and souvenir shop in Yekaterinburg, said customers were snapping up any items related to football. "There has been an invasion of our shop. People  have come and bought out all the flags, and all the posters with lists of tournament fixtures. Everything they could buy they have bought," she said
