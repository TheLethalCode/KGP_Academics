<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 24 (bdnews24.com)--The World Bank will help Bangladesh deal with rising food prices, the lending agency's vice-president for South Asia Praful Patel said Tuesday. It was crucially important to make sure the significant gains achieved in poverty reduction are not be eroded by high food prices, Patel said. "The World Bank is committed to helping Bangladesh overcome this challenge by providing financing to the government, investing in social protection programmes and efforts to boost agriculture," said Patel. At a press conference in the city's Sonargaon Hotel, Patel said he felt that the 6 percent growth of the economy was quite enviable compared to those in other developing countries. "Bangladesh should be capable to be a mid-income state within a decade if a growth of 7 percent can be maintained over the next ten years," he added. Patel however stressed a smooth political transition to facilitate economic growth terming the political situation critical. Suggesting substantial investment in developing human resources he said: "It is the biggest resource of Bangladesh." The multilateral agency official also recommended continuation of the reform agenda and increasing farm output. He also focused on huge infrastructure development saying, "The kind of infrastructure, needed for a 7 percent growth rate, simply does not exist in Bangladesh." On climate change, Patel said that Bangladesh was one of the countries that had not done much to address the issue. He affirmed the WB commitment to assist Bangladesh in adapting to and mitigating effects of climate change and further improve natural disaster management. Replying a query on the soaring global prices of food and fuel, Patel told the press briefing that the Bank would help Bangladesh cope with the challenges in form of budgetary assistances. "WB is funding and will fund the government's safety net programmes to face the food security crisis due to inflationary pressure," said the WB vice-president. Inflation has gone down from 12 percent in December to 7.7 percent in April, he added. Patel said that the current government acted fast in making available the inputs farmers needed prior to the crop season. He praised government measures to maintain macroeconomic stability and improve the core institutions of accountability such as the judiciary, ACC and the election commission. The WB official also lauded the caretaker government for its efforts to hold the national polls. Suggesting more regional integration among South Asian countries, Patel said the Bank was embarking on a long-term project to strengthen regional co-operation in water management among Bangladesh, India and Nepal for flood control. bdn
