 WASHINGTON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Federal Reserve resumed a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday that was expected to end with benchmark interest rates on hold and little evidence the central bank is going to raise borrowing costs soon. After an opening session on Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee resumed its policy-setting meeting at around 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) as scheduled, a Fed official said. A decision on rates is expected to be announced at about 2:15 p.m. EDT. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues confront a deepening housing market slump that looks set to be a drag on growth for months to come, and surging oil and commodity prices that threaten to ignite broader inflation. While inflation risks have edged up and the economy has seemingly steered clear of the risk of a deep recession, policy-makers at the central bank have not fully set aside concerns about economic weakness. The U.S. central bank lowered the interbank federal funds target rate to 2 percent at its last meeting on April 29-30, and has indicated it hopes rate reductions of 3.25 percentage points since mid-September will suffice to help the economy recover from the housing collapse and credit crunch.
