<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A committee has recommended a restart in the construction of City Centre, a high-rise in Motijheel, which developed a crack on its front wall. The committee has declared the building safe for use. The committee that probed the safety of the building owned by Dhaka City Corporation submitted its report to DCC chief executive officer Md Alauddin Tuesday. DCC mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka formed the probe committee on March 29 after the crack was spotted on the front wall of the building during construction. The committee recommended recruitment of a DCC engineer to oversee construction properly, Alauddin said. "Construction suspended after the crack was noticed will resume in a week," the official said. According to the report, the crack did not leave any impact on the main structure of the building. "The committee did not find any fault with the construction," the official said, referring to the report. The committee questioned the DCC's "sense of responsibility" as it failed to assign a site engineer to oversee construction. The committee alleged that the DCC did not assist in the investigation. The probe committee was led by BUET teacher Joynul Abedin. Dr Khan Mahmud Amanat, also from BUET, Lt Col Nurul Huda and Ahmad Ali Khan of the Public Works Department were also on the committee. bdnew
