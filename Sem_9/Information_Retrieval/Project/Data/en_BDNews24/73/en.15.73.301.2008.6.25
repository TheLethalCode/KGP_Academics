 LAHORE, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds from Suresh Raina and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and four wickets from teenage leg spinner Piyush Chawla helped India to a thumping 256-run win over Hong Kong in the Asia Cup one-day tournament in Karachi on Wednesday. Chawla bamboozled the Hong Kong batsmen, whose inexperience at international level was exposed as they were bowled out for just 118 after being hammered for 374 for four by the Indians. Raina struck his maiden one-day century, scoring 101, and captain Dhoni hit an unbeaten 109 as their fourth-wicket partnership put on 166 runs in 123 balls. India, playing their first match of the tournament, got off to a breezy start, with Virender Sehwag (78) and Gautam Gambhir (51) reaching 100 in 65 balls in a 127-run opening stand. Raina, in particular, savaged the Hong Kong bowlers, racing through his second 50 in only 16 balls with five sixes and three fours. Dhoni was also in spectacular form, his fourth one-day hundred coming from 90 balls with six sixes and five fours. "You have to be ruthless if you are contesting international cricket, no matter against which team you are playing," Dhoni said. "We have to play against tough teams in the coming days, so it was an ideal start for us as all the batsmen got good batting practice today." Chawla took career-best figures of four for 23, while Sehwag wrapped up the match by taking wickets off successive balls, the Hong Kong innings lasting just 36.5 overs. Chawla dismissed captain Tabarak Dar, who batted resolutely for 21 runs, Hussain Butt and Courtney Kruger, all stumped by Dhoni. His fourth victim was Munir Dar, caught by Yusuf Pathan. Chawla conceded just four runs in his first five overs as the batsmen struggled to fathom his bowling. RP Singh had started Hong Kong's downfall, removing opener Skhawat Ali leg before for nought in the second over. Pace bowler Manpreet Gony made his debut but did not get a wicket. Irfan Ahmed contributed Hong Kong's highest score of 25, laced with five fours. It was associate member Hong Kong's second successive defeat in the tournament in which they are appearing for the second time. Hong Kong skipper Tabarak Dar said it had been a tough match for his team. "The pitch had nothing for the bowlers and once they piled up runs it was always difficult to for us to chase such a big total," he said
