 MBABANE, Wed Jun 25(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Wednesday the African Union, backed by the United Nations, should lead a transitional process in Zimbabwe following disputed elections and a wave of political violence. Tsvangirai told a press conference: "I am asking the AU and SADC (Southern African Development Community) to lead an expanded initiative supported by the U.N. to manage what I will call a transitional process." Tsvangirai spoke at his home shortly after leaving the Dutch embassy, where he took refuge on Sunday when he pulled out of Friday's presidential election because of violence against his supporters. The opposition leader said the election would be a sham. While he was prepared to negotiate with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF before Friday, his Movement for Democratic Change would "not have anything to do" with a government that emerged from the vote. Tsvangirai spoke as pressure mounted on Mugabe from both inside and outside Africa to call off Friday's vote, which follows presidential and parliamentary elections on March 29 won by the MDC. Tsvangirai fell short of the absolute majority required for outright victory in the first round. Southern African leaders were holding an emergency meeting on Zimbabwe on Wednesday and Kenya stepped up African pressure for intervention, saying the country risked a Rwanda-style disaster. In the first concrete step to punish Mugabe for a wave of violence that resulted in Tsvangirai's withdrawal, former colonial power Britain said it was preparing tougher sanctions against specific members of the Zimbabwe's government. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga told reporters: "Zimbabwe right now is a disaster in the making," while Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula described the crisis as a blot on Africa. Odinga said Friday's presidential election should be postponed. "If the world does not act now, we will soon have a situation very similar to what we saw in Rwanda," he said referring to the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 people died
