 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Unrelenting overnight downpours in the capital and elsewhere across the country signalled that the monsoon season, which officially started in mid-June, might have truly set in. The Metrological Department said in a forecast Sunday morning that more heavy showers might be expected through the day. Met office duty officer SM Mahmudul Haque told bdnews24.com: "The overhanging rainclouds might induce further rainfall countrywide throughout the day, accompanied by very heavy showers at places." Monday might see the wet spell drying up somewhat, he added. Precipitation over 24 hours from 9am Saturday was recorded as 111mm in Dhaka, 88mm at Cox's Bazaar, 27mm in Chittagong, 46mm at Comilla, 49mm at Bogra, 21mm at Mongla, 38mm in Patuakhali and 23mm at Faridpur, the weather office said. bdnews24.c
