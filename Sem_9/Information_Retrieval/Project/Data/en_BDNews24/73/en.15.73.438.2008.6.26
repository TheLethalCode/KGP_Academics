<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Luis Aragones was right to join Turkish club Fenerbahce after Euro 2008 and has had the last laugh over his critics, Spanish media was broadly united in saying on Thursday. The timing of the Turkish club's statement on Wednesday could not have been worse, a day before Spain's semi-final against Russia, but few begrudged him the deal as Aragones had already said he was leaving after the tournament. "Luis does well to go to Istanbul. They are going to give him a lot of money. In two years he will earn around 12 million euros ($18.81 million). With the national team it would take him 10 years to earn that," sports daily Marca said. Daily El Pais absolved Aragones of blame as well and turned their anger on the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) saying they forced Fenerbahce into a premature move. "Spain's capacity for self-destruction is unlimited," El Pais wrote. "The irresponsible directors of the RFEF have slipped out news that Aragones would have an offer of a contract extension. "It was their way of courting public opinion. The news got to Fenerbahce who announced their pre-agreement for two years, unsettled by the RFEF directors' dealings." Former Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque is widely expected to be the replacement for Aragones, who told a news conference in Vienna on Wednesday that he had signed nothing yet. Spanish media have reported that Del Bosque has a verbal agreement with the federation's sporting director, Fernando Hierro, to take over after Aragones goes. Spain reaching their first semi-final in 24 years has divided opinion within the federation, El Pais said, as to whether they should continue with the Del Bosque plan, or stick with Aragones, as public support for him has rocketed. "The problem isn't the professional future of Aragones who is free to negotiate with who he wants," El Pais added. "Rather the current situation of the national team, who because of the actions of their governors, have shot themselves in the foot at the worst possible time." The 69-year-old has had a turbulent relationship with fans and the Spanish media during his four-year tenure and daily Sport reckoned Aragones was having the last laugh. "Luis is like this. When no one wanted him he decided to stay. Now that everyone wants him he goes," they wrote. "It is his way of gaining revenge on everyone.
