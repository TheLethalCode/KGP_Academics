<TITLE> Israel says to reopen Gaza border crossings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel will reopen its border crossings with the Gaza Strip on Sunday because there has been a halt to Palestinian cross-border attacks that had strained an Egyptian-brokered truce, officials said. Israeli military liaison official Peter Lerner said the Sufa and Karni commercial crossings, the Nahal Oz fuel transfer depot and the Erez border terminal for travellers would resume operations at 8 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT) with some restrictions. Israel closed the crossings on Wednesday after an Islamic Jihad rocket attack which the Palestinian militant group called revenge for the killing of one of its West Bank leaders. The truce, which came into effect on June 19, does not apply to the West Bank.
