 MBABANE, Wed Jun 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Southern African leaders began an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss Zimbabwe's crisis and Kenya stepped up African pressure for intervention, saying the country risked a Rwanda-style disaster. Former colonial power Britain said it was preparing tougher sanctions against specific members of Zimbabwe's government. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga told reporters: "Zimbabwe right now is a disaster in the making," while Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula described the crisis as a blot on Africa. Odinga, one of the continent's most outspoken critics of President Robert Mugabe, said Friday's presidential election should be postponed. "If the world does not act now, we will soon have a situation very similar to what we saw in Rwanda," he said referring to the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 people died. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has withdrawn from the election because of violence against his supporters, urged the United Nations to isolate Mugabe and called for a peacekeeping force. He accused Mugabe, 84, of declaring war. Mugabe has refused to call off the vote, shrugging off mounting international pressure including Monday's unprecedented U.N. Security Council condemnation of violence. It said a free and fair run-off election on Friday was impossible. Leaders of a Southern African Development Community security troika of Tanzania, Angola and Swaziland on Wednesday started a meeting near the Swaziland capital Mbabane, officials said. But the region's designated mediator, South African President Thabo Mbeki, would not attend, his spokesman said. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, Swaziland's King Mswati III and SADC executive secretary Tomaz Augusto Salomao were at the meeting. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was not present. The Tanzanian government said Mbeki had been invited, together with Zambian leader Levy Mwanawasa. The South African president has been negotiating between Mugabe and Zimbabwe's opposition since last year but has been widely criticized for being ineffective and too soft on Mugabe. Zambia's foreign minister said Mwanawasa would not attend but be briefed about the result. "Depending on the outcome of the troika meeting, we may consider taking the matter to the AU (African Union)," Foreign Minister Kabinga Pande said. NEW MEDIATOR Odinga said he had phoned the Tanzanian president ahead of the Swaziland meeting and suggested former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo or Botswana's former leader Ketumile Masire as possible mediators. Odinga also suggested a team from the African Union, backed by the United Nations, should be involved in the crisis which has seen the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy -- now suffering hyperinflation of around 2 million percent according to experts. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said on Wednesday that armed police had cordoned off and raided its office in the eastern city of Mutare. Nobody was arrested. Mbeki spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga told Reuters: "We are not going to Swaziland. We have had no invitation to go to any meeting, especially Swaziland." He said Mbeki also had no plans to visit Zimbabwe this week. In an apparent criticism of Mbeki, Odinga said a new negotiator must be appointed if the election went ahead on Friday. There has been wide international condemnation of the violence but SADC is seen as the only body that can influence events in Zimbabwe. Several of its members have been flooded by millions of refugees fleeing the economic collapse of the once prosperous country. Britain has been heavily critical of Mugabe, but has little influence over Zimbabwe. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said tougher sanctions were being prepared against members of Mugabe's government. "We are preparing intensified sanctions, financial and travel sanctions, against named members of the Mugabe regime," Brown told parliament. He said Britain would also try to ensure Zimbabwe's cricket team does not tour England next year. Development ministers from ten countries, including the US, Britain, Japan, France and Switzerland said in a statement that they encouraged the growing concern about Zimbabwe among African countries but the southern African region must do more to put pressure on Mugabe. South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister, Aziz Pahad, said in Pretoria that more efforts must be made to bring Mugabe and Tsvangirai together. The opposition leader, who has taken refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare since Sunday, said Zimbabwe would "break" if the world did not come to its aid. Nobel laureate Archbiship Desmond Tutu also called for peacekeepers to be sent to Zimbabwe. Mugabe "has mutated into something quite unbelievable. He has really turned into a kind of Frankenstein for his people," Tutu told ABC television in Australia
