<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A special trial court, which has exempted Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco from personal appearance in court hearings, has yet to decide on the same for his elder brother Tarique Rahman. Judge Shahed Nuruddin adjourned a hearing on Wednesday to June 29 on Tarique's application seeking exemption from appearing in hearings of a bribery case linked to the murder of Bashundhara Group chairman Humayun Kabir Sabbir.. Tarique's lawyer Sanaullah Miah sought the exemption Wednesday, telling reporters the judge was expected to give a decision later in the day. Judge Nuruddin, of the Special Judge's Court-3 set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex, had already earlier in the day granted an exemption to Coco from appearing in hearings of the Gatco graft case. Coco had sought permission from the court the previous day, for his lawyers to appear in future court hearings on his behalf, on medical grounds. Tarique and Coco have been held in the prison ward of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, while charges against the two brothers are pending trial. Both are reportedly suffering from a number of medical complaints, for which they want to seek treatment overseas. bdnews24.
