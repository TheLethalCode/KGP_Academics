<TITLE> Pietersen blames batsmen as England lose one-day series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stand-in captain Kevin Pietersen on Saturday blamed England's batsmen for their 3-1 defeat to New Zealand in the one-day series, which ended with a meek 51-run loss in the fifth match at Lord's on Saturday. England, who won the test series convincingly 2-0, started the one-day matches strongly with a 114-run victory when Pietersen scored a match-winning century and grabbed the headlines with his unique switch-hitting. Two weeks on and New Zealand were able to turn the series around with wins at Bristol, The Oval and Lord's after a no result at Edgbaston when they seemed to be heading for a win before he rain prevented a finish. "It all started alright with the toss and then we did a great job with the ball," Pietersen, skipper in place of the suspended Paul Collingwood, told reporters. "We just didn't bat well enough, not only today but throughout the series. "Too many players have got in and not gone on and been the hero. The consistency in the batting has not been there and it's an area where we need to have a look at." New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, who led from the front with figures of three for 32, was pleased with how his team came back after the test series disappointment. "From the second match at Edgbaston onwards we have played some really good cricket," Vettori told reporters. "To win any series is pleasing but to win against a pretty good team away from home and in convincing style means we have a very happy dressing room." Although Pietersen has not yet been confirmed as England skipper for the next three matches of Collingwood's ban, he is keen to take on the role again. "Today was great fun and if I get the opportunity (again) hopefully I will do a good enough job," he said. "I'm a perfectionist and I strive on doing things really well and to the best of my ability and being successful. "So finishing today without a victory gives me more of an incentive to get the stripes back again for the next game and to try and get a victory under our belts. I don't want to be an England captain who captains one game and loses it.
