<TITLE> Aragones fashions a more resilient Spain </TITLE>

 NEUSTIFT, Austria, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Luis Aragones is not a great fan of tactics and systems, instead putting the emphasis on skill and mental attitude as the two most important ingredients in making a successful team. In his four years in the post, Aragones has tried to create a side with its own distinctive style tailored to the individual strengths of the players, whilst at the same time building team spirit and instilling self belief. He was a popular choice when appointed after the debacle at Euro 2004, when Spain went out at the group stage. However, a premature exit at the last World Cup in the round of 16, the decision to dispense with team talisman Raul and his unfulfilled threats to resign undermined his position. Encounters with the media became increasingly fractious and there were even rumours the 69-year-old might quit in the run-up to Euro 2008. But knowing he will step down after the tournament seems to have concentrated his mind and Aragones has been the model of calmness and diplomacy while working in the bucolic surroundings of the team's training base in the Tyrol. With more senior figures like Raul and goalkeeper Santiago Canizares now out of the picture, Aragones has been able to impose himself more easily on his fledgling team. He has an almost paternal approach to dealing with young players like Fernando Torres and Sergio Ramos, although as with many father-son relationships there is the occasional blow-up. TEAM ETHIC It is on the psychological aspect that Aragones appears to be doing his best workbuilding up his players, emphasising the team ethic and keeping them isolated from the euphoria in certain sections of the Spanish media. Much of the credit for the squad's quiet confidence and self belief must go to him. Unlike so many of their predecessors, this Spanish team has developed a winning mentality that proved decisive in their group victories over Sweden and Greece and their penalty shootout win over Italy in the quarter-finals. "Anything can happen in a game of football, but I want my players to be convinced they can win as those teams that have that conviction usually do," Aragones said before the Italy match. Spain's training regime is relatively light and if there is a criticism that can be levelled at Aragones and his assistants it is that their methods are rather old-fashioned, although so far the results have been impressive. Spain have won 37 and lost just four of their 52 games since Aragones took charge. Two more victories and he will be able to step down as the most successful coach since Jose Villalonga led them to their European Championship triumph in 1964
