<TITLE> Blunt Aragones meets suave Loew in style clash </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gruff Spain coach Luis Aragones could not be more different from Germany's young-looking style connoisseur Joachim Loew. Their contrasting approaches have not mattered when it comes to winning, though, with most pundits struggling to choose between the teams contesting Sunday's Euro 2008 final. The 69-year-old Aragones is never out of his tracksuit, his thinning grey hair often damp with sweat, while his blunt nature has caused controversy on and off the pitch. He had to fight off accusations of racism following comments about France striker Thierry Henry in 2004 and is also not averse to criticising his own players. Earlier in the tournament, Aragones said Sergio Ramos still had a lot to learn in terms of his behaviour. Later he was involved in a heated discussion with the defender when Ramos appeared to take issue with something he said in training. "The better player you are, the more discipline you have to have in every sense," Aragones told reporters recently. Despite his scruffy looks and irregular methods, his team have produced stylish, attacking play on their way to the final. In contrast, Germany have been more direct and have stuttered along at times in the tournament. Their struggles have led to the suave Loew losing his customary cool. He gave his players a stern talking to at halftime in the 3-2 semi-final win over Turkey, having been sent to the stands in the decisive 1-0 group victory against Austria after arguing with the fourth official. "You won't catch me criticising referees. I tried several languages to try to get him to leave us be (in the technical area). Perhaps I overstretched my politeness a bit," Loew said. Generally, though, he is rarely flustered and looks younger than his 48 years thanks to his floppy hair, ironed trousers and designer shirts. He also differs from Aragones in terms of experience, having had only a modest club management career in Germany and Turkey. The Spain boss can draw on knowledge from his time in charge of Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Espanyol, Real Betis, Sevilla, Valencia, Real Oviedo and Real Mallorca. Sunday will decide if the tracksuit or the smart suit reigns suprem
