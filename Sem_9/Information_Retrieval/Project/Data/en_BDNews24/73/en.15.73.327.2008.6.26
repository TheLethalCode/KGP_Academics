 FALLUJA, Iraq, Thu Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up at a tribal council meeting in Iraq's Anbar province on Thursday, killing 20 people, days before US forces are due to hand the province over to Iraqi control, police said. In the northern city of Mosul, a car bomb killed 18 people and wounded 62, the governor of the surrounding province of Nineveh told Reuters. Twelve people were wounded in the attack against US-backed Sunni Arab tribal leaders in the Anbar town of Garma, 30 km (20 miles) northwest of Baghdad, said Colonel Dawood al-Maraawi, police spokesman in the nearby city of Falluja. A tribal leader, Mizher Mshawih, and the head of the district council, Kamal Abdul-Salam, were among those killed, Maraawi said. Three policemen were also killed, he said. Garma is in Anbar province, once the heartland of the Sunni Arab insurgency against US forces. In late 2006, Sunni Arab tribal leaders, sick of al Qaeda's indiscriminate killing of civilians and harsh interpretation of Islam, joined with the US military to expel the group. Violence in the province has fallen so sharply that Anbar is scheduled to become the first Sunni Arab province to be transferred to Iraqi security control on Saturday. A U.S. military source in Anbar province, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject, said there were no immediate plans to postpone the handover date in response to the bombing. "We still have people planning for the event. Obviously our senior commanders are always assessing, but as of right now, there is no change. The situation is continually being looked at," he said. The suicide bomber managed to get into a meeting between the tribal council of Garma, made up of local tribal leaders, and Abdul-Salam. The meeting was held inside the building of the local council which also serves as headquarters of the tribal council. In Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad, attackers fired two rockets that landed near the office of Nineveh province Governor Duraid Kashmula, officials said. When Kashmula left the building to investigate, a parked car bomb exploded. Kashmula said 18 people were killed and 62 wounded in that attack. Nineveh, a hotbed of activity by al Qaeda insurgents, is hit by frequent bombings, shootings and kidnappings despite a crackdown by US and Iraqi forces
