 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Detained former home minister Mohammad Nasim, now under treatment at LabAid Specialised Hospital, has sought an exemption from personal court appearance. The application was made Thursday at the special court where a corruption case against the Awami League leader, involving the illegal setting up of 300,000 digital telephone lines by Worldtel Holdings Ltd, is under trial. Advocate Sheikh Baharul Islam presented the application at the Special Judges Court-3, where judge Shahed Nuruddin said he would give a decision on the matter after a hearing Sunday. However, the judge assured the lawyer that if necessary the hearing would be held earlier. The ailing Nasim is awaiting release on parole to seek treatment abroad. He was admitted to the LabAid hospital earlier in the week after suffering a stroke. The AL leader was arrested on Feb 4 last year on charges of corruption. In October last year, he was sentenced to 13 years in jail for amassing property beyond his known income and concealing wealth-related information. The court also sentenced his wife to three years for abetting helping her husband. She is yet to be arrested or turn herself in. bdnews24
