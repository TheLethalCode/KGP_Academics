<TITLE> Spirited Tigers wait for Sri Lanka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  Taking heart from Saturday's better batting display against India, Bangladesh look forward to another spirited game against Sri Lanka in their second Super Fours match of the Asia Cup in Karachi on Monday. Consistency will be the mantra as so often the team fails to keep the momentum after a good showing. Sloppy catching and overthrow didn't help the Tigers' cause either Saturday, helping India, who also dropped a few catches, to chase 283 with almost seven overs to spare. Sri Lanka thumped Bangladesh by 131 runs in the group match at Lahore and Mohammad Ashraful's men would have to play out of their skin Monday if they are to stop the Sri Lankan, who will be playing back-to-back games. Bangladesh need to devise a way to stop hard-hitting opening pair of Kumar Sangakkara, who continued his superb form to crack a century against Pakistan on Sunday, and Sanath Jayasuirya, who had taken the match away putting on 116 runs in 14.5 overs. With the bowling attack struggling to be penetrative on batting-friendly wickets, the onus would lie more heavily on their batsmen to make a match. The team management is due to give another thought about misfiring opener Nazimuddin, who has scored 2, 1 and 6 in the tournament. The Bangladesh batsmen should not have much trouble from Sri Lanka's depleted pace attack, but they have to reckon with magical spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and newcomer Ajantha Mendis. Poor shot selection is another area they need to look at despite the fact that captain Mohammad Ashraful and Alok Kapali already have had hundreds against their names, while Tamim Iqbal and Roqibul Hasan too have been among runs. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal, Nazimuddin, Roqibul Hassan, Mushfiqur Rahim (Wicketkeeper), Alok Kapali, Mahmudullah Riyad, Farhad Reza, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain Rajib. 12th Man - Mehrab Hossain Jr. b
