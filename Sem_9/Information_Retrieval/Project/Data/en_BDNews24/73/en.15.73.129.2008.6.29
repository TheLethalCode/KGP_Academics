<TITLE> Kapali's new innings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Karachi, June 29 (bdnews24.com) - Alok Kapali's 97-ball 115 against India Saturday could have been like any hundred scored in an ODI. However, quality, class and style was so distinctly in evidence in that gem of a knock that even after the Tigers' seven-wicket loss cricket fans and journalists here are still talking about it. From hotel staff to the usually unassuming security personnel at the Tigers' hotel Kapali has become a star overnight. Fans and kids present at the lobby are rushing for his autographs and having their snaps taken, according to a report of the tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Kapali has also stirred the imagination of the international media covering the Asia Cup and are trying to find out every bit about this gifted 24-year-old and his surprising absence from the world cricket scene for so long. There are significant factors that separated Kapali's innings from merely being another special one. He was not even supposed to be here and only a training-ground injury to Aftab Ahmed opened the door for him and he was pulled out of the England-bound Bangladesh A side and inserted into the national squad for the Kitply Cup tri-series earlier this month. With a very small gap between the Kitply Cup and the Asia Cup the selectors decided against changes and retained the same team for this tournament and Kapali got the ticket to Pakistan. This was an opportunity Kapali could ill afford to slip. "I had last played an ODI for Bangladesh 22 months ago and when I got selected for the A team my family members and friends were very happy and told me to make that chance count. "Then Aftab got injured and I was called up in the national side and before coming to Pakistan I thought this was my lucky ground as I had made some runs and taken a hattrick when I was here last time (in 2003) and just the right place to start all over again," said Kapali, a firm believer in reincarnation from a religious point of view at least. "My late father believed in reincarnation and that's why I do too. But from my cricket's perspective I hope this is a new beginning also." Kopali's international career had begun in almost the same period Mohammad Ashraful and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza were making heads turn with their unmistakable talent. He made his ODI debut in August 2002 and until November 2003 the performances graph was steady if not spectacular as he made four fifties and a few useful 40s and 30s. Then started a free fall. The timing was there, the wrist work was as elegant as ever, the class was oozing but Kapali just could not get the runs and was termed Bangladesh cricket's greatest enigma. Kapali lost his place in Dav Whatmore's team and was almost forgotten before his second coming happened. "I can't blame Dav or anyone for that. I was not scoring runs and had to accept the fact that I was out of the Bangladesh team. I held no grudges. In fact I always wished the team well when they were playing," says Kapali who also admits making mistakes at that crucial juncture. "When I was out of form I spoke to many people - coaches, players about what I should be doing. Maybe I consulted too many persons and tried too many things after listening to them. That did not help at all and I became a confused cricketer." Things did start changing for the better in 2007 and Kapali attributes that to himself. "I identified the weaknesses in my batting myself. There were slight changes I had to make technically. Earlier I went across too much early on and that brought about my downfall often. I practiced playing with a straight bat and I made runs in the National Championship and the Dhaka Premier League this season," said Kapali. His batting on Saturday was all about that new found maturity. Kapali's first fifty took 65 balls and then he exploded and brought up his hundred playing another 21 deliveries. In all he hit 5 sixes preferring the widish mid-wicket region and cleared the rope with clinical efficiency. "All the while I was thinking of the team score and did not for once look at my runs on the scoreboard yesterday. I planned my innings and followed the team rule. I knew that if I was there after 40 overs then I could play those big shots and that's why I started off playing as straight as possible and with low-risk shots. I practice those lofted shots too." Rather than basking in the afterglow of a majestic innings, Kapali was looking at it as a stepping stone. "There is so much work to be done. I was out of the national set-up for a long time, almost two years, and now I need to earn my place again. I have to improve my fitness level also as I have not trained in the same pace as the national team. There is a lot of catching up to do," said Kapal
