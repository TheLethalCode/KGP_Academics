 LAHORE, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Young spinner Nadeem Ahmed had Pakistan reeling in mid-innings before they recovered to make 288 for nine against Hong Kong in their Asia Cup match at Karachi's National stadium on Tuesday. The Pakistan-born 20-year-old, playing in only his second one-day international, finished with four for 51 after sending the Pakistanis crashing from 121 for two to 161 for seven. Fawad Alam, unbeaten on 63 from 77 balls, and Sohail Tanvir, who scored 59, revived the innings with a record Asia Cup eighth-wicket stand of 100 runs. They beat the previous best of Ajay Jadeja and Ajit Agarkar for India against Pakistan at Dhaka in 2000. Left armer Ahmed, whose only other international appearance was also against Pakistan in Colombo in the 2004 Asia Cup, took the wickets of Younis Khan (67), Mohammad Yousuf (28), Misbah-ul-Haq (2) and Shahid Afridi (4) in 21 balls for 19 runs. Younis had guided Pakistan to a solid position after the early loss of opener Salman Butt for a duck with the third ball of the innings. Younis put on 66 with captain Shoaib Malik (35) and 54 with Yousuf before Ahmed struck on a good batting track, flighting the ball and turning it appreciably. Younis hit eight fours in his 65-ball innings before he was stumped while Yousuf was caught, Misbah trapped leg before and Afridi gave a return catch to Ahme
