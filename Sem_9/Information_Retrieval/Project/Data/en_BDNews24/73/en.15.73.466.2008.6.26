<TITLE> Germany show strength of mind can make up for a lot </TITLE>

 BASEL, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew has a lot of work to do heading into Sunday's Euro 2008 final but he can be confident that if all else fails the team's physical and mental strength can still get them out of trouble. Germany did just about everything wrong in the semi-final against Turkey but despite making terrible mistakes in defence and relying on the hit-and-hope approach to building attacks they came through a bruising match to win 3-2. After falling behind midway through the first half they showed a couple of moments of quality to go ahead through Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose. When Turkey equalised with four minutes to go it looked like Fatih Terim's team were heading for another great escape but Germany showed they are made of sterner stuff than Switzerland, Czech Republic or Croatia as they snatched victory. Philipp Lahm's late strike turned the tables on the Turks who had managed their own great escape three times. "We've got a victor's mentality and want to win the title," said Loew. "We didn't do what usually makes us strong, which is passing forward. We started kicking high balls forward instead and the Turks were able to stop that. GREAT MORALE "It was an open match, going back and forth without any clear structure, but the team showed great morale to come back." Germany will face a different test in Sunday's Vienna final, whether it is against Russia or Spain who meet on Thursday. Both those teams like to move the ball around, and neither will play such a tight pressing game. That is likely to work in Germany's favour. Under Loew, the Germans look far more comfortable playing on the counter-attack than trying to build through midfield and if they are given that opportunity on Sunday in Vienna they stand a great chance of winning a fourth European Championship. "After coming so far we obviously want to win and we're going to bring our winning mentality into the final," Loew said. "The players are exhausted after five or six weeks now but there's also obviously a lot of joy." Loew's task will be to ensure they play with none of the casualness that marked their performance against Turkey, particularly in the first half. "We know we didn't play well," captain Michael Ballack told reporters. "It was a real fighting game but on a technical level it wasn't very good. "We have no preferences about who we play in the final. Russia were very good in the last couple of games and Spain are also strong. "There's no feeling in our minds that we are now the favourites. That just doesn't come into it.
