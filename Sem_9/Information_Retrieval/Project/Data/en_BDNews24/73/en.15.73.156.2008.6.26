<TITLE> Lahm happier with goal than own performance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's Philipp Lahm said his 90th minute winner against Turkey was the most important of his career, but was less ecstatic about his overall performance in Wednesday's 3-2 victory in their Euro 2008 semi-final. The 24-year-old defender was involved at both ends of the pitch during the dramatic closing stages, first making a mistake that allowed Turkey to equalise for 2-2 in the 86th minute. The left back made amends four minutes later, though, combining neatly with Thomas Hitzlsperger to fire home a winner that also brought him the man of the match award. "I thought my performance was ok, but I think there are other games where I have more deserved such awards," Lahm told a news conference. "I didn't look so good with that equaliser but as a team we know that you have to keep believing in your abilities. "You can lose out in a tackle like I did before the Turkey goal, but you should never lose belief in yourself and your team. "To go 2-2 down just before the end and then produce the winner, and all in a European Championship semi-final, I can certainly say it's the most important goal I've ever scored. "I couldn't tell you what went through my head. There was just too much emotion." Lahm said he had given little thought to Sunday's final opponents, the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between Spain and Russia. "I'm just happy to be in the final and we'll take whoever comes our way," he said. "All we want now is to bring the title back to Germany.
