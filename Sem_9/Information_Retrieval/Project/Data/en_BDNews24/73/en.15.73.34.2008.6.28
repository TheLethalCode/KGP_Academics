Abul Quashem, a farmer who came to the dialogue venue, 45 kilometres south of the port city, said he hoped the chief adviser would give villagers a patient hearing. The dialogue widened scope for the people of southern Chittagong to share their views with government high-ups. Prior to the talks, the chief adviser said: "Political parties are not our opponents. None of us will take part in the next election." Fakhruddin hoped that a democratic government would be established thanks to the participation of all political parties in the year-end elections.
