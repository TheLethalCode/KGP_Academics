 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Tuesday his party wanted solution to problems through talks, not clashes. The AL leader demanded that the government release former home minister Mohammad Nasim on bail in 24 hours and facilitate his treatment abroad. "If anything happens to Mohammad Nasim, the government will be responsible," Ashraful told reporters at acting party president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home after a presidium meeting. Ashraful said the meeting was organised to take a final decision on whether the Awami League would participate in the city corporation elections. However, the meeting later focused on Nasim's health. On whether the AL would participate in local government elections, Ashraful said: "We will go to dialogue to reach a consensus. We have no difference of opinion on local government elections." "The difference of opinion is over the time of the electionas to when it will be held. We hope this difference will be settled through discussion." bdnews24.
