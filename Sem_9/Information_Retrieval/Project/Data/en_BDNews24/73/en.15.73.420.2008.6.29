<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-headed four-party alliance will see what happens to its key leaders including former prime minister Khaleda Zia before deciding on participation in local government elections, BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said. The alliance at a meeting discussed the issue of whether or not to take part in the four city corporation and nine municipal elections due in October but did not take a decision for 'strategic reasons', Delwar, the Khaleda-nominated secretary general, told reporters. "We will take the next steps after seeing what decision the government takes on the release of Khaleda Zia and Motiur Rahman Nizami, sending Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco abroad and withdrawal of the state of emergency. Let's see what the government does." Asked whether they would go to the polls, Delwar said, "We will not field any candidate on party tickets. If anybody wants to participate in the election he will do so at his own responsibility. There is still time. We will not take part in any stage-managed election." Delwar came down hard on the Awami League for its decision to join the elections. "They are going to participate in a stage-managed election after forging an entente with the government. The Awami League had made such pacts several times in the past." He alleged that the AL unleashed anarchy in October 2006 immediately after the four-party coalition government had relinquished the power. "Later patronised by some foreign countries they conspired and staged January 11 incidents. After the entente with the government the tone of Awami League leader Zillur Rahman and the chief adviser sounds similar." "When the schedule for the local government election was announced, [Zillur Rahman] termed it a farce. After a few days he said his party would go to local elections in the interest of democracy. They had cheated with the people in the past." He referred to the AL's singular decision to join the 1986 general elections and imposition of a one-party rule in 1972 by amending the constitution. "The BNP and its allies will not enter into any deal with the government endangering the interest of the country." Delwar also demanded release of all detained leaders including Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, Tariqul Islam and MK Anwar. bdnew
