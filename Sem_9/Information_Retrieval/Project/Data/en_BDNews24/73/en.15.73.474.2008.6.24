<TITLE> NCC has no legal basis of taking up cases: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)The National Coordination Committee that works to check serious crimes has no "legal validity" of taking up new cases, said the committee's chairman MA Matin Tuesday. Corrected Matin, also home and shipping adviser, said the committee would not itself deal with any new case but would refer all graft allegations to the Anticorruption Commission. "The ACC will handle all corruption allegations from now on. The NCC is not taking up new cases. It has no legal basis either," the adviser said when he was asked if the NCC would take up any new high-profile case. The NCC has so far worked mainly to bring changes and assist the ACC, Matin clarified to reporters Tuesday after attending a board meeting of Bangladesh Shipping Corporation at the shipping ministry. The NCC has so far investigated 488 cases. Of them, 65 have been disposed of, following trial. The remainder of the cases are either on trial or being investigated. Matin said on Sunday that the government would not start any fresh anticorruption drive but would consider cases on a priority basis from the list of corruption suspects lying with the government. On whether the NCC's stance indicated the government's gradual withdrawal or switch to a more amenable stance, the adviser said: "I don't see any compromise. We've assisted the ACC by instigating necessary measures against those found guilty." Shipping secretary Sheikh Enayetullah, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation chairman Golam Rabbani and other senior officials attended Tuesday's board meeting. The adviser said the BSC board meeting discussed public safety issues such as overloaded passenger launches during the ensuing monsoons and government measures to prevent such safety breaches, which included at least three committees for ensuring regular monitoring of river traffic. The adviser said the launches pick up only the allowed load of passengers at the main terminals under close monitoring. "Overloading occurs where there is currently no monitoring." Only four inspectors are expected to monitor hundreds of launches handling millions of passengers round the clock all the year round, which was unfeasible, Matin said. Obtaining fitness certificates has been made compulsory for all launches plying the Dhaka-Chittagong-Barisal-Chandpur routes, he said. Careful selection and recruitment of masters and drivers is also crucial, the home adviser said. bdnews24.
