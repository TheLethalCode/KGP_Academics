<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will take part in the local government polls under the banner of a citizen committee, which promises to bring together the 14-party alliance, pro-Liberation groups and civil society, a leader said Sunday. "The Awami League will start talks on the issue with 14-party alliance members on Monday," acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a presidium meeting at acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. He said the local leaderships would decide on the nomination of candidates for the elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. "The central committee will intervene if local leaders fail to nominate their candidates," the AL leader said. On the four-party alliance's refusal to take part in the polls, Ashraful said: "We want all parties to take part in the polls. We have to change the practice of election boycott. "But every political party has its freedom to take a decision on whether or not to go to the polls." On BNP's allegation that the Awami League connived with the government, Ashraful said: "They should have control over what they say. They should not spoil the good environment with illogical remarks." The AL leader said his party had appealed to the government to send former home minister Mohammad Nasim abroad for better medical treatment by Monday. bdnews24.c
