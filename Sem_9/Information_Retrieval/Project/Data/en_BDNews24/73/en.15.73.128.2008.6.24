<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)The government has not engaged in any clandestine meeting with any political party or attempted any special deal, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed was quoted as saying Tuesday in the government's political dialogue with the Progressive Democratic Party. PDP convenor Ferdaus Ahmed Quarishi quoted Fakhruddin while briefing reporters at a joint press conference after the dialogue at the chief adviser's office. "The chief adviser refuted all rumours and allegations about the government getting involved in secret deals," said Quarishi. "He plainly asserted that the elections will be held transparently according to the roadmap already announced." An eight-member PDP delegation was led by Quarishi in the dialogue with Fakhruddin accompanied by communications adviser Ghulam Quader and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Law adviser Hassan Ariff is abroad, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury is attending to personal business and local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal is out of the city, Hossain Zillur told reporters, explaining the absence of the three who also normally attend the political dialogues. "People at large have been heard discussing disturbing rumours, such as the government reaching an understanding with a certain political party, or that Awami League are claiming that they will form the next government based on a secret deal struck with the government," said Quarishi. "We sought clarifications on the above stated rumours at the meeting today. The chief adviser dispelled all doubts and fears." "We supported holding of local government polls before the national election," said Quarishi. "As people today want elections, it doesn't really matter who are running the polls and who aren'tpeople now want to leave the 'old order' behind. I'm sure that at least 60 percent people will be casting votes during the forthcoming elections," said the PDP convenor. The party also proposed no rescheduling of loans by big defaulters for at least a year in advance of any polls they are considering contesting, Quarishi said. "No rescheduling, all loans will have to be regularised before the polls, in the case of any loan defaulter running for elections." Education adviser Hossain Zillur, speaking to reporters on behalf of the government at the press briefing, said: "We are advancing towards holding a meaningful election, taking everyone with us, ensuring the participation of all concerned, and leaving no stone unturned." "The people of Bangladesh are quite aware and they are assessing our moves at all times. We are doing all right, as we are not deviating from the announced election roadmap." bdnews24.com/e
