 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Wednesday sentenced Orion Group chairman Obaidul Karim to 13 years in prison in a graft case, filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Judge Khandaker Kamal Uzzaman of the Special Court-9 on the Jatiya Sangsad complex also fined Obaidul Tk 10 lakh and ordered one more year in jail in failure to pay the fine. The court also ordered confiscation of Obaidul's Tk 50.92 crore worth of property earned by illegal means. The convict was on the run. The ACC filed the case against Obaidul with Ramna Police Station on Oct 8 last year on charges of amassing illegal wealth and concealing information on wealth. Obaidul's wife Arjuda Karim and son Salman Karim had also been accused in the case for abetting him in corruption but they were later discharged. According to case details, Obaidul had concealed information on Tk 46.28 crore in property and earned Tk 4.63 crore by unfair means. In his verdict, the judge said: "Obaidul Karim submitted a statement on property worth about Tk 2 crore to the ACC. Besides, he used legalised Tk 40 crore in black money." On Dec 27 last year, a court sentenced Obaidul to life imprisonment for misappropriating money from Oriental Bank, now ICB Islamic Bank. bdnew
