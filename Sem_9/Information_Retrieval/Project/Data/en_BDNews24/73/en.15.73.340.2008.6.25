 VIENNA, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's footballing engine stalled and spluttered in the early Euro 2008 matches before finding top gear and cruising into the semi-finals in style. Guus Hiddink's men looked destined for the scrapheap after a 4-1 loss to Spain in their first game but the coach's remarkable repair job and the influence of Andrei Arshavin, who was banned last time, means a repeat is unlikely in Thursday's rematch. The Dutchman gave the players a hard time after that opening loss, telling them they needed to change their naive ways fast and putting them through what he said were tense sessions. It had not been all bad in that first match, with Russia looking exciting going forward, but the problem was that in their enthusiasm to attack they seemed to forget about defence. With just one or two Russian defenders at the back at times, Spain forward David Villa was handed a hat-trick on a plate. They learnt a painful lesson and when they faced Greece in the next match they barely looked in danger of conceding. Hiddink installed the experienced Sergei Ignashevich in the centre of defence instead of Roman Shirokov, who had tended to drift into his usual midfield position against Spain. Going forward they looked constantly dangerous but their 1-0 victory told the story of missed opportunities, mainly by striker Roman Pavlyuchenko who squandered several sitters. The win kept alive their chances going into the third match against Sweden where Hiddink could at last wheel out his biggest weapon, Arshavin, who was suspended for the first two games. EYE-CATCHING The Swedes barely knew what had hit them and were unable to keep a lid on the nifty 27-year-old as he tore through their defence with menace, inspiring his team mates to do the same and scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win. With a new confidence and an eye-catching way of playing, that victory booked Russia their first place in the knockout phase of a major tournament since they were part of the Soviet Union in 1988 and reached the European Championship final. Hiddink had achieved his aim but while he encouraged his players to enjoy the moment, he was already plotting his next move. The challenge was a quarter-final against his native Netherlands, who had demolished world champions Italy and runners-up France in the group stage with the trademark flowing moves Hiddink had been trying to instil in his own team. Russia did not just imitate the slick Dutch style, they improved on it and Marco van Basten's team were beaten at their own game by 3-1 after extra time. Hiddink masterminded the tactics, while Arshavin was at the centre of implementing them on the pitch. A sharper-looking Pavlyuchenko scored his third of the finals and Arshavin bagged his second goal and second man-of-the-match award in two games. The Russians will now have a second crack at Spain and, after the transformation they have undergone in just two weeks, the players believe they can get it right this time
