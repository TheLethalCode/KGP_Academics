<TITLE> Tournament's legacy is 4-5-1, says Wenger </TITLE>

 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Saturday he expected Spain to start Sunday's Euro 2008 final with a five-man midfield, maintaining one of the trends of the tournament. When striker David Villa went off injured after 35 minutes of Spain's semi-final victory over Russia, Cesc Fabregas went on as an extra midfielder and helped his country to a 3-0 victory. Fabregas, who has played under Wenger at Arsenal for almost five years since joining as a 16-year-old, is expected to start against Germany on Sunday and his club manager is not surprised. "Most of the teams who came to the tournament as 4-4-2 finished as 4-5-1, including Germany," he told a news conference. "Teams suffered too much in midfield. Even without Fabregas, Spain played 4-5-1 defensively as Villa dropped back, then switched to two up front in attack." Wenger said he thought Spain were a stronger team with Fabregas in the side. "They have an abundance of midfield talent, all short players who are technically very subtle," he said. "Sometimes you have to look twice to see who is doing stuff as they look alike and are similarly talented technically. "But Fabregas has vision in depth and I believe it is those players who make you win. He has that forward vision and they have a more vertical game when he plays." REMAIN DANGEROUS Wenger thought Spain would win the final, probably 2-1, but said people should be wary of judging them on their three-goal second-half display in Thursday's semi-final. "It is difficult to make a definitive conclusion from one half," he said. "Russia were dead physically in the second half." Wenger said it was important for Germany that Ballack recovered from his calf injury to take his place in the side. "I think Germany will suffer in midfield and Ballack can carry the team," he said. "He always covers more ground than people think and it will be sad for him if he misses the game after missing the 2002 World Cup final with a yellow card." Wenger said Germany remain dangerous even when, as against Turkey in the semi-final, they are not at their best. "Germany are the only team in the tournament who can have four chances and score three goals and they are the only team who score headers," he said. "They can always raise their game for the big occasions. They can be under pressure but get a free kick near the halfway line and score from that. "How Spain deal with those free kicks and corners is important, though they did well against Italy (in the quarter-final).
