<TITLE> Transfer talk not distracting Russians, says Hiddink </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's players are not being distracted by speculation over which big clubs may snap them up after Euro 2008, coach Guus Hiddink said on the eve of their semi-final against Spain. With their attractive, attack-minded style, players like forwards Andrei Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko have shot into the transfer market spotlight. Hiddink said his players were keeping their feet on the ground and their minds focused on Thursday's match in Vienna against the team that thrashed them 4-1 in the group phase. "Maybe they get calls that I don't want but I can't control that, it's their life," Hiddink told a news conference on Wednesday. "But the reaction of the players to all true or not true stories is that they are very stable and they love to play football. It doesn't distract them." Arshavin, who has been linked with clubs in Spain and England, told uefa.com his dream move would be Barcelona. "I have supported Barcelona all my life. Barcelona are my dream," the 27-year-old Zenit St Petersburg player said. "I never thought I would have a genuine chance to play for the club. Let's see how the situation unfolds." COPING WELL Hiddink said Arshavin was coping with the attention well. "Every tournament needs its attractive teams and when you are watching attractive teams that means that within them are outstanding players and he's one of those players," the Dutchman said. "Young kids like to have a kind of role model  he's the kind of player who attracts attention. He can deal with it very well, he's not getting out of control whatsoever." Arshavin dodged questions after training, keeping his head down and rushing determinedly past the waiting reporters. Hiddink said despite the transformation of the side in the two weeks since the Spain defeat, they were not letting the success go to their heads because they had not forgotten about their bumpy qualifying campaign. "I'm realistic and I don't forget the past," the 61-year-old coach said, pointing to the defeat by Israel that left their qualification hopes hanging by a thread in November as one of the difficult moments. "Everything now is highlights and highlights  I don't forget the tough way we had (it in qualifying). Hopefully, I don't get carried away by today's success because we know where we came from.
