 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim is expected to get parole in a couple of days for better medical treatment abroad, according to party colleagues and home ministry officials. AL leader Tofail Ahmed broadly hinted that Nasim would be released on parole by Friday morning. In a speech to a discussion to mark the party's 59th founding anniversary at the auditorium of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, Tofail expressed concern over the condition of Nasim. Officials with the home ministry told bdnews24.com that the government agreed to release Nasim on parole, but there was no official announcement Wednesday. "A formal announcement is expected soon," one of the officials said, asking not to be named. Meantime, the government sought opinions from Anisul Haque, a lawyer for the Anticorruption Commission, about the probable parole for the former home minister. "The home ministry has sought my opinions," he told bdnews24.com. The condition of Nasim, who had suffered blood haemorrhage in his brain, has slightly improved although the left side of his body remains "paralysed", a hospital official said. "His condition has improved a bit and he may be out of danger," Dr AKM Mahbubul Hoque, coordinator of LabAid Specialised Hospital, told reporters. Nasim's son Tanvir Shakil and advocate Sheikh Baharul Islam appealed to the government for his treatment abroad. The application addressed to the chief adviser was handed to home adviser MA Matin Wednesday. The application sought release of Nasim and urged the government to make quick arrangements to send him to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Matin told reporters: "The government is very sympathetic about Mr Nasim. He was in the position I hold now." "He has been jailed for 13 years in a corruption case. The legal process is involved in the matter. If there is no legal obstacle, the government will look into the problem sympathetically." Nasim was admitted to LabAid Tuesday. Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed visited him in hospital Wednesday. Tofail told reporters: "I talked to Syed Fahim Munaim (press secretary to the chief adviser) about sending Nasim abroad." Nasim was arrested on Feb 4 last year. bdnews2
