<TEXT>
 Lahore, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh suffered a massive 131-run defeat to Sri Lanka in Group A match of Asia Cup at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium Wednesday. Sri Lanka restricted Bangladesh to 226 for seven in 50 overs after racking up an impressive total of 357 for nine, riding on Kumar Sangakakar's fasted century and fifties from Sanath Jayasuriya and Chamara Kapugedera. Bangladesh has never looked to chase the formidable total and eventfully ended up with a respectable total. The defeat margin could have been worse had Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Abdur Razzak not added 49 runs for the unbroken eighth wicket stand. Mashrafee remained unbeaten on 34 off 55 balls while Razzak played a 23-ball 22 not out. Bangladesh fell in trouble to be reduced to 48 for three inside 13 overs after losing opener Nazimuddin (one), Mohammad Ashraful (eight) and Tamim Iqbal (28) before middle orders Roqibul Hasan (35) and Mushfiqur Rahim (44) and Alok Kapali (30) offered some resistance. Muttiah Muralitharan grabbed two wickets for 37. Earlier, Sri Lankan openers Jayasuriya and Sangakkara proved Bangladesh's decision to bowl first wrong, putting on 116 runs in 14.5 overs as Bangladesh pacers, all except Mashrafee, struggled to find their line and length. Shahadat Hossain conceded 27 runs in his first three overs while Dollar Mahmud gave away 28 in his first two with Jayasuriya playing shorts around the wicket. Bangladesh skipper Ashraful introduced spinners in the 11th over and got dividends in the 15th over as left-arm spinner Razzak uprooted explosive Jayasuriya with an arm delivery, but not before the left-handed opener fired 72 off 42 balls that featured 10 fours and three sixes. Sangakkara continued the assault where Jayasuriya left off, keeping the Bangladeshi bowlers at bay to reach his eight and fastest hundred and finally struck 101 off 91 balls that studded 16 boundaries. The 27-year-old opener survived a return catch by bowler Dollar on 70, but miscued a pull shot to be caught at mid-on by Tamim off Mahmudullah to leave the side at 211 for three in 27.5 overs. Razzak, the only Bangladesh bowler to trouble their opponents, removed Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, for a 10-ball six, and Chamara Kapugedera, who quickfired 74 off 67 clubbing five fours and two sixes. It seemed Sri Lanka would gain the 400-mark with the scoreboard reading 291 for four in 40 overs, but some tight bowling in the slog overs helped Bangladesh to restrict Sri Lanka to 357 for nine. Razzak grabbed three wickets for 55. Mashrafee returned two for 53 in his 10-over spell, while Shadadat took two wickets for 62 in his seven-over spell. Mahmudullah (1/62) and Alok Kapali (1/72) chipped in with one wicket each while Dollar remained wicketless conceding 49 runs in three overs. bdne
