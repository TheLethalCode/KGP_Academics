 VIENNA, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Losing your top scorer in a delicately balanced semi-final is a blow that would sap the morale of most teams but for Spain the setback turned into a virtue as they outclassed Russia 3-0 on a stormy night. Euro 2008 leading scorer David Villa, who has scored four goals including a hat-trick against the Russians in the group stage, limped off with a thigh injury 10 minutes from halftime at the Ernst Happel Stadium on Thursday. His departure forced Spain coach Luis Aragones to send on supersub Cesc Fabregas earlier than expected and it tipped the balance of the game decisively in Spain's favour.ADVERTISEMENT It also ensured the team took yet another step towards shaking off their long-standing reputation as underachievers by reaching their first major tournament final in 24 years. As he had done earlier in the tournament, the 21-year-old Arsenal player added new zest and momentum to the midfield. His natural desire, forged by five years of top flight football in England, to surge towards the opposition area forced Russia onto the back foot and helped create the spaces that gave his fellow midfielders the freedom to play. A liberated Xavi exchanged a neat one-two with the livewire Andres Iniesta and broke the deadlock with a classy finish to make it 1-0 to Spain five minutes into the second half. Fabregas then set up substitute Daniel Guiza for the second with a sublime chip over the Russia back four and completed his masterclass with a slide rule pass to David Silva for the third, eight minutes from time. SPAIN FOCUSED Fabregas, who notched the decisive penalty in the shootout victory over Italy in the quarter-final, was typically understated in his assessment of the match. "The game was there to be enjoyed just like kids do when they play in the park," he said. "When things go like this everything is easy. We all felt very comfortable out there. I've always felt an important part of this team." Fabregas added that Spain were determined not to rest on their laurels and would maintain a down-to-earth, focused attitude for Sunday's final against Germany. "There are still 90 or even 120 minutes to go and that is a long time," he said. "But we are motivated and hope that on Sunday the celebrations will be even bigger than today." Xavi echoed his sentiments. "We played a great game and we are really happy. This team keeps making history and now we are going to go for the final. It hasn't been easy but this team is ready for everything. "We aren't favourites. Spain haven't won anything for a long time and Germany are always up there fighting to win the big events, but this group of players deserves something." Spain will almost certainly have to do without Villa for Sunday's final but with Fabregas in the mix few would bet against them winning a second European Championship 44 years o
