 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Former home minister Mohammad Nasim is still not out of danger, a LabAid Specialised Hospital official said Saturday. "Although his brain has stopped haemorrhaging, it can resume anytime," Dr AKM Mahbubul Hoque, head of medical services of LabAid, told reporters. Doctors had Nasim's brain CT-scanned Friday and found nothing abnormal, he said. "There is no active bleeding point in his brain, but bleeding may restart any moment." An eight-member medical board was scheduled to sit Saturday to analyse Nasim's physical condition. Hoque said a further decision on the treatment of the former minister would be decided on the recommendations of the medical board. On how many patients like Nasim had recovered after treatment at LabAid, Hoque said: "Some patients recovered. The number is not high though. Even if some patients become well, some abnormalities remain." Asked why the medical test reports on Nasim were not given to his family he said: "We received the patient from jail authorities. If the jail authorities permit, we can give the reports to his family." bdnews
