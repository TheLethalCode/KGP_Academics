 RIYADH Wed Jun 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has detained 520 suspects for "involvement in terrorism", state television said on Wednesday. "These are all new detainees," an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The kingdom, which has faced a campaign of violence by al Qaeda-linked militants since 2003, arrested hundreds of suspects in 2007. A report read out on Saudi television said the detainees included a cell in the Red Sea port city of Yanbu, close to oil export terminals and petrochemical plants, and another in the Eastern Province where the bulk of kingdom's oil sector is located. "Security forces managed to arrest one cell in the Eastern Province led by African residents ... they tried to work in the oil sector and it became clear they were spreading militant thought and collecting funds to send them abroad," it said. Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter and militants have tried to target its oil sector in the past, attacking foreign compounds in Yanbu in 2004 and an oil facility at Abqaiq in 2006
