 KYOTO, Japan, Fri Jun 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Group of Eight nations lambasted Zimbabwe as it began voting in a one-sided presidential run-off on Friday, and diplomats said there was a push for the UN Security Council to consider fresh sanctions on the African country next week. "We deplore the actions of the Zimbabwean authorities -- systematic violence, obstruction and intimidation -- which have made a free and fair presidential run-off election impossible," the rich countries' foreign ministers said in a statement after a two-day meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Defying world condemnation, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe pressed on with the run-off vote on Friday even though opposition contender Morgan Tsvangirai, accusing the authorities of violence and intimidation, had withdrawn. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that next week the UN Security Council would discuss tightening the West's array of sanctions on Zimbabwe, whose economy is already in a state of collapse. "This was linked with an announcement by the United States, who are currently presiding over the Security Council, that starting next week, this coming Monday, further sanctions will be discussed there," Steinmeier told reporters. The G8 said March's first round of voting -- in which Tsvangirai beat Mugabe but did not secure an outright majority -- must be respected, and it would not accept the legitimacy of any government that did not reflect the will of the people. Officials said the ministers' decision to release a separate statement on Zimbabwe underlined their determination to send a strong message to Harare. "There is no legitimacy for a government claiming election on the basis of today's events, because this was an election that was one-sided in every aspect," British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told a news conference. "One-sided in the brutality of the regime, one-sided in the publicity given to one side, one-sided in the electoral organisation." Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told reporters that he wanted discussions within the European Union on withdrawing national ambassadors from Zimbabwe. NORTH KOREA: VERIFY FIRST Zimbabwe dominated the second day of the meeting in Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, just as North Korea's declaration of its nuclear activities had overshadowed its opening on Thursday. The ministers agreed that verifying North Korea's account was crucial, and rallied behind Japan over the unresolved question of its citizens abducted by Pyongyang agents. Pyongyang's statement prompted a wary U.S. President George W. Bush to ease some sanctions on a state he once branded as part of an "axis of evil". The mood was just as cautious in Kyoto, where Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said "it is not a game of trusting North Korea, but a game of verification". US officials say the secretive state's declaration, which came six months after a December deadline agreed in six-country talks, falls short of answering all concerns about its ambitions and its past nuclear proliferation activities. The United States said on Thursday it would take North Korea off its terrorism blacklist and ease some sanctions. Japan, a close US security ally, had previously expressed concern about delisting the communist state before resolving the issue of Japanese citizens decades ago to help train spies. In a nod to Japan's concern, the G8 ministers urged Pyongyang to move quickly to resolve the abduction issue. The ministers also discussed Iran's determination to pursue a nuclear programme in the face of UN resolutions to halt it. Washington and its allies suspect Iran wants to make nuclear arms but Tehran denies this. This month the West handed Iran an offer of trade and other benefits designed to persuade it to curb its nuclear work and end a row that has helped push oil prices to record highs. "We call on Iran to respond to the updated incentives package in a constructive manner," the ministers said in a statement. They also called on Tehran to act in "a more responsible and constructive manner in the region", singling out the Middle East peace process and the need for stability in Iraq and Afghanistan
