<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany is preparing to grind to a halt on Wednesday evening as German and Turkish workers across the country down tools to watch the Euro 2008 semi-final between their two nations being played in Switzerland. Manufacturers ranging from carmakers Daimler and BMW to Europe's biggest engineering group, Siemens, are making special provisions to allow staff to watch the game (1845 GMT). The match is eagerly anticipated in Germany, where about 2.7 million people of Turkish origin also livemore than in any other country in western Europe. Flags of both nations are flying side by side from many cars and buildings, and footballers and politicians have appealed for the two communities to party together without violence. BMW said it would stop production and end the late shift earlier than usual in all its German factories, including its main plant in Munich, where about 1,700 of the 9,000 staff hold a Turkish passport. Up to 1,000 vehicles would not be built due to the early stoppage, a spokesman said, although he added that flexible working practices would allow this to be made up easily. Audi also said it would end the late shift earlier and start the night shift later, meaning its 45,000 factory staff could enjoy the game, which will be played in Basel. Siemens employees, however, will have to make use of their flexible working hours and inform superiors ahead of time, and theoretically production will not stop, although those employees who have opted to work have TVs in the break rooms. Those working for car-parts maker Continental are less fortunate. "Production will go on," said a spokeswoman, adding that workers at Conti's Regensburg plant could follow the semi-final on the radio. At another plant in Stoecken, Conti has installed a large screen in the canteen and will hand out free sausages and alcohol-free beerbut only for those not on shift. German engineering association VDMA was unable immediately to estimate how much the standstill might cost. The winners of Wednesday's match will face Spain or Russia, who meet on Thursday, in the June 29 final in Vienna
