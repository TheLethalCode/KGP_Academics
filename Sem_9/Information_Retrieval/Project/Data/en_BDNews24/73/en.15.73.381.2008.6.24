 TEL AVIV, Tue Jun 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli soldier on the perimeter of a farewell airport ceremony for French President Nicolas Sarkozy apparently shot himself on Tuesday in a incident that did not endanger the visiting leader, Israel Radio said. Television footage showed bodyguards hustling Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy into their airplane at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport while other security men surrounded Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and moved him quickly toward his car. The plane departed without further incident. Israel Radio said the soldier who was shot was stationed 100 meters to 200 meters (yards) away from the plane. Two women soldiers who witnessed the shooting fainted and were treated by medics. Israel's volunteer medical service Zaka said the soldier apparently committed suicide
