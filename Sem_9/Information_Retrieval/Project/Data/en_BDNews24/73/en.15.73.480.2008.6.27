 KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are looking forward to renewing a keen rivalry with Japan in the fourth and final round of qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup after being drawn together in Asian Group A on Friday. South Korea must once again negotiate potential political problems as they face communist neighbours North Korea in Group B having met them twice in the previous round of qualifiers for the finals in South Africa. The South Koreans, World Cup semi-finalists as co-hosts in 2002, also take on Iran, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, while Group A also features Bahrain, Uzbekistan and Qatar following the draw ceremony in Kuala Lumpur. Former Oceania representatives Australia have made it to the final stages of the regional qualifiers in their first campaign as an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) member. They play Japan in their final qualifier at home on June 10, 2009 with Australian federation (FFA) official John Boultbee saying they are looking forward to a fierce contest. "It's a wonderful competition for us. The last game at home to Japan will be a blockbuster," Boultbee told journalists. "We get excellent competition from these teams and benefit greatly, but it won't be easy." Australia open their fourth-round matches away to Uzbekistan on Sept. 10. ANY VENUE In the previous round, South Korea were forced to play the away game against North Korea in Shanghai, China because of a political standoff in March, while the return match this week was played in Seoul. Both matches finished 0-0 as South Korea topped their group ahead of the North on goal difference. Chun Han-jin, South Korea's head of administration, said the team would be willing to play at any venue decided by their North rivals. "It's not a problem for us," Chun told Reuters. "Wherever they want us to play, we will be there. But it is their decision, it is not something we can control. "As for us, we will invite them to play in Seoul. We played them in the last round and it was a friendly and courteous atmosphere." South Korea are in the toughest group with Iran and Saudi Arabia, who both reached the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, expected to offer strong opposition. However, Iranian coach Ali Daei said he feared North Korea more than any other nation in Group B. "I would say North Korea are the most difficult team in the group," Daei told Reuters. "I have been there twice as a player, and there were no problemsBut football-wise, they are a very strong team." The top two teams in each group qualify automatically for the finals. The third-placed teams face each other in a playoff with the winners going on to meet the best team from Oceania for a place in South Afric
