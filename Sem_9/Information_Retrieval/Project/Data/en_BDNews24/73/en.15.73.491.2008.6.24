 BAGHDAD, Tue Jun 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US military court has sentenced a Canadian-Iraqi translator to five months in jail over a stabbing in Iraq, the US military said. Alaa Mohammad Ali, who holds Iraqi and Canadian citizenship, was the first civilian contractor working for US forces in Iraq to face trial under military law. He was charged under an amendment passed by the US Congress in 2006 which authorizes military trials for contractors accompanying US troops. Ali has been in detention since February after a fight with another interpreter at a military base in western Iraq. At a court-martial on Sunday at a US military base in Baghdad, he pleaded guilty to wrongful use of a soldier's knife, obstruction of justice and making a false statement to military investigators, the military said in a statement. He was originally charged with aggravated assault for allegedly stabbing the other contractor. That charge was dropped when he pleaded guilty to the other charges. The US military said Ali had been given the same rights as a US service member facing military court. The legal status of contractors in Iraq has been the subject of much controversy, especially since September when contractors from the US firm Blackwater were accused of wrongly killing 17 people in a shooting in Baghdad. Blackwater has said its guards acted lawfully in response to a threat. Private security contractors working for the US military and government have immunity from Iraqi law, although that is expected to be lifted under a new security pact being negotiated between Washington and Baghdad
