 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday adjourned charge framing against former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her son Arafat Rahman Coco, and others in the Gatco graft case, to June 30. Judge Shahed Nuruddin, of the Special Judge's Court-3 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban complex, set the new date after rejecting a request by the defence to stay the case proceedings. Khaleda's lawyers, advocate Abdur Razzak Khan and barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan, informed the judge of a Supreme Court order that asked the High Court to resolve within one month a writ petition filed by Khaleda Zia to stay the case proceedings. The court, however, replied that the apex court did not give any specific order to stay the case proceedings. State counsel Mosharraf Hossain Kajal asked the court to continue with proceedings. Judge Shahed Nuruddin rejected the defence plea requesting a temporary stay on the case proceedings due to a vacation in the High Court, and set June 30 as the next hearing date. The BNP chairperson was earlier taken to court at around 10.30 am from the nearby special jail. Coco was taken by ambulance from his prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Other accused in the case, former ministers Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar, Motiur Rahman Nizami and others, were also produced in court. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC pressed charges on May 13 this year against some 25 people. The name of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, one of the original accused, was dropped from the chargesheet after his death. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. The case was initially set for trial under metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque, but the case proceedings were later shifted to the special court on security grounds. bdnews
