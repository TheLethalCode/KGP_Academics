Israel closed the crossings on Wednesday in what it said was a response to rockets fired by Islamic Jihad militants.

"Securing the continuation of the Palestinian factions' commitment to the deal hinges on the Occupation's lifting of the siege and the opening of all the crossings in the first 10 days," he said, referring to Israel.
