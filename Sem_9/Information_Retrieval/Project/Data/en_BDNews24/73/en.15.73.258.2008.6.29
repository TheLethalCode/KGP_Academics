<TITLE> Loew leads Germans with new spirit of adventure </TITLE>

 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Joachim Loew has stepped out of Juergen Klinsmann's shadow at Euro 2008, while showing a daring streak in his character to match the team's adventurous style. Germany have made it to Sunday's final against Spain after Loew tore up his carefully conceived plan after just three games, switching his formation from the tried and trusted 4-4-2 to a more flexible 4-5-1. Loew's Plan B finally got the best out of captain Michael Ballack in the quarter-final against Portugal. A similar level of performance by Germany on Sunday would give them a great chance of a fourth European Championship title although they will be praying Ballack shakes off a calf injury that prevented him training on Friday and Saturday. If they do manage to lift the trophy at the Ernst Happel stadium it would be a personal triumph for Loew, a softly spoken coach who was a surprise choice when Klinsmann plucked him from obscurity to make him his right-hand-man in 2004. He had enjoyed one good spell in charge of VfB Stuttgart, winning the German Cup and reaching the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, but he was hardly a household name. The double-act proved successful. Loew took care of training while Klinsmann did the inspirational speeches, and he was the only candidate to take over after the head coach decided to call it quits following a third-placed finish at the 2006 World Cup. BIG QUESTION The big question was how he would measure up not so much on tactics and team selection but in motivation and leadership. Germans need not have worried. Under Loew, the team qualified for Euro 2008 easily and if they beat Spain in Sunday's final he can celebrate a major tournament success at his first attempt. "I think we've been very consistent over the past two years," Loew said at a news conference this week. "Now it's about keeping the players grounded." Keeping a sense of perspective is Loew's speciality. He never rants or raves in public, and it was a huge surprise when he was sent off after a run-in with the fourth official in the group game against Austria. The subsequent suspension meant he watched his big triumph of the tournament from high in the stands. Loew surprised Portugal by choosing a new formation that stifled their attack and proved devastating when Germany hit them on the break and at set-pieces. The same system looked less effective against Turkey in the semi-finals but it was just enough to get them through. If Ballack fails to recover in time to take his place at the heart of the midfield, Loew may have to improvise yet again as he chases a place among Germany's coaching greats
