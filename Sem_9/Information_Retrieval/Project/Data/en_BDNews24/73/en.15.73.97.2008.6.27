 HARARE Fri Jun 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's one-candidate election drew a low early turnout on Friday after President Robert Mugabe went ahead with the vote despite widespread international condemnation. Mugabe, in power for 28 years, stood alone after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew six days ago because of state-backed violence and intimidation. Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change, who say the vote is a farce, urged people to abstain but said they should vote if their lives were in danger. "Whatever might happen, the results...will not be recognized by the world. No matter what you are forced to do, we know what is in your heart. Don't risk your life. The people's victory may be delayed but it won't be denied," he said in a statement. The G8 group of rich nations lambasted Zimbabwe for going ahead with the vote and the United States said the UN Security Council may consider fresh sanctions on Zimbabwe next week. Mugabe voted with his wife at Highfield Township, on the outskirts of Harare. Asked how he felt, he told journalists: "Very fit, optimistic, upbeat," before being driven away. Voting began shortly after 1 a.m. EDT and turnout was thin at many polling stations in the capital Harare, unlike parliamentary and presidential elections in March when people queued from the early hours. Polling was due to end at 1 p.m. EDT. "There is no doubt turnout will be very low," said Marwick Khumalo, head of monitors from the Pan African Parliament. Tsvangirai won the March 29 poll but fell short of the majority needed for outright victory. The MDC says Mugabe's ZANU-PF militants will force people to vote on Friday, especially in rural areas where the veteran leader lost support during the first round. Voters have their little finger dyed with purple ink. In the affluent Greendale suburb of Harare there were scores of people queuing for bread at a shopping centre but only 10 at a polling station nearby. "I need to get food first and then maybe I can go and vote...I heard there could be trouble for those who don't," said Tito Kudya, an unemployed man. ECONOMIC COLLAPSE Mugabe, 84, has presided over Zimbabwe's economic collapse with hyper-inflation, 80 percent unemployment, food and fuel shortages. A loaf of bread now costs 6 billion Zimbabwe dollars, or 150 times more than at the time of the first round of elections. A middle-aged man waiting for a bus said it was dangerous to talk about politics. "Your tongue can cost you your teeth," he told Reuters, adding that he would vote. "I hope that will mean the trouble that we have been seeing also goes away," he said. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said the vote was going well. "Everything is well on course and people are voting peacefully," Deputy Chief Elections officer Utoile Silaigwana told state radio. A newspaper vendor in Harare city centre told Reuters: "I am not voting in this election. We voted for change last time and nothing changed. This time, we know the outcome, so why bother?" The vote has been widely condemned both inside and outside Africa. African Union foreign ministers were discussing Zimbabwe ahead of a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "I don't think we are going to accept the result but we are still discussing," one minister said, asking not to be identified. A security committee of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed, saying Mugabe's re-election could lack legitimacy. But Mugabe, who thrives in defiance, remained unmoved and said he would attend the AU summit to confront his opponents. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after a Group of Eight nations (G8) meeting in Japan that Washington would raise the issue of further sanctions against Zimbabwe at the U.N. Security Council. "We deplore the actions of the Zimbabwean authorities -- systematic violence, obstruction and intimidation -- which have made a free and fair presidential run-off election impossible," the G8 rich countries' foreign ministers said in a statement. Analysts said Mugabe was pressing ahead with the election to try to cement his grip on power and strengthen his hand if he was forced to negotiate with Tsvangirai. Mugabe says he is willing to sit down with the MDC but will not bow to outside pressure. Observers from Western countries critical of Mugabe have been banned, as have hundreds of foreign journalists wanting to cover the election. A local observers grouping said its members had faced intimidation and would not observe the vote. Zimbabwe's electoral authorities deployed thousands of polling officers across the country and distributed ballot boxes and papers to more than 8,000 polling stations. Police set up several roadblocks around the capital Harare and a spokesman said all leave for officers had been cancelled. The MDC says nearly 90 of its supporters have died in political violence which it blamed on ZANU-PF supporters. Mugabe says the opposition has been responsible for the violence. Since the March election, Mugabe has rallied his shock troops, veterans of the 1970s independence war and youth militia, in a violent campaign that critics say has made a free and fair election impossible
