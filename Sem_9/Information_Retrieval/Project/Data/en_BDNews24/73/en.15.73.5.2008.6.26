 BASEL, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philipp Lahm scored a 90th minute winner to give Germany a thrilling 3-2 victory over Turkey on Wednesday and a place in the Euro 2008 final. A header from Germany's Miroslav Klose 11 minutes from time looked have sealed a 2-1 victory, only for Semih Senturk to level for Turkey in the 86th minute in what looked like another escape act by Fatih Terim's men.

Turkey deserved their lead having already come close when Kazim rattled the woodwork with a shot and impressive playmaker Hamit Altintop was denied following a Lahm mistake.
