 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)The family of detained Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim and fellow party leaders have voiced concern over his treatment, saying he should be sent abroad to best aid his recovery, despite a LabAid spokeman's statement Friday that his condition was stable. Nasim, who was hospitalised after suffering a stroke, is clinically stable, said chief of medical services at LabAid Specialised Hospital. "Mohammad Nasim has regained complete consciousness. He can talk and is eating normal food," Dr AKM Mahbubul Haque told bdnews24.com. "But the condition of such patients may deteriorate any time," he added. Asked about the brain haemorrhage that caused Nasim's stroke, the LabAid doctor said there had been no new bleeding but further haemorrhage may occur any time. "We have seen such cases before." Three doctors examined the AL leader at the hospital's Intensive Care Unit on Friday, including neurosurgeon MH Shahriar Sabet who heads the medical board formed for Nasim's treatment, Haque said. He told bdnews24.com that doctors were treating the left side of Nasim's body that had become paralysed following the stroke. The AL leader was also taken to Square Hospital for a routine CT scan late Friday evening. "He was taken to Square at around 6.45pm, and returned to LabAid an hour later," Haque said. Nasim's younger brother Md Rezaul Karim said the family wanted the best possible treatment for Nasim overseas, for a full and speedy recovery. He hoped the government would consider the family's application, submitted Wednesday, seeking permission to take him abroad for treatment. AL acting president Zillur Rahman, after a meeting of the party's working committee Friday evening, told reporters that Nasim's condition was discussed at the meeting and it was felt he should be sent abroad for better treatment. Nasim, convicted in a graft case, was admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University on Tuesday after suffering a stroke at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur. He was later transferred to LabAid Specialised Hospital. bdnew
