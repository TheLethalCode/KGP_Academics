 VIENNA, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 finally paused for breath on Monday after 16 days of non-stop action where 28 games have produced an unlikely lineup for this week's semi-finals. Italy were the latest to head home, following Netherlands, Croatia and Portugal, all of whom topped their groups, as quarter-final losers. The only Italian with anything to celebrate on Monday after his country's penalty shoot-out defeat by Spain the night before was Roberto Rosetti, who was named as the referee of Sunday's final in Vienna. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said he had no intention of resigning and claimed the world champions had played well in the tournament, where their only victory came against a France side who were reduced to 10 men after 24 minutes. "I don't have a reason," he said when asked if he would quit. "We only lost a game on penalties." One man who has decided to call it a day is Austria's Josef Hickersberger, who announced he is resigning in the wake of the co-hosts' failure to get past the group stage. "I am empty, I am tired," said the 60-year-old. "The chapter is closed, the mission accomplished." His decision may have been influenced by a touchline ban he and Germany coach Joachim Loew received after their group game. "They treat us like dancing bears," he said. "I don't want to be a dancing bear any more." It was the other way round for Spain coach Luis Aragones, who dismissed suggestions he might stay on if his side won the tournament. Aragones, who turns 70 next month, said he would stick to his plan to stand down after four years in charge. "We have created a great group with a great atmosphere but it is over and that is it," he said. The Spanish media were delighted with their side's first appearance in a semi-final at a major tournament for 24 years, particularly as it ended a run of three quarter-final shootout defeats. HISTORICAL BURDENS "Possibly this triumph will help rid those historical burdens that have sown a lack of confidence in everyone," said sports paper Marca. However, Cesc Fabregas, who scored the decisive penalty, warned against complacency going into Thursday's semi-final with Russia, who Spain beat 4-1 in their first group game. "If we think Russia will be the same as the opening match we will be very mistaken," he said of the Vienna rematch. Russia's transformation has been inspired by Andrei Arshavin, who was suspended for the first two games but starred in the next two. Andy Roxburgh, head of UEFA's technical delegation, praised the playmaker on Monday. "His introduction has been like a sparkle of magic," he said. "He almost seems to have ignited them." Germany midfielder Torsten Frings has recovered from a fractured rib to give coach Joachim Loew a full squad to choose from for Wednesday's semi-final against Turkey in Basel. Conversely, Fatih Terim is struggling to fill his bench after losing eight players to suspension and injuries. Hopes that first-choice goalkeeper Volkan Demirel might be available were dashed on Monday when his appeal against a two-match ban failed. He must sit the game out after missing the quarter-final, when his replacement Rustu Recber was the hero of their penalty shoot-out victory over Croatia
