<TITLE> MasterCard settles lawsuit with American Express </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - MasterCard Inc, the world's second-largest credit-card network, said on Wednesday it will pay American Express Co up to $1.8 billion to settle a lawsuit that said MasterCard and Visa blocked banks from issuing cards from their rival. American Express said that so far in June, credit conditions have weakened more than it expected, and the settlement will generate funds as the weakening economy cuts into its main business. MasterCard said it will take a $1 billion charge in the second quarter for the settlement. The settlement stems from a 2004 suit American Express filed against MasterCard, Visa and eight banks that claimed the card associations' "anti-competitive practices" prevented 20,000 U.S. banks from issuing its credit-cards. With the MasterCard settlement and a similar deal with Visa and other parties late last year, American Express will be receiving as much as $4 billion through 2011. MasterCard agreed to make 12 quarterly payments of $150 million each to American Express, beginning in the third quarter, contingent on American Express' U.S. network business meeting performance hurdles. In November, Visa settled with American Express for about $2.1 billion, in a deal that combined with payments from other parties could net American Express up to $2.25 billion. MasterCard said that after taxes, and accounting for the fact that settlement payments will be made over time, the value of the deal is estimated to be about $1 billion.
