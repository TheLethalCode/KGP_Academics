 Sibuyan Island, Philippines, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US navy divers will join the grim search for bodies in a sunken ferry in the Philippines on Wednesday with over 700 people still missing. Hundreds of passengers were feared trapped inside the Princess of the Stars when it ran aground and capsized in waves as big as houses off the central island of Sibuyan during a typhoon on Saturday. Philippine divers retrieved three bloated corpses, including one believed to be a crew member still clutching his radio, on Tuesday. Coast guard officials said operations were now underway to retrieve bodies from inside a dining hall, where around 15 people, still wearing life vests, were floating head up. "They are optimistic they will be able to penetrate the others spaces today," Lieutenant Commander Armand Balilo, coast guard spokesman, said. Officials do not expect to find any survivors. Plans to bore a hole into the side of the seven-storey vessel have been abandoned for fear of disturbing around 100,000 litres of bunker fuel still on board. Around 10 divers from U.S. military ship, the USNS Stockham, will join the operation after receiving orientation. In Washington, President George W. Bush said the United States would send an aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, to aid in the relief effort following Typhoon Fengshen, which devastated islands in the centre of the archipelago. Bush made the pledge after a state visit from Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in the White House. Fengshen, which struck south China on Wednesday as a tropical storm, has killed at least 213 people, largely through drowning in a torrent of floodwaters and high winds in south and central Philippines. The sixth typhoon to hit the archipelago caused nearly 1 billion pesos ($22.4 million) worth of damage to homes, bridges and roads and forced over 200,000 people to evacuate. SHIPPING TRAGEDIES Off Sibuyan island, Princess of the Stars was resting upside down with the tip of its bow above the water and its stern resting on the bottom of the sea, easily visible from shore. So far, 48 people have been found alive out of 865 passengers and crew on board and 70 bodies have been counted, the coast guard said. Decomposing corpses keep washing up in surrounding areas, including 22 on one island, forcing ill-equipped communities to quickly bury them. The sinking of Princess of the Stars may be the Philippines' worst maritime disaster since 1987 when the Dona Paz ferry collided with an oil tanker killing more than 4,000 people. Sulpicio Lines, which owns Princess of the Stars, also owned the Dona Paz. Sulpicio Lines has agreed to bring recovered bodies to the central city of Cebu, where the ship was meant to dock and distraught relatives were waiting. Late on Tuesday, nine survivors, who drifted on a rubber boat for nearly 24 hours, had a tearful reunion with relatives at the airport in Cebu. "It's a miracle," said Besminda Blanco, tightly embracing her son Wresley. "We'll be offering thanksgiving masses for my son's new life. Shipping tragedies are common in the Philippines, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands where safety rules are poorly implemented and substandard vessels ply dangerous waters. Families are irate at Sulpicio for proceeding with a sailing when Typhoon Fengsen, with gusts of up to 195 kph, had already hit the archipelago on Friday. The government has ordered a review of maritime regulations and suspended Sulpicio's passenger ferry operations. bd
