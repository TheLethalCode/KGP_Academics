Fenerbahce announced on Wednesday that Aragones had agreed a provisional two-year contract to coach the club following a flurry of media speculation about the coach's future. Aragones has made it clear that he would be stepping down as Spain coach after the tournament, but there was increasing speculation among the Spanish media that the Spanish Football Federation might offer him a contract extension given his success at the tournament.

"The matter has all been talked about and sorted out before.
