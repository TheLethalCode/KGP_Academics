<TITLE> Tigers get off to a brisk start in Asia Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Lahore, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  A polished century from skipper Mohammad Ashraful guided Bangladesh to a fine start in the Asia Cup with a 96-run win over ICC associate member United Arab Emirates in Group A opener at Gaddafi Stadium Tuesday. Bangladesh bundled UAE out for 204 with 26 balls to spare after racking up an impressive 300 for eight in 50 overs riding on Mohammad Ashraful's second ODI hundred. It was apparently an uphill task for the UAE's amateur cricketers and they never seemed to chase the total as they were all but hapless against trio Bangladesh spinners Abdur Razzak, Mahmudullah and Alok Kapai, who together captured seven wickets giving away 85 runs in 27.4 overs. The UAE were reduced to 70 for four inside 16 overs and never recovered the damage before Khurram Khan and Arshad Ali drew attention to play two fine knocks. Khurram struck 78 off 81 balls that studded eight fours while opener Arshad played a 79-ball 41 smashing five fours. Khurram became Razzak's third victim to award left-arm spinner Razzak to 100-ODI scalp. Razzak, who conceded 20 runs in his 10-over spell against UAE, is the third Bangladesh's bowler to reach the 100-wicket milestone after left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique and pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Alok Kaplai and Mahmudullah grabbed two wickets each for 27 and 38 respectively while pacers Mashrafee, Shahadat Hossain and Dollar Mahmud chipped in with one wicket each. Earlier, the Tigers started cautiously against UAE, but soon built up momentum, riding on a new third-wicket record of 141 runs laid by Ashraful and Roqibul Hasan. Ashraful struck his second ODI century to score 109 off 126 balls, which featured eight fours. Meanwhile, Roqibul slammed his third ODI fifty to quick-fire 83 off 63 balls, with the help of nine boundaries. Bangladesh lost the last six wickets for 52 runs, but some quick-fire efforts from tail-enders Dollar (20 off nine balls) and Mushfiqur Rahim (16 off 11 balls) helped Bangladesh reach the triple figure mark, just one run short of Bangladesh's highest total of 301/7 against Kenya in 2006. Bangladesh had a shaky start, losing opener Nazimuddin for 2, after opting to bat first on the batting friendly wicket, however, Ashraful and Tamim went on to play cautiously, adding 85 runs for the second wicket before the latter was run out by Amjad Ali. Roqibul then joined Ahsraful to accelerate the run rate, adding 141 runs for the third wicket, but the departure of Roqibul led to a mini-collapse in the middle order and soon Ashraful followed Roqibul to the pavilion after being run out. Pacer Zahid Shah was the pick of the attack, with three for 49, while spinner Khurram Khan grabbed two for 78. Hosts Pakistan also got off to a brisk start with a 155-run win over another ICC associate member Hong Kong in Group B affair at National Stadium, Karachi. bdnew
