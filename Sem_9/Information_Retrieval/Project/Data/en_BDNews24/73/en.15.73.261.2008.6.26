 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's ear examination has revealed a worse than expected prognosis, said her special assistant, now in Canada, Thursday. The hearing aid implanted in her right ear was removed after it became inoperative, Hasina's aide Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com by phone from Toronto. "She may need surgery for her ear and will have to remain under regular observation." Hasina reached Toronto Thursday to be welcomed by her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, Canada Awami League president Sarwar Hossain and general secretary Azizur Rahman Prince, among others. Mahmud, Hasina's chief security officer retired major general Tarek Ahmed Siddiqui and Awami League central sub-committee assistant secretary Abdus Sobhan Golap accompanied her from the US. The former prime minister had her ear examined by Dr Michael M Bibliowicz at the Orland Ear, Nose and Throat Associates clinic in Orlando of Florida, Mahmud told bdnews24.com. "The condition of her ear is worse than before, much worse than thought." The hearing aid in her right ear was completely out of order. "It has been taken out. The hearing aid in her left ear has been partially damaged. It has to be repaired." Mahmud said Hasina would stay in Canada for a week. bdnews
