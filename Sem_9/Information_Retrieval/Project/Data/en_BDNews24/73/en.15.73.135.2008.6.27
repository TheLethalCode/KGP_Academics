<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  Business leaders of Chittagong have said that local problems should be given priority over national issues at the regional dialogue set to begin from Chittagong Saturday. Problems in industry and businesses should top the agenda rather than national politics, said Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, president of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The dialogue will be held in two separate venues in Chittagong  Chandanaish and the Engineers' Institute. "People of Chittagong are reeling under a string of problems that deserve to be given top priority," Chowdhury said. Talking to bdnews24.com, other business leaders said that local development and agricultural reforms should be discussed in the dialogue. They urged the participants of the dialogue to raise their voices for Chittagong's further development. Saifuzzaman Chowdhury said that investment in Chittagong had turned stagnant in recent years. "Several appeals were made to the government to resolve the crises of gas, power and water, but to no avail." Three hundred people of different professions have been invited to each of the two venues. Chittagong deputy commissioner Md Ashraf Shamim told bdnews24.com that all preparations were taken for the dialogue. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff and communications adviser Ghulam Quadir will attend the dialogue. MA Salam, acting president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said he wanted the government to make its position clear about solving the existing problems of Chittagong at the dialogue. Salam said that industrialisation of Chittagong was under threat due to gas, power and water crises. It also affected the city dwellers, he said, and demanded clear government instructions to end the problems immediately. Mahbub Ali, president of Bangladesh Shippers Council, said that a consensus on local issues was more important than on national issues. "It's now time to address regional issues," he said. He said that there would have to be a commitment at the dialogue that political parties would not politicise port activities anymore. And the matter would have to be put on the next government's priority list of reforms. Chittagong Stock Exchange chief Nasir Uddin Chowdhury said that infrastructural development of Chittagong and other regional issues should be on the agenda of Saturday's talks with the government. Establishing a tourist zone comprising Cox's Bazar and the three hilly districts should be discussed in the dialogue, he added. He said that the success of regional dialogue would depend on local issues. "The regional dialogue will be successful if the local issues are prioritised," he said. SM Monirul Hasan, an associate professor of Chittagong University, said that the regional dialogue would give marginal people a chance to tell their stories. He also said that the dialogue would be successful if it put emphasis on issues relating to agriculture, land reform and the rural economy. bdnew
