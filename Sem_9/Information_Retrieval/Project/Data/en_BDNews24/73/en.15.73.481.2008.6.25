<TITLE> Aragones seeking new challenges at 69 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luis Aragones made it clear that he would be stepping down as Spain coach after Euro 2008 no matter what happened but the 69-year-old has certainly not lost his appetite for football. The news that he has signed a two-year contract with Turkish side Fenerbahce means that there will be no going back on his decision even though he has led the side to their first semi-final appearance at a major tournament in 24 years. Vastly experienced, volatile, fiercely patriotic and widely respected by the players, the former Atletico Madrid player is the undisputed grand old man of Spanish football. He has managed a host of leading Primera Liga sides, notched up a record 757 matches in the top flight and become one of the most successful coaches of the national team. Spain have won 37 of his 52 matches while he has been at the helm and lost just four. They head into their Euro 2008 semi-final against Russia unbeaten in 20 matches having won all their previous nine before the shootout win over Italy to reach the Euro 2008 last eight. He was appointed as Spain coach after the team's disappointing first-round exit at Euro 2004, his record and experience giving him all the right credentials to help Spain break their record of underachievement at major championships. Despite an impressive 22-match unbeaten record going into the last World Cup, the team were knocked out at the hands of France in the last 16 and appeared incapable of ending their record of choking on the big stage. His derogatory comments about France striker Thierry Henry ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Belgium in 2004 further undermined his reputation as did rumours of a fall-out with Spain captain Raul. TARNISHED IMAGE An unfulfilled promise to step down after the World Cup, further threats of resignation and morale-sapping Euro 2008 qualification defeats at the hands of Sweden and Northern Ireland further tarnished his image. His run-ins with the mediain particular over his decision to drop Raulprompted many of his previous supporters to press for his dismissal. But Aragones is a resilient character and, bolstered by a strong finish to qualifying and friendly victories over world champions Italy and World Cup finalists France, he steered the team confidently towards Euro 2008. Spain began the tournament with an emphatic 4-1 win over Russia and qualified for the quarter-finals with a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Sweden. The team then broke a 24-year quarter-final hoodoo by ousting world champions Italy in the quarter-finals and face Russia in the last four in Vienna on Thursday. Born in the working class Madrid suburb of Hortaleza, Aragones had an illustrious playing career as a powerful goalscoring forward at Atletico Madrid, then steered the club to victory in the Interncontinental Cup in 1975, the King's Cup in 1976 and the league title in 1977. His managerial CV includes five separate spells at Atletico as well as stints at other high-profile clubs such as Barcelona, Betis, Sevilla, Valencia and Real Mallorca. He first emerged as a possible candidate for the post of Spain coach back in 1991, but was passed over in favour of Vicente Miera and he turned the job down seven years later when he was offered it following the departure of Javier Clemente. After the team's disappointing first round exit at Euro 2004 he decided his time had finally come and was named as Inaki Saez's successor. He is the second coach at this tournament to have preparations interrupted for a high-profile announcement of a club appointment. The other was Portugal's Luiz Felipe Scolari who was named as the new manager of Premier League Chelsea on June 11. Eight days later they were beaten by Germany 3-2 in the quarter-final on June 19. Spain will be hoping there is no loss of focus from a team which has so far been single-minded in their approach to ending a 44-year drought of major tournament success
