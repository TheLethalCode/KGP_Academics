 Pabna, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Two more PBCP men were killed in an exchange of gunfire with Rapid Action Batallion members in Pabna early Monday, a RAB officer said. Rab said the two dead men, Mohammad Swapon (31) from Swargram and Jahurul Islam (30) from Baukola, Ataikula, belonged to the outlawed militant outfit Purbo Bangla Communist Party (ML-Janajuddho). Rab-12 officer Ft Lieut Ahmad Faisal told bdnews24.com that the exchange of gunfire occurred at around 1.30am at Swargram, in Ataikula, Pabna. "Acting on a tip-off, a Rab-12 contingent from Pabna camp went to Swargram at around 1am, and took up position behind the Dakheli Madrasa," Faisal said. When associates of the suspected militant Swapon started shooting the Rab team retaliated, he said. "After half an hour's exchange of fire, the suspects fled, and we found Swapon and Jahur, both hit by bullets," said the Rab officer. Rab said a single-barrelled shotgun, a .32 revolver and five rounds of ammunition were recovered from the site. The Rapid Action Batallion also said Swapon faces nine separate cases, including seven murder cases, filed against him in Ataikula, Santhia and Sujanagar police stations and Jahur faces 10 cases, including five murder cases. Swapon was allegedly the district commander, and Jahur second-in-command, of the banned militant party Purbo Bangla Communist Party (ML-Janajuddho) in Pabna. Three leaders of the banned party have been killed in recent days, in similar incidents of shootouts with Rab, including the notorious militant known as 'Dada Tapan', who headed PBCP (ML-Janajuddho) bdnews24.com/co
