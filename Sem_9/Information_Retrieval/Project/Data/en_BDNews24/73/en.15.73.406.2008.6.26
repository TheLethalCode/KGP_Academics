<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister and BNP chief Khaleda Zia said Thursday that her party would show "all cooperation" to the caretaker government if it worked towards holding parliamentary elections ahead of all other polls. "The government must act neutrally, treating everybody alike, and first create an environment which is conducive to holding the national elections," Khaleda said in special court following a hearing of the Niko graft case filed against her and others. Judge Khandakar Kamaluzzaman had earlier adjourned the day's charge framing proceedings until July 7. The eight accused in the case were produced in the Special Judge's Court-9 Thursday morning, the former prime minister being brought from the nearby special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex just before 10am. The caretaker government will end by recreating the turbulent era that gripped the country in the days prior to 1/11, by holding the local polls before the parliamentary elections, she said after the hearing. "Disregarding the view of almost all political parties, the government is determined to stage the local level polls before the national elections," she said, reiterating her demand for holding the parliamentary elections by the end of October. "We are not against the local government elections, but we want that those elections will be organised, conducted and managed by an elected government." The government is conspiring to hold a stage-managed local polls with its chosen 'pawns', she alleged. Justifying the call for holding the parliamentary polls by Oct 30, Khaleda said: "The state of emergency has to be lifted immediately and we want free and fair polls with all parties participating." She said, the government can easily hold the elections by October, if it really wants to. The people would like to see it happening too, she added, "including BNP, the 14-party alliance and other political partiesbig and small." Assuring the government of all cooperation, Khaleda said, "We'd like to see the government working towards holding the parliamentary elections first, in which case we'll go all out to cooperate with them." Worrying over the situation of her two detained and ailing sonsTarique and Coco, Khaleda said, "Both of them are very sick. I demand that they should be sent abroad for treatment as soon as possible." "I also would like to see Mr Nasim of Awami League be sent abroad for proper treatment." bdnews24
