 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The experience many of Spain's squad have of winning titles at youth level has helped the senior team break a record of underachievement and will stand the players in good stead for the Euro 2008 final with Germany. "From my point of view I think a lot of our success at this tournament is due to a generational change that has taken place," Spain captain Iker Casillas told a news conference on the eve of the final at the Ernst Happel stadium. "All of us have played at youth level and achieved big things, something the senior team hasn't managed," he said. "Other teams like Portugal and Italy are suffering from a generational change, but Spain has a young and yet experienced team and that has helped us a lot." Spain have won a host of major titles at youth level with players like Casillas, Xavi and Fernando Torres having been part of the triumphs, but Sunday's game against Germany is only the senior side's third appearance in a final at a major tournament. They beat the Soviet Union 2-1 to win the European Championship on home soil in 1964 and finished runners-up to France 20 years later. "Tomorrow we have the opportunity to end our poor record at big events," said Casillas. "We were close 24 years ago, but there are always two faces to any final. If we lose, everything we have gone through will be worth nothing. "So getting to the final and winning it is the most important thing." NO COMPARISON Casillas, who has won two Champions Leagues with Real Madrid, said there was no comparison between reaching the final of that competition with his club and getting to the showpiece match at the European Championship with Spain. "In my opinion, it is very different. Getting to the final of the Champions League is nothing like this. "Real are fortunate in that they are used to getting to finals, but this tournament is only every four years. There is a greater sense of responsibility and more nerves for this one and we have 46 million people behind us. The 27-year-old added that although Germany were more experienced at playing in finals, Spain's determination to claim their first trophy in 44 years could help them win through. "Germany are a tough side to face on these occasions in that they have reached so many finals," he said. "That could work in their favour. But we have enthusiasm and desire on our side. Centre-back Carles Puyol said coach Luis Aragones, who will step down after the tournament, bore much of the responsibility for the team's impressive performance at Euro 2008. "A lot of it is down to him. He has showed us the way and we are with him 100 percent. He had to suffer a lot of criticism before but that helped make the team stronger. We owe him a lot. We have one match left to do something for him.
