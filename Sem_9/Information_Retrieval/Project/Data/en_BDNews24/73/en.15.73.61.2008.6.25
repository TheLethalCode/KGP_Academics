 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  The family of detained Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim, who was hospitalised Tuesday after a stroke, have applied to the government to release him on bail to seek treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Nasim's son Tanvir Shakil Joy and lawyer Sheikh Baharul Islam submitted the application to home adviser MA Matin and home secretary Abdul Karim on Wednesday. Baharul Islam also submitted the application to the Chief Adviser's Office. "The home secretary has assured us that necessary arrangements will be taken," Joy said. The home adviser told reporters: "The government is concerned about the matter." "As the former minister has been sentenced in a graft case the matter of release is dependant on legal procedures." "If there is no legal barrier, the government will consider the matter humanely," the adviser said. The AL leader underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Wednesday morning. LabAid Specialised Hospital spokesperson Mesbah Azad told bdnews24.com that the MRI report showed the former minister's condition remained unchanged. "The positive sign is that his haemorrhaging has stopped," Azad said. Nasim was admitted to the LabAid hospital Tuesday, after having suffered a stroke due to a brain haemorrhage at Kashimpur jail. From jail, he was initially admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital where he underwent a CT scan. Mohammad Nasim, a former home, post and telecommunications minister and member of the Awami League central committee, was arrested on Feb 4 last year on charges of corruption. bdnews24.
