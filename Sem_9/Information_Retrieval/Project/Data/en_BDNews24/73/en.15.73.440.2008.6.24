 GAZA, Tue Jun 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Militants in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip fired several rockets into southern Israel on Tuesday, breaching a five-day-old ceasefire after Israeli troops killed two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. "This is a blatant violation of the calm, and we will weigh options," an aide quoted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as saying after the rockets struck. The Egyptian-brokered truce, which took effect last Thursday, calls on Hamas to prevent cross-border fire from the Gaza Strip, which it seized by force a year ago. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the rocket attack, calling it a "first response" to Israel's killing overnight of a local commander of the militant group and another Palestinian, who was affiliated to Hamas, in the West Bank city of Nablus. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, responded by urging "all Palestinian factions to abide by the calm agreement", adding: "Hamas is keen to maintain the deal." The ceasefire, under which Israel agreed to halt its own operations in the Gaza Strip and to ease its economic blockade of the impoverished enclave, does not apply to the West Bank. An Israeli police spokesman said at least three makeshift rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip and one hit a house in the border town of Sderot. No one was seriously hurt. The rockets landed in Israel only hours after Olmert thanked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in talks in Egypt for brokering the ceasefire, which came into effect on Thursday. DEADLY RAID The Nablus operation was the first fatal Israeli raid since the truce took hold in Gaza. Similar West Bank operations and Palestinian rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip led to the breakdown of previous truce deals. Islamic Jihad said Tarek Juma Abu Ghali, killed in Nablus, was one of its most senior commanders in the northern West Bank. Nablus Governor Jamal Muheisen called the raid in the city an "unjustified crime" but said he did not believe it would threaten the Gaza truce. Officials on both sides said from the start that they doubted the truce in the Gaza Strip would last. Earlier on Tuesday, the Israeli army confirmed Palestinians fired a mortar shell into Israel from Gaza overnight in the first reported violation by militants of the ceasefire. No one was hurt in that incident and there was no immediate claim of responsibility. In the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Mubarak assured Olmert the Gaza Strip's only border crossing to the outside world would remain closed until a deal was reached with Hamas to free an Israeli soldier, Israeli officials said. Under the Gaza truce, Israel agreed to ease gradually its economic blockade, but it demanded the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip stay shut until Gilad Shalit goes free. There was no immediate Egypt comment on the officials' remarks. Egypt has been trying to mediate Shalit's release since shortly after he was captured on the Gaza border in June 2006
