 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday filed charges against former foreign minister M Morshed Khan and wife Nasrin Khan for allegedly providing false information to the ACC and earning wealth beyond their known sources of income. The investigating officer appealed for arrest warrants to be issued against Khan and his wife, who remain on the run. On June 20 last year, the ACC sought a wealth statement of moveable and immoveable assets from the former minister of the BNP-led alliance government, his wife, and other family members. Khan submitted his wealth statement through his representative Anwar Jamil Siddiqui on July 10, 2007. In the statement, the accused showed assets worth Tk 17.41 crore. However, the ACC later claimed an investigation had proved the statement concealed information on wealth worth Tk 91.36 lakh. It is also alleged that the couple colluded with one another to amass property worth Tk 1.67 crore. Ten individuals have been shown as witnesses for the state in the chargesheet. ACC assistant director Md Talebur Rahman filed the chargesheet against the couple with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Meanwhile, the ACC received permission to interrogate detained former lawmaker Fazlul Haque Milon in jail regarding his wealth statement. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani Tuesday granted the ACC permission to interrogate Milon at the jail. In a separate case, the court ordered the seizure of a cheque-book issued by Agrani Bank's Amin Court Branch in the name of Khabarer Antorale. The move relates to allegations of bribery against Sigma Huda, the wife of former communications minister Nazmul Huda, who owns the newspaper. Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque gave the order Tuesday. The ACC official filed the case against the couple on June 18 last year. bdnew
