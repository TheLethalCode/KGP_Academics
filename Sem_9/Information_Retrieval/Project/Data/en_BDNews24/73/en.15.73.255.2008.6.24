<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia denied Tuesday that there was any division in her party, at the same time thanking BNP leaders and supporters for remaining united. "There is no discord in the party. All are united," she said in the presence of reporters after a hearing of the Gatco graft case. Khaleda thanked her party for maintaining unity during hard times. "Everything will work out in time," she said. The former prime minister voiced her opposition to the scheduled local body elections, saying: "All major parties want parliamentary elections ahead of any other polls." "The government does not have the constitutional right to hold local government polls." "They want to place their own people by holding these elections. This is not acceptable in any way," the BNP chief said. Khaleda expressed her solidarity with the decision of the four-party alliance to resist the local polls schedule: "The decision of BNP and the alliance is my decision." She voiced concern over the current situation of the country. " The government has destroyed the economy of the country. There is no employment. People are starving." She insisted again that the country was experiencing "a famine". "The government has failed to control the law and order situation," she added. To overcome these crises, she demanded that the government should immediately hand over power to an elected government. "There is no alternative to holding parliamentary elections." Only an elected government can turn the country round again, she said. She also accused the government of increasing corruption and bribery. The BNP chairperson was taken to the Special Judge's Court-3 on the Sangsad Bhaban complex at around 10.30 am, from the nearby special jail. Her son Arafat Rahman Coco was taken by ambulance from his prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Other accused in the case, former ministers Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar, Motiur Rahman Nizami and others, were also produced in court. Khaleda's lawyers, advocate Abdur Razzak Khan and barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan, informed the judge of a Supreme Court order that asked the High Court to resolve within one month a writ petition filed by Khaleda Zia to stay the case proceedings. The court, however, replied that the apex court did not give any specific order to stay the case proceedings. State counsel Mosharraf Hossain Kajal asked the court to continue with proceedings. Judge Shahed Nuruddin rejected the defence plea requesting a temporary stay on the case proceedings due to a vacation in the High Court, and set June 30 as the next hearing date. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC pressed charges on May 13 this year against some 25 people. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. The case was initially set for trial under metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque, but the case proceedings were later shifted to the special court on security grounds. bdnews24
