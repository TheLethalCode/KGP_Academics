 Karachi, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leg spinner Ajantha Mendis took career-best figures of five for 22 to help Sri Lanka cruise to a 142-run win over United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup one-day match in Lahore on Thursday. Mendis punished the inexperienced opponents as they lost their last six wickets for just 15 runs and were bowled out for 148, chasing a Sri Lankan total of 290 for nine.
