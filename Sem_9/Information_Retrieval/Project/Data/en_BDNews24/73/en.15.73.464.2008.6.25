<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Wed Jun 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US embassy in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, was closed on Wednesday after a "suspicious powder" was found in the premises, the embassy said. "The suspicious substance will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. Until the results are received and a determination is made that the substance does not pose health or safety risks, the embassy will be closed to the public," it said in an e-mailed statement. The heavily-guarded embassy has thrice been closed in the past after suspicious powder was detected but on each occasion it turned out to be a false alarm. A Sri Lankan police officer said no formal complaint had been received on Wednesday. The consular section will remain available to provide emergency services to American citizens during the closure, the embassy statement said. The United States supports a political solution to end Sri Lanka's 25 year civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people
