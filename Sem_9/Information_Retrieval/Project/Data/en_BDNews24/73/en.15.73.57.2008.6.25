 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday again shifted the charge framing proceedings in the Niko graft case filed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others to July 7. Hasina's High Court challenge against the case is set to be heard on the last day of June. The judge said trial proceedings would be adjourned in the meantime. The High Court on June 19 ordered the special trial court to submit the documents of the case as Hasina had petitioned to the higher court for cancellation of the case. Judge Amar Kumar Roy, of Special Judge's Court-2 set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises, adjourned the hearing on Wednesday saying he had received a copy of the High Court order. The petition hearing is set to be held on June 30. Under the circumstances, the judge said, the case proceedings would be resumed later in line with the HC order. Advocate Sahara Khatun was present in court on Hasina's behalf as the former prime minister has been exempted from personally appearing in court while she seeks medical treatment overseas. Former energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury and former state minister for power Rafiqul Islam, also accused in the case, were present in court Sunday. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year, and pressed charges against the Awami League president and nine others on May 7. Hasina stands accused of approving a deal with Niko Resources Ltd in 2001, during her term as prime minister, which cost the state Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses. Other charged in the case are former principal secretary of the prime minister's office SA Samad, former energy secretary M Akmal Hossain, former chairman of Petro Bangla Md Mosharraf Hossain, Niko Resources Bangladesh Ltd vice president Kashem Sharif, former secretary of external resources division AKM Mashiur Rahman and former director of Petro Bangla Syed Anwarul Haque. bdnews24
