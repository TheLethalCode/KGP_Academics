 LONDON, June 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England one-day captain Paul Collingwood faces an international ban of four one-day matches or two tests after his side failed to bowl their overs in the required time in Wednesday's one-day game against New Zealand. A statement from the International Cricket Council (ICC) said the punishment would be determined when Collingwood meets match referee Javagal Srinath on Thursday afternoon. The statement said Collingwood faced the ban because Wednesday's offence was the second within a year. Collingwood was fined 50 percent of his match fee when England fell short of the required over rate in a one-day international against India on Aug. 24 last year. An international ban would complete a miserable two days for Collingwood who admitted on Wednesday he had been wrong not to recall New Zealand batsman Grant Elliott who was run out after a collision with bowler Ryan Sidebottom. Although New Zealand won the game off the last ball, the Kiwi team were incensed and captain Daniel Vettori refused to shake Collingwood's hand after the match. Vettori, whose team take an unbeatable 2-1 lead into the fifth and final match at Lord's on Saturday, later accepted an apology from Collingwood at the post-match victory ceremony
