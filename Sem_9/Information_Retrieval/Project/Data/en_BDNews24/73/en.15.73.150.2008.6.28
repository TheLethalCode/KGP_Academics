<TITLE> Spain's super sub Fabregas ready to graduate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cesc Fabregas began Euro 2008 struggling to carve out a place for himself in Spain's over-crowded midfield but the 21-year-old is on course to end the tournament as his country's most decisive player. The debate before Euro 2008 focused on why the Arsenal favourite was unable to replicate his club form when playing for Spain. Typically, the astute former Barcelona youth teamer played down the controversy and put his finger on the reasons why he was not shining the way he had done at the London club. "You have to analyse the way we play for the national team," he said. "At Arsenal there is only one channel between the defence and attack and that is me, so I'm involved in practically all the attacks, but here there are more variations, more ways of attacking. "It's is up to me to adapt but after over two years with the national team I think I've done pretty well. Good players have to be able to adapt to any type of football." He was as good as his word. He was named among the substitutes for Spain's opening 4-1 win against Russia but came off the bench to set up his side's third goal and then weighed in with the fourth himself, his first for the national team. Against Italy in the quarter-finals, Luis Aragones gave him the responsibility of taking the often decisive fifth spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out even though he had not taken one in a match since he was 15. Fabregas responded by sending Gianluigi Buffon the wrong way with a perfectly hit shot to put Spain through to the semis for the first time in 24 years. In the semi-final rematch against Russia he changed the course of the match when he came on in place of the injured David Villa and gave Spain the edge with his driving play in midfield. GET FORWARD His presence gave Xavi more freedom to get forward and he set up two of his side's three goals with brilliant assists. Spain may be bemoaning the absence of their leading scorer for the final but Villa's injury could be a blessing in disguise as there is now space for Fabregas to start in midfield against Germany. Fabregas has been used to taking on major responsibilities from an early age. Spirited away from Barcelona by Arsene Wenger when he was just 16, he enjoyed fast-track promotion to the Arsenal first team. He became the club's youngest ever player and goalscorer in his first season and surprised many with a maturity and work ethic beyond his years. His performances after stepping into the shoes of Patrick Vieira drew critical acclaim from all quarters. "Okay, maybe I'm biased but I think we have here potentially the outstanding midfielder of his era," said former Republic of Ireland international Liam Brady, head of youth development at Arsenal. Fabregas become the youngest player in 70 years to represent Spain when he featured in a friendly before the last World Cup and the youngest Spaniard to appear in the competition when he played in the group match against Ukraine. While many other national sides might build their team around a player of his quality, Fabregas remained a relatively peripheral figure for Spain. That could all change after his performances at Euro 2008
