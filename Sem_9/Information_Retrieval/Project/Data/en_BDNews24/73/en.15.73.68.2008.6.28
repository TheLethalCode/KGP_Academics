<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Transparency International Bangladesh chairman Prof Muzaffer Ahmad Saturday urged nongovernmental organisations not to take financial assistance from foreign donors to become self-reliant. "In our country, NGOs run on foreign funds. Their projects pander to the wishes of donors. The NGOs have to become self-reliant," Ahmad told a convention on "Institutional Good Governance of NGOs" at the LGED auditorium in the city. "During the Language Movement, students had raised funds by saving up from their pocket money. They raised funds from different sources for different movements, but did not receive foreign assistance." The TIB chairman claimed that there would be no welfare with foreign money. "We have to have self-reliance and institutional transparency." Pointing to NGO representatives present at the convention, Ahmad said: "You don't stand against the eviction of indigenous people from their ancestral lands, encroachment of rivers and land grabbing. You don't stand against pollution through industrial waste." "Where is your contribution in the field of agriculture? You are speaking of eliminating poverty but you are doing nothing for the betterment of farmers. Rather you are making them poorer by giving loans on high interest." The NGOs have been used politically, Ahmad alleged. "As a result, the job of NGOs is being hampered. Religion-based NGOs are emerging. Money comes from abroad in the name of religious schools." On the operations of microcredit by NGOs, he said: "Many NGOs have disappeared into thin air after taking money meant for microcredit. Big corporate NGOs are involved with other businesses." To bring transparency to NGO activities, Ahmad advised making their budget public. He also advised reviving the roles of NGOs in safeguarding culture and heritage. Campaign for Good Governance (Supro) organised the convention. More than 300 representatives of NGOs from Dhaka and outside participated in the convention. bdnew
