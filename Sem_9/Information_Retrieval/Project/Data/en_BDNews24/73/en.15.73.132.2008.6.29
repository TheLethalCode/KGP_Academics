<TITLE> Vienna neutrals favouring Spain over Germany </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German fans far outnumbered their Spanish counterparts on Saturday as the first batch of supporters arrived in Vienna for Sunday's Euro 2008 final between the two teams. A few hundred German fans were chanting predictions of European glory in the Austrian capital's fanzone with barely a Spanish shirt in sight but it seemed Spain could expect plenty of match day back-up from locals and other supposed neutrals. "We'll be supporting Spain because we never support Germany," said Austrian student Claire Damm. "I also think Spain played better during the whole tournament." Fireman Franz Miedler, 65, said he too would be supporting the Spanish for sporting reasons. "It's just about the way they play. I think they deserve to win," he said above the noise of a German band belting out Elvis Presley hits. While many Austrians said they would be supporting Spain based purely on their style of play, several Germans in the fanzone suspected it had more to do with the history between their two countries. Austrians have a long-standing rivalry with their big northern neighbour based on past political grudges including most obviously their country's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. There have been plenty of sporting defeats along the way as well, and it was Germany who ended Austria's Euro 2008 hopes with a 1-0 win in the two teams' last group stage match. SAME REASONS "I believe it is not that they are for Spain so much as that they are against Germany," shrugged Michael Hecker, a German student studying in Austria. "It is based on the same reasons as ever, they have not forgiven the Germans. We don't want to discuss this subject any more but it looks like nobody is happy to see Germany winning." Fans from further afield were also favouring Spain with one group of four American tourists split 3-1 in favour of Luis Aragones' side. "I have to support the homeland," explained the one exception, 35-year-old Max von Zimmermann, an equestrian judge from Seattle with Germanic roots. "It's a great time for us to visit Europe because it's the only time when we Americans aren't hated," said his Californian friend Chris Wheeler, 34. "Everyone here is too busy hating the Germans!" There were some voices of support for Germany, though mostly for financial reasons. "I sell sporting paraphernalia and I still have four huge boxes of German items stored up which I have to sell, so that's why I'll be supporting the Germans," said retailer Heinz Durst. "Personally I don't mind who wins but the Germans are good consumers of beer so a win for them would definitely be better for business," said Nicole Malla, a Vienna local working at one of the official refreshment stands
