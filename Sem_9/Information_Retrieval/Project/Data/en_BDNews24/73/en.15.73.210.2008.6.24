 NEW YORK, Tue Jun 24, (bdnews2.com/Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co, the biggest US chemicals manufacturer, said on Tuesday it will boost its prices by as much as 25 percent, institute freight surcharges and cut output of some products because of soaring energy prices. The price hikes come after last month's across-the-board 20 percent increase by the Midland, Michigan-based company, which makes thousands of products ranging from plastic wraps to car parts and insecticides. "What we're doing is trying to protect our earnings," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris told broadcaster CNBC. Dow said it is also undertaking a series of cost reduction measures on staffing, facilities and spending at its automotive unit because of the decline in North American auto sales. The chemical maker's costs for oil and gas feedstocks and energy bills had jumped fourfold over the past five years to an estimated $32 billion this year. The price increases announced on May 28 were not enough to cover the additional energy prices increases, Liveris said. Oil prices have jumped have jumped 44 percent so far this year, including a $9 per barrel jump since Dow's last price hike, while natural gas prices have surged 75 percent. Liveris again called for the U.S. government to overcome political squabbling and past energy measures that will increase supplies. "We've got to get bipartisan energy policy ... this is too important a country to take aspects of energy policy off the table," he told CNBC. From August 1, Dow will implement a surcharge of $300 per shipment by truck and $600 per shipment by rail in North America for customers buying chemicals, hydrocarbons and plastics. Freight charges will be applied in other regions later this year. Dow also trimmed it production of the industrial chemical ethylene oxide by 25 percent and idled 30 percent of its North American acrylic acid output. The company will idle 50 percent of its European styrene production, and has cut European polystyrene production by 15 percent. Shares of Dow were up 1 percent at $38.05 in pre-market trade on the New York Stock Exchange
