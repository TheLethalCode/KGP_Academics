<TITLE> Spain's 2008 vintage more than matches predecessors </TITLE>

 VIENNA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There are two indelible images imprinted on the minds of Spain fans from their team's only previous appearances in the final of a major championship. The first is the grainy newsreel footage of Spain striker Marcelino stooping low to head past goalkeeper Lev Yashin to score the winner in the 2-1 triumph over the Soviet Union at the Bernabeu in the 1964 European Championship. The second is of Spain keeper Luis Arconada desperately scrambling across his own line after letting a Michel Platini free kick squirm under his body and into the net in the 2-0 defeat by France in the 1984 final. Both events left their mark on Spanish football, which is back on the big stage in Sunday's Euro 2008 final with Germany; the first assured the senior team of their only major title, the second embodies the subsequent failure to deliver more trophies. The 1964 side was built around Luis Suarez, the only Spaniard to win the European Footballer of the Year award and the player who had led Inter Milan to a 3-1 victory over Real Madrid in the European Cup only weeks before. ROBUST DEFENCE Apart from Suarez, the skilful Amancio and Real defender Ignacio Zoco, Spain had few other high-profile players, with much of the team's strength coming from its robust defence. "We were a good team but possibly not one of the best Spain has had," Suarez told www.uefa.com. "But we played well as a team. We were very compact and the players understood and complemented each other very well. "Other Spain teams I played in were much better than the one we had in 1964 yet we never managed to achieve anything." It took Spain another 20 years to reach the final again, although had it not been for a remarkable 12-1 win over Malta in the final qualifier they would have missed the tournament on goal difference. Luck was also on Spain's side at the finals. Antonio Maceda snatched an injury-time winner against West Germany to put them in the semi-finals where they edged out Denmark on penalties before facing France in the final. Spain held on until Arconada won a place in the goalkeeping chamber of horrors with his failure to hold on to Platini's free kick, although it would have been an injustice if they had beaten a supremely talented France side. MODEST OUTFIT The 1984 Spain team were a modest outfit, characterised by hard-working players driven by a fierce team spirit. Real Madrid's Santillana provided the punch up front with skilful Barcelona forward Francisco Carrasco on the wing. Julio Alberto added pace at fullback while the team also included the hard-working Victor Munoz and ferocious Jose Antonio Camacho. The 2008 vintage that faces Germany in Vienna on Sunday compares very favourably to both teams. Although he will miss the final through injury, David Villa is as good a finisher as any Spain striker and forms a lethal partnership with the athletic Fernando Torres up front. Few would argue that with the nimble, pint-sized quartet of Xavi, Cesc Fabregas, David Silva and Andres Iniesta to choose from the midfield is more talented that its predecessors. At the back Carles Puyol is a match for the likes of Camacho and company in terms of determination and commitment, while Iker Casillas is a class above any of his rivals in goal. The current squad appears to have the same spirit as the 1964 side but must win Sunday's final to be placed alongside them in the pantheon of Spanish sporting successes
