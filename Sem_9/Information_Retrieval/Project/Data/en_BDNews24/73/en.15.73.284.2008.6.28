 Karachi, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  Spilled catches cost Bangladesh dear as they went down to India by seven wickets in the Super Fours opener of the Asia Cup at the National Stadium in Karachi Saturday. Suresh Raina struck his second ODI hundred as India raced to 284 for three in 43.2 overs after Bangladesh racked up an impressive 283 for six riding on Alok Kapali's swashbuckling century. Raina put on 139 for the third wicket along with Gautam Gambhir and added another 89 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket with Yuvraj Singh, who played a 35-ball 36 not out, to steer India home. The left-handed Raina, dropped twice, hammered three sixes and 11 fours to make an unbeaten 116 facing 107 deliveries. Bangladesh had to pay a heavy price of dropping both Gautam Gambhir and Raina as they together kept the Bangladesh bowlers at bay and dumped Bangladesh's hope of taming India. Captain Mohammed Ashraful turned to Mashrafee Bin Mortaza in the 16th over to break the third-wicket partnership. Mashrafee, who conceded 28 runs in his first five-over spell, induced Gambhir to play a lofty shot at point when he was on 56, only for Farhad Reza to spill it. In his next over, Mashrafee saw Mahmudullah drop Raina on 16 at fine leg. Finally, Fahad had Gambhir caught by Mashrafee, but then Gambhir and Raina had taken India to 195 for three in 31.4 overs. Shahadat Hossain struck a double blow sending back Robin Uthapa (2) and Rohit Sharma (22) to reduce the opponents to 56 for two in 9.3 overs. Gambhir quick-fired 90 off 84 balls that studded 10 fours and one six. Earlier, Alok Kapali hit a swashbuckling century to fire Bangladesh to their highest-ever total of 283 for 6 in 50 overs against India in the Super Fours opener of the Asia Cup. Kapali drove, cut, pulled, sliced, slashed, and slog swept his way to a breathtaking 115--his maiden hundred--surpassing his previous best of 89 against the West Indies in 2002. Bangladesh racked up their highest total against India as its previous best of 257/9 came in 2004 in Dhaka and it was the third time that the Tigers passed the 250-mark against India. The stylish middle-order batsman was a bit shaky in the beginning and reached fifty facing 65 balls, but later cut loose and the Indian bowlers had no answer to his breathtaking strokeplay. Kapali exploded into life to change the complexion of the game when he was on 47. He slog-swept fastish offspinner Yusuf Pathan for two big sixes and went on to score off every other bowler with power and precision. He and Mahmudullah scythed RP Singh over backward point for fours to set the tone. Mahmudullah was happy to turn over the strike at the other end, contributing just 24 to the century partnership. Kapali hit pacer Manpreet Gony for four, six and six. Later, he clipped a slow Ishant Sharma yorker through midwicket and then stroked one past point as 61 came in just five overs. He reached his second fifty off just 21 balls. Despite an early setback with Nazimuddin failing to justify his worth in the tournament three times in a row, Bangladesh started brilliantly with some fluent batting from the top order. However, at one stage it seemed that Bangladesh would fail to cash in on from their brilliant start with scoreboard reading 120 for four in 23.2 overs. But Kapali along with Mahmudullah did an incredible task to give bowlers a very good total to bowl at on a track that is thought to assist the spinners in the second innings. Alok reached his fifty in style, hoisting off-spinner Yusuf Pathan for a massive six and took a single off Ishant Sharma to reach his hundred. Captain Mohammad Ashraful joined Tamim Iqbal to shrug off the pressure as they looked confident to face the Indian pace attack, playing them around wicket. Ashraful, however, threw his wicket away because of a poor shot selection to leave the side at 66 for two in 12.2 overs The Bangladesh captain could not elevate pacer RP Singh enough and was caught at mid-off by debutant Pragyan Ojha for a 21-ball 20. Despite the departure of the captain, Tamim and Roqibul Hasan kept up the momentum, but their successive dismissals put brakes on the run machine before Kapali took things in his own hand. Roqibul (25 off 34 balls) was preceded by Tamim Iqbal, the 11th Bangladesh batsman to reach 1000-ODI-run club in his 37th match. The left-handed opener reached his seventh ODI fifty before being superbly caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni off Ishant Sharma. Tamim, dropped on 11 by Gautam Ghambir off Gony, hit Ojha for a four through the first slip to reach his fifty and finally made 55 off 67 balls that featured seven fours. Alok along with Mahmudullah (26 no out) put on 112 for the sixth wicket and added another 49 with Mushfiqur Rahim, who played 35-ball 22. bdnews24
