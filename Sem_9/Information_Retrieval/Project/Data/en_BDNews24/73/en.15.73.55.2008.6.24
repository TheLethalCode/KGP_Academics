<TITLE> Moeen styles himself as redeemer: Time </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief Moeen U Ahmed underlines the urgent need to clean up Bangladesh's cynical, venal and corrupt politics, in a recent interview with Time magazine. General Moeen looks back to what preceded Jan. 11, 2007, when the army intervened, and recalls chaos: "The situation was deteriorating very rapidly. The world saw people dying in Dhaka's streets. Was this the way forward?" The article posted on the magazine's Website on Thursday highlights Moeen's views on the country's politics and its democracy's many failings. "No systems of government are bad in their own right," says the top-ranking military officer. "It's the human beings who make it so." According to Time, civil liberties in Bangladesh have taken a hit and thousands of suspected troublemakers picked up in midnight sweeps. "Behind all this, it's commonly understood that Moeen and the military really run the show. The Harvard-trained general was made army chief just under three years ago and is coy about the extent of his power," Time says. "It's this history of political dysfunction and avarice that Moeen claims he wants to expunge. The caretaker government has prided itself on its efforts to rebuild Bangladesh's democratic institutions  from cleaning up a voter roll that had some 12 million fake names listed on it to laying the groundwork for more effective regulatory commissions," according to Time. "With such steps and the examples set by the government's anticorruption campaign, Moeen believes Bangladeshis can be weaned off their fraudulent politicians." In the interview, Moeen says: "The people in the villages are very docile, they are kind-hearted. You can be a criminal, but you just need to go and cry, and they will accept you." Though the army chief insists, Time says, he and his top brass are operating purely in aid of civil power until elections are finally held, few in Dhaka doubt that anybody but the generals are "calling the shots behind the scenes in this interim government". "Many Bangladeshis suspect that Moeen and the advisers are happy to press ahead with both local and national elections, crafting a government of 'national unity' with handpicked candidates and without the backing of any of the major parties," Time says. Shying away from democratic commitments, according to the magazine, Moeen is far more eager to talk about building effective leadership in Bangladesh and educating its vast, illiterate masses  as he himself puts it  "so that they don't keep on cutting off their own feet". Towards the end of its article, Time says such a tone is fitting for a man who "styles himself the redeemer of his country". The magazine quotes him as saying at the end of the interview: "You can judge the people of a nation by the type of leaders they select."
