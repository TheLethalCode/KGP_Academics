 Natsuko Waki LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks rose on Wednesday after Barclays $8.9 billion share issue boosted other banking shares, while the dollar steadied before a closely watched policy decision by the Federal Reserve. The euro rose broadly after European Central Bank officials warned about persistently high inflation, while oil prices held above $137 a barrel -- within a few cents of the record high -- keeping inflation concerns alive. Britain's No.3 bank Barclays (said it was raising capital through a discounted share issue in which Qatar Investment Authority, the country's sovereign wealth fund, and Japan's Sumitomo MitsuiBanking will be major investors. Signs that the world's major banks are clearing up their troubles from the credit crisis and raising new capital come at a time when the global economy faces the threat of rising prices from surging oil and commodity prices. That has cemented market expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep its benchmark interest rates on hold at 2.0 percent later on Wednesday, ending a string of cuts since last year to bolster the slowing economy. However, analysts doubt the Fed would embark on a series of aggressive interest rate hikes given still soft signs from the U.S. economy. "(People are) obviously looking to the statement to see how hawkish they really are but I still think we are going to see rates on hold for quite some time in the U.S.," said Elisabeth Afseth, fixed income analyst at Evolution Securities. "I don't really see the sort of August hike being ready yet. I would expect them to be a little bit more balanced than what some fear." The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.8 percent while MSCI main world equity index erased early losses to gain 0.2 percent on the day. U.S. stock futures were up half a percent, indicating a firmer open on Wall Street later. The dollar was steady against a basket of six major currencies. The euro rose around 0.2 percent against the dollar and the yen after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation in the euro area was likely to remain high for some time. His comments were echoed by other ECB policymakers. Investors expect the ECB to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month to 4.25 percent. INFLATION LANGUAGE The Fed concludes its two-day meeting later on Wednesday, with the focus on what language the central bank chooses to use to highlight inflation and growth concerns when it releases the accompanying statement. "It seems likely the Fed will choose to adopt language that suggests more attention to the inflation outlook while maintaining the language highlighting the risks to growth," David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said in a note to clients. "As a result, the statement is likely to be less a representation of the evolution of the economy than a reminder that the Fed is balancing risks to both growth and inflation, supporting its stance that 2 percent is the appropriate level for the Fed funds rate." U.S. light crude was steady at above $137 a barrel, within a few cents of the June record high. Gold was steady at $888.80 an ounce. Emerging sovereign spreads were steady while emerging stocks rose 0.6 percent. The September Bund future fell a quarter percent.
