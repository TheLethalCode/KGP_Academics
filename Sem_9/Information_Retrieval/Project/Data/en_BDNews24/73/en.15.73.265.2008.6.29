<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet has decided to speed up public purchase regulations for the procurement of fertiliser in a bid to tackle any crisis during the upcoming Aman season, the finance adviser said Sunday. "The PPR for fertiliser procurement has been altered for one year to allow stocks to grow, considering the instability of fertiliser prices in the international market," AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the planning ministry. The new PPR compels the completion of the tender process within one month instead of 42 days and the time limit for re-tender will be cut to 14 days from 28 days. The cabinet meeting on economic issues has also approved import of other fertilisers, excluding urea, from countries through government-government deals. The finance adviser said that agriculture adviser CS Karim had travelled to Italy to attend a conference, and had held discussions with representatives of several countries including Morocco, Ukraine and Uzbekistan on importing non-urea fertilisers. The countries gave a positive response, Aziz said adding that the government had not previously imported fertiliser from these countries. On recent remarks by economists forecasting a fertiliser crisis, the adviser said: "The price of fertiliser is increasing abnormally in the world market. This is the reason for their comments." "But we will take all necessary steps, so that we do not have to face any crisis of fertiliser at any cost," he assured. bdnews
