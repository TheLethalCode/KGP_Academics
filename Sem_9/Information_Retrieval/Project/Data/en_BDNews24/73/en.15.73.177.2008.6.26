<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Thu Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis SA expects global vaccine sales to double to 22 billion euros ($34 billion) by 2016 and will invest 4 billion euros by then to expand its production capacity to meet rising demand, the head of the company's vaccine unit told The Wall Street Journal. The French pharmaceuticals company expects economic growth in the developing world to drive much of the new demand, Wayne Pisano, chief executive of vaccines, said in an interview published in the Journal on Thursday. "We have a number of diseases where there is not enough capacity today, where there is demand and there's not enough supply," Pisano said at a company vaccine factory northwest of Paris, according to the Journal. Vaccines represented about 10 percent of Sanofi's sales of 28 billion euros last year, but the company expects that to rise to 15 percent by 2016, Pisano told the paper. Sanofi is expanding production capacity or building new capacity at 15 sites world-wide, he also told the Journal
