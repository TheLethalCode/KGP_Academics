 VIENNA, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It is not just the Henri Delaunay trophy up for grabs in Sunday's Euro 2008 final as just about any stand-out individual performance by a Spaniard or German could secure him UEFA's Player of the Tournament award. Oddly, in a championship that has produced so many great games and dramatic moments, there are few obvious candidates for the honour being announced by organisers on Monday. Should Germany triumph, captain Michael Ballack would be a major contender. The midfielder was solid in the group phase, superb in the 3-2 quarter-final win over Portugal in a more advanced role and, though he had a game to forget against Turkey in the semis, he will expect to be at his best in the final. Ballack revels in big games and knows he is the focal point of the team. Having missed the 2002 World Cup final through suspension and lost in two Champions League finals he has a point to prove and what better place to do it than the European Championship final, perhaps with a decisive late goal? Team mate Bastian Schweinsteiger has quickly developed from a substitute in the first two group games into a key part of Germany's midfield. He scored the first goal and set up the other two in the victory over Portugal and scored again in an excellent performance against Turkey. His harsh red card for shoving Jerko Leko in the Croatia group match could count against him in UEFA's eyes, however. PODOLSKI'S CHANCE Germany's third contender, Lukas Podolski, is going for an individual double after being named the best young player of the 2006 World Cup. Transformed from striker to attacking midfielder, he has scored three goals and laid on two others at Euro 2008. Greece captain Theo Zagorakis got the 2004 award and though he had been consistently solid, it was seen by many as more of a representation of a victorious team ethic. With Spain's advance also based on an all-round team effort, captain Iker Casillas could be in with a shout, especially if he keeps another clean sheet on Sunday. The big goalkeeper has not put a foot wrong so far and saved two penalties in the quarter-final shootout win over Italy. There is still time for Spain's Cesc Fabregas to make a late run, despite mainly featuring as a substitute to date. If, as expected, he starts on Sunday then a repeat of his semi-final performance against Russia could bring him the honour. Outside the two finalists, Russia's Andrei Arshavin caught the eye with inventive displays against Sweden and Netherlands but he was unable to impose himself against Spain in the semis and is unlikely to collect an individual consolation
