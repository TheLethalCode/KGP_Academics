 Washington, June 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration said on Friday it was proposing to sell Pakistan ITT Corp electronic warfare gear valued at up to $75 million to enhance Islamabad's existing F-16 fighter aircraft fleet. Pakistan has asked about buying as many as 21 AN/ALQ-211(V)9 Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite pods, or AIDEWS, and related equipment, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a notice to lawmakers. The proposed sale will ensure that the existing fleet is "compatible" with new Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 Block 50/52 fighters being purchased by Islamabad, the notice said. Electronic warfare targets such things as radars, communications links, computer networks and advanced sensors. The notice of a potential sale is required by U.S. law. It does not mean the sale has been concluded.
