 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Direct flights between Colombo and Dhaka are set to take off soon, said Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama on Sunday. "We have already finalised the air services agreement between the two countries." "We expect our national carriers will soon take advantage of this by flying directly from Colombo to Dhaka and [vice versa]," Rohitha Bogollagama told reporters following talks with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at state guest house Padma in the city. But the minister did not define "soon". Bangladesh High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Shahadat Hossain told reporters at the guest house that the proposed air route could include Nepal (Colombo-Dhaka-Katmandu-Colombo). Bogollagama stressed: "We have a very close relationship that is growing and we want it to be more accelerated in terms of greater connectivity between the two capitals." The Sri Lankan minister arrived in Dhaka on Saturday to hand over a formal invitation to attend the 15th Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, to be hosted by the island nation on Aug 2-3. He handed Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury an invitation letter for a meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers on July 31. The foreign adviser thanked his Sri Lankan counterpart and hoped to join both meeting and summit. Bogollagama was set to see chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed later Sunday to hand over the SAARC summit invitation. On the agenda of the 15th SAARC summit, Bogollagama said: "We have identified seven key areas  including the new dimension of food security for the peoples of the SAARC region." "And how we are going to meet the energy crisis that is looming over our economies in the SAARC region; how we are going to share our resources and alternative sources for generation of energy that could cater to the needs of SAARC," he added. The minister hoped that bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka would increase in future. He is scheduled to leave Dhaka Monday. bdn
