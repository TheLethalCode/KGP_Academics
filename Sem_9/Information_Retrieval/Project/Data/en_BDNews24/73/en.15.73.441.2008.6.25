<TITLE> Matin clarifies NCC statement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)Home adviser MA Matin on Wednesday clarified a statement on the National Coordination Committee that he made the previous day. The NCC that works to check serious crimes has no legal validity for taking up new cases, said Matin, the committee's chairman, in Tuesday's statement which created some confusion. "I was asked (by reporters) whether NCC would continue its activities. As I thought the query was related to court matters, I said NCC did not have any legal validity," said Matin on Wednesday. "I meant that the NCC does not have the legal basis to file cases with the court or execute cases," Matin told reporters. "The police, the Anticorruption Commission and the National Board of Revenue have the powers," he said. Matin said the committee would not itself take up any new case because of paucity of time. "Steps will be taken by selecting among the charges submitted to the committee so far." On whether the committee would constrain its activities by year-end, the adviser said: "We have not constrained our activities. But we will not start any fresh anticorruption drive either. We will consider cases on a priority basis from the list of corruption suspects already submitted to the government." "We don't have sufficient time on our hands. Time is too short," said the NCC chairman. The NCC has so far investigated 488 cases. Of them, 65 have been disposed of, following trial. The remainder of the cases are either on trial or being investigated, the home adviser said Tuesday. On whether the taskforce would remain active after December, Matin said: "I am hopeful about the taskforce that the next democratic government will continue with it." bdnews
