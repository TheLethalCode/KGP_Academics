<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) A day after Khaleda Zia expressed her doubts, a High Court bench is going to hear on Wednesday a plea to drop from its business her stay petition against a government order and send it to the chief justice. The bench is dealing with her writ petition to freeze last year's government order requiring the opposition chief to vacate her residence in Dhaka cantonment. In Tuesday's petition submitted to Justice Iman Ali and Justice Obaidul Hasan, the BNP chairperson stated that she doubted getting proper justice from the bench and called for her original application to be withdrawn from the cause list. The court, accordingly, set the hearing on this petition for Wednesday, Mahbubuddin Khokan, one of her lawyers, said. Earlier, on April 11, the HC bench rejected an appeal by Khaleda's lawyers to stay that government order, and two days later rejected another application expressing 'no confidence' in the bench. The Directorate of Military Lands and Cantonments served the two-time former prime minister the original notice on April 20, asking her to immediately vacate the cantonment house. On May 3, Khaleda filed a petition with the High Court challenging the executive order. In a modified notice on May 7, the Directorate asked the BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. Subsequently, a government ministry in a May 24 notice asked the former prime minister to leave the house by June 30. Three days later, the court stayed the government notice for three months. On Aug 23, the High Court extended its stay order upon the government notice for a further four months, and on Dec 14 the freeze was extended for a further six months The cabinet had decided in April 2009 to cancel the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that Khaleda had violated the lease terms. Before her cabinet took the decision, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had told parliament that Khaleda should vacate the house to make way for blocks of apartments for families of army officers killed in the February BDR mutiny. The massive 2.72-acre spread was originally the official home of the deputy army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Ziaur Rahman, who later became army chief and then president through controversial means. After the murder of Ziaur Rahman, in a military coup in 1981, his widow Khaleda was also awarded a house in Gulshan in addition to the cantonment house which the family had been occupying since the 1970s. bdnew
