 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)--A special BDR court in Dhaka on Thursday began trying 300 members of the signals sector and RSU unit, located at the border guard's Peelkhana headquarters, accused of involvement in the Feb 25-26, 2009 mutiny. The special court-6, set up at the Darbar Hall at the paramilitary force's headquarters, initially began at around 9am to try 187 members of signals sector and ended at around 10:30am. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Major General Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, adjourned the court until 10am Saturday. At the start of the proceedings, Naik Subedar Niamat Ullah brought charges against the 187 accused. Among the total accused, 107 are currently in jail while the remaining 80 are on duty at Peelkhana. Gen Islam ordered that all the remaining accused be arrested and produced before the court the next day. The court sat again at around 11:30am to try 113 mutineers of the Rifles Security Unit and ended an hour later. Naik subedar Mohammed Abdul Matin Miah read out charges against the accused. Among the total accused, 57 are currently in jail while the remaining 56 are on duty at Peelkhana. Gen Islam ordered authorities to arrest the remaining accused and produced all accused before the court the next day. The court was adjourned until 12:15pm Saturday. The mutiny saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. Special tribunals in Rangamati, Satkhira, Feni, Panchagarh and Thakurgaon have already given verdicts previously. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The Peelkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts.
