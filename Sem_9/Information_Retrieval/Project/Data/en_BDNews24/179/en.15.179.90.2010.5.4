 PROVIDENCE, Guyana, May 4 (bdnews24.com.AFP) -- Muttiah Muralitharan could still feature for Sri Lanka in the World Twenty20, according to captain Kumar Sangakkara, after officials said he'd been ruled out with a groin injury. A statement released by Sri Lanka Cricket in Colombo earlier on Monday said the star off-spinner had been "advised to rest for two or three weeks" following a groin problem he suffered during the team's two-wicket opening match defeat by New Zealand here on Friday.

"Clinical tests revealed a grade one strain of his right adductor muscle," team physiotherapist Tommy Simsek said in the statement. "Murali has been advised to rest for two to three weeks." Muralitharan, who is the most successful bowler in history with a record 792 Test and 512 one-day wickets, took two wickets for 25 runs against New Zealand.
