 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has asked the police to submit investigation report of a case against three policemen including the OC of Mirpur Police Station. Md Manjurul Islam of 91/2 of West Manipur filed the case on Tuesday with the Dhaka's Chief Judicial Magistrates' Court against three police officials for loot and harassment after forced entry into his house. According to the case details the plaintiff is a retired government officer and also a freedom fighter. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque ordered the additional inspector general of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit the probe report within Jul 15 after hearing the plaintiff. The accused are--acting officer Md Zakir Hossain Molla, sub-inspector Md Abdul Aziz and sub-inspector Md Bakar. Manjurul complained that some quarters had been trying to evict him from his house. He had bribed the OC of Mirpur Police Station but the criminals had apparently bribed them more than he did. Manjurul said that he had filed a case against the criminals before. The court ordered the OC to maintain law and order. But the Mipur OC said that two parties had been feuding over a piece of land for a long time. He told bdnews24.com that Manjurul had gone to take possession of that piece of land on Apr 25 forcibly. "But he did not have the authentic documents, whereas the opposing did possess proof of ownership." bdne
