 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has defended the appointment of Abdul Matin, the chief of war crimes probe who resigned on Wednesday following accusations that he was allegedly linked with an Islamist outfit. "The resignation has ended all criticism," Sahara Khatun told reporters at the secretariat moments after the resignation. "Matin resigned to avoid the embarrassing situation he has been through since the comment of the advisor and media reports." The minister, however, claimed that the appointment was never a mistake. "The appointment was definitely all right," she said. Matin, who was also present there, told reporters that he had proved through his resignation that the allegations were not correct. "The allegations brought against me were not right. They are not authentic." He said he did not have any pressure from the government to take the decision. "I have resigned to avoid an embarrassing situation," he said. Prime minister's advisor on education, social development and political affairs Alauddin Ahmed on Apr 30 alleged that Matin had run for a college election position backed by the defunct Islami Chhatra Shangha, a student wing of fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. ICS members have been accused of taking part in war crimes during 1971, in particular relating to the abduction of intellectuals mainly on Dec 14-15, 1971 just days before the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16. Matin has however strenuously denied any involvement in Islamist politics. Matin said after completing his master's, he joined the Mymensingh Judges' Court as a civil judge at the end of 1971, when the Liberation War was still on, considering his family's welfare and the 'overall situation'. "Doing a job and being a razakar (collaborator) are not the same." On 25 March, the government formed a tribunal to try people alleged to have committed war crimes during the 1971 Liberation War. On the same day the seven-member investigation agency was also constituted, with Matin as its chief. bdn
