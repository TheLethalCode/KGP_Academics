<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)---- BNP has alleged that no private TV channels are being allowed to air the speech of the opposition leader live from Wednesday's Rajshahi rally. Khaleda Zia's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan made the allegation on Tuesday night but he would not name the channels. Maruf said, "Some private TV channels telecast the speech of opposition leader Khaleda Zia live from BNP's Chittagong and Khulna rallies. "But they are being barred from doing the same thing from Rajshahi. This is condemnable," he said. Khaleda is supposed to address a divisional rally at Madrasa Ground in Rajshahi. Maruf alleged that some TV channels had taken preparations to cover the programme as usual but they have been under pressure not to broadcast Khaleda's speech. He added that Channel 1 has already been shut down. He termed such government policy as 'fascist.'
