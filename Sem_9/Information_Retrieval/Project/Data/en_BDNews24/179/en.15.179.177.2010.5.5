 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com) -- A tripartite meeting on Wednesday has decided to increase wages of shipping and launch workers by 50 percent to 60 percent. However, there could be a problem in implementing the decision as one of the biggest workers union, Noujan Sramik Federation, did not attend the Wednesday's meeting because they have been demanding 350 percent rise in minimum wages. The tripartite meeting attended by the owners and workers' leaders has agreed on a minimum wage structure, under which it would be increased 50 percent to 60 percent. The decision will be finalised at a meeting to be held at the office of director of labour directorate on Thursday. Later shipping ministry will issue a gazette regarding new salary structure. In March, launch workers called a strike to press for their 22-point demands. The strike was called off after a high level tripartite meeting at the labour minister's residence on Mar 18. The demands include fixing minimum salary structure and regularise their appointment. Ashikul Islam, secretary general of Noujan Sramik Federation, told bdnews24.com that they were not invited in the meeting. "If the government wants to do something individually ignoring us, time will say whether the workers will accept the government decision," he said Islam said, "We have already set our programmes. The workers will shun their agitation once government takes some positive initiatives." "Otherwise the workers will decide their course of action just after the meeting. The strike may resume across the country on Apr 7," he said Though the Federation proposed rise in salary by a minimum of 300 to 350 percent, Wednesday's meeting decided on 50-60 percent hike in salary. On top of that workers will get duty allowance ranging from Tk 200-1000. Badiuzzaman, vice-president of Inland Water Transport (passenger) Owners' Association, told bdnews24.com, "Separate salary structure was being formulated for each category of workers on the basis of agreement between owners and workers under government initiative." Jahaji Sramik Federation president Shukkur Mahmud told bdnews24.com the salary structure made on the basis of the tripartite agreement would be acceptable to all. He also said, "But a faction of workers is preparing to wage movement ignoring the agreement. They are trying to increase salary by 300-350 percent in one go, which is unrealistic."
