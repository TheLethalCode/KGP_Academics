 Dhaka, May 05 (bdnews24.com) - The customs police have detained a Tamil youth at Shahjalal International Airport and claim they have recovered from him 20 kgs of a heroin like powder. Maro Khamu Ju Ila Mugogu was carrying an Indian passport and was detained on Tuesday night as he was about to leave on a Singapore Airlines flight. Shamsul Islam Khan, customs superintendent of Shahjalal International Airport told bdnews24.com that the Mugogu was searched and questioned by the police because of his suspicious movement. "Finding nothing on him we brought his luggage from the aircraft," he said. "We found a water heater in a black handbag. The scanning machine detected a substance of white colour in the heater," he added. Khan said "We found 19.7 kg of heroin like powder from the heater." He also said that officers of the department of narcotics control in the airport identified the powder as high quality heroin. Later on Wednesday morning a team led by an assistant director from the department of narcotics control tested the material and declared that it was not heroin, he said. He added that the team refused to inform the customs superintendent in writing about their finding. A ample of the powder has been sent to the Dhaka University, Science laboratory and Department of Narcotics Control for test.
