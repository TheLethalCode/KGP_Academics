 Chittagong, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Metropolitan Police have launched a service to prevent women's harassment. The police have advised women to send a text message with their names (SMS) to '373' from their mobile phones whenever they face such harassment. CMP officials said the police will act instantly to arrest the eve-teaser upon receiving the message. Police were spurred into action as some guardians stopped their daughters from attending schools in the face of harassment by men along their way. Meanwhile, CMP arranged a counselling session, attended by around 900 female students, to make them aware about how to deal with harassment. Police also distributed leaflets, containing necessary instructions and cellphone numbers of 15 police officers, among the students of Dr Khastogir Government High Girls' School on Wednesday to check teasing. They have also planned to conduct awareness raising campaign at different academic institutions against this menace.
