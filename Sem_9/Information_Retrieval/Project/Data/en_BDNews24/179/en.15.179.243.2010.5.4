 GROS ISLET, May 4 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- When Australia's Michael Clarke took part in the first ever international Twenty20 match, against New Zealand five years ago, the emphasis was very much on 'fun'. New Zealand players dressed up in retro kit, with some sporting hairstyles more associated with the 1960s and 70s. Australia captain Ricky Ponting made 98 as his side won by 44 runs in Auckland but questioned whether the 'novelty' of Twenty20 would endure.

"Everybody is taking the game a lot more seriously now and in tournaments like this, you want to do well. We haven't done as well as we would like but we've started well." Australia complete their group programme against Bangladesh in Barbados on Wednesday and, having seen his team lose to Zimbabwe in a warm-up fixture, Clarke was adamant he would not be underestimating Bangladesh. "It just shows in this form of the game, you have to be at your best, it doesn't matter who you are playing against," he said. "We certainly won't be taking Bangladesh lightly.
