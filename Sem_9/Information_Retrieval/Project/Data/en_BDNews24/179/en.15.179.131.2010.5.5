 GEORGETOWN, Guyana, May 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Sir Ronnie Flanagan, formerly the most senior policeman in the British province of Northern Ireland, is to become the new chairman of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption and security unit (ACSU), the governing body announced Tuesday. Flanagan will replace another former senior British policeman in Lord Paul Condon, previously head of London's Metropolitan Police, who is retiring from the role at the end of June. Until recently, Flanagan was the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and was previously the head of the police force in Northern Ireland from 1996 until 2002. ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Flanagan, described in an ICC statement as a 'keen amateur cricketer', and a former senior rugby player for Ulster, had the ideal qualities for his new role. "The job description dictates that anyone who takes the role has to be of international standing and experience. "There is no doubt that Sir Ronnie fits that description. He served as a Chief Constable, he has advised governments around the world in policing techniques and has also been involved in sport," the South African added. Condon helped create the ACSU and his time in charge coincided with the fall-out from several match-fixing scandals, including betting scams involving former South Africa captain Hansie Cronje. Condon was widely credited with pushing through an education and reporting system designed to help players first ward off and then alert authorities to approaches from unscrupulous gamblers. "He has guided the ACSU through difficult times for the game of cricket and helped to establish the unit as the world leader in its field and one that other sports are now looking to emulate," Lorgat said of Condon. However, the issue of spot-fixing, where events such as the number of wides in an over become the subject of gambling coups, remains a problem for cricket, especially in an era of spread betting which encourages punters to bet on more than just the results of matches. Condon, who like Flanagan was involved in counter-terror work while a police officer, mainly in operations against the Irish Republican Army (IRA), has also had to draw up security protocols following the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March last year. That incident led to the suspension of international cricket in Pakistan. "I feel that my tenth year with the ICC is a fitting time to stand down especially as I have now completed the work of the task force set up to look into improving security after the attack in Lahore last March," Condon said. Flanagan is currently an advisor to the Abu Dhabi Police Force as well as contributing to the security and safety plan for the Football Association's bid to host the 2018 soccer World Cup in Eng
