 MANCHESTER, May 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- England goalkeeper Ben Foster has signalled that he will be leaving Manchester United at the end of the season as he seeks to revive a career that has stalled over the last ten months. The 27-year-old started the season looking poised to establish himself as the number one choice for both club and country. But some high-profile mistakes while standing in for the injured Edwin van der Sar resulted in him being banished to the United reserves and he is now resigned to missing out on the World Cup, with England boss Fabio Capello set to take David James, Robert Green and Joe Hart to South Africa. "You never want to leave Manchester United. If you leave this club you are only ever going to go down," Foster acknowledged. "But I want to be playing football. I am not interested in just hanging around and I would go if the club wanted to sell me. "If they are happy to accept a bid then you have to read between the lines and realise you are not really needed and move on. It would not be the end of the world for me." Foster, speaking to the Manchester Evening News, added: "I don't think there is any chance of South Africa now. If he (Capello) were to pick me it would be very unfair on some of the other goalkeepers. "I have not played a first-team game for a good few months and some of the English lads out there like Joe Hart and Robert Green have been doing fantastic." United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has meanwhile revealed that Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans has committed his future to the club after extended contract negotiations. "Jonny has proved himself," Ferguson told MUTV. "He has signed a new contract and helps to provide a good foundation for the club for a long time." Evans, who has reportedly agreed a four-year deal, is only 22 but has been a regular in the first team this season because of recurring injuries to Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and is seen by some as a future club cap
