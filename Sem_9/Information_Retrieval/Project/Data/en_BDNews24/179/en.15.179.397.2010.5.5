 Jahangirnagar University, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  Student groups demonstrated on Wednesday demanding removal a department chairman for sexual harassment. They demanded that Abdullah Hel Kafi, chairman of international relations, be removed for sexually harassing his female colleague. The Progressive Students' Alliance and Jahangirnagar Sangskritik Jote jointly organised a human chain and staged a rally on the university's Amar Ekushey premises at around noon. Speakers at the rally, after the human chain, criticised the authorities for exposing the identity of the complainant in an official notice. They condemned the vice chancellor's speech in the media, saying that it clearly indicated his partisan attitude. The student leaders also threatened strong movement if the administration delayed the probe. bdn
