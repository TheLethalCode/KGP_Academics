<TITLE> Moriarty defends high US tariff </TITLE>

 Dhaka, May 06 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty played the Africa card defending high US tariffs for Bangladeshi products, suggesting that it was to protect the smaller exporters. He indicated the export interest of small African countries who strongly object to Bangladeshi garments getting completely free access to the US market. The US government came under criticism at a discussion meeting on Thursday for not giving duty-free market access to Bangladesh, a least developed country. Allegations were made that there was no level playing field for Bangladeshi traders entering the US market. "There are some trade distortions between Bangladesh and the US. The distortion does not come from Bangladesh side," economist Rehman Sobhan told the discussion meeting organised by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "Demanding duty-free access to the US market is not seeking a privilege. This is a demand for a level playing field," he said. Like other non-LDC countries, the economist said, Bangladesh, a least developed country, was paying 15 percent export duty. "The US is the only western country which has not kept its commitment to grant duty-free market access to Bangladesh as a LDC under the WTO rules. All western countries have given the facility," M A Taslim told the meeting on US-Bangladesh trade and economic cooperation. "Bangladeshi exporters are competing with China, India, Indonesia and Vietnman. They are not competing with Madagascar," Moriarty told the meeting. "If the 15 percent duty was not there, the smaller exporters would be the losers," said the US envoy. He said Bangladesh's export competitiveness was good and it could survive in the competition. "You have shown this," he told the businessmen. Moriarty said the American consumers, not the Bangladeshi businessmen were paying the 15 percent duty and that Bangladesh would get little benefit if the 15 percent export duty was waived. Businessman C K Hyder term Moriarty's statement "misleading". Rehman Sobhan also said that Bangladesh was paying US $700million to US $800 million every year as duty for exports worth US $ 3.75 billion. Former Bangladesh ambassador to Washington M Humayun Kabir and economist Zaidi Sattar presented keynote papers. Commerce minister Faruk Khan attended the meeting as chief guest while prime minister's adviser H T Imam was guest of honour. b
