 Bogra, May 04 (bdnews24.com)--- A court in Bogra granted bail to opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque on a Tk 100 crore defamation case. Bogra Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hasanuzzaman, granted bail with a bond of Tk 50,000 and placed Farroque, who was present at the court, under the custody two local people. Farroque had alleged, at the Jatiya Sangsad on March 11 and again at a press conference in Gulshan on March 12, that Sajib Ahmed Wazed, son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was involved in illegal VOIP business and that the BNP had information to support these allegations. Following the statements Suvashis Liton Poddar, President of Bogra BCL, the student wing of the ruling Awami League, filed the defamation case at the Bogra Court on March 18. Coming out of the court, accompanied by a procession of opposition activists, Farroque told journalists that the Awami League was filing false cases against members of the opposition to harass them, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all such cases. Farroque also claimed that those who spoke out in parliament were being kept busy in the courts defending themselves. BCL activists demonstrated on the court premises on hearing the news of the bail. bdnews
