<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister's adviser Moshiur Rahman on Tuesday left for New Delhi to push for implementation of the Bangladesh-India joint communiqu that includes a key power deal. Rahman, who advises premier Sheikh Hasina on economic affairs, and a senior foreign ministry official are scheduled to discuss probable signing of deals on sharing of the Teesta waters and importing power from India. Rahman is on a high-power committee formed on Monday to review a deal signed earlier with India on open-ended import and export of electricity, before ratifying the deal for power purchase from the larger neighbour. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith and planning minister A K Khandaker are the other members of the committee tasked to examine the memorandum of understanding signed during the premier's January visit to New Delhi. Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the just concluded SAARC summit in Thimphu discussed progress of implementation of the joint communiqu prepared during Hasina's Delhi visit in January. The two leaders also stressed speeding up the implementation. Foreign ministry director general (in charge of South Asia desk) Mohammad Imran is accompanying the economic adviser, officials say. "They will discuss the progress of the cooperation spelled out in the Bangladesh-India joint communiqu," Said Muna Tasneem, a foreign ministry director general (external publicity), told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "It includes cooperation in the power sector and others," said Tasneem and added that the adviser and the director general would return on May 8. The joint-statement contains 50 points with a mention of Bangladesh-India cooperation in areas such as crime check, power, water, business, connectivity, and development. It stressed conclusion of the discussion on sharing water of the Teesta. Dhaka and Delhi also signed five deals during Hasina's visit. These are: Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, Agreement on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, Agreement on Combating International Terrorism, Organized Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking, Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Power Sector, and Cultural Exchange Programme. India agreed to export 250 megawatts of electricity to energy-starved Bangladesh through connecting the power grids of the two countries. Bangladesh also agreed to allow India to use Ashuganj as a port to take equipment to Indian territory for constructing the Palatana power plant. Indian ships will use Chittagong port to carry goods to that country's northeastern states. India announced a creditline of US$ 1 billion for projects mainly in the railway and road sector in exchange for transit through Bangladesh territory to carry its products. Once the power deal is ratified, the Bangladesh Power Development Board and India's Thermal Power Corporation will sign a contract on the import. Energy-starved Bangladesh presently produces a maximum of 4,200 megawatts of electricity against demand of 6,000 megawatts. Hasina had recently said her government would import 500 megawatts from India. The government was also pursuing energy cooperation with nearby Bhutan and Nepal. In a recent statement, she outlined that her government would be able to add more than 9,000 megawatts of electricity in both public and private sectors by 2015
