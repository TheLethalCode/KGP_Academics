 LOS ANGELES, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former "Baywatch" star Pamela Anderson was eliminated from television's "Dancing With the Stars" competition on Tuesday, leaving just five celebrities in the running for the finale. Anderson, 42, who had finished in the bottom two several times this season despite mostly good reviews from the judges, received the lowest votes from the public this week for her fairy-tale waltz with professional partner Damian Andrews. Popular ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews also found herself at risk of elimination on Tuesday after ending in the bottom two in a shock result that judge Len Goodman called "absolutely heartbreaking." Canadian-born Anderson, a former Playboy model, found worldwide fame as a buxom lifeguard in the 1990s TV series "Baywatch". But the almost 20 million viewers for ABC television's "Dancing With the Stars" never seemed to take to her, despite performances on the show in which she emulated other famous blondes including Marilyn Monroe and Dolly Parton. Anderson, along with eliminated contestants astronaut Buzz Aldrin and TV reality mother of eight Kate Gosselin, has helped the 10th season of "Dancing With the Stars" to its biggest audiences ever. The remaining five celebrities are Pussycat Dolls singer and favourite Nicole Scherzinger, Olympic ice skater Evan Lysacek, Andrews, actress and "Clean House" host Niecy Nash and footballer Chad Ochoci
