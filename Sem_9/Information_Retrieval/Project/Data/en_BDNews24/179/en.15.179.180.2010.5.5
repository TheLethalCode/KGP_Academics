 Dhaka, May 05 (bdnews24.com)- Bangladesh fails to import Canadian wheat because it is too expensive said the food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak on Wednesday. The minister was speaking at the inauguration of a workshop jointly organised by the Canadian High Commission, the Canada Wheat Board and the Canadian International Grain Institute for the wheat traders of Bangladesh in the capital. He said that whilst Bangladesh's flour and bread factories import wheat from Canada, the government simply cannot do so as the price is so high even though the wheat is said to be highly nutritrious. The minister said that the country imports two million metric tons of wheat every year  mostly from Russia - against a demand of three million metric tons. He mentioned that the demand for wheat products has risen with the emergence of fast food shops in the country and the increased popularity of food made from wheat. Canadian High Commissioner Robert McDougall, Ashok Sarkar and Yvonne Supenee from the Canadian International Grain Institute and Donald Bonner from the Canada Wheat Board were also present in the inauguration ceremony of the workshop. b
