 JERUSALEM, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States expects to reconvene Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in an indirect format in the coming days, a US spokesman said on Wednesday after the US envoy met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "We hope and expect formally to move forward with proximity talks before Senator (George) Mitchell leaves the region on Sunday," State Department spokesman P.J.

"If the executive approves these indirect negotiations, all the final-status issues will be on the table for discussion," Rdainah said. "Absolutely no issue will be excluded and Jerusalem will be the top priority." Israeli leaders have said the Palestinians can raise core issues in the indirect talks but only direct negotiations can resolve them.

Washington opted for this method of negotiation after failing to narrow differences over Jewish settlements built in occupied land enough to resume face-to-face talks, which the two sides have not held in 18 months.
