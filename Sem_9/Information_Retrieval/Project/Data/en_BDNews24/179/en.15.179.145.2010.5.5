<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will be getting their last chance to progress into the Super Eights of the third World Twenty20 on Wednesday when they face an in-form Australia, apparently qualifiers for the Super Eights, in the last of the Group A matches. Bangladesh Television will be broadcasting the match live from Kensington Oval Pitch at Barbados from 11pm. The Tigers lost their first group match after failing to reach the target of 173 set by Pakistan. In the second match Australia almost qualified for second round beating reigning champions Pakistan by 36 runs. Both Australia and Pakistan have two points. A Bangladesh win, which is highly unlikely given that they have lost 11 T20s in a row since beating West Indies in September 2007, will bring net run rates into play. For that to happen, dashing Tamim Iqbal needs to be in his aggressive self and play a big innings. But he has struggled so far, with a top score of 32 in 14 matches. Mohammed Ashraful, who topscored with 65, and Shakib also need to be at their best to give they any chance. They were beaten by Pakistan by 21 runs on Saturday, leaving their net run-rate at -1.05, meaning Shakib Al Hasan's men will have to overcome Pakistan's net run rate should they pull off a mini miracle. Theoretically, a big win for the Tigers could also lower Australia's net run rate below that of Pakistan, and throw them out of the tournament. However, if Australia bat first and score, let's say, 200, that will be it for Bangladesh. Australia have not lost since their exit in last year's tournament and they have been in their most successful streak in the format. Their only previous meeting in Twenty20s saw Australia win by nine wickets at the 2007 tournament in South Af
