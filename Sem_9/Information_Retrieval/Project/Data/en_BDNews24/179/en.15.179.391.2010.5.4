 Satkhira, May 4 (bdnews24.com)--Three members of a family in Satkhira have been charged with war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. GM Ishaq Ali, the son of Abdul Mannan Gazi of Chhotokupot village in Shyamnagar upazila, filed a case with the senior judicial magistrate's court on Tuesday. Magistrate Humayun Kabir has ordered the Shyamnagar Police Station officer in charge to start investigation. The accused are Shahbaj Gazi, his two sons Mahmud Ali Gazi and Hossain Ali Gazi of the same village. According to the complaint, Abdul Mannan Gazi, father of Ishaq, was an activist of the Awami League and he used to provide secret information to the freedom fighters during the war. On the other hand, the accused opposed the nation's freedom struggle and actively collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces. They were well known for murder, loot and are said to have killed a number of people in the area. The accused took Abdul Mannan by force to the bank of a canal in Baduria Mollapara, blindfolded him and killed him with sharp weapons. Then they threw the body into the canal. Mannan's family recovered the body from the canal the next day and buried him. It was also mentioned that they could not file any case at that time as the criminals were Razakars (collaborators). Now as the process of the trial of war crimes has started, the case was filed with the support of witnesses. b
