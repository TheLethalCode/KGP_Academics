 Rajshahi, May 5 (bdnews24.com)BNP chief Khaleda Zia has asked opposition activists in Rajshahi to take preparations for a strong anti-government movement and said the programmes will be announced from a Dhaka rally. She addressed a big public meeting on Wednesday at Rajshahi Alai Madrasa ground--the third major rally after Chittagong and Khulna. Khaleda said, "The movement programmes will be declared from the grand rally scheduled to be held in Dhaka on May 19." The opposition has taken up a series of programmes to rejuvenate the party and infuse dynamism into its rank and file. The Rajshahi rally was Khaleda's first appearance in the city since Dec 29, 2008 national elections. This is the third of six grand rallies across the country. The first rally was held in Chittagong on Mar 29 and the second one in Khulna on Apr 18. BNP will hold the next meetings in Barisal and Dhaka on May 12 and 19.
