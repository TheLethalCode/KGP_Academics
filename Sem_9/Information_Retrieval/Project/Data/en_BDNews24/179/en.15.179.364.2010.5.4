 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  A senior economist on Tuesday advised the government to introduce similar long-term planning for the local government system as in the five-year development plans and the annual development plans. MM Akash, an economics professor at Dhaka University, made the suggestion at the discussion on 'National Budget & Local Government' held at the National press Club. Governance Advocacy Forum hosted the discussion. In his keynote paper Akash said, "Though the local government allocation has increased in the current budget compared to previous years, it is hardly enough." He said the election manifesto of the ruling party and even the budget speech of the finance minister reiterated the government's commitment on decentralisation and empowerment of local government financially. But the budget allocation did not reflect the commitment, he alleged. Akash put forward six-point demands to the government to facilitate empowerment and decentralisation of the local government. The demands included increasing budgetary allocation to 2 percent from the last year's actual allocation of 1.43 percent for the local government bodies on the basis of specific work plan. They also included specifying responsibility of the local government bodies to empower them with more allocation and to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities democratically, being free from influence of MPs or administration. Identifying sources of income to determine income and expenditure and formulating the main proposal of increased allocation during national budget preparation was another demand placed by the DU professor. The demands encompass undertaking effective measures in ensuring transparency and accountability of the local government's tasks. He also demanded that development planning and expenditure of poverty alleviation programmes should be available on the internet and in mass media for public consumption. Speaking as the chief guest, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on land, AKM Mozammel Haque said, "Accountability of the local representatives will be better ensured if the elections of the local government bodies are held with political affiliation." He urged the government to allocate 20 percent of the national budget for the local government ministry. UNDP's advisor to the local government affairs and senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed said, "A change should be brought in the national and local government budget structures." He also said that a framework should be prepared simultaneously for formulating an allocation guideline and its proper implementation. bdnews
