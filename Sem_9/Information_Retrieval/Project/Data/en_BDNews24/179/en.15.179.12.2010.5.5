 WASHINGTON, May 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday his country would "definitely continue" its nuclear program despite Israeli threats of military action.

Ahmadinejad has said he is not concerned about sanctions. "We will not accept something that's forced upon us," he said in the interview.
