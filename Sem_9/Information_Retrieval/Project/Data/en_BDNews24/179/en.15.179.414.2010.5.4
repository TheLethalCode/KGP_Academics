<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday asked authorities to deploy police at the banks of the river Buriganga to stop dumping of waste. At the same time, the court also asked the government to explain why it should not be ordered to take effective measures to protect the river from pollution. The officers in charge of the capital's Demra, Lalbagh, Kamrangirchar, Kotwali and Hazaribagh police stations have been asked to make the deployment. This process will be monitored by a committee composed of the representatives from the district administration, police and BIWTA (Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority). The court also asked the committee to submit its report on the progress of police activities by four weeks. The bench of justices Md Mamtaz Uddin Ahmed and Naima Haider gave the order on Tuesday following a public interest petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a rights organisation. Manzil Morshed, who appeared for the petitioner in the hearing, said, "The present situation of the Buriganga is terrible and hundreds of millions of people in the capital depend on its water. "But thousands of tons of trash are being dumped into the river every day along with hundreds of sewerage lines that disgorge the raw sewage into it, polluting the river severely." The lawyer said due to the pollution, the city dwellers are being affected. "It has become tough to treat the water too," he added. Deputy attorney general Mostafa Zaman Islam argued for the state. bdnew
