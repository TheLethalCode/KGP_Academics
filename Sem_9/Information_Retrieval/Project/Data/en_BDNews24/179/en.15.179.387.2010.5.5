 Rajshahi, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia has questioned the ability of the Awami League to govern the county citing allegations of terrorism and extortion by the rulers. The two-time prime minister also alleged that the government was rewarding the party coterie by awarding them power projects. The opposition chief alleged that the current power crisis had been 'manufactured' to heighten the sense of urgency, indicating the government's recent initiative of entertaining unsolicited bids. She made the statements at a public meeting on Wednesday at Rajshahi Alia Madrasa grounds amid tight security with a large deployment of RAB and police. Eight closed-circuit cameras were also installed around the stage. Rajshahi was the third major rally after Chittagong and Khulna. Khaleda asked the thousands of opposition activists present at the rally to take preparations for a strong anti-government movement. She said the programmes will be announced from a Dhaka rally. Khaleda said, "The movement programmes will be declared from the grand rally scheduled to be held in Dhaka on May 19." The opposition has taken up a series of programmes to rejuvenate the party and infuse dynamism into its rank and file. The Rajshahi rally was Khaleda's first appearance in the city since Dec 29, 2008 national elections. This is the third of six grand rallies across the country. The first rally was held in Chittagong on Mar 29 and the second one in Khulna on Apr 18. BNP will hold the next meetings in Barisal and Dhaka on May 12 and 19. The last meeting will be held in Sylhet. The BNP chief said, "Different associate organisations of the ruling party are engaged in terrorism, extortion and tender grabbing." She pointed out that the ruling party could not even control those elements. "They cannot even run their own party. How can they run the country?" Alluding to the prime minister, she said, "Everyone in the government, beginning with number one, has become corrupt." She claimed that the ruling party had violated their election pledges. "They could not solve the existing crisis with gas, power and water. Moreover, the law and order situation has worsened." Khaleda harped on her case against the military-backed interim government and said Fakhruddin-Moinuddin had taken the country 20 years behind by loot and plunder. She said that ruling government had come to power with the assistance of that government. "And they have kept up the same trend of pushing the country backwards." Regarding the unsolicited power contracts, Khaleda said, "They (government) have created the crisis artificially so that they can award the projects without tenders to their people." "The country will face a loss of Tk 7,000 crore in the next 3 years for this partisanship," she warned. The prime minister along with the ruling party ministers have accused the previous BNP-Jamaat led four party alliance government not adding any new power to the national grid during the five-year tenure and Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman was involved in corruption. Rejecting those allegations, Khaleda claimed that 1,500MW power was added to the grid during her term. Citing that the people of Chittagong and Khulna demanded movements against the government, Khaleda asked the audience whether they would be on the streets if such programmes were taken up. The meeting loudly said, "Yes." When she asked about the programme, they gave slogans for hartal (strikes). The BNP chairperson then said, "The programmes will be announced immediately. The next meeting is at Barisal on May 12 and then in Dhaka. "The programme will be announced from there." She asked her party-men to take preparations. Indicating the combined participation of AL and Jamaat-e-Islami in the 1986 elections during the tenure of ousted military dictator HM Ershad, Khaleda said, "They took part in the elections having an entente with an autocratic government." "Today it is heard that we have an entente with Jamaat. But I would say, they do not have such relation with us, rather it is with the Awami League," she added. Different newspapers have recently reported that with the trial of war criminals beginning, BNP was concerned about the fate of Jamaat, which had institutionally opposed the nation's independence war in 1971. BNP took elaborate measures to welcome their chairperson with over 200 archways along the route that she would have taken from Dhaka. The meeting grounds and adjacent areas had some 200 loudspeakers and several projection screens although they could not be operated due to rain. Overwhelming crowds brought traffic to a halt in the surrounding areas. A number of central BNP leaders were also present in Rajshahi. They included standing committee members, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque. The meeting was presided over by city BNP president and former Rajshahi mayor Mizanur Rahman Minu. She met the local leaders of Rajshahi at Dak Bungalaw after the rally in the evening. bdnews24.com
