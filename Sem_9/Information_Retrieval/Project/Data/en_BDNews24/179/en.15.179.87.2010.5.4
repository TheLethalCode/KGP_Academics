<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 04 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has termed the commerce ministry's practice of setting export targets for Bangladesh missions abroad "meaningless". The parliamentary standing committee on foreign ministry decided at its meeting on Tuesday to review the government's policy of giving export targets for the missions at its next sitting, the date of which was yet to be fixed. "The practice of setting targets for all missions is not the right way of promoting exports. It does not mean anything," A H Mahmood Ali, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at the parliament building. The chairman said he raised the issue at the meeting following media reports on the failure of 24 Bangladesh's foreign missions to fulfill the export targets. "What will be the status of the envoys in the serving countries if media publishes reports on their failure of meeting export targets," said Ali not mentioning the name of the authority of setting the export targets for the envoys. He said his committee had asked the foreign ministry to prepare a working paper on setting export targets for ambassadors. The commerce ministry about a decade ago started the practice of fixing export targets for Bangladesh missions. Commerce ministry's wing export promotion bureau prepares export earnings from different countries every month. The chairman said his committee would initiate the process of inviting the Bangladesh envoys to the parliamentary standing committee to brief the MPs on their plans while serving as envoys. "As part of the practice, we invited Bangladesh ambassador in Russia and Kuwait before they took up their position," said Ali who was a career diplomat. "If necessary, we will hold special meetings with the ambassadors before they take upi their postings," he said
