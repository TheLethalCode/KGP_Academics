 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former caretaker administration advisor Akbar Ali Khan on Tuesday described as a 'hoax' the woman development projects of the government. At a seminar on the role of the national budget in achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) for women at the CIRDAP auditorium, he said that together the women and children affairs ministry and the education ministry had 40 projects on women development. "These projects yielded no benefit for women. "These projects are hoaxes. "On the other hand, most of these projects favour men." He asked the government to stop such hoaxes in the name of women development. Khan said there is great shortage of data on women's development, adding that "attention should be focused on that." In relation to the budget discussion in parliament, he said, "Only 40 percent of the members of the parliament can take part in the budget discussion and 90 percent of these MPs say things that are not relevant to the budget. "The parliamentary standing committees are not allowed to discuss the budget. Initiatives should be taken to change this," the former finance secretary said. State minister for women and children affairs Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury said, "Attempts are being made to make the women development projects sustainable." She said more projects on women development, training programmes and projects to eradicate women's poverty would be taken up. Meher Afroz Chumki MP praised Khan's comments saying that "those widened our knowledge." "We have only five years left for the millennium development goals. Efforts will be made so that the women related issues are prioritised in the next budget. In the keynote paper, Pratima Paul Mazumder, BIDS senior research fellow, said, "Though there is a plan to bring down the maternal mortality rate, there has been no reduction in the mortality rate since 2000." She mentioned that the mortality rate was increasing due to illiteracy, adolescent marriage and child motherhood. "Moreover, the number of dropout of girls has also been increased due to poverty and lack of security." Pratima said, "To attain the millennium objectives, the budget should take steps on ownership of wealth by women, positive steps in case of female entrepreneurship and removal of gender inequality in the field of education." The function was jointly organised by Bangladesh Womens Guild and Institute of Environment and Development. bdnew
