 Moulvibazar, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  A strike called by transport owners and workers in Moulvibazar paralysed the district's communication system on Thursday. The joint association of owners and workers called the indefinite strike in Sylhet division but it failed to make any impact on other areas of Sylhet, Habiganj or Srimangal. The association convener Syed Mufassil Ali said they had called the strike to press for the withdrawal of cases against the association's leaders and the removal of the chief of Moulavibazar police from his post. No inter-city and distant-range buses ran from the district town from Thursday morning leaving the passengers stranded. Meanwhile, transport strikes in Sherpur and Lalmonirhat have been called off after workers were assured that their demands would be met. Sherpur district commissioner Md Nasiruzzaman said on Thursday that the leaders of the labour union had agreed to call off their strike following a successful meeting with the authorities. The strike had been enforced in the district since Tuesday over a feud between bus workers and CNG auto-rickshaw drivers. Leaders of Lalmonirhat labour union agreed to withdraw their planned 24 hours strike on Wednesday night after the authorities assured them that the 15 demands set out by the workers would be met within seven days. bdnew
