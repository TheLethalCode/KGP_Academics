 Sylhet, May 5 (bdnews24.com)  The residents of Akhalia Ghat area in Sylhet took to the streets demanding electricity supply. The agitating locals blocked the road in front of the main entrance of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology by burning tires. The blockade triggered a serious traffic snarl-up for an hour from 7pm. Sanjit Mallick, sub inspector of Sylhet Kotwali police, told bdnews24.com that power supply was hampered as the transmitter had broken down. Discussions were on with the authority and supply would be restored soon, Sanjit said. No one from the power office was available for comments. Locals alleged that they had been suffering due to power outage. They complained to the authorities to no avail. "The officials just hang up if we place complaints frequently," one alleged. Finding no way, they took to the streets and blocked the road to press for their demands for immediate solution. bdne
