<TEXT>
 ESTORIL, Portugal, May 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Roger Federer on Tuesday said that he's keen to get his French Open preparations under way as he gears up for a second-round match with German Bjorn Phau at the Estoril Open. The world number one insists he's not overly concerned by his shaky start to the 2010 clay campaign, which culminated in last week's upset loss to Latvian Ernests Gulbis in the Rome second round. But just to be more secure in his own mind, a second title at Estoril is his first order of business. "First, I'd like to win the first round here and then go from there," said the top seed, a winner here in his only other appearance in 2008. "Of course I'd like to win the event again. I'm the only top player in the draw and I have high hopes of doing well and progressing in the tournament. "Hopefully I'll be standing there as the winner -- anything else would be a disappointment, but you never know. "I've not won a match on clay this season yet, I've had some disappointing losses the last weeks and months (at Indian Wells, Miami and Rome), so I have to make sure I bounce back." Phau and Federer first met 11 years ago, when the German prevailed. World number 138 Phau earned his spot in round two with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 defeat of Spaniard Marc Lopez. After Federer's opening practice session at the Estadio Nacional on Monday, when he complained about having 'three kilos' of sand in each eye, windy conditions died down a bit on Tuesday. And with his goal a first victory on Tour clay since defeating Robin Soederling at Roland Garros last summer, the 28-year-old Federer is looking ahead optimistically to the week in Portugal. "I know I can do it, it's what I've been doing my whole life, coming back strong after disappointments. I hope I can start that again here," he said. The Swiss said that no matter how he fares this week in Estoril and the next in Madrid, he will head to Paris with optimism after lifting his first Grand Slam title on clay at the venue. "I don't know how tough it will be, we will see," he said. "I haven't struggled with defending my finals, I've been good at that. "We'll see how well I do in defending a championship at Roland Garros. My game is good enough, my mind is good enough, my body is good enough. "That's all I need to know. The next couple of weeks will be important -- but not crucial -- to see where my level's at." For the second straight day, the Swiss star trained with a player from the host nation, following up Monday's session with Rui Marchado with a hit-out against 246th-ranked Leonardo Tavares. On the women's side of the draw, Spanish fourth seed Anabel Medina Garrigues, winner of eight minor clay titles, reached the second round after beating Portugal's Magali de Lattre 6-0, 6-0. Swiss Stephanie Voegele knocked out fifth seed Melinda Czink of Hungary 6-4,
