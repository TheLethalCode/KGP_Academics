 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) The Secretariat suffered a series of rolling outages for roughly 45 minutes on Wednesday. Officials and staff at hub of the Bangladesh government and administration said that power went out for about 25 minutes the first time. But there were two more outages  one for 10 minutes and one about 5 minutes they said. Dhaka Power Distribution Company's (DPDC) central office, its regional office in Shegunbagicha and the housing and public works ministry, responsible for power supply to the Secretariat, have given contradictory comments about the power outage. Housing and public works ministry's sub-divisional engineer Shamsul Alam said that a portion of the national power grid suddenly stopped functioning. Alam said that this power outage occurred in most of the areas under the grid. However, power supply resumed within 25 minutes. But electricity supply snapped two more times, although it was back on within minutes. Khairul Alam, the sub-divisional engineer of DPDC's regional office in Shegunbagicha, told bdnews24.com that Dhanmondi's supply from the national power grid stopped at around 2:30pm. He said about half of Dhaka's power supply was snapped including the Secretariat for this reason. But the DPDC's central control room officials said that Ramna's 33KV power distribution line had snapped at around 2:26pm. Ramna, Phulbaria, Karwan Bazar, Kaptan Bazar, Nazira Bazar, Segunbagicha, Press Club, the Secretariat and adjacent areas were disconnected also. Officials said that a cat had entered the Ramna power supply's control room and caused the incident. But they drove away the cat immediately and took initiatives to resume power supply rapidly. Secretariat employees said that almost all their activities came to a halt. The lifts and other electronic machines stopped functioning at that time. Some people were stranded in the lifts and became frightened. The lifts, however, were brought into action swiftly by generators and the stranded passengers rescued. bdn
