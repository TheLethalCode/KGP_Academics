<TEXT>
 BERLIN, May 5 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bayern Munich's veteran goalkeeper Hans-Joerg Butt is set to be handed a shock World Cup call-up when Joachim Loew names his squad on Thursday, according to German daily Bild. Bild quotes a German Football Federation (DFB) source as saying Butt, who won the last of his three caps in 2003, is set to be named on Thursday in Germany's World Cup squad following the injury to goalkeeper Rene Adler. The 35-year-old Butt has been in stellar form for Bayern this season with Louis van Gaal's side set to win the Bundesliga title on Saturday. Loew has already said he will name Schalke 04's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen's Tim Wiese in his World Cup squad, but Butt is likely to get a recall to claim the third goalkeeping place. Adler was forced out of World Cup contention on Tuesday when it was revealed he needs a rib operation. Meanwhile, former Germany coach Franz Beckenbauer also told Bild he feels former Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann could be another option to claim the third berth, if Loew opts not to take Butt. "That would be a possibility," said Beckenbauer who captained Germany to the World Cup in 1974 and coached the team to the 1990 title. "Lehmann is our most experienced goalkeeper and did well at the last two tournaments in 2006 (at the World Cup) and Euro (2008). "Loew must decide that if he takes Lehmann to the World Cup, it must be as number one, you can't leave him on the bench." Although Lehmann has said he would like to play for Germany at the World Cup in South Africa, Loew has repeatedly said he will not recall the 40-year-old. Germany have drawn Australia, Ghana and Serbia in Group 4 for the World Cup which starts on June 11 and Loew is set to name the squad at 12:00pm (1100 BST) on Thur
