<TITLE> Rail motormen strike jams Mumbai </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, May 4(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strike over better pay by motormen of Mumbai's famed suburban trains threw city life out of gear on Tuesday, stranding thousands of office goers, college students and businessmen during morning rush hour. The suburban railway is Mumbai's lifeline and ferries more than 6 million commuters during peak hours everyday. The strike started on Monday with motormen going on a fast to demand a pay hike, and had disrupted rail traffic by evening. Most people thought the strike would end overnight, but cancelled trains early Tuesday left commuters fuming, as taxies and autos, the other public transport in the city besides crowded buses, were stretched. Despite the inconvenience to commuters in India's financial hub, stocks, bonds and forex trading was largely unaffected. A railway spokesman said senior railway officials and motormen were in a meeting with the chief minister of the state to resolve the standoff. "I boarded two trains but both were cancelled. I tried catching a rickshaw but was asked to pay 500 rupees. Hence, decided to go home and bunk office," said Nisha Joshi, a civil engineer with a real estate firm in the city's northern suburb of Mulund. Students appearing for exams were a harried lot. Anchal Tiwari was stranded with three of her college mates, all B Ed students appearing for their final examination in the western part of the city. They bundled into an auto rickshaw crawling through the ballooning traffic, desperate to make it to the exam centre. "It was mandatory to come for the teachers and students as exams were scheduled. But now, the big question is, how to go back home? There are no trains," said Pooja Somani, a lecturer at an engineering college at the other end of the city in Navi Mumbai. Mumbai's radio taxi service, Meru Cab, was also affected with disgruntled drivers staying off the roads. It operates around 1,600 cars on a shift basis, of which around 700-800 ply during the day time. "Around 50 percent of the 800 taxis that ply during the day were affected by the strike, while the remaining were not affected," Meru Cab CEO Rajesh Puri told Reuters. "It took me three hours to reach office. None of our clients have come and we are also planning to call it a day," said Ankeet Dave, a consultant with Vitcom Consult
