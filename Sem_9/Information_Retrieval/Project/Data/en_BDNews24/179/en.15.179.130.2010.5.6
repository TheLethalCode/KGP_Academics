 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  RAB have seized large numbers of fake NID cards and unregistered SIM cards from a market in the capital and have arrested three people. A team of Rapid Action Battalion-3 raided two shops in Sundarban market, located at Gulistan on Wednesday night and recovered about 10,000 fake national identity cards, 2,310 SIM cards belonging to different mobile operators, assistant director MD Rajib Al Masud told bdnews24.com. The elite force also seized 12,000 photographs collected for the use in the SIM cards. The arrested are Nur Mohammad Khan, Nazrul Islam Mridha and Mahmudul Hasan Mridha. Masud claimed that the gang had been involved with registering SIM cards and fake ID cards and photographs for a long time. He said they had come to know about the scam whilst calling up the numbers they obtained when investigating crimes. They could not find any similarity between the users of the phones on the one hand and the identities given in the registration papers on the other - a matter which has caused the police great problems to their investigations, the official said. Legal action will be taken against the arrested people, he added. b
