<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi scientists are working to invent new species of climate resilient crops, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said on Wednesday. The minister also said the government is taking initiative to dredge rivers so that farmers can use the surface water for irrigation. Matia was speaking as chief guest at an international workshop titled 'Building a climate resilient agriculture system in Asia' at the capital's BRAC Centre, organised jointly by the Centre for Policy Dialogue and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics. Several private companies have also expressed their interests in dredging the rivers, the minister said. Dredging in the Garai River has already begun, she said. Matia said cultivable lands are decreasing with the rapid growth of population. "Considering this situation, the government is putting stress on invention of climate resilient and fast-growing crops." The country's northern region is affected by arsenic due to excess use of underground water, the minister said and added that farmers now should emphasise on using surface water and rain water. CPD researcher Uttam Deb said that 45 researchers from India, Sri Lanka, China, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh are attending the workshop. Private think-tank CPD's chairman Rehman Sobhan and executive director Mostafizur Rahman, and former adviser to the interim government A M M Shawkat Ali also spoke at the seminar. bd
