 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  A special BDR court in Dhaka on Thursday began the trial of 187 members of the signals sector's located at the border guard's Pilkhana headquarters accused of involvement in the Feb 25-26, 2009 mutiny. The special court-6, set up at the Darbar Hall at the paramilitary force's Pilkhana headquarters, began at around 9 am and ended at around 10:30am. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, adjourned the court until 10am Saturday. At the start of the proceedings, naik subeder Niamat Ullah brought charges against the accused. Among the total accused, 107 are currently in jail while the remaining 80 are on duty at Pilkhana. Gen Islam ordered that all the remaining accused be arrested and produced before the court the next day. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. Special tribunals in Rangamati, Satkhira, Feni, Panchagar and Thakurgaon have already given verdicts previously. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts.
