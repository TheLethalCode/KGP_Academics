 BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- South Africa won through to the second round of the World Twenty20 with a 59-run win as newcomers Afghanistan were bowled out for just 80 at the Kensington Oval. The Afghanistan top order on Wednesday had no answer to fast bowlers Morne Morkel, the man of the match, with four wickets for 20 runs, Dale Steyn (two for six) and Charl Langeveldt (three for 12). But the lowest record score in a Twenty20 international remains the 67 made by Kenya against Ireland in Belfast in 2008. Kenya also hold the corresponding World Twenty20 record of 73, set against New Zealand in Durban in 2007. Afghanistan fast bowler Hamid Hassan, who earlier took an impressive three wickets, took his team's score off 67 by swinging left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe for six. Hassan (22) and fellow tailender Mirwais Ashraf (23) prevented what had looked like a record-breaking rout although South Africa still won with four overs to spare. Afghanistan, who only a few years ago were playing the likes of Jersey and Denmark, had no answer to the pace of South Africa's quicks and collapsed to 12 for five in pursuit of a victory target of 140. But Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan, the former Pakistan pace bowler, was proud of how his side had performed in their first major international tournament. "With each stage they are going a step higher," Khan said. "Today, to restrict a batting line-up like South Africa to 139 is a big achievement so there are all sorts of pluses for them. "They key is they need to be exposed to that pressure again and again and then they'll get used to it. "We were talking about practising for the pace bowlers and on a bowling machine you can put it to 90mph but you can't have Dale Steyn bowling at you and swinging the ball." Meanwhile Morkel was looking forward to bowling again on the Kensington pitch when South Africa begin their Super Eights campaign here on Thursday against New Zealand. "Hitting the deck hard is my strength and I'm preparing for the games ahead as well so it was about doing the basics right. "With the new ball, it's going through quite nicely and it was much quicker than the pitch at St Lucia." South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl added: "The New Zealand team is always a dangerous team in this format and we haven't got a lot of time to prepare. "We have to rest well then hit our straps from the start." Steyn did the initial damage having Noor Ali, who made 50 in Afghanistan's tournament opener against Group C winners India, caught behind for nought with an 88 miles per hour delivery. Mohamammad Shahzad struggled to get bat on ball and, when he did, he too was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher off Steyn. Morne Morkel then accounted for Afghanistan captain Nowroz Manga with his first ball and removed Karim Sadiq with his fourth as the collapse continued under the floodlights. Number eight Samiullah Shenwari became the first Afghan batsman in the innings to make 11 but was then run out after by AB de Villiers's direct hit. Hassan showed defiance by lofting Albie Morkel's first ball for six over long-off and Ashraf struck the seamer for an even bigger six over long-on. Ashraf gave van der Merwe the six treatment before he was bowled by Langeveldt. Earlier, Hassan, red headband and all, was every inch the image of a fiery fast bowler as he took three for 21 in South Africa's total of 139 for seven. Hassan's scalps were all 'proper' batsmen in Jacques Kallis, Boucher and JP Duminy. No batsman made more than Kallis' 34 but if the conditions were helpful to Hassan, they were always likely to be even more favourable to South Africa's pace at
