<TEXT>
 Bridgetown, Barbados, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh lost the plot and imploded horribly after raising the hope of qualifying for the Super Eights of the World Twenty20, chasing 142 against Australia at Kensington Oval on Saturday. The batting combusted in typically dramatic fashion and both Australia, winning the tie easily in the end by 27 runs, and Pakistan, keenly watching the game on TV, went through to the Super Eights. The Tigers crashed and burned from 15 for four inside four overs to 114 all out with batsmen playing rash shots that betrayed a nervous and muddled mindset. No one took ownership of the chase after the innings got off to a disastrous start. Openers Mohammed Ashraful, who had topscored 65 against Pakistan, and Imrul Kayes were out for duck, exposing the middle order too early for their liking. In this game and the one against Pakistan, Bangladesh had their moments but on both occasions, they failed to seize opportunities. They were let down badly by bowling in the previous game and things went awry from the 15th over of Australia's innings, but the batsmen played suicidal shots to bring about the debacle Bangladesh needed to get to the total in 19 or fewer overs to go through the next round, knocking reigning champions Pakistan out of the tournament. If they could get there in under 14.3 overs, Australia will have missed out on the next stage on net run rate. But on a pitch full of pace and bounce, Bangladesh - who've often struggled against fast bowling - collapsed to 15 for four inside overs as they failed to cope with Dirk Nannes and fellow quick Shaun Tait. Left-armer Nannes finished with figures of four for 18 - an Australian Twenty20 international record - but it was Tait who made the breakthrough in the first over, Imrul Kayes caught at mid-on for nought. Mohammad Ashraful also fell for a duck, well caught by a diving Tait at third man off Nannes. Aftab Ahmed and Mahmudullah (both one) also couldn't handle left-armer Nannes's pace. Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim showed some fight and lusty hitting in a 48-run stand but another stunning catch ended their resistance. Out of nowhere, Hussey ran back towards the square leg boundary and to dived scoop a slog-sweep from Shakib to leave the Tigers 63 for five and there was no way back. Bangladesh's chances evaporated with that dismissal, and they hobbled along to 114 before being bowled out in the 19th over. Earlier, Hussey pulled Australia back from the brink with a swashbuckling 47 to put up 141 for 7 in 20 overs, after Bangladesh bowlers were all over them Man of the Match Hussey, who hit four fours and a six in the 29-ball knock, took 17 runs off Mashrafe Mortaza's final over after the Aussies lost half their side inside 11 overs. Steven Smith gave him good support with a fine 27 and Australia recovered thanks to their stand of 74 in seven overs. A superb bowling display from Bangladesh had left Australia reeling at 66 for six before Hussey walked in after their skipper Michael Clarke won the toss and decided to have a bat in the last Group A match. Mashrafe bowled accurately at a lively pace on a fast and bouncy pitch to begin the slide, taking out Shane Watson (4), caught by Aftab Ahmed. They bowlers kept striking blows as David Warner was caught by Aftab off Shakib for 16. Brad Haddin (6) was the next to go, top-edging left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak. The favourites stuttered further when Clarke (16) stepped out of his crease, looking to loft Ashraful over long off but was caught by Jahurul Islam to leave the side on 52/4. Mashrafe then hurried David Hussey, dropped by Jahurul off Ashraful in the 10th over, into a pull shot with a well-directed bouncer and hwicket-keeper had no problem gloving the top-edge. Shakib then fooled Craig White (8) with one on leg and middle that turned away to disturb the furni
