 BANGKOK, May 4 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thai protesters said Tuesday they "welcome" a proposed compromise to end the violent political crisis that has paralyzed central Bangkok for nearly two months, but asked for more details on the plan before ending their protest. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva proposed holding new elections on Nov. 14 in exchange for the Red Shirt protesters dismantling the camp they have set up in the middle of the Thai capital. The Red Shirt leaders met Tuesday to discuss the five-point plan and "unanimously welcomed the reconciliation process," said Veera Musigapong, a protest leader. He did not say, however, when they would evacuate the streets of Bangkok, and other leaders called on the government to clarify some details of the plan, including the election date.

Chavalit Yongchaiyuth, chairman of the opposition Pheu Thai party, praised the prime minister's plan and said he believes the Red Shirt protesters would end their protest Wednesday  Coronation Day, which marks the day revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej was officially crowned.

The protesters, mostly from the rural and urban poor, claim that Abhisit came to power illegitimately in December 2008 with the help of army pressure on legislators.
