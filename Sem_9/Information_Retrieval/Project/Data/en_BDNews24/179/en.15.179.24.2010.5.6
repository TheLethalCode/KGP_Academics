 BANGKOK, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai protesters refused to leave their Bangkok camp on Thursday, waiting for the prime minister to set a firm date for dissolving parliament, but an agreement to end two months of violent protests looked within reach. The "red shirt" protesters have responded positively to Abhisit Vejjajiva's offer of a Nov. 14 election and other proposals to end a crisis in which 27 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded. Asked about the protesters' demand for a specific date for dissolution of parliament, Abhisit told reporters on Thursday it could be calculated based on his proposed election date. Under the constitution, parliament must be dissolved 45 to 60 days before an election. Asked it that meant dissolution would be between Sept. 15 and 30, Abhisit replied: "Yes". That failed to convince the protesters. "The reconciliation plan is very vague and Abhisit's promise is slippery. We have to make sure what we are getting before we declare victory," Weng Tojirakarn, one of their leaders, said from the stage at their barricaded encampment in the heart of Bangkok's commercial district. The stock market was down 1.5 percent at 0330 GMT when trade resumed after a holiday after jumping 4.4 percent on Tuesday in response to Abhisit's five-step peace plan.

Analysts say both sides want to be in power in September for a reshuffle of the powerful military and police forces, and for the passing of the national budget. Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the stage in Bangkok on a wet concrete road following heavy rain in the early hours and surrounded by upmarket shopping malls and luxury hotels, many of which have been shut for weeks, at huge cost to the local economy. However, at least one mall was making tentative plans to reopen, arranging for a clean-up, and the capital's mass transit rail systems said they had returned to normal operating hours. Services have been ending early and some stations have been shut periodically since violence flared last month. A state of emergency has been in force since April 7 and thousands of troops and riot police surround the encampment, out of sight most of the time or lounging around in small groups. TENSION DROPPING Financial markets were shut on Wednesday for Coronation Day and there was no movement on the political front, neither side wanting to be seen as disrespectful to Thailand's revered king. Sukit Udomsirikul, a senior analyst at Siam City Securities, said stocks were bound to slip back on Thursday, especially with world markets under pressure from the euro zone's debt problems. "Yes, protesters have agreed to enter into a reconciliation process but crucially, they're still not leaving the protest site and demand a date for dissolving parliament," Sukit said. "On the whole, tensions are cooling and the chance of another major blow-up should recede now that both sides are talking about reconciliation." The red shirts mostly back former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006, but more broadly they have developed into a movement of the rural and urban poor opposed to the power wielded by the aristocracy, army, business elite and Bangkok middle class. They say Abhisit came to power illegitimately in December 2008 when a pro-Thaksin administration fell after a court case and a new coalition was formed with the prodding of the milit
