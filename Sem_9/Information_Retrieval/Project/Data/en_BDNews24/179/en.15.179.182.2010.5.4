 MUMBAI, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Prosecutors asked an Indian court on Tuesday to sentence to death a Pakistani man found guilty over the 2008 Mumbai attacks after a trial India said sent a message to its rival neighbor Pakistan not to "export terrorism". Mohammad Ajmal Kasab was the only gunman captured alive in the three-day rampage through India's financial capital in November 2008 that killed 166 people at key landmarks, including two luxury hotels, the main train station and a Jewish center.

"The judgment itself is a message to Pakistan that they should not export terrorism to India," Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters on Monday. Kasab was filmed walking through Mumbai's main train station carrying an AK-47 rifle and a knapsack on his back. Nearly 60 people were gunned down in the crowded station. He was one of 10 gunmen who carried out the attacks in Mumbai. All were believed to have received training in Pakistan before traveling to Mumbai by
