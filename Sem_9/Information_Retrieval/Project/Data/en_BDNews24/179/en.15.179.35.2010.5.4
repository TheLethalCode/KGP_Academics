 Mymensingh, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested 23 people including a RAB soldier and three men pretending to be RAB members for attempted robbery at a house in Trisal upazila in Mymensingh on Monday night. In addition, the man whose house the RAB solider and his accomplices are said to have tried to rob has subsequently identified some of the detained men as having been involved in the abduction and murder two years earlier of his son. The men were arrested from Moishartiki village under Dhanikhola Union of Trisal upazila. Babul, an army soldier and also a member of Rapid Action Battalion stationed at Shimultali RAB Training Centre in Gazipur, is said to have been the leader in the robbery. Additional police super of Mymensingh ASM Akhtaruzzaman said that the men led by Babul had gone to the house of Mokabbar Moral at Maishartiki village with two microbuses on Monday night. They are said to have started interrogating the family members about possessing a "magnate" in their house. They then threatened them with "crossfire" unless they hand over the magnate. Family members however were cleverly able to make a call to the Trisal Police Station, who with the help of local people arrested the robbers, the official added. Akhtaruzzaman on Tuesday morning went to the police station and questioned the arrested men. He said that two years earlier some of the same people had come to Mokabbar's house and taken his son Bakul away. Bakul's dead body was recovered after a few days and a case was filed at that time. Mokabbar was able to identify the people who had taken his son from amongst the men detained at the Trisal Police Station, the police officer said. Akhtaruzzaman said, "The murder case will be reactivated and another case will be filed on charges of robbery in the guise of RAB soldiers." bdnews2
