 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) Students at Jagannath University were demonstrating on the campus on Wednesday morning protesting a rise in fees. Thousands of students of 28 departments boycotted classes and exams and joined the procession from 9am. The demonstrators said authorities on Sunday had raised monthly fees, transport and seminar fees by Tk 450. They said they wanted the administration to keep the fees as before. The students also demanded that a proposed new section of the university rules that requires the university to cover certain kinds of expenditure from the university's income should not come into effect. The students are calling on additional government subsidy. University vice-chancellor Mesbah Uddin told bdnews24.com they would consider the matter if the students submit a written application.

Additional policemen have been deployed on the campus to avoid any untoward incident, he added. bd
