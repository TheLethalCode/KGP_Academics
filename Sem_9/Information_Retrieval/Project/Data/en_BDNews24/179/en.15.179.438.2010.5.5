 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) Jagannath University authority has announced that it has agreed to withdraw semester fees after an angry demonstration of the students on Wednesday. At around midday the VC Mezbah Uddin assured the students that the increased fees would be withdrawn - with the students bringing out a joyous procession in the campus after the announcement. The university administration had increased tuition, transport and seminar fees by Tk 450 on May 02. Thousands of students of 28 departments boycotted classes and exams on Wednesday morning and joined the procession from 9am. In the rally, the demonstrators threatened the administration with a tougher movement if they did not agree to their demands. After a procession around the campus the demonstrating students went on a sit in protest in front of the vice-chancellor's office. Some of them threw bricks at the proctor when he went to calm them. The students also demanded that a proposed new section of the university rules that requires the university to cover certain kinds of expenditure from the university's income should not come into effect. The students are calling for the university should be given additional government subsidy. The proposal for amendment to the law has already been sent to the parliamentary standing committee on education affairs, and the committee has said that it will take the required measure, the VC said. bdnews
