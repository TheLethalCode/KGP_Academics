<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Mumbai court sentenced to death Pakistani citizen Mohammad Ajmal Kasab over the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and broke off peace talks between the nuclear-armed neighbouring rivals. The sentencing comes days after a Pakistani-American, who US authorities say trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan, was charged for a failed attempt to bomb New York's Times Square, highlighting the continued threat from militants. Kasab was the only gunman captured alive in the coordinated three-day rampage in November 2008 through key landmarks in Mumbai, including two luxury hotels, the main train station and a Jewish centre. "The facts are so compelling that the death penalty must be imposed. This court has no other option," Judge M.L. Tahilyani pronounced in the special court housed in the maximum-security prison where Kasab is being held. "He shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead." As the judge read out the sentence, Kasab sat with his head down, occasionally wiping his eyes with the back of his palm and then covering his ears with his fingers. Earlier in the day, when proceedings began, Kasab shook his head when the judge offered him a chance to speak. The court on Monday found Kasab guilty on more than 80 charges, including murder and waging war on India. The guilty verdict came shortly after the prime ministers of India and Pakistan held talks in Bhutan and asked officials to take steps to normalise relations between the neighbours, reviving a process that had been stalled by the Mumbai attacks. "We have a far bigger agenda on the table," Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said when asked by Indian television if the trial would hurt the thaw in ties. "We will have to respect each others' judicial processes," he said before the sentencing, but declined to comment further. In India the death penalty is awarded for the "rarest of rare" crimes and is carried out by hanging. The sentence must be confirmed by a higher court. Kasab, 22, has the option to appeal the sentence in superior courts before moving a mercy plea to the president, a process that takes years. The last execution was in 2004. One of 10 Pakistani gunmen who carried out the coordinated attacks, the baby-faced Kasab was filmed walking through Mumbai's main train station carrying an AK-47 rifle and a knapsack on his back. Nearly 60 people were gunned down in the crowded station. The attacks shocked India, with television channels beaming to homes visuals of the siege of two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre. Relatives of victims have demanded an immediate public execution for Kasab to detract similar raids. Twenty Pakistani co-conspirators, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, were also found guilty. Two Indians were acquitted. New Delhi broke off five-year peace talks with Pakistan after the attacks, saying Islamabad had to first act against militants operating from its soil, including the LeT, of which Kasab was convicted of being a member. Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said earlier this week the guilty verdict was a message to Pakistan that they should not export terrorism to India. Pakistan denies involvement and says it is prosecuting seven suspected militants for their role in the attacks. Islamist groups like the LeT, which has been linked to al Qaeda, see India and the United States as foes against whom they must wage a holy war. They also support independence for Kashmir, the Himalayan region claimed in full but controlled in part by both India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two over Kash
