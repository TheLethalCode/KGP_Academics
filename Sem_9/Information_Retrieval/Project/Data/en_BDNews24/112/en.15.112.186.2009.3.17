<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will write to the government to amend the errors in wording in the electoral law passed in parliament, a commissioner has said. "Some mistakes in wording were noticed in the revised Representation of the People Order passed into law by parliament on Feb 24," Sohul Hossain told reporters Tuesday. The new law needs to be amended immediately because the EC will have to notify the political parties to submit their final party constitutions within the scheduled time, he said. As many as 39 parties registered with the EC last October in compliance with the preconditions stipulated in the RPO, Hossain said. "But the political parties submitted temporary party constitutions prior to the polls. They promised to give us the final constitution within six months from the first session of the ninth parliament." He termed the mistakes 'clerical' and referred to some instances such as "Electoral Rolls Ordinance, 2007" which should be "Electoral Rolls Act, 2009" and some misprinted words in "Article 90 G and 90 H under Chapter VI A" of the RPO Act. No 'No Vote' Since there is no provision for "no votes" in the RPO Act, 2009 voters will not be able to cast negative votes in the Apr 2 by-elections, the commissioner said. The voters enjoyed the unprecedented right in the Dec 29 national elections. bd
