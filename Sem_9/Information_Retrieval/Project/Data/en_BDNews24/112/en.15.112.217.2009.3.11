 BUSAN, South Korea Wed Mar 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former North Korean spy, convicted of bombing a commercial jetliner, on Wednesday tearfully told the family of a Japanese woman kidnapped 31 years ago she believed the woman was still alive. Kim Hyon-hui, the former agent who has lived in South Korea since 1990, told the family of former Tokyo waitress Yaeko Taguchi that Taguchi had helped her disguise herself as a Japanese tourist. "She told me quite clearly that my mother ... is still alive, so I have fresh hope for her return," Koichiro Iizuka told a news conference in the southern port city of Busan. "She also said she would be my mother in South Korea, so I am very happy," he said. Iizuka was a toddler when his mother, then a 22-year-old bar waitress, was snatched from her Tokyo home in 1978 and taken to North Korea. He and his older sister have not seen or heard from her since. "You look like her," a weeping Kim told Iizuka in Japanese as she hugged him. "Your mother is alive," she said, without giving any evidence of how she knew. Iizuka was adopted by Taguchi's brother. Kim, wearing a black suit and short cropped hair, met both men for the first time. Such cases have strained relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang since the North abducted several Japanese in the 1970s and '80s, some of them to help train its spies. Tokyo has demanded a full account of each case. North Korea has apologised for the kidnapping of 13 Japanese citizens. Five have been returned but the North says the rest had all died. It has said Taguchi, who had married another abductee, was killed in a car accident in 1986 but has offered no evidence. Kim said Taguchi had helped train her to pass herself off as a Japanese tourist, a disguise she and a male companion used when they planted a bomb on a Seoul-bound Korean Air flight in 1987. All 115 crew and passengers were killed when the plane exploded in mid-air over the Bay of Bengal. Kim and her companion both took poison as they were about to be arrested but she survived. She was later sentenced to death by a Seoul court but received a presidential pardon in 1990. She later won sympathy as someone whom the reclusive North had used as a pawn but then largely dropped out of the public eye after leaving prison. Kim said the North's leaders had ordered the attack on the plane to discourage foreign countries from sending athletes to the 1988 Seoul Olympics. North Korea denies any involve
