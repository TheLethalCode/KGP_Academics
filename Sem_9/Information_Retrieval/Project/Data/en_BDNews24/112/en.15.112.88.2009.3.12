 MUTARE, Zimbabwe, Thu Mar 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean MDC official Roy Bennett was freed from prison on Thursday after the Supreme Court ordered his release on bail and he called for forgiveness and reconciliation in the country. His release after almost a month in jail could ease tension in the power-sharing government of President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai which faces the task of rebuilding the shattered economy. Bennett told reporters in Mutare, 300 km (188 miles) east of the capital Harare, he had forgiven those who had imprisoned him and he called for tolerance and reconciliation.

Their help will be conditional on the implementation of fully democratic government and reforms such as reversing plans for nationalization. Australia said on Wednesday it would provide funding to Zimbabwe's new government, the first Western power to announce direct support to the new administration. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete has called on the international community to help Zimbabwe out of its economic crisis, saying conditions have become too bad to ignore. Kikwete, one of Africa's first leaders to criticize Mugabe, told Reuters in an interview in Tanzania's capital the country had "come a long way" after forming the coalition government of Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.
