 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka launched intense diplomatic efforts a day after Malaysia announced that thousands of ready-to-fly Bangladeshi workers would not be taken now. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Thursday that the foreign secretary had held talks with the Malaysian high commissioner in Dhaka and made a formal request for a review. "Diplomatic efforts are on to resolve the issue," she said. "I don't think the situation has reached a point that should cause panic," Dipu Moni told reporters at the Press Club after attending a seminar on human rights and media. The state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud, speaking later in the day, said Bangladesh had asked the Malaysian government to review the matter "on humanitarian ground". "We expect something positive after the upcoming Malaysian national elections," Mahmud told reporters. Dipu Moni said: "We export human resources to many countries. Some of them return and go again." "The coming and going of overseas workers is a continuous process," she said. The foreign minister said the matter should also be viewed in the context of the global economic crisis. The Malaysian government cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers Wednesday, citing global economic recession. Malaysia is the second largest destination for Bangladeshi workers, with about 450,000 employed there, according to foreign ministry sources.
