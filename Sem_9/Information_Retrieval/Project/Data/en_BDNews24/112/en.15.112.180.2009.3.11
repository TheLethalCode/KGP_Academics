 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  Anxious families who gathered in their hundreds outside the main Peelkhana gate for over a week, waiting to know the fate of their husbands, brothers and sons, were being allowed in to BDR headquarters on Wednesday. Authorities were allowing ten family members to enter at a time from the morning. BDR families said they were being asked to register outside the main entrance. After giving names and addresses, they were given tokens with a serial number. One person per family was being allowed in, they said. The first lot were taken into the Peelkhana compound at around 11.30am, said bdnews24.com photographer Nashirul Islam. They came out about one and a half hours later, said Islam. They were taken in and came out through two separate narrow passages, he added. Rashida, wife of a border guard, emerged with a gloomy face. She said she was allowed to meet her husband on a parade ground. Asked how the meeting went, she did not reply. Thousands of BDR members fled their Peelkhana headquarters in the capital during or after the Feb 25-26 mutiny that left scores of army officers, deputed to the paramilitary force, killed or missing. The border guards started reporting back to the headquarters in their hundreds between Feb 28 and Mar 2 on a government order that issued a deadline. Since then they have been kept inside the headquarters, with anxious relatives waiting outside. They were not allowed any contact until Wednesday. bd
