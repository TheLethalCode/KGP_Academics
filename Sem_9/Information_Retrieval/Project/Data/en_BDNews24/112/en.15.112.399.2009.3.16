 DAMASCUS Mon Mar 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Lebanese embassy opened in Damascus on Monday after international pressure on the Syrian government to establish diplomatic ties and treat its smaller neighbour as a fully sovereign country. The Lebanese flag was raised on the premises in the centre of Damascus and the embassy is now staffed with a charge d'affaires, a Lebanese official said.

A United Nations investigation implicated high-level Syrian security officials in the incident but Syria denies involvement.
