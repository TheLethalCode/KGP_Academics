 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government has tasked commerce minister Faruq Khan to coordinate all investigations into the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the BDR headquarters in the capital. A retired lieutenant colonel, he told reporters Tuesday that he would oversee the probe by the government, army and Criminal Investigation Department of police. Later, speaking on a live TV show, he confirmed the new assignment. The 11-strong government inquiry committee is headed by retired civil servant Anis uz Zaman Khan, who replaced home minister Sahara Khatun on Mar 2. The government named an original 10 -member team on Feb 27, a day after the 33-hour mutiny was quelled. The new committee that began work on Mar. 3 sought more time Sunday to file a report that was due Monday. According to the new deadline, it will continue with its work until March 19. The army launched its own probe into the revolt with Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, a former BDR director general, as its chief. Senior assistant superintendent of police Abdul Kahar Akhand is leading the criminal probe in the sedition case filed by Lalbagh police against over 1000 BDR men. Six of them, including alleged mutiny leader deputy assistant director of BDR Touhidul Islam, were named on Feb. 28. On Mar 7, CID replaced the officer who was overseeing the investigation. Special superintendent Misarul Arif took over from SSP Abdullahhel Baki, apparently because of the latter's controversial links to the 10-truck arms haul
