 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to cancel the Independence Day parade on March 26, in the wake of the BDR massacre, minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Thursday. The LGRD and cooperatives minister made the announcement after a cabinet committee meeting on law and order at the home ministry. "The new situation prompted the government to forego the parade," he said. Ashraful said, "The extra-ordinary meeting dwelt mainly on the BDR issue and we decided to sit again in a few days for detailed discussion on the incident." The minister declined to give further details but said the government expected reports soon of the investigations being undertaken by army, CID and different intelligence agencies. "Only then we'll get to know details of the incident." Ashraful called for responsible journalism. "The media has a responsibility and should not publish or air reports that could further complicate the situation," he said. "The media is free but should be more careful about reporting on delicate issues." Home minister Sahara Khatun chaired the meeting attended among others by law minister Shafiq Ahmed, information minister Abul Kalam Azad, communications minister Raziuddin Razu, senior civil servants and military officers. bdne
