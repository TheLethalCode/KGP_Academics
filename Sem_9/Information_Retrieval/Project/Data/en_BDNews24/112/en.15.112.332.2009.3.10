 DURBAN, March 9 (bdnews24.com)- Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers gave South Africa a chance of saving the second Test in Durban with an unbeaten 164-run partnership on day four. At stumps, Kallis was unbeaten on 84 and De Villiers on 68 as the hosts reached 244-2, still 302 short of the 546 needed to square the series. Australia lost Marcus North (0) and Phillip Hughes (160) before declaring after just 7.4 overs of play. The Proteas lost openers Neil McKenzie (31) and Hashim Amla (43) in reply. South Africa require a win to have a chance of winning the three-match series, which Australia lead 1-0 after victory in Johannesburg. Hughes, who on Sunday became the youngest player in history to score two centuries in the same Test, added 24 runs off 22 balls to his overnight tally before he fell to Makhaya Ntini. Amla, standing in for his injured skipper Graeme Smith at the top of the order, and McKenzie got the hosts off to a solid start before seamer Peter Siddle struck twice. First he had McKenzie caught by keeper Brad Haddin before he had Amla caught by Ricky Ponting at second slip as the visitors threatened to tear through the top order. Kallis was dropped first ball by North at slip off Siddle as he prodded at a delivery outside off stump, before he and De Villiers dug in. Both played some attacking strokes, but it was mainly a study in concentration as Kallis survived 161 deliveries and De Villiers 166. Kallis passed Graeme Pollock as South Africa's highest run-scorer in Tests against Australia in the final session and survived a tricky spell from part-time spinner Simon Katich before the close. Earlier, Hughes belted Ntini's first ball of the day through extra cover for four and was soon smashing Dale Steyn back over his head for six to raise his 150 after six hours and 312 deliveries at the crease. The left-hander stepped away and slashed once too often, though, slicing a catch to third man off Ntini to be dismissed for 160 in the seventh over of the day. While Australia are still big favourites to go 2-0 up in the series, they may have to make do with a skeleton pace attack on the final day. Siddle left the field with an injury prior to tea and returned with his foot restrapped. The Victorian missed the majority of the limited-overs series in Australia with a stress reaction. Meanwhile Mitchell Johnson, chief destroyer of South Africa in Johannesburg, clutched at his left hamstring after chasing down a ball in the outfield before tea. Courtesy : BB
