<TITLE> Gayle 'overjoyed' at Windies series triumph </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PORT OF SPAIN, March 11 (bdnews 24.com/Reuters) - It has been five years since West Indies captain Chris Gayle tasted success in a test series and after a dramatic draw against England in the final test on Tuesday, Gayle was unusually effusive. "I'm really happy, overjoyed. You just have to enjoy the moment," he said after the hosts secured a 1-0 series win. "These things don't come around often and I just want to thank each and every player for their efforts and the character they have shown. "I'm really happy not just for the team but also the people overseas. I'm sure they are jumping for joy. To win the series is great. I just want to ...enjoy the night, and move onto better things." Gayle played his part in West Indies' battle for survival on the final day as he shared a crucial partnership with Denesh Ramdin in the 114 for eight second innings. The skipper was suffering from a hamstring strain he picked up when completed his first innings hundred but batted with a runner, making just four but, more importantly, facing 42 balls. "The hamstring was hurting but it was bearable pain and as you saw I was doing a lot of stretching to try and reach the ball," he said. "But I knew I could bear it so it wasn't too much for me." It was a nervy final two hours for the home as they surely sensed their 1-0 lead in the series, gained by a first test win in Kingston, could slip from their grasp in the final overs of the five-test series. "I had a lot of confidence in the guys but it was pretty tense. Batting in those situations is never easy but I was confident," Gayle said. "We had a bit of a scare, but we had capable batsman like Denesh Ramdin and we know Fidel Edwards has been in this situation before." The last time West Indies beat England, in 1998, Gayle was a 20-year-old just beginning his career, which has unfortunately coincided with a decade of decline for the team. But under his captaincy, West Indies have developed a tougher approach to the game and a more competitive team spirit. "We know each other well and everyone has an understanding of what is required of them rather than someone reminding them how to go about situations," said Gayle. "We have gelled, something we wanted was not to chop and change too much and we have a settled side and it was been really good. The guys have put in the hard work and it has paid off
