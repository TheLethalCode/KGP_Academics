 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  The 89th birth anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and National Children's Day was being observed Tuesday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid flowers at Sheikh Mujib's portrait at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at Dhanmondi Road 32. She also addressed a programme at Osmani Memorial Auditorium marking the day. Hasina urged all to reach a consensus on protecting child rights. "Let's dedicate our present for the furtherance of future generations," she said, addressing an audience of children and adults. Addressing the children, she said, "I'm dedicating my present days to ensure that you all may live loftily, raising your heads high." Calling upon the affluent in society to stand beside helpless and neglected children, the prime minister said, "We must do our best to ensure a better future for our children so that they are able to laugh and stand upright as worthy global citizens." Bangladesh Children's Academy was arranging a gathering at Gonobhaban in the afternoon that includes discussions on the independence leader's life and ideals and a cultural show. Bangladesh Television will broadcast a new monthly children's programme Amader Kotha at 8:30pm to mark the day. The prime minister is scheduled to be the first guest on the show to talk with children in the audience. The Awami League and its associate organisations earlier chalked out a host of programmes to mark Mujib's birth anniversary, including discussions and milads . Friend of Bengal Mujib was born in 1920 in Tungipara, Gopalganj. Involved in politics as a student, Mujib later rose in East Pakistani politics and within the ranks of Awami League as a charismatic leader. An advocate of socialism, Mujib became popular for his leadership against the discrimination of Bengalis in Pakistan and became a fierce opponent of the military rule of Ayub Khan. He outlined a six-point charter of demands for the autonomy of East Pakistan in 1966, which was viewed as separatism by West Pakistan. Despite leading his party to a major victory in the 1970 elections, Mujib was not invited to form the government. After talks broke down with West Pakistan Mujib finally called for independence in his historic March 7, 1971 address. But he spent the war in a West Pakistan jail. Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal) returned as a hero to an independent Bangladesh on January 10, 1972 and eventually took office as prime minister. He was assassinated in 1975 along with family members in a military coup. From 1996-2000, the Awami League government observed the birthday of the father of nation as National Children's Day. bdnews24.co
