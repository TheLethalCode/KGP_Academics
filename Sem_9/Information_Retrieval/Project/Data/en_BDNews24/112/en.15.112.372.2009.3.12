<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews4.com)  Left arm spinner Abdur Razzak was set to return to international cricket after the ICC cleared his suspect bowling action, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said in a statement on Thursday. Razzak underwent a reassessment test at the Australian Institute of Sports on Feb 23. The 26-year-old was suspended by the ICC in November after an independent analysis of his bowling action revealed that it exceeded the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under regulations. BCB cricket operations chairman Enayet Hossain Siraj said on Wednesday that "a positive result" was expected "in a couple of days". "(We will wait) until ICC let us know," said Siraj. "However, we came to know from a source that he now has no problem with his bowling action." bdne
