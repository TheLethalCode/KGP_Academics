<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com) - Law minister Shafiq Ahmed said Monday comments on who were involved in the BDR mutiny before a full-scale probe report was available would be premature. "The government is investigating whether any extremist organisation is operating under the banner of the religious political parties," the minister told reporters. "It will not be proper to accuse anybody until a full investigation report is available. On conclusion of the investigation, the names of persons involved will be made public," he said. Earlier on the same day, commerce minister Faruq Khan, tasked with coordinating the various mutiny probes, commented that some people with links to the BDR mutiny "in order to save themselves" were trying to protect those who were directly involved in the killings. Last week, Faruq, a former army officer, said evidence had been found tying the banned Islamist outfit Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh to the Feb 25-26 massacre at the BDR headquarters. Pressed by reporters on Monday to give more details, he said: "It won't be right to disclose anything now. The investigation is ongoing." Meanwhile, prime minister Sheikh Hasina was quoted by her press secretary, after a cabinet meeting Monday, as giving directives to law-enforcing agencies "to remain alert against militant organisations and activities". The cabinet also sent back a home ministry report on militant organisations and activities in Bangladesh, asking for a more detailed account. BJSA want judiciary bill passed The law minister was speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Bangladesh Judicial Services Association. The association leaders asked the minister to help pass the judiciary separation bill tabled in the parliament without changing any clause therein. Shafiq said, "The government will take steps to keep the objective of the bill unchanged." Asked whether executive magistrates were being given any judicial or special powers, he replied, "Some kind of power has been mentioned in the bill on separation of the judiciary. The Supreme Court is scrutinising that." bdnews24.
