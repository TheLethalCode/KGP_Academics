 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of anxious families of BDR men continued attempts, in vain, to contact or discover the fates of their loved ones at the Peelkhana compound's main gate on Tuesday. "I couldn't even manage to get a message to my cousin, Anwar Hossain, that his father died," Shahjahan Kabir told bdnews24.com. Sixty-five year-old Mofiz fell ill when he lost contact with his son, as the BDR mutiny erupted on Feb.25-26, said the old man's nephew. "He passed away last night." "Since then I have been trying to give the message to Anwar but nobody at the BDR gate heeded me," said Shajahan. "I even don't know if my cousin is alive or not." "My close relatives have been pressing me to inform him of his father's death as his family is waiting to bury him," he said. Anwar Hossain, from Mangalsind village in Atpara Upazila, Netrokona, is posted with Rifles Battalion 12. Dozens of others burst into tears as they told their tales. Rumana Sharmin, wife of Sepoy Shariful, said, "My three year-old daughter Nusrat cried nonstop for days and forced me to come here as she thought she would be able to see her father at the gate." "But it didn't happen," said Sharmin in a breaking voice. Others who narrated their plight included: Monzer Ali, father of Sepoy Mirajul Islam; Sepoy Sohel Rana's father Nabab Ali; Abu Zafar brother of BDR cook Golam Rasul; Sepoy Zahurul Islam's wife Maksuda Akhter; and Ibrahim, brother-in-law of BDR canteen-man Al-Amin Hawlader. All complained bitterly that they were unable to contact their relatives serving with the border force. Monzer Ali said, "Media reports on our situation have failed to draw the attention of the government, which is busy with the army only." bdnew
