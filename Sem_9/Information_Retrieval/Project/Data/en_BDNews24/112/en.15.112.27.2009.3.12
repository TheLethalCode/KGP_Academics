The AFC chief, accompanied by 12 delegates who flew in by a chartered jet plane, is scheduled to meet officials of the newly-elected committee led by Kazi Salahuddin before leaving on Friday morning. It is a courtesy visit for Hammam, who visited Bangladesh last year to unveil the foundation stone of the artificial football turf adjacent to BFF House under the FIFA Goal Project-2. On arrival, Hammam said that Bangladesh football was growing very fast as the new administration was taking necessary steps to take the game forward. The AFC supremo also assured that the football governing body of Asia would increase its assistance to Bangladesh day-by-day.
