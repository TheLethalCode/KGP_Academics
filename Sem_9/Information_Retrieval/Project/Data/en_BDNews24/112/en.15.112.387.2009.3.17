 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP standing committee was meeting Tuesday to decide the fate of member Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky, embroiled in controversy centring on his son's allegation against party chairperson Khaleda Zia. The meeting, chaired by Khaleda at her Gulshan office, began just after 7pm, BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Tanbir has insisted again that the charge his son made against the chairperson was false and baseless. He told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "I am upset. Such a statement tarnished the party's image. I condemned the statement." In a press conference on Mar 9, in the presence of his father, Irad Ahmed Siddiky alleged that BNP chief Khaleda Zia had sought Tk 5 crore from him in return for the Dhaka mayoral ticket from the party. Irad called incumbent mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, and former mayors BNP's Mirza Abbas and AL's Mohammad Hanif "all corrupt", who "failed to deliver". He also called the BNP chairperson's adviser, ASM Hannan Shah, the "'bastard' child of democracy". He said none among Khoka, Abbas, Hannan and former FBCCI chief Abdul Awal Mintoolikely BNP picks for the mayor racewas acceptable. Hannan Shah last Sunday filed a Tk 50 crore defamation suit against Irad. The allegations also sparked grievances among party leaders and activists, who have demanded Tanbir's expulsion. Party supporters have also burnt effigies of Tanbir and Irad in demonstrations. The standing committee in a meeting on Mar 10 gave Tanbir 72 hours to explain why any action should not be taken against him, in line with the party constitution, for breaching discipline. Tanbir replied to the show cause notice last Friday that will be placed in Tuesday's meeting, said BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan. "I explained all in my written statement," Tanbir told bdnews24.com. b
