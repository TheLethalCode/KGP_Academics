<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona, Ecuador's most popular club, managed their first win of the season and their first under former Real Madrid coach Benito Floro when they thrashed Liga de Portoviejo 5-0. Peruvian side Alianza Atletico had three players sent off in a 3-0 defeat at Sport Huancayo and Atletico Nacional picked up their first points of the year in a 1-0 win over Millonarios in a meeting of two previously powerful but now struggling Colombian clubs. ECUADOR Barcelona, who have a record 13 Ecuadorean titles, won their first game of the year at the sixth attempt by thrashing Liga de Portoviejo. Narciso Mina scored twice while Pablo Palacios, Fernando Hidalgo and Giovanny Nazareno shared the other goals for the Guayaquil-based team. Barcelona's last title was in 1997 and recently they have made a habit of spending lavishly without success. Floro, who has also coached Albacete, Sporting Gijon, Villarreal and Real Mallorca, became the latest to try and stop the rot when he was hired in December. Titleholders Deportivo Quito, whose players went on strike last month over unpaid wages, managed only their second win when they beat Espoli 2-1 with former Colombia striker Leider Precido notching the winner. Despite the defeat, Espoli, who are owned by the police force, stayed top. PERU Alianza Atletico finished with eight men as they lost 3-0 to Sport Huancayo who scored their goals, including two penalties, in the last 20 minutes. Augusto Valdiviezo was first to go in the 40th minute and was followed by Marcio Valverde for fighting and goalkeeper Hector Lozano for a foul which led to a penalty and Huancayo's third goal in the 87th minute. Raul Aleman and Blas Lopez converted the penalties and Omar Ramirez scored the other goal for promoted Huancayo. COLOMBIA Atletico Nacional, who lost their first five games in the Apertura championship, gave new coach Luis Fernando Suarez his first win as they beat Millonarios with a header from defender Humberto Mendoza. Millonarios have four points from six games. Atletico Junior lost their unbeaten record when they went down 2-1 at Deportivo Cali after having Roger Cambindo sent off after only four minutes for punching an opponent. Sergio Herrera scored Cali's winner from a 66th minute penalty. The hosts had Deigo Valdes dismissed in injury-time. URUGUAY The 2008/09 championship re-started at the weekend after a third interruption of the season with Defensor Sporting's 0-0 draw at Liverpool sending them top of the second stage. Defensor had Walter Ibanez dismissed in the 66th minute while Gustavo Varela and Nicolas Correa were sent off for Liverpool in the last two minutes. The tournament was halted in November by a crowd riot, in December because of worries over security arrangements for a match at Danubio and last week because of a players' strike which ended on Friday. CHILE Esteban Paredes took his tally to 11 goals in seven games after scoring twice in Santiago Morning's 2-2 draw at Municipal Iquique. Argentine striker Ruben Dario Gigena scored a hat-trick in Audax Italiano's 4-1 win at Curico while Union Espanola stayed top of the Apertura championship with a 2-1 win over Palestino. BOLIVIA Striker Jaime Cardozo scored a hat-trick in the last 20 minutes to help defending champions Aurora to a 4-1 win over San Jose. Cristian Diaz gave San Jose an early lead and Paraguayan Derlis Paredes equalised with a 57th minute penalty. Nacional Potosi stayed top of the Apertura championship after Argentine Maximo Andrada scored in injury-time to give them a 2-2 draw with Bolivar, PARAGUAY Cerro Porteno maintained their 100 percent record in the Apertura championship in emphatic style by beating 2 de Mayo 4-0 in their fourth game. David Mendoza and Cesar Ramirez scored in the first half before Jorge Britez and Javier Villarreal added two more after the break. Libertad, champions four times in a row, fell five points behind Cerro after being held 1-1 by Nacional, who equalised with a Fabio Escobar goal in the 83rd minute after Juan Samudio had opened the scoring with a first-half penalty
