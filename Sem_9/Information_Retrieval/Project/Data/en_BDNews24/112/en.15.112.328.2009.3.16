 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called on law enforcement agencies to be alert for militant activities across the country. "She urged the public to be alert too," said the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad after a cabinet meeting on Monday. "Different militant groups and their activities were discussed during the meeting," he told reporters. The cabinet sent back a home ministry report on militant organisations and activities in Bangladesh, asking for a more detailed account. "Militancy is not new in Bangladesh, but the prime minister asked everyone to be alert at this time," said Azad. The meeting also decided to form a task force, that will convene from Mar 24, to devise Bangladesh's response to the global recession finance minister AMA Muhith told reporters later in the day. "The task force with up to 29 members will advise the government on ways to protect the country from the crisis," said Muhith. Its members will include representatives from the major parties, including the main opposition BNP, economists, specialists and businessmen, he said. The cabinet also approved an amendment to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act 2003. The amendment to the law specifies the academic qualifications required to be the chairman or member of the Commission, said Azad. bdnews24
