 BELFAST, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish and British politicians vowed on Tuesday to defend the peace process between Northern Ireland's Protestants and Catholics after attacks on security forces by republican dissidents threatened a return to conflict. The Continuity IRA killed a policeman on Monday two days after another splinter group shot dead two British soldiers at an army base, in attacks that raised fears of a backlash from pro-British loyalists. "These people, a small group of evil people, have the capacity to kill and to maim," said Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin at a news conference with British ministers. "What they don't have is the capacity to undermine the advances that we've made in society on the island of Ireland." A 1998 power-sharing agreement has brought relative calm to Northern Ireland after 30 years of bloodshed between minority Irish Republican Catholics and pro-British Protestants. The Continuity IRA and the Real IRA, which claimed Saturday's attack, oppose the peace settlement and have pledged to keep up their fight until British rule is overthrown and Ireland united. They do not have widespread support within the province's Catholic community, with a membership in the low hundreds. But their actions have the potential to fuel tit-for-tat violence. "That has to be a worry that there will be a reaction from loyalist paramilitaries who have more or less gone off the pitch," Ireland's Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said. Two men, aged 17 and 37, were arrested in connection with the policeman's killing, police said on Tuesday. A number of garbage bins were later set alight in the town of Craigavon where the shooting happened, police said. SINN FEIN Stephen Carroll, 48, who was shot on Monday, was the first policeman killed in Northern Ireland since 1998, when the IRA along with pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups agreed to cease hostilities. By then, the sectarian violence known as the Troubles had killed more than 3,600 people in 30 years. Sinn Fein, an ally of the IRA, now shares power in Belfast with its former foe, the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, a senior IRA commander in the 1970s, described the killers in Monday night's attack as "traitors." Analysts said the test of Sinn Fein's intentions was whether it followed up its pronouncements with action, including passing information to the police, a taboo practice during the Troubles when Republicans viewed the police as a partisan extension of British rule. The province's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, was disbanded and relaunched as the Police Service of Northern Ireland in 2001 in an attempt to provide a more impartial force with support from Protestants and Catholics. "The test is whether or not in private information is being given," said Richard English, a professor of politics at Queens University in Belfast. "It's clear that the people who carried out these killings are not killing for the first time." English said he suspected the Continuity IRA killed Carroll to capitalize on publicity from the Real IRA attack on Saturday. "Even if they are not coordinating attacks they can benefit from each other's violence. That makes it a double threat although still a very small threat.
