<TITLE> South Korea tells North to pay for blockade costs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea told North Korea on Monday it would have to foot the bill for losses from blocking access to a factory park just inside the communist state, a move likely to add to tension on the divided peninsula. In the past week, the North has blocked movement across the heavily defended border to an industrial park run by South Korean companies using cheap North Korean labour, whose salaries they pay directly to the Pyongyang government. "It is very regretful that North Korea imposed an access restriction and a blockade. Our government is making it clear now that responsibility for all incidents, including lost output and economic losses of our companies caused by the restriction and blockade are on North Korea," Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Ho-nyeon said in a statement. The comments follow increasingly acrimonious rhetoric from the North against the conservative government in the wealthy South and put in doubt the one major economic cooperation between the two Koreas. "If free transfers of our staff and goods transportation are not guaranteed in the future, we cannot expect steady development in the Kaesong industrial park," Kim said. "RECKLESS MOVES" Pyongyang's decision to restrict access to the industrial zone follows months of angry verbal volleys against South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who last year ended a decade of no-questions-asked aid to the impoverished North. That anger intensified last week when South Korea and the United States started a series of routine annual military drills. "The reckless moves of the Lee group to do harm to fellow countrymen by force of arms have created such (a) dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula that any accident may trigger off a new war," the North's KCNA news agency said. Earlier, North Korea said it would allow hundreds of South Koreans stranded in the Kaesong industrial park to return home, but showed no signs of lifting a blockade on the joint project. North Korea restricted access to the complex of 101 South Korean firms on Friday, just days after cutting off a military hotline usually used to process daily passage to Kaesong park which is about 70 km (50 miles) north of Seoul. The industrial zone is still functioning, but at a minimum level. The Unification Ministry said a North Korean military official had served notice that 453 people would be allowed to return to the South from Kaesong. Those returning include 233 who were stranded since Friday and nearly 200 stuck since Saturday. North Korea had so far not issued permission to more than 600 people from the South waiting to enter the zone, Lee said. An expert on the North at Dongguk University, Kim Yong-hyun, was quoted as saying that the workers in Kaesong were "hostages", accusing North Korea of using the project as collateral to serve its political purposes. The complex of South Korean firms at Kaesong was opened in 2004 and employs 38,000 low-wage North Koreans. It churns out light-industrial goods such as pots, watches and clothing. Its closure would cut off one of the North's few sources of foreign currency. An apparel maker with a factory in Kaesong was quoted by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper as saying that one of its buyers had expressed serious concern about getting deliveries on time and that future contracts may be in jeopardy. The border shut-down came as the North has escalated tensions on the Korean peninsula with its plan to launch a satellite in early April, which US and South Korean officials believe is a disguised test of its longest-range Taepodong-2 missile that could reach the United States. Regional powers have warned that a launch would violate a Security Council resolution adopted in 2006 in response to an earlier missile test by the North. That year, the North also tested a nuclear device. Pyongyang says the launch is part of its peaceful space programme. In a reminder of the decades of enmity between the two Koreas, the South conducted a civil defence drill to test readiness against a chemical, biological and nuclear attack, bringing traffic in the centre of the capital to a stop. South Korean and US forces will also conduct live-fire exercises near the border with the North on Monday as part of their military dr
