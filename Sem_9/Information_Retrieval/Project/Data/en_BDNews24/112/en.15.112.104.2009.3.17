 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's home series against Pakistan and other teams at the moment have been cancelled on security grounds, the sports minister says. "After the Pilkhana events, our national security is not yet full-proof. In these circumstances, it is not possible to invite any foreign team," Ahad Ali Sarker told reporters at his home Tuesday night. "That's why the tour of Pakistan team has been suspended for now," Sarker added. The government postponed the series between Bangladesh and Pakistan on March 5, two days before the Pakistanis were scheduled to arrive for a five one-day international and two Twenty20 matches. The bloody BDR mutiny in late Feb and the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore are believed to have influenced the decision to postpone the series.
