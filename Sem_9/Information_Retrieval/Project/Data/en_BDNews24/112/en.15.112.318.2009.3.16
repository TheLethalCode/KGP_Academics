 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)Garment manufacturers and exporters have presented the government with a proposed eight-point incentives package for the industry to meet the "unprecedented" challenges of the global recession. "Our recommendations include incentives to the tune of 10 percent of consignment prices and lowering interest rates," said newly elected BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi on Monday. Other recommendations include scrapping all VAT levied on the RMG industry and lowering handling charges at the port. Also, in view of the present power crisis, the industry leaders asked the government to provide the RMG factories diesel at subsidised rates. Morshedi presented the recommendations at a press conference at the BGMEA office in Karwan Bazaar. "Bangladesh's garment manufacturers are facing threats and challenges in this global recession that are unprecedented in the industry's three decade history," said Murshedi. Export orders went down by 4.98 percent in January this year compared with 2008. In February they fell 17.58 percent. March is likely to see a more drastic reduction if the trend continues, he added. At the same time, the price of Bangladeshi readymade garments has gone down by 20 percent, Murshedi said. "The overall picture is quite grim." "Under the circumstances, BGMEA is laying before the government an 'assistance package' to provide the RMG industry owners with some relief." Murshedi also urged the government to facilitate special emergency measures to set up 12 zonal captive power plants hand-in-hand with the private sector, expressing BGMEA's eagerness to cooperate with the government in this effort. Other recommendations include implementing a proposed rationing programme for RMG workers without delay and rescheduling repayments of bank loans taken by the sector since October 2008. Those manufacturers stuck with 'stock lots' due to the global recession have to be afforded special benefits. Former BGMEA president Tipu Munshi MP, BGMEA vice president Nasiruddin Chowdhury and others also spoke at the briefing. bdn
