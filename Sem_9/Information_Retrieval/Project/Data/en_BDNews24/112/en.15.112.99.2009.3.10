<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The policymakers of the main opposition BNP started a meeting at 7:40pm Tuesday, a day after the son of a senior leader said party chief Khaleda Zia had asked for money to give him ticket for Dhaka mayor election. Khaleda rushed the meeting of the National Standing Committee, member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday morning. He added he did not know of the agenda. Another member Chowdhury Tanbir Ahmed Siddiky was absent from the meeting. He said at a press briefing earlier in the day Khaleda never sought money from his Chowdhury Irad Ahmed Siddiky. "What my son said was false," Tanbir said he said at a press briefing at Gulshan home. Irad at a media briefing Monday alleged that "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia demanded Tk 5 crore". Some angry supporters of BNP and its associate organisations burned effigies of the two outside the chairperson's political office in Gulshan at around 7pm. The 11-strong committee also includes M Saifur Rahman, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Abul Matin Chowdhury, A R Gani, Moudud Ahmed, Mahbubuddin Ahmed, Mahbubur Rahman and M Shamsul Islam
