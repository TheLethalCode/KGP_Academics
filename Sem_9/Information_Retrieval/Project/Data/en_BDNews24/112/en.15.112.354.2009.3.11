<TITLE> Razzak set to return to int'l cricket </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak is likely to return to international cricket after being cleared of his suspect bowling action, an unconfirmed source said on Wednesday. It is understood that the International Cricket Council has yet to tell the Bangladesh Cricket Board officially about the decision. Razzak underwent a reassessment test at the Australian Institute of Sports on February 23 to correct his bowling action. The 26-year-old was suspended by the ICC in November after an independent analysis of his bowling action revealed that it exceeded the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted under regulations. BCB cricket operations chairman Enayet Hossain Siraj said, "We hope to get a positive result on Razzak in a couple of days. "I am not sure whether Razzak has been cleared until ICC let us know," said Siraj. "However, we came to know from an unconfirmed source that he now has no problem with his bowling action." bdnew
