 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) - Holders Abahani consolidated their lead in the Premier Division Cricket League with a convincing 38-run win over Bangladesh Biman in the final match of the first leg at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday. Mohammedan Sporting Club also confirmed their super league berth after handing a massive 174-run defeat to star-studded Gazi Tank Cricketers at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Despite losing to Mohammedan, Gazi Tank were also thrown to the six-team super league along with Abahani, Surjo Tarun, Biman, Mohammedan and Partex. Abahani have 20 points from 11 outings, four points clear of Biman and Surjo Tarun. Mohammedan secured 13 points, followed by Partex and Gazi Tank on identical 12. Abahani vs Biman Electing to bat first, title contenders Abahani posted a challenging 269-7 in 50 overs, thanks to fifties from opener Tamim Iqbal and two-down Reshmi Ranjan. Tamim and Ranjan took Abahani to 155-3 from 74-2 in 34 overs before the left-handed opener, Tamim, fell to left-arm spinner Nabil Samad for 66 off 98 balls featuring five fours and one six. Ranjan and Nasir Hossain then added another 55 runs for the fourth wicket before the latter gave a catch to Javed Omar off Shahadat Hossain for a 27-ball 25, leaving the side at 210-4. Ranjan also fell to Shahadat for an attacking 79 that saw 10 boundaries in 73 balls. Captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza then made a 10-ball 16. Biman, in reply, were 231 all out with four overs to go, despite a weakened attack of Abahani, who saw its three pace bowlers miss the game due to different ailments. The national flag carrier got off to a fine 52-run opening start between Nazmus Sadat and Jahirul Islam before Nasir removed Sadat for 24. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who opted to bowl in medium pace due to back pain, then dismissed Javed Omar for 13, but Niaz and Jahirul put up a fightback to take Biman to 167-3 in 33 overs before being separated. Arafat Sunny bowled Niaz for 37, triggering a collapse in the middle and Biman were reduced to 175-6 in 36.2 overs before Mashrafee wrapped tail removing Shahajada and Mahbubul Alam Robin. However, Sajjad Kadir and Shahadat raised some hopes putting on 24 and 23 respectively, but their efforts were not enough to cross the hurdle of Abahani. Mashrafee grabbed three for 45 while Nasir took two for 23. MSC vs Gazi Tank Mohammedan bundled Gazi Tank out for 53 in 19.5 overs after making a modest 227-9 in 50 overs. Pacers Tareq Aziz, Sajidul Islam and spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo claimed three scalps each as no Gazi Tank batsman could reach double digits as the highest 13 came from extras. Opener Sanath Jayasuryia gave a fine 27-ball 31 start to Mohammedan, who needed a victory against Gazi Tank to qualify for the super league, before being trapped leg before by Rubel Hossain, leaving the side at 39-1 in 7.1 overs. Opener Nadimuddin Mintu, who continued to assault the bowlers, saw Shamsur Rahman Shuvo (3) and Farhad Hossain (3) also fell to Rubel for cheaply. Nadimuddin was removed by Mohammad Ashraful for 65, leaving the side at 140-4 in 33.3 overs, but middle-order batsmen Roqibul Hasan (27) Marshal Ayub (33), Faisal Hossain (33) and Suhrawardi (22 not out) put some runs on the board to take Mohammedan beyond the 200-run mark. bd
