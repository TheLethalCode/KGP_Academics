 NEW DELHI, Mon Mar 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is pressing ahead with a trading scheme centred on energy efficient certificates that could possibly expand to renewable energy, the country's climate change envoy said on Monday. The plan involves creating a market-based mechanism that would allow businesses using more energy than stipulated to compensate by buying energy certificates from those using up less energy or using renewable energy. The government is setting up energy benchmarks for each industry sector. Those companies that do not meet the benchmarks would have to buy these certificates under a reward and penalty system. "We hope that this may perhaps even be linked with the concept of renewable energy certificates," Shyam Saran told a business meeting in New Delhi. "And if this link could be established we will probably have a very fast growing market in energy efficiency, renewable energy certificates in this country. And that would be a very major innovation." Energy efficiency is among eight areas that India identified in its national climate change policy last year. It hopes to reduce energy consumption by at least 25 percent in energy-intensive sectors such as power and cement. No timeline is prescribed for reaching the target. Most firms in India, which is Asia's third-largest economy and the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, have yet to plan for the impact of climate change and do not measure emissions or have deadlines to curb them, according to studies. India's top firms also face little stakeholder pressure to combat climate change with only about 40 percent of the companies setting voluntary carbon emissions reduction goals, according to a survey of CEOs by KPMG consultants last year. Experts say Indian firms' response to climate issues is driven largely by the need to comply with expected regulations, while leaving the leadership role in tackling global warming to the government. Saran hoped a domestic trading system would draw upon the market mechanism to further encourage energy efficiency. India says it wants to save 10,000 Megawatts by the end of the 2012 through energy efficiency measures. "We are looking at trading mechanisms so if you are more efficient you get a certain credit, if you are less efficient you have to buy it," Saran said. India, whose economy has grown by 8-9 percent annually in recent years, contributes around 4 percent of mankind's global greenhouse gas emissions, but says its levels will never go beyond those of developed countries. The country faces an election in a few weeks, and though climate change is not a poll issue, many fear policy announcements such as energy efficiency trading schemes could get delayed until a new government is in
