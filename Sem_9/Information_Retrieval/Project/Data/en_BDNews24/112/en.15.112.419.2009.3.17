<TITLE> India's Dravid eyes rare test win in New Zealand </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Rahul Dravid has tasted test success in every test-playing nation except New Zealand and the veteran batsman is determined to end that barren run in the upcoming series. The 36-year-old is one of eight batsmen to score over 10,000 test runs and has notched centuries in every test-playing nation. India, routed in both tests on their previous tour in 2002, have not won a test in New Zealand since 1976. "I have played in a test match win everywhere in the world -- except in New Zealand," Dravid told Mumbai tabloid Mid Day on Tuesday. "So to win a test match and the series will be great." The first test in the three-match series starts in Hamilton on Wednesday. India completed their first one-day series win on New Zealand soil 3-1 last week. "I will try and make a good contribution to the team and if we can win the series -- (there's) nothing like it!" said Dravid. Dravid is among the golden generation of seniors led by Sachin Tendulkar who have been dubbed the "Fab Five." Saurav Ganguly and Anil Kumble have retired, and batsman Vangipurappu Laxman is the youngest at 34. One short of equalling Australian Mark Waugh's test record 181 test catches, Dravid scored a century in each innings in the drawn third test on his first tour of New Zealand in January 1999. He had been under pressure due to a run of poor form recently but managed to rescue his career with a chanceless century in the final test of a two-match series against England last December
