<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Citycell Super Cup gets underway Wednesday at Bangabandhu National Stadium as the top brains bet on a Tk 1 crore winners' purse in desperation to revive the dying game. The players who have showcasing the trade for last seven months will look to raise their stakes in the much-hyped tournament ahead of the next season's transfer window that opens in August. Abahani manager Satyajit Das Rupu, Brothers Union coach Wasim Iqbal and Sheikh Russel coach Wazed Gazi believe this gives the players another stage to prove themselves. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq however disagrees. "It seems most players are quite excited about the Super Cup and there is a good possibility that they will play negatively on the pitch just to make sure they are in the last four," he said. Rupu said most of the club officials are decided about which players to buy or release after the Federation Cup and the B. League. Now they will get another opportunity to see them again. "So, I think the players will try to give their best," said Rupu, a member of the Bangladesh Football Federation. Asked whether the foreign recruits would make the difference, Rupu, Wazed and Maruful said they might but it all depended how they would play on the particular day. Wasim, however, would not want comment until seeing the performances of the foreign players on the pitch. He believed barring two or three, the foreign players were not up to mark in the B. League. Mohammedan's Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken became the league's top scorer with 18 goals while Abahani's Nigerian midfielder Emeka Christian finished just behind him with 17. Doubtless, the foreign players will also dominate the proceedings this time too, as each club is allowed to play four foreigners instead of B. League's three. B. League champions Abahani, Federation Cup winners Mohammedan, the third and fourth finishers Sheikh Russel and Brothers Union are believed to be main title contenders. But many think the race will be wide open. Abahani Limited will take on Rahmatganj on one of two opening day matches at 4:30pm with state-owned Bangladesh Television beaming the match live. Sheikh Russel face Chittagong Mohammedan in the other match at 6:30pm. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin and sponsor Citycell CEO Michael Seymour will inaugurate the eight-team tournament
