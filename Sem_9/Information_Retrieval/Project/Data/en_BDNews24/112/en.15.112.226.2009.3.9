 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  The mother and mother-in-law of two army officers slain in the BDR mutiny are on the list of 36 nominees the ruling Awami League-led alliance has selected for the reserved seats for women in parliament. Major Mahmudul Hasan Swapan's mother Momtaz Begum and Major Gazzali Dastagir's mother-in-law Farida Rahman Hira were drafted into the list by the party's parliamentary board. Deputy office secretary of the Awami League BM Mozammel Haq announced the names Monday at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi in Dhaka. He said as many as 784 people collected nomination papers from Feb. 14-18. "But we can't nominate all. The parliamentary board has finalised nomination of 36." He added that, the party president, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, had said those who did not get nomination will be given tasks. The nominees will have to specify their TIN, or their husband's, and assets in the designated form. They cannot default on payment of utility bills and have to state clearly if they are facing charges or convicted. March 12 is the last date for filing nomination. BNP has got five and Jatiya Party four reserved seats proportionate to their strength in parliament.
