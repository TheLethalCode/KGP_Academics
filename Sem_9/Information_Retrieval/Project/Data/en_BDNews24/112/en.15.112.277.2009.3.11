 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  The energy ministry has outlined a Tk 1,050 crore project to prevent seepage from Titas gas field, the largest in the country, an official said on Wednesday. Energy secretary Mohhamad Mohsin told bdnews24.com the proposal was examined at an internal meeting of the ministry on Wednesday. The ministry has set a target to begin the project by June this year, after approval from the planning commission and ECNEC. Asian Development Bank is likely to finance this project, said ministry officials. Mohsin said the project will identify causes of seepage and take remedial measures. Wells where seepage has been detected will be surveyed and worked over. The Titas field now produces an average 400 million cubic feet gas per day from 14 out of 16 wells. Akher Abdul Awal, manager of Bangladesh Gas Field Company Limited (BGFCL), told bdnews24.com, seepage had been reduced after the killing of number Well 3. "We found a fault in this well. We guess this was the cause of seepage," he said. Well 14 is being "worked over", he said. According to Petrobangla, the total reserve of gas in the field is approximately 5.5 trillion cubic feet. Almost 50 percent of t0tal gas has been extracted to date. BGFCL is operating six gas fields in the country including Titas.
