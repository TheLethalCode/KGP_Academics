 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  Despite proving a point or two in the curtain-raiser Federation Cup and B League, Brothers Union want to finish top in the Super Cup. The Gopibagh-based outfit, Brothers, failed to qualify for the last four in the Federation Cup and finished fourth in the 11-team B League, but both the club manager and captain remained positive ahead of the mega-rich tournament that kicks off on March 11. "We could not maintain our consistency in the B League, but we played good football and this time the players, club officials and coaching staff are determined that the club clinches the Super Cup," said Brothers manager Amer Khan at a briefing at BFF House on Monday. Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club also appeared on the last day of the four-day pre-tournament briefing series of the eight clubs taking part in the Tk one crore trophy. Amer Khan said that they were depending on their national stars because that they could not rope in more foreign players due to insufficient time. The former national footballer, however, said they still had Ghanaian striker Henry Quaye, who played in the B League and were going to sign up African recruit Basiro Mohammed, who was supposed to arrive here in a couple of days from India. Brothers captain Amit Khan Shuvro said that they were keen on giving opponents a tough time on the pitch. "I can assure you that we will fight in every match." The Brothers manager, however, thought that the tournament committee was focusing its attention too much on Abahani and Mohammedan. Brothers have been drawn in Group B along with Mohammedan, Farashganj Sporting Club and Chittagong Abahani. "Three matches each of Abahani and Mohammedan will be telecast whereas the other six teams will not receive the same level of publicity," said Amer. Like Farashganj, Rahmatganj and Chittagong Abahani, Chittagong Mohammedan also had high hopes. "First we must ensure our place in the semi-finals before dreaming of playing in the final," said Chittagong manager Mohammad Yousuf. Yousuf, however, said that it would be always tough for a team outside the capital as their preparation was hampered due to lack proper ground facilities. Chittagong Mohammedan, who reached the Federation Cup semi-finals and finished fifth in the B League, were placed in Group A with Abahani, Sheikh Russel and Farashganj. "Of course, winning Tk one crore is major incentive, but we also want to entertain the spectators," said captain Masud Parvez Kaiser. The Chittagong Black and Whites are pinning their hopes on Liberian Anthony Pepe Doe and the Ghanaians Raphael Sagno and Camara Saifoulaye, who helped them in the B League. The port city outfit have included four local players former Army team striker Nasir, Komol from Badda, Mamun from Victoria and goalkeeper Karim from the Under-17 team. bd
