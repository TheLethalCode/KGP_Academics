 KUALA LUMPUR, Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Malaysian opposition MP was banned from parliament on Monday after he linked incoming premier Najib Razak to the murder of a model, with a second to be prosecuted under the country's tough sedition laws. Opposition parties said the ban and the prosecution were signs of the battles that await Najib when he takes the top job at the end of March. They said it indicated he would crack down on dissent when he takes office. Karpal Singh, chairman of the Democratic Action Party, part of a three-party opposition grouping led by former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim, told Reuters that he would be charged on Tuesday with sedition under laws that could see him jailed for up to three years. "I have been informed by the investigating officer into the case," Karpal, a human rights lawyer, said on Monday. Karpal is to be charged over his threat to sue the Sultan of Perak for consenting to a new state government in one of the five of Malaysia's 13 states controlled by the national opposition following a putsch organised by Najib. Malaysia's sultans are the defenders of Islam and it is a sensitive subject among many Malays, the majority population in the Southeast Asian nation of 27 million people. Earlier, amid rowdy scenes in parliament which saw the opposition walk out of the chamber, an opposition lawmaker was banned for a year for demanding that Najib answer questions over his alleged links to the murder of a model. Last week during a debate on the budget, MP Gobind Singh Deo demanded Najib answer questions over alleged links to the murder of Mongolian Altantuya Shariibuu in 2006 and shouted across the chamber: "Involved in a murder case. Deputy Prime Minister!", according to Hansard, the official record. Najib has repeatedly denied he is linked to the lurid murder in which Altantuya was shot twice and then blown up with explosives in a jungle outside the capital Kuala Lumpur. No evidence has been produced linking him to the killing. The opposition wants an official inquiry into the issue and has repeatedly sought to embarrass Najib, who is currently deputy prime minister. Crowds shouted "Altantuya" at him during a recent by-election. "It is a punishment fair to the offence committed by him (Gobind), because this ... is about accusing the deputy prime minister of the heinous crime of murder," said the minister in charge of parliament, Nazri Aziz. A court in late October freed a former top aide to Najib who had been charged with abetting two policemen in the murder. Anwar led opposition MPs out of parliament after the decision, saying the suspension marked a "disturbing" sign of intolerance by the incoming Najib administration. Anwar told reporters the suspension was a deliberate strategy to silence questions over the murder. "We can use the power of the majority to punish the MP, but the voice that Gobind has given rise to is still being spread, and the people are still waiting for answers," said Anwar. Najib, 55, is the son of Malaysia's second prime minister and the nephew of its third and will take over from incumbent Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whose poor showing in elections a year ago led to him stepping aside early. He will have to lead Malaysia through what is likely to be its deepest recession since the 1998 Asian financial crisis and his budget last week was criticised for being an inadequate response to the global economic downturn. The opposition has repeatedly tried to paint Najib as a hardliner who will crack down when he takes power, although Najib has pledged to liberalise the economy and tackle graft. "It (the suspension of Gobind) is a sign of scary things to come for us all in Malaysia," said Kamarudin Jaafar, secretary-general of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), one of the three parties in Anwar's alli
