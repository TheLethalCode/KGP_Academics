 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission sued Tuesday Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, on charges of money laundering, police said. The officer in charge of Kafrul Police Station, Salahuddin Arshed, told bdnews24.com ACC deputy director Abu Sayeed filed the case at around 4:30pm. Arshed said the ACC will investigate the case and if found guilty, he may be sentenced to seven years in jail. The case, filed under Money Laundering Prevention Act 2009, accuses Coco of laundering funds he had received in bribes to Singapore worth nearly US $ 9.32 lakh and Singapore $ 28.85 lakh. It said he used his influence to earn the money illegally between 2004 and 2007 when his mother was prime minister. An accused in GATCO and other cases, Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick. The government extended his parole by a month on Mar 15. The antigraft body also served a notice earlier in the day on BNP vice chairman and Khaleda's brother Sayed Eskander, giving him just seven days to come up with a statement of his assets and property. A senior ACC official told bdnews24.com that the notice had already been sent to his home address in the capital's Baridhara.
