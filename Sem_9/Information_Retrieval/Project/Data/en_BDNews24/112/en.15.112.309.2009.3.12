<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafiq Ahmed said Thursday he expects passage of a law on separation of the judiciary within a week, just a day after the High Court questioned the legality of judicial magistracy in absence of the law. "There is no reason to think that the bill will not be passed within the week," he said a regular press briefing at the ministry. The government came under fire from the High Court Wednesday for the delay in the passage of the caretaker government's ordinance under which the judiciary was made independent. In a suo moto rule, the court questioned the legality of the judicial magistracy after Feb 24, the day the ordinance expired. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haq and Abdul Hye ordered the law secretary and the Supreme Court registrar to answer the rule by Mar 19. The law minister said Thursday the matter would be resolved in parliament, as necessary. He said the government had already decided to pass the amended CrPC ordinance, under which the judiciary was made independent in 2007. It would become law after final input from the parliamentary standing committee, he added. All actions taken under the ordinance will be approved retrospectively as "done under the law", Shafiq said. High Court questions delay The High Court on Wednesday questioned why parliament had not passed the amended CrPC ordinance within 30 days of its being tabled in the maiden session. It said the ordinance had now expired. The judges wanted to know under what legal powers the judicial magistrates have been functioning since Feb 24. They also wanted to know why their functioning since the date should not be declared without proper legal authority. The court solicited opinion of senior lawyers M Zahir and Mahmudul Islam in the hearing on a petition on the appointment of staff to assist judicial magistracy and metropolitan magistracy. The lawyers were on the committee that reviewed over 100 ordinances of the interim government. They said they had suggested passage in parliament of the ordinance regarding the separation of the judiciary. The judiciary was made independent of the executive on Nov. 1, 2007, during the caretaker government's tenure. bdn
