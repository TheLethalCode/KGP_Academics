 WASHINGTON, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday condemned the Sudanese government's decision to expel aid groups, saying it risked creating an even greater humanitarian crisis in its western Darfur region. Sudan expelled 13 aid groups after the International Criminal Court charged Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir with war crimes in Darfur, where 4.7 million people rely on foreign assistance for food, shelter and protection from fighting. "We have a potential crisis of even greater dimensions than what we already saw," Obama said in his first response to Khartoum's action last week. Obama made the remarks after wide-ranging talks with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the White House, their first meeting since Obama was sworn into office on January 20. Both men heaped praise on each other's leadership after the meeting, which underscored the new administration's desire for closer ties between Washington and the world body. Ban's office said in a statement that he and Obama had agreed on the need for an international agreement on climate change and committed to pursue one by the end of the year. Obama said much of their conversation was devoted to Darfur, and he had impressed on Ban the importance of the international community making clear to Khartoum it was "not acceptable to put that many people's lives at risk." UN officials said on Tuesday the expulsion of the aid groups had paralyzed as much as half of the UN's programs. They said they were unable to fill the gap left by the NGOs, which handed out food aid, monitored for disease outbreaks and provided clean water and healthcare across Darfur. Obama pledged US help in addressing the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, where UN officials say as many as 300,000 people have died since a conflict erupted in 2003. "We need to be able to get those humanitarian organizations back on the ground," Obama said. FOOD SECURITY Obama and Ban also discussed the potential threat posed by the global economic crisis to food supplies in poorer countries, increasing civilian development aid in Afghanistan, and combating nuclear proliferation. Ban said he would use the G20 summit in London next month to call on the leaders of industrialized nations to keep promises of development aid to poorer nations hard hit by the global economic turmoil. Ban said it was an encouraging sign that he and Obama were meeting so early in the latter's presidency and praised the president's "dynamic and visionary" leadership in combating the economic crisis. "The United Nations stands ready to work together with you Mr President, to make this make-or-break year turn into a make-it-work, full of optimism and resolution," he said. Relations between the United States and the United Nations were strained during the Bush administration, especially after conservative John Bolton, an outspoken critic of the world body, was named UN ambassador in 2005. Bolton and some other officials in former President George W. Bush's administration considered the United Nations hostile to US interests. But relations improved in the last few years of Bush's term after Bolton stepped down and Bush replaced him with a former US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad. Obama has signaled that he wants to put more emphasis on multilateralism in US foreign policy, a stance that has been welcomed at the United Nations. "The United Nations can be an extraordinarily constructive, important partner in bringing about peace, security and stability to people around the world. And the secretary-general has shown extraordinary leadership during his tenure," Obama said, with Ban sitting to his right in the Oval Office
