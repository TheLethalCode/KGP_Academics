 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  A visiting FBI team met with the CID investigators on the Peelkhana mutiny case on Monday. "We briefed them about the killings and the investigation process during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting," CID special police superintendent Misharul Arif told bdnews24.com. The two-member FBI team may visit the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters, scene of the massacre, on Tuesday, he said. The FBI men arrived in Bangladesh on Sunday to assist in the investigation of the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny that left almost 70 dead, mostly army officers. The 'advance team' came in response to the government's requests for assistance, foreign minister Dipu Moni said on their arrival. The FBI may also provide forensic expertise to trace bodies of still-missing army officers. The US agency will set its terms of reference working with the local investigation team, the length of their stay depending upon their work. The Bangladesh government sought help from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the UK's Scotland Yard in the immediate aftermath of the Peelkhana mutiny. The foreign minister has said a team from UK's Scotland Yard was also expected "soon". bdn
