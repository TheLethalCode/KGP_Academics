<TITLE> BJP struggles with allies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. The sources of reports are in brackets. A key member of the main national opposition bloc, Janata Dal (United), or the JD(U), is considering leaving the alliance. The JD(U), which is strong in Bihar, disagreed with the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which heads the combine, over sharing of seats in Bihar (Mail Today). This could be another major blow to the alliance after the Biju Janata Dal of Orissa, one of its oldest members, quit the combine last week. The BJP has also so far failed to find a partner in the key state of Andhra Pradesh. No party seems keen to ally with the BJP after it fared poorly in the 2004 national election partnering the Telugu Desam Party (Mail Today). The Congress, which heads the ruling national coalition, is still negotiating with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), its partner in Maharashtra, for seats. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said he "could not ignore" the Third Front, a coalition of smaller parties which aims to provide an alternative to the two main national alliances. The Third Front wants the NCP to join, but the Congress wants to prevent any such move (Indian television). The Election Commission has asked Mulayam Singh Yadav, chief of the Samajwadi Party from Uttar Pradesh, to explain why his party workers were seen distributing cash to people on a Hindu festival this week (The Hindu). Opposition parties say the act violated the election code of conduct.
