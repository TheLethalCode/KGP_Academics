<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wednesday said those who sought to ride to power on blood-letting were behind the grisly BDR carnage. Hasina, also ruling Awami League chief, asked party supporters to sensitive the public against the 'misgivings being spread' since the killing of army officers in BDR headquarters. "The valour that the two Jubo League leaders showed during the BDR incident was admirable," she told the central committee members of the party's youth front Bangladesh Jubo League at residence. The Jubo League is set to launch a countrywide organisational tour on Mar 12-15, party sources said. Hasina said during the last caretaker government's rule, attempts were made to "turn me into a thief" but the people shot down the bid. "The army presented a nice voter list with photos which helped the citizens to vote in a free and fair atmosphere, leading to fair results." She asked the ageing Jubo League leaders to "leave rooms for the younger generation". A delegation led by state minister for LGRD and cooperatives and Jubo League chairman Jahangir Kabir Nanak and Jubo League secretary Mirza Azam stayed with the prime minister for an hour since 8:30pm. bd
