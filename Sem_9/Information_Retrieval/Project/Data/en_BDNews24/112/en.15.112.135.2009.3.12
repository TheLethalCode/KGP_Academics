 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)Visiting UK minister Mike Foster said the BDR mutiny was a "first test" for the newly elected government to ensure good governance. Ending his three-day visit, Foster hoped that the government would overcome the challenges in wake of the mutiny. "[It] is the first test of the new government. But they are elected on a strong mandate on very high turnout in a fairly contested election," Foster told reporters at a press conference at the Westin Hotel. "Without doubt it is a serious challenge that the government of Bangladesh is rising to meet," said the minister who arrived on Tuesday. "I sincerely hope that this new government will not only be able to get through the present crisis, but also able to implement their manifesto and their commitment to the people." He said the government must face the challenges evolving on the country's political front, as well. Foster, the UK minister for international development in charge of the South Asian desk, said democracy was restored well in Bangladesh . He also said his country was pleased to meet the Bangladesh government's request for assistance in its investigation into the mutiny. A four-member Scotland Yard team arrived from the UK the day after Foster's arrival to advise the government in the investigation.
