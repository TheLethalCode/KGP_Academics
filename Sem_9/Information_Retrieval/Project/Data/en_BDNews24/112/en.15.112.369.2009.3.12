<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a High Court order that granted bail to former chief conservator of forests Osman Gani in a corruption case until his appeal hearing pending. A four-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice M.M. Ruhul Amin passed the order on hearing an application by Gani to vacate a previous stay order by the Judge in Chamber. Judge in Chamber of the Appellate Division Md. Abdul Matin, on Feb 17, had stayed the HC bail for one month. The HC on Feb 15 granted four month's bail to the ex-forests chief. Joint forces arrested Osman at his Uttara house in the capital on May 29, 2007 and seized Tk 1 crore in cash that he had hidden in the house. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on July 26, 2007, accusing Osman and his wife of concealing assets worth around Tk 4.30 crore and concealing information in his wealth statement. A special court on June 5 last year sentenced Osman Gani to 13 years' imprisonment. That court also fined Osman Tk 10 lakh and ordered the authorities to confiscate wealth worth Tk 1.80 crore belonging to Osman, and Tk 2.80 crore and 270 tolas of gold ornaments belonging to his wife. Barrister Moudud Ahmed moved the application for Osman Gani on Thursday while Additional Attorney General M. Enayetur Rahim opposed it.
