 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)The government is not happy over the volume of water flowing from Farakka point into the Padma, the water resouces minister has said. As little as 42000 cusecs of water were received Monday whereas 56000 cusecs were available 15 days ago, water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen told reporters Tuesday. To ensure proper use and management of waters in Padma, the Ganges barrage project was finalised and sent to the Cabinet Committee On Purchase. The work on the project will begin on approval by the committee, he said After completion of all formalities in two years, tenders will be invited for construction of the barrage, Sen told reporters at his Secretariat office. "We have started the process of dam construction by creating blocks on seventy rivers in two and a half months. Besides, 25,000 tonnes of wheat were sanctioned for building dams on the rivers in the Sidr-affected areas and their protection. "About 90 percent of work has been completed." He said the India- Bangladesh Joint River Commission would discuss issues such as reclamation of land eroded by border rives, inter-river link project by India near the Tepaimukh embankment and water sharing of common rivers. On why the JRC meeting had not been held for so long, the minister said, "India is now concerned with the (general) election. That is why scope to discuss these issues before election is thin. But after the election, date for the JRC meeting will be fixed". About the causes for reduced water flow in the Surma, Kushaira and Teesta, the minister said, it needed to be kept in mind that in last seven months there was no rainfall in these areas. Besides, because of siltation, water absorption capacity of these rivers has gone down. Initiative has been taken to excavate these rivers. Dredgers were sent in Kushaira and Surma, Sen further said
