 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government will roll out its stimulus package by month-end to help RMG and other major exporters face the global financial downturn, the finance minister said Thursday. Banks will also be asked to offer financial incentives to help recession-hit export-focused sectors, he added. "The banks will offer concessions in their own business interest. They will give a percentage of their profit to the exporters," AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh Jute Association. "We consider that it is a difficult time for export sector including readymade garments, jute, frozen food and leather to sustain due to global recession," Muhith said. He said various sectors were demanding compensation package but not all demands could be met. The government will provide the stimulus package after talking with representatives from all sectors, he added. The banks can also help by lowering the interest rate on loan for the export-oriented sectors. On the source of incentives by the government, he said budget has an allocation of incentive for various sectors. The allocation will be adjusted with other sectors to meet the additional spending. bdnews24.
