 KHARTOUM, Mon Mar 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan's president said on Monday he wanted foreign aid groups to stop distributing aid in Sudan within a year, in an escalation in the country's defiant response to an international war crimes warrant against him. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir expelled 13 international aid groups this month, accusing them of helping the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against him, accusing him of orchestrating atrocities in Darfur. Aid groups deny working with the court. In an emotional speech to thousands of soldiers and police, Bashir said he had ordered Sudanese aid groups to take over the distribution of all relief inside the country -- a move that could freeze the work of more than 70 foreign organisations still operating in Darfur and other strife-torn areas. If carried out, the order will also create a dilemma for international donors, including the governments of the United States and Britain, over whether they will be able to continue to pour millions into projects across the underdeveloped country without full control over how their aid is distributed. "We have ordered the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to completely Sudanise the voluntary work in Sudan within one year and after that we don't want international organisations to deal with Sudanese citizens with relief," Bashir told the rally. "If they (the international organisations) want to continue providing aid, they can just leave it at the airport and Sudanese NGOs (non governmental organisations) can distribute the relief." "CLEAR OUR COUNTRY OF ANY SPIES" "We need to clear our country of any spies," he told the cheering crowd in Khartoum's Green Square rally ground, close to the city's airport. Bashir said Sudan's neighbours Ethiopia and Eritrea had carried out similar programmes to distribute foreign aid through local groups. Bashir did not specify how the order would be carried out. It was not clear whether more than 70 foreign aid groups still working inside Sudan would also be expelled, or how the order would affect UN agencies. It was also not certain whether the order would cover aid programmes in Sudan's semi-autonomous south. The earlier expulsion of 13 aid agencies, including Oxfam, Save the Children and two branches of Medecins Sans Frontieres, only affected operations in the north. Thousands of soldiers from the regular army and the state-aligned Popular Defence Forces militia pledged allegiance to Bashir during the rally, the latest in a series of demonstrations against the ICC's warrant in Khartoum. Bashir was a career army officer when he overthrew a democratically-elected civilian government in 1989. The army remains one of his strongest power b
