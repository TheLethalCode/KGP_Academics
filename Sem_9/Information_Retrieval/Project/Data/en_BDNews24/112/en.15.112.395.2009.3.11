 Chittagong, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  Officials of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd have given contradictory statements to CID investigators over offloading of 10 trucks of arms in 2004. Assistant superintendent of CID Moniruzzaman Chowdhury who is on the arms haul case said Tuesday all five officials questioned gave contradictory information. Ten trucks laden with illegal arms were seized at the CUFL Jetty in the port city as those were being smuggled in on Apr. 1, 2004. The five officials were seated together and quizzed. The then CUFL security officer Mubin Hossain Khan said he informed the high officials when he had come to know that the arms were being offloaded at the jetty. He said he could take no action as he was not given orders. The other officials including CUFL's managing director dismissed his claim. Members of police, coastguard and some other CUFL officials who were on duty during the arms offloading will be quizzed, Chowdhury added. bdnews
