 MIAMI, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies captain Chris Gayle has recovered from a hamstring injury and been named in a 13-man squad for the first two one-day internationals against England in Guyana. Gayle picked up the injury during the drawn fifth test in Trinidad and missed Sunday's Twenty20 triumph at the same ground. Sulieman Benn, whose three wickets helped West Indies to a comfortable six-wicket victory in the Twenty20 match, was surprisingly left out with his spot going to Jamaican slow left-armer Nikita Miller. All-rounder Dwayne Bravo, whose appearance in the Twenty20 was his first for West Indies following ankle surgery, was also named in the squad for the matches on Friday and Sunday. The games kick off a five-match one-day series. West Indies squad: Chris Gayle (captain), Lendl Simmons, Devon Smith, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin (wicketkeeper), Darren Sammy, Kieron Pollard, Fidel Edwards, Nikita Miller, Daren Powell, Lionel Baker
