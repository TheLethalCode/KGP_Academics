<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 10 (bdnews24.com)  Gazi Tank Cricketers almost confirmed their Super League berths in the Premier Cricket League Tuesday with a convincing 57-run win over lowly City Club at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. Partex steered further clear of relegation with their fourth win in eight matches with a six-wicket win over Victoria SC at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Young Pegasus, who tied against Mohammedan in their first match but lost six consecutive matches, tasted first victory when the minnows handed a 36-run defeat to Old DOSH at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Pegasus, however, are still in threat of playing the relegation league with three points from eight outings, one less than Victoria, who are in 10th position with four points. City Club are at the bottom with eight losses in as many matches. Gazi Tank raised their point tally to 12 from eight matches, beside third-placed Surjotourn. Partex joined Old DOHS with eight points from as many matches. Abahani Limited and Biman Bangladesh Airlines are jointly atop with 14 points from eight matches. Gazi Tank vs City Club Gazi Tank, led by Nafis Iqbal in absence of regular Mohammad Ashraful, bundled City Club out for 172 for 46.2 overs after posting a fighting 234 for nine, thanks to half centuries from Mohammad Mithun and Mahmudul Hasan. Both openers Imrul Kayes and Anwar Hossain returned before opening their accounts, but Mithun and Mahmudul rescued Gazi Tank with 75 and 53 respectively. City Club responded well with openers Rasel Al Mamun and Mayshequr Rahman contributing 43 and 46, but with the departure of both openers City Club lost their way. They eventually were all out for 177 as Gazi Tank's Mahmudul Hasan (3/27), Enamul Haq Junior (2/29) and Rubel Hossain (2/43) wrecked the innings. Partex vs Victoria A defiant 137-run fifth-wicket partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Rashed Hanif took Partex to 175 for four in 43.5 overs, chasing Victoria's paltry 174 all out in 49 overs. Partex were tottering at 38 for four at one stage, but Mushfiqur and Rashed took the charge to steer Partex home with unbeaten 71 and 68 respectively. Earlier, Iqbal Hossain claimed five scalps for 38 runs to wreck Victoria's innings. He was backed up by pacer M Azim (2/24) and spinner Rashed Hanif (2/12). Pegasus vs DOHS Put in to bat first, Pegasus made a modest 203 all out in 49.1 overs as opener Faisal Javed top-scored with 51, followed by one-down Rahat Sadek with 45. M Jubair and Rubait Haq chipped in with 25 and 18 to take Pegasus to the total. DOHS, in reply, were restricted to 167 all out in 47.1 overs though opener Fazle Rabbi stood tall to make
