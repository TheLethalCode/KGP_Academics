 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has said long-due polls to the Dhaka City Corporation are likely to be held by June as it waits for the DCC election law to come into force. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said Monday the elections to the lowest tier of the local government, Union Parishad, most of which have run out of tenure, will be held by Dec. "We want to arrange the DCC election by June if the necessary law is introduced before that," he told reporters at his office. In late Feb., the EC proposed to the local government ministry to hold the DCC elections between Apr. 10 and 12 and was scheduled to announce the election schedule by the first week of Mar. The deadline for holding the election expired on May 24, 2007. Sakhawat said the DCC election will be held on the national voter roll. He, however, added that, the elections to nearly 4,500 Union Parishad across the country will be held after the voter list is updated. The by-elections to seven constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the ninth general elections, will be held on Apr. 2. The EC has asked the ministers and those with equivalent ranks not to visit those constituencies in breach of electoral law. bdn
