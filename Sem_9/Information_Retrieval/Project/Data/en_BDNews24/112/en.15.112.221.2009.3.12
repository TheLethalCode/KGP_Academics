The candidates are Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte in the south-east, Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Florianopolis in the south, Campo Grande, Cuiaba, Goiania and Brasilia in the centre-west, Salvador, Natal, Recife and Fortaleza in the north-east, plus the Amazonian cities of Rio Branco, Manaus and Belem.
