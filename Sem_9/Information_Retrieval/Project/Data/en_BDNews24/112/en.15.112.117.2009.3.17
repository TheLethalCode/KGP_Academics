<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation has decided to bring foreign referees to conduct the second-leg semi-finals and the final of the Citycell Super Cup. The decision was taken on Tuesday at an organising committee meeting after Brothers Union, a semi-finalist of the tournament, filed the written allegation against referees after playing a 1-1 draw against Mohammedan on Monday. "Brothers Union filed a written allegation against referees, besides other teams also informed us verbally about the poor refereeing and considering all aspects, we have decided to bring referees from outside country," said co-chairman of the committee Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir. Abahani will take on Brothers Union on March 19 in the first-leg semi-final while Dhaka Mohammedan will face their Chittagong namesakes the next day and both matches will be conducted by the local referees. Later in a discussion with reporters, BFF president Kazi Salahuddin also expressed his dissatisfaction over the standard of referee as he watched the match between Dhaka Abahani and Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club on March 13. After a meeting with former Japanese International footballer Tsuyoshi Kitazawa at BFF House, the BFF boss said that the Japan Football Association would provide a youth coach to Bangladesh for two years. The coach is expected to arrive here on October next. Salahuddin said that the new coach would be assigned to the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan to build up the budding footballers of the institution. bd
