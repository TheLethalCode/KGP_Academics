<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  The food minister has admitted that the country's irrigation ahead of the Boro season is being hampered for lack of power. "Deputy commissioners from many districts have sent letters to the government for ensuring uninterrupted power supply and we discussed the matter in today's cabinet meeting," Abdur Razzaque told reporters on Monday. Razzaque said the government had taken a decision to rearrange gas distribution to upgrade power production and supply for farmers. "We have instructed the respective ministry in this regard," he added. He said power production was being hampered which could threaten Boro production. "The government is considering this matter seriously." Razzaque said we will resume Open Market Sales of essentials this month for garments workers. "We have asked the BGMEA to make a list of garments workers." The minister earlier met with a five-member World Bank team, led by visiting vice president Isabel M Guerrero, at his office. He said the Guerrero had pledged the Bank's help to construct more food storage facilities. Modern silos and warehouses are planned in Postogola, Dhaka, and Chittagong and Mongla sea ports. World Bank will also continue their assistance in reconstructing around 3,333 food storage facilities at upazila and union level, he added. He said the lending agency also offered to assist in the government's VGD, VGF and 100-day employment programmes, though they have not been involved in these previously. Razzaque said at present around 71 lakh families are getting help from VGF programmes and this figure will be increased in future, marking WB's keenness on social security programmes. Acting food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman was also present at the meeting. The members of the WB team were country director Zhu Xian, operation adviser Tahseen Sayed, senior urban specialist Zahed Khan and special assistant Catterine Vegnernon. bd
