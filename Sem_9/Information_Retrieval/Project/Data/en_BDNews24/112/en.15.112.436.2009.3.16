<TITLE> China's Panchen Lama says Tibet needs Communists </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Tibetan anointed by Beijing as the region's second-ranking spiritual leader was quoted by Chinese state media as saying that Tibet could only have a "bright future" under Communist Party leadership. His comments came less than a week after the exiled Dalai Lama said 50 years under Communism had brought "untold suffering" and turned the region he once ruled as spiritual and temporal leader into a "living hell". Gyaltsen Norbu, recognised by China as the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama but spurned by many Tibetans, said he would guide Tibetan Buddhists in their quest to adapt to "socialist society", the official Xinhua news agency said. Visiting an exhibition on the "50th anniversary of Democratic Reforms in Tibet" in Beijing, the 19-year-old said Chinese rule had brought progress and happiness to his people. "People living in Tibet should cherish the prosperity and happy lives today," Xinhua quoted the Panchen Lama as saying. March is the sensitive 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's flight to India and the first anniversary of deadly riots in Lhasa that sparked waves of protests in Tibetan areas. China brands the Nobel Peace Prize winner a separatist. This year Beijing has promised stability and sealed off ethnic Tibetan parts of the country to all foreigners, while launching a campaign to celebrate achievements it says include economic progress and the abolition of serfdom. Many Tibetans outside China dispute these achievements, saying they were launching their own reforms and Beijing's depiction of traditional society is a distorted caricature. China has poured billions of dollars into modernising Tibet but a dispute over the Panchen Lama's position has left a void that could foster conflict and violence after the death of the Dalai Lama, now 73. Another 5-year-old boy was chosen by the Dalai Lama as successor to the 10th Panchen Lama in 1995, but he has disappeared from public view since his selection became known. China's critics called him the world's youngest political prisoner. Beijing says he does not want publicity and has a normal life with his family
