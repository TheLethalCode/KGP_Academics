 MUMBAI, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua will not be allowed to host international cricket for at least 12 months following the pitch fiasco last month, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday. The second test between the West Indies and England was abandoned after 10 balls when the ground was deemed unfit and dangerous for play. A third test was hastily arranged at the nearby Antigua Recreation Ground, the old test venue, and the ICC has handed the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) an official warning for not preparing the ground effectively. The sport's governing body has ordered for "extensive remedial work" to be carried out at the stadium, to be monitored by the WICB, before the ICC conducts an official inspection. "Such inspection will be conducted no earlier than 12 months from yesterday, the day the ICC informed the WICB of its decision," an ICC statement said. "The decision is in accordance with the ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process, which was introduced in 2006 to ensure international cricket was played in conditions of a suitably high standard," the statement added
