 PORT OF SPAIN, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If West Indies hold out on the final day of the fifth test to secure their first series win over England in 11 years they will have a little man from Attadale, Western Australia to thank. Brendan Nash scored his maiden test century on Monday to help his team to 544 all out, two short of England's first innings. Nash's composed and resilient innings gave West Indies a great chance of defending their 1-0 lead in the series and rewarded the 31-year-old for years of unheralded play. "It's been many years of hard work to finally get the opportunity, to be there on 98 and 99 was very nervous. But I got there in the end so I'm very happy with that," said Nash, who spent seven balls on 99. Before moving to play for Jamaica in 2007, Nash played his cricket for Queensland in Australia's domestic competitions and worked as a professional for Monton and Weaste in the Central Lancashire League. It was when Queensland chose not to renew his contract that Nash decided to try his luck in Jamaica, the land of his parents, and after a good first season in Caribbean regional cricket he earned a call-up for his first test when West Indies toured New Zealand in December. West Indies have not been beaten in the six test matches since Nash came into the side -- two in New Zealand and four on this tour -- and he showed the qualities that have impressed his coach and fellow Australian John Dyson against England's attack on Monday. Nash, who stands 1.73 metres tall (5 foot 8), was part of a 234-run partnership with fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul (147 not out) and said his team mate was a big help. "Shivy and I had to work together and build a partnership. It's very easy to do with him, he likes to bat time and that's something I've learnt from him and hopefully will continue to do so in the future. "He makes the game look very simple and that gives you a bit of confidence at the other end. He doesn't look like he is going to get out so you can just play your game and go from there," he said. The pairing with Chanderpaul was a record fifth wicket partnership at the Queen's Park Oval. However, Nash's celebrations were tempered by the knowledge that his team still have a day to survive if they are to clinch the series. "The track is wearing a little bit more, there are some good rough patches there for the spinners so if we get our chance to bat again we are going to have to watch hard and make sure the spinners don't take full effect of that rough," he said. "It's going to be tough to bat on tomorrow. It's a lot easier with the new ball because after that the spinners come into play. We have to make sure we have a gameplan and stick to
