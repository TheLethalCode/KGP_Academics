 MOSCOW, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Moscow police detained more than 650 soccer fans late on Sunday after violence broke out between fans at one of the opening games of the new season. The majority of those arrested were supporters of UEFA Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg, who drew 1-1 at Spartak Moscow. Russian television showed seats being hurled through the air and supporters brawling at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium. The teams have a history of rivalry that has led to violence on the terraces before. "Of the 650 that were held, 513 were Zenit supporters. They were released after three hours once we took down their details but they now face a fine for hooliganism," a police spokesman said on Monday
