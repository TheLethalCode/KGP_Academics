 LONDON, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool stunned leaders Manchester United 4-1 at Old Trafford to revive the English Premier League title race, while French league leaders Olympique Lyon also faltered at the weekend. Barcelona reinstated their six-point lead in the Primera Liga and Inter Milan remained seven points clear in Italy. SPAIN Barcelona restored their six-point advantage over champions Real Madrid with a 2-0 win at Almeria on Sunday, teenage striker Bojan Krkic netting twice in a dominant display that moved the Catalans on to 66 points with 11 matches remaining. Real had trimmed Barca's lead back to three with a bruising 5-2 victory at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, when struggling Valencia were held 1-1 at home by Recreativo Huelva. Third-placed Sevilla's bid to catch Real suffered a setback when they were held to a 2-2 draw at Malaga and Antonio Lopez netted a late header as Atletico Madrid battled back from two goals down to beat 10-man Villarreal 3-2 and move up to fifth. ITALY Inter Milan took another big step towards retaining their title when Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice in a 2-0 home win over fifth-placed Fiorentina. Jose Mourinho's side, eliminated by Manchester United in the Champions League in midweek, failed to find top gear but managed to keep their seven-point lead intact with 10 games left. Juventus, in second, came from behind to beat Bologna 4-1 in Turin with Alessandro Del Piero scoring a double and winger Sebastian Giovinco inspirational throughout. Filippo Inzaghi grabbed his 300th career goal when he netted his second in third-placed AC Milan's 5-1 hammering of Siena. Milan's Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato also bagged a brace in Tuscany, including a thumping strike from distance. ENGLAND Manchester United's 11-match winning run in the Premier League came to a shuddering halt when they were thumped 4-1 by Liverpool at Old Trafford, a shock result that breathed new life into the title race. Liverpool hit back with goals from Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard, Fabio Aurelio and Andrea Dossena after Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty had given the champions the lead. United still lead the standings by four points from Chelsea and Liverpool with a game in hand. Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to stay in the hunt but Aston Villa's hopes of playing Champions League football next season took a dive when they lost 2-1 at home to Tottenham Hotspur to drop to fifth. FRANCE Seven-times champions Olympique Lyon retained a one-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 despite a 2-0 home defeat by mid-table Auxerre. The leaders benefited from Olympique Marseille's 3-1 win at arch rivals Paris St Germain later on Sunday. The capital side missed a chance to go top and dropped to third, below Marseille on goal difference. Girondins Bordeaux kept alive their title hopes with a 2-1 home victory over mid-table Nice on Saturday. They are fourth on 50 points, three off the pace. GERMANY Andriy Voronin's eighth goal in six matches gave Bundesliga leaders Hertha Berlin a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen, maintaining their four-point gap at the top. Second-placed Bayern Munich had a comfortable 3-0 win against hosts VfL Bochum but lost striker Miroslav Klose to an ankle injury for at least two weeks. VfL Wolfsburg notched their sixth successive win with a 4-3 victory over Schalke 04 courtesy of a Grafite hat-trick, to move level with Bayern on 45 points but in third place on goal difference. Hamburg are also on 45 after a 2-0 win against lowly Energie Cottbus while newcomers Hoffenheim lost more ground, failing to win for the sixth successive match, drawing 1-1 against Eintracht Frankfurt to drop to fifth on 43 points. NETHERLANDS AZ Alkmaar stretched their unbeaten run to 25 matches after a 1-0 win over Utrecht thanks to an early goal from Maarten Martens. They maintain their 11-point lead in the Dutch league with seven matches remaining. Second placed Twente Enschede cruised to a 2-0 victory at Willem II Tilburg to stay three points ahead of Ajax Amsterdam who beat bottom side Graafschap Doetinchem 3-0. Mid-table Feyenoord overcame PSV Eindhoven 1-0 with youngster Leroy Fer heading home the winner, meaning that PSV officially lost their title as they are 23 points behind Alkmaar. SCOTLAND Two extra-time goals gave Celtic a 2-0 win over city rivals and holders Rangers in the Scottish League Cup final. Both sides had good chances in normal time but it was Darren O'Dea who finally broke the deadlock, heading in early on in the first period of extra time. Aiden McGeady added the second from the penalty spot after Kirk Broadfoot was shown a red card for bringing him down in the box in the dying seconds. PORTUGAL Porto extended their lead at the top of the Portuguese Premier League to four points with a 2-0 win over Naval, while Benfica lost 1-0 at home to Guimaraes and dropped to third after Sporting beat Rio Ave 2-0. Porto lead on 48 points after 22 matches, followed by Sporting on 44 points and Benfica on 43. Argentine forward Mariano Gonzalez scored Porto's first with a low drive from outside the box on 30 minutes and was also involved in the second, providing the assist for Lucho Gonzalez to finish coolly from near the penalty spot in the 68th minute. GREECE Olympiakos Piraeus moved a step closer to their 12th league title in 13 years as they thrashed Iraklis 5-0 in the Greek Super League. Vassilis Torosidis ended Olympiakos' recent scoring drought  which had lasted 345 minutes in the leaguewhen he headed in the opener in the 60th minute. That was followed by two each from Oscar Gonzales and late substitute Matt Derbyshire. The win means that, with four rounds remaining, Olympiakos need just four points to clinch the title. They are nine points clear of Panathinaikos who needed a Dimitris Salpigidis penalty to beat Thrasyvoulos Filis 1-0. RUSSIA Champions Rubin Kazan kicked off their title defence with a 3-0 home win over promoted Kuban Krasnodar after striker Aleksandr Bukharov scored twice and set up a third for captain Sergei Semak. UEFA Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg earned a 1-1 draw at Spartak Moscow in the opening round's big match after their striker Pavel Pogrebnyak cancelled out an early opener by his opposite number Ivan Saenko. CSKA Moscow enjoyed a 3-0 success at Saturn Ramenskoye, Dynamo Moscow beat city foes FC Moscow 1-0 at home and Krylya Sovietov Samara won 1-0 at Tom Tomsk. UKRAINE Front-runners Dynamo Kiev, chasing their 13th Ukrainian title after winning as many in the former Soviet Union, came from behind to beat Metalurg Zaporizhya 3-1 away to go 12 points clear at the top. Champions Shakhtar Donetsk leapfrogged Metalist Kharkiv into second after beating them 3-0 away to round off a bad week for their rivals, who also lost 1-0 to Dynamo in their UEFA Cup last-16 first-leg match on Thursday. Dynamo striker Artem Milevsky set up Milos Ninkovic and Brazilian midfielder Correa either side of his own clinical finish after Olexiy Hodin had given the home side the lead with a thunderbolt from 25 metres. SERBIA Champions and league leaders Partizan Belgrade beat city rivals Cukaricki 2-0 at home to go eight points clear of second-placed Vojvodina Novi Sad, who were held to a 1-1 draw at fifth-placed Borac Cacak. Brazilian midfielder Antonello Juca fired Partizan ahead when he swept home a rebound from eight metres and new signing Nemanja Tomic headed home his first goal for the club in the closing stages. Former European Cup winners Red Star Belgrade stayed third, nine points off the pace, after they fought back from 2-0 behind with a man down after defender Jefferson Silva was sent off to salvage a 2-2 draw at struggling neighbours OFK Belgrade. POLAND Lech Poznan stayed on course for their first league title in 16 years after a 1-1 draw at bottom team Gornik Zabrze sent them three points clear of Legia Warsaw, who slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Jagiellonia Bialystok. Midfielder Semir Stilic scored a 90th-minute equaliser for Lech, while Tomasz Frankowski and Dariusz Jarecki were on target for Jagiellonia after Takesure Chinyama had given Legia the lead. Third-placed champions Wisla Krakow, who trail the leaders by five points, missed a chance to close in after they laboured to a 0-0 draw at sixth-placed GKS Belchatow
