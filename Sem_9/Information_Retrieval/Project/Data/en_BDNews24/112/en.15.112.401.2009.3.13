<TITLE> Communists launch Third Front in India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A group of smaller political parties, including the communists, formally launched a "Third Front" on Thursday in a bid to provide an alternative to the two main national coalitions, leaders said. An alliance of nine parties, the Third Front will take on the ruling national coalition led by the Congress party and the main opposition bloc led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The parties making up the Third Front have around 70 seats between them in the 543-member lower house of parliament, most of them belonging to the communists. But they are looking to woo other smaller parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), strong in Uttar Pradesh, and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which heads the government in Orissa. Many pollsters say the Third Front could hold the balance of power after the election, and the alliance has dreams of providing India's next prime minister. Any government in which they played a leading role would be unlikely to push through economic reforms or liberalisation measures, and could take a more protectionist line, analysts say. "India needs an alternative to the so-called national parties," Chandrababu Naidu, chief of the Telegu Desam Party, a prominent member of the Third Front, told reporters. "The Congress is corrupt and the BJP is communal. What is the alternative?" Analysts say the Third Front is unlikely to be able to form a government without the support of the main national parties, and is not a very cohesive alliance in any case. The main parties will also try to woo Third Front members to their side and break up the alliance after the election. "If the Front's numbers are really good then the Congress could be forced to extend support to its government to keep the BJP out," said independent analyst Kuldip Nayar. "But that could also mean an instable government and the possibility of mid-term polls. Otherwise, if the Congress or the BJP does well, they could break the Front." Two previous governments formed by similar alliances of smaller parties did not last their full term of five years. Nevertheless, smaller parties, with regional or caste-based support, are becoming more and more powerful in India as the main parties struggle to woo voters in many parts of the country. Prolonged political wrangling after the polls, and a weak coalition government, could be bad news for India's economy as it seeks to plug a widening fiscal deficit and survive the global economic crisis. The communists thwarted pro-reform policies while supporting the Congress-led coalition ruling for the past five years, before walking out over differences regarding a civilian nuclear deal with the United States. The national election is to be held from April 16 to May 13. Votes will be counted on May 16.
