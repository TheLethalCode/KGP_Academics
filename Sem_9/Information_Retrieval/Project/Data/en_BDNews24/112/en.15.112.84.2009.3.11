<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering giving scope again in the next budget for legalising undisclosed or undeclared money, as in the previous budget, the finance minister said on Wednesday. AMA Muhith, after a meeting with the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said he was not in favour of such a provision but the government would consider it. "The Dhaka chamber delegation proposed the government offer the provision again," the minister said. "I am not in favour of the proposal ethically or theoretically." "But it should not be kept outside consideration in the context of our country. We will consider the proposal," he told reporters. DCCI president Jafar Osman said after the meeting: "We think no money should lie idle. If we are given the scope of legalising undisclosed income, investment will increase and make a positive impact on the economy." The chamber also proposed a number of other measures including an income tax database ahead of the new budget, bringing the Dhaka Customs House under automation and gearing up Mongla port to lower the pressure on Chittagong port. The finance minister said the proposals were rational. "Steps will be taken over these." The past caretaker government twice offered the provision to legalise undisclosed income by paying a 7 percent fine, during FY2007-08 and FY2008-09. bdnew
