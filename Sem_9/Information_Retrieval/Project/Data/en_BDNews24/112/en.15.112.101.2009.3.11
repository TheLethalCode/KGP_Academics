 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Abahani got off to a flying start while title contenders Sheikh Russel were stunned on the opening day of the Citycell Super Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. Nigerian striker Emeka Christian struck twice while Rahmatganj defender Nurul Alam Seepon scored an own goal as the Sky Blues handed an emphatic 3-0 defeat to Rahmatganj MFS. On the other hand, Sheikh Russel went down 2-0 to Chittagong Mohammedan with Nasir and Raphael Sagno striking one goal each. Abahani started their campaign from where they left in the B. League as they stretched their unbeaten run to ninth matches. Yet to get over the 2-1 loss to Rahmatganj in the professional football league, B. League champions Abahani did not give their opponents any room on the pitch. After just the second minute Ugandan playmaker Awudu Ibrahim whipped a cross from the left for Abul Hossain, who found Emeka at the far post and all he had to do was tap the ball home. Two minutes later, Emeka again threatened with a neat back-volley on Abul's left-side lob before a shot from Rahmatganj captain Nche Francis was drifting away the next minute. Rahmatganj could have equalised after some crisp passing when Kabir Hossain hammered a long-range shot from the midfield to test Abahani goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya, who managed to stop the ball, but it went to an unmarked Idris Kasirye inside the danger zone. The Nigerian striker however frustrated the old-Dhaka outfit, floating it over the open net just three minutes before the lemon break. After the breather, Abahani stepped up their attacks and the persistence paid off with a second goal in the 58th minute when Wali Faisal darted down the left to whip a cross into the box, but all Rahmatganj defender Seepon managed was simply head the cross into the net as attempted to clear it. The Dhanmondi-based outfit, who dominated the entire second half, went close to making it 3-0 in the 60th minute when Emeka latched on a throw from Awudu Ibrahim, but a Rahmatganj defender made a goal-line save. Jahid Hasan Emily then drove a grounder on the edge of the box that narrowly went wide before Emeka sealed the game in the 81st minute with a solo effort. Emeka ran down the middle after seeing off three Rahmantganj players before placing the ball past goalkeeper Mohammad Ali to the delight of the strong-50,000 crowd. In the day's second match, Chittagong Mohammedan went ahead in the 19th minute when Shahid sent a cross from the right and Nasir drove the ball home. Raphael Sagno made sure of the points 10 minutes into the second half as the Ghanaian striker, set up by his captain Mashud Parvez Kaiser, danced past the Sheikh Russel goalkeeper to find the back of the net.
