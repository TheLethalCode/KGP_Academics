 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Brothers Union were held to a surprise goalless draw against Farashganj Sporting Club in the Citycell Super Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Thursday. Both teams failed to impress the 2,000 spectators who came to watch the Group B opener. Brothers had two good chances before the breather to break the deadlock, but they could not utilise the opportunities. For the first 35 minutes of the game play was confined to the midfield as no side was able to take control. Brothers Union's Rezaul Karim Liton drove a left-footer outside the box, but the harmless shot went straight to Farashganj third-choice goalkeeper Sujon Chowdhury. Five minutes later, Henry Quaye flicked a Jahid Hossain low cross with goalkeeper Sujon beaten, fortunately defender Mamun Miah managed to clear it to disappoint Brothers. Just before the break, Brothers Ashraful Kader Manju got into a good position, but goalkeeper Sujon frustrated Manju to palm his shot away. After the breather, Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal sent on striker Iddi Batambuze and midfielder Rony Islam to add pace in both positions and Brothers went all-out to push Farashganj, who apparently adopted a defensive stance. Farashganj, however, from a rare counter-attack came close to taking a lead when Emeka Lucky Uti headed a Kabir Hossain free kick narrowly wide of the far post in the 66th minute. Brothers kept up the pressure earning a couple of corners kicks and in the 81st minute when a clearance from goalkeeper Sujon fell to Jahid Hasan, who drove a powerful shot outside the box, but Sujon again saved it for a corner. bd
