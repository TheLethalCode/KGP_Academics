 TEHRAN, Mon Mar 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Monday the United States was failing in Afghanistan and that a new approach was needed, four days after Washington said it would invite Tehran to an international conference to discuss its neighbor. Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki did not say whether Iran would accept the US invitation to this month's planned meeting on Afghanistan, a swift overture toward Tehran by the new administration of US President Barack Obama. Iran's government spokesman said on Saturday the Islamic Republic would consider such an invitation and that it was ready to help Afghanistan as it battles a growing Taliban insurgency. Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties for three decades and are now embroiled in a dispute over Tehran's nuclear program, which the West suspects is aimed at making bombs.

Afghanistan's foreign minister made clear he wanted Iran to attend the conference, possibly on March 31, which would also bring in neighbors including Pakistan as well as other players. "We warmly welcome any precious role that Iran wants to play to strengthen peace in Afghanistan," Afghan Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta told reporters during a visit to Tehran. Mohammad Hassan Khani, an assistant professor of international relations at Tehran's Imam Sadiq University, said it was in the interests of both Islamic nations and the West that Tehran and Washington tried to resolve their disputes. "Efforts that include goodwill, engagement and negotiation certainly should be more successful than continued hostility," he wrote in the Washington Post. "The United States has made a start by including Iran in discussions regarding Afghanistan." Despite the US offer to talk to Iran if it "unclenches its fist," Iranian media on Sunday said the Islamic state had tested a new surface-to-air missile to help it confront any thr
