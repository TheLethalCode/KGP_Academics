<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  High Court on Thursday stayed proceedings of the graft case filed against Chittagong city mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdury by the Anticorruption Commission for two months. The HC bench of justices Najmun Ara Sultana and M Rezaul Huq passed the rule on a petition by Mohiuddin. Mohiuddin's lawyer Amirul Islam stated, "Since a police report against mayor Mohiuddin was not submitted to the court in 60 days as per the relevant law, the case has lost its validity." The ACC lodged the graft case with Double Mooring police on Dec 19, 2007. The Chittagong mayor and his wife were charged with amassing wealth valued at nearly Tk 1.35 crore beyond the known sources of income and concealing information about Tk 2.5 crore worth of assets from the ACC. bdnews24
