 BIRMINGHAM, Alabama Wed Mar 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven people including the suspected gunman and his mother were killed in a shooting spree and car chase in southern Alabama on Tuesday, authorities and local media said. The shooter, who was in his mid-30s, killed five people including the wife of a local deputy sheriff and her 3-month-old baby at a mobile home in Samson, according to Wynnton Melton, mayor of nearby Geneva, Alabama. His other victims included his own mother, two people killed at a convenience store and a man in a pickup truck who died during a car chase as the gunman apparently fired at random, said Melton. In all 10 people plus the gunman died, according to the website of the Dothan Eagle newspaper.

There was no indication of a motive for the spree in which a house was also burned in a nearby county. Rural southeastern Alabama, which borders Florida, is a largely agricultural area with many low-income families. Mass shootings have become a feature of life in the United States. In one of the worst recent incidents, a gunman dressed as Santa Claus killed nine guests at a Christmas Eve party, before taking his own life in Covina, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech, a university in Blacksburg, Virginia, became the site of the deadliest rampage in modern US history when a student gunman killed 32 people and himself.
