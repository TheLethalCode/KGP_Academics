 TEHRAN, Wed Mar 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told regional leaders on Wednesday that the capitalist system was close to collapse.

Afghanistan, which produces 93 percent of the world's heroin, has been ravaged by decades of civil war and a US-led international coalition is currently battling Islamist Taliban insurgency in the Central Asian state.
