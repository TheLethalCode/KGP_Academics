 KARACHI Thu Mar 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani lawyers and opposition activists launched a cross-country protest on Thursday, heading for a showdown with the civilian government which has banned rallies and detained hundreds of activists. As the so-called long march got underway, a coalition partner in the year-old government of President Asif Ali Zardari said Zardari had agreed to two opposition demands, raising hope for reconciliation a day after a crackdown. No details were immediately available. The agitation for an independent judiciary could destabilise the government at a time when the nuclear-armed US ally faces severe problems from Islamist militants and a sinking economy. Pakistan is vital to US efforts to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan and defeat al Qaeda. The United States wants to see it focus on fighting militancy rather than getting diverted by political turmoil. In Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, paramilitary soldiers and police ringed the High Court where lawyers were assembling, stopping their cars and buses from approaching. Instead, several hundred black-suited lawyers streamed out of the building on foot, where they joined political activists carrying party flags and chanting slogans. "We've started the march to achieve our goal," Munir A. Malik, a former president of the Supreme Court bar association and a protest organiser, told Reuters. Despite a crackdown on Wednesday, when rallies were banned and at least 300 activists detained, the protesters hope to converge on Islamabad on Monday to demand the reinstatement of former Supreme Court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. He was dismissed by former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf in 2007. Protesters plan a sit-in near parliament, although the government has said they will not be allowed in the city centre. WORRY ABOUT VIOLENCE Earlier, about 100 members of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party allied with the lawyers scuffled with police who stopped them entering Karachi's High Court. Police detained about a dozen protesters and later used batons to disperse the crowd, a witness said. Lawyers were also gathering in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan province, a witness said. They aim to join up with the Karachi lawyers and head to Islamabad, gathering strength on the way. Zardari has refused to reinstate Chaudhry. Analysts say he fears the judge could nullify an amnesty Musharraf granted Zardari and his late wife Benazir Bhutto. His main rival, opposition leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has thrown his weight behind the lawyers, putting him into open confrontation with Zardari. Sharif, who is also infuriated by a Supreme Court ruling which barred him and his brother from office, and which he blamed on Zardari, called the protest a defining moment for Pakistan. If the crisis gets out of hand, the military, which has ruled for more than half the country's 61 years of history, could feel forced to step in. But in a sign of a possible compromise, Asfandyar Wali Khan, leader of small coalition party, told reporters Zardari had agreed to two of Sharif's demands. He did not elaborate but Sharif told Reuters last week his two main demands were the restoration of the judge and the reversal of last month's court ruling. The ruling led to his party being thrown out of power in the key province of Punjab and central rule imposed there. In another sign of possible compromise, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said late on Wednesday the government wanted central rule in Punjab to end and for whatever party had a mandate to form the provincial government. Sharif's party is the biggest in Punjab, although it does not have a majority. Top US and British diplomats have been meeting all sides in recent days in an effort to work out a compromise. "Our biggest concern, of course, is that the situation become violent and then start to spiral downward," said a US official in Washington who declined to be identified. Worry about political turmoil has weighed on financial markets but the main stock index opened higher in thin trade on hope for an interest rate cut. The rupee was flat, dealers
