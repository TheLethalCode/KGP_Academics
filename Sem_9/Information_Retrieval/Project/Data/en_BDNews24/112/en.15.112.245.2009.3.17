<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has directed the Department of Environment to ensure that all ship-breaking yards operating without environmental clearance shut down operations. The court gave the ruling Tuesday on a public interest litigation filed by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. . It said that no ship breakers should operate without first obtaining the legally mandated environmental clearance, and gave the DoE two weeks to comply to the order. The court also directed the government to ensure that no ship with hazardous wastes enter Bangladesh without being pre-cleaned at source or outside the territory of Bangladesh. 'Red' category industry On Dec 11 last year, the Department of Environment in a report said that none of the 36 ship-breaking yards has ever taken or applied for environmental clearance. They have been bracketed in the "Red" (extremely dangerous) category industry. The High Court Tuesday observed that none of the ministries had cooperated to ensure conformity to the environmental laws. The court also observed that the Department of Shipping had always aimed at importing greater number of ships ignoring public interest, labour welfare and environmental hazards. The order said the government had to ensure that ships were only broken after guaranteeing safe working conditions for the labourers and having in place appropriate disposal arrangements for hazardous wastes and protection of environment. The court directed the environment and forest ministry to frame rules within three months on ship-breaking, relying on Bangladesh compliance with the Basel Convention, 1989, the Environment Conservation Act, 1995 and the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997. The ministry has been directed to inform the court after three months on the status of framing of the rules. The High Court was also of the opinion that a committee should be formed to ensure implementation of the court orders. The matter will appear again for order on April 7, when the Department of Environment will have to brief the court on the progress in closing the non-complaint yards and operations. BELA's petition BELA filed the writ petition in September last year challenging the entry of the ship M.T. Enterprise, listed by Greenpeace as toxic, into Bangladesh. The High Court said Tuesday no Green Peace-listed 'toxic' ships should be imported into Bangladesh for breaking purposes "unless and until appropriate scrutiny of relevant information on their waste content and cleaning was done by authorities in line with applicable laws and proper infrastructural facility was in place to deal with such ships". Former attorney general Fida M Kamal moved the petition, while Syed Rizwana Hasan, Bahreen Khan and Iqbal Kabir assisted him.
