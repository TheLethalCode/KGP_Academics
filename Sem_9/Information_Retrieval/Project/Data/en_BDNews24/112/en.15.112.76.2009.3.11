 TEHRAN, Wed Mar 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's top authority said the new US administration was showing no sign of trying to correct its predecessor's "big mistakes" in the region, including Afghanistan, Iranian media reported on Wednesday. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his comments at a meeting with visiting Turkish President Abdullah Gul, whose country recently said it was working to create "better understanding" between the United States and Iran. Khamenei has final say on matters of state, including foreign relations. US President Barack Obama has offered to engage Iran in direct talks if the Islamic Republic "unclenches its fist", in a major shift from the approach of George W Bush.

Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Monday the United States was failing in Afghanistan and that a new approach was needed. Iran has often called for US forces to leave the region, saying they were making the situation worse. Mottaki did not say whether Iran would accept the US invitation to the meeting. Iran's government spokesman has said it would consider such a request and that it was ready to help Afghanistan against a growing Taliban insurgency. An Iranian analyst said he believed Iran would attend as it "wants to be recognised as a key player in Afghanistan". Despite the nuclear row, analysts say the two foes share an interest in ensuring a stable Afghanistan. While Iran and the United States sat at the same table to discuss Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the Bush administration made sure the new pro-Western Afghan government kept Tehran at arm's le
