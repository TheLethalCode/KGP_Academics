 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina says she will scuttle the bids of the schemers as long as she is alive. "They'll never ever succeed until I am alive," she said at a discussion on the 89th birth anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and National Children's Day in the city Tuesday. She urged people to watch out for conspiracies. "Disgruntled losers are out to negate the people's mandate," she said of the landslide her party won in last year's general elections. She, however, would not name a party or any quarter that she said "the people would resist". "We must develop the country and reach the fruits of liberty to every doorstep," the prime minister observed. "People are with us and we have their mandate. We must not forget that human might is the strongest, which grenades and bullets cannot destroy." "What is this intermittent blood game for? What are these killings, militancy and arms about?" she questioned. The ruling Awami League president asked the party members to get to the grassroots people to "give them their due because they sent us to power". "Our biggest test now is to build the country in the spirits of the Independence War." AL presidium member Suranjit SenGupta demanded inclusion of Sheikh Mujib's Mar 7, 1971 speech that led the nation to independence in the textbook curriculum.
