 GAZA, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian-brokered negotiations between Israel and Hamas over swapping hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for a captured Israeli soldier have made progress but differences remain, Hamas and Israeli officials said on Monday. Negotiators wrapped up two days of indirect talks in Cairo without word on whether it would be possible to finalise a deal before Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert leaves office. Olmert spokesman Mark Regev said two high-level envoys returned to Israel on Monday night to brief the prime minister on the status of negotiations, conducted through Egyptian mediation, with Hamas Islamists who rule the Gaza Strip. Regev said Olmert's cabinet would meet on Tuesday to consider how to proceed. Olmert has made freedom for Gilad Shalit, held by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip since 2006, a precondition for a wider truce with Hamas and the reopening of the enclave's borders to crucial reconstruction aid after Israel's recent offensive. In exchange for the soldier, Hamas has demanded the release of about 450 Palestinian prisoners, including some convicted of attacks that killed Israelis, a prospect opponents of such an exchange have said would only encourage the group to try to seize more soldiers. "There is progress and there is a new (Israeli) proposal, but there are still some differences blocking conclusion of a deal," a senior Hamas official told Reuters. Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said some progress had been made but there was no agreement. Israel's Channel One television reported that there was no breakthrough in the talks in Cairo and that Olmert's cabinet would decide whether to press ahead with the negotiations. Olmert had scheduled a cabinet meeting for Monday to weigh a possible agreement, but moved it to Tuesday to give his envoys, Yuval Diskin, head of the Shin Bet security service, and negotiator Ofer Dekel, more time to try to seal a deal. "The government will be meeting tomorrow morning and the ministers will be briefed on the negotiations," Regev said. "If there is a need to take decisions, decisions can be taken." Hamas was represented in the talks for the first time by top military commander Ahmed al-Jaabari, a sign, sources said, of their seriousness. Olmert, who has come under mounting public pressure to bring Shalit home, is in the final days of a three-year term marked by a 2006 Lebanon war that many Israelis see as a failure and a 22-day Gaza campaign that ended in January without achieving a complete halt to cross-border rocket fire. Members of Olmert's outgoing administration have warned Hamas publicly that it may find a new government being formed by right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu less willing to deal on prisoners. But the Hamas official said: "We are not pressed for time." "There is room to achieve a breakthrough," the official added. "It needs a decision from the Zionist occupation." Shalit, now 22, was captured in June 2006 by militants who tunnelled into Israel from the Gaza Strip and took him into the Hamas-ruled territory. Abu Ubaida, spokesman of Hamas's armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, said on Sunday that Israel wanted to exile some of the prisoners it has offered to release. "We reject expulsion," he said. "There is no room for more flexibility in our position." Israel has carried out lopsided exchanges in the past, trading large numbers of Arab prisoners for its captured soldiers or their remains
