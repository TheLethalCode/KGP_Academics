 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has announced that a parliamentary committee will be constituted to investigate corruption charges against his predecessor Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar in the face of demands by MPs. He said he would instruct the comptroller and auditor general's office to audit accounts of all speakers in a first such instance in Bangladesh. "As demanded by some of the MPs, I will form the probe committee within two to three days and place the proposal in the House," Hamid told parliament in an unscheduled debate on Sircar, now a BNP candidate for the Bogra-6 constituency in the upcoming by-polls. "The committee will only investigate the alleged corruption of Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar". BNP MP Abul Khayer Bhuiyan demanded that the activities of all speakers should be investigated. Hamid made the announcement as Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta, Fazle Rabbi Mia, Shajahan Khan and Workers' Party MP Rashed Khan Menon demanded formation of the probe committee on Sircar.
