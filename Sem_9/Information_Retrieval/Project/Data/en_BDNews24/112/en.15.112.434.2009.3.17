 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  The security forces will now search the cars of all, barring ministers, state ministers and cabinet division secretary, as part of the government's plan to shore up security at the Bangladesh Secretariat. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar told reporters after a meeting on the issue that the cars of all other VIPs will be allowed in to the Secretariat after scans. All Secretariat staff will have to wear IDs as long as they stay there and show them at the entrance. The home secretary said ministers and state ministers can each have a maximum of 10 visitors' passes issued and all visitors will be frisked. He said the measures were part of the routine exercise when asked if they were acting on the prime minister's warning over militant attacks. Sikdar said the Secretariat and the Bangabhaban would have fire drills on Mar 19 and 22, respectively. He added that the fire chief had been asked to stage similar drills at all the key installations in the capital in the next 15 days
