 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com) - The country's first capital market fair, scheduled to kick off Thursday aims to provide people elementary knowledge on fundamental analysis, advice to brokers and price information for trading decisions, organisers say. Dhaka Sheraton Hotel will organise the three-day event titled 'Share Bazaar Mela' at its Winter Garden. "After the successful Bank and Non-Bank Financial Institutions Fair last year, it will be another step for us to boost our event organisation capacity," Trevor McDonald, general manager of the hotel told a news conference Tuesday. He said the developing nations solely depended on banks for investment financing, which hindered economic growth. "The [capital] market is a major source of funding for industries as well as infrastructural development." Bangladeshi capital market can play an important role by raising funds for infrastructures like roads, bridges, power plants, McDonald said. "That gives an opportunity to integrate people in the growth process." The fair aims to create better investors who can invest comfortably on the stock exchanges, says a statement issued by the organisers. Civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader is expected to inaugurate the fair, said Mahfuzur Rahman, marketing chief of the hotel. "The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, president of Dhaka Stock Exchange and vice president of Chittagong Stock Exchange will attend the event." Explaining the hotel's foothold in event management, he said the move came in line with its parent company's policy.
