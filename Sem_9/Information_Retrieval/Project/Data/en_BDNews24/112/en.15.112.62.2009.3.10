 BERLIN, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Midfielder Hamit Altintop has been added to Bayern Munich's growing injury list ahead of their Champions League tie against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday. "Hamit Altintop was injured in the 5-1 win against Hanover 96 and is not at the coach's disposal for the Sporting match," the club said on their website (www.fcb.de) on Monday. The Turkey international was expected to be out for two to three weeks, the club said. Bayern are already without injured midfielders Franck Ribery and Tim Borowski as well as striker Luca Toni, who is still recovering from a heel injury, for their round of 16 return leg against Sporting.
