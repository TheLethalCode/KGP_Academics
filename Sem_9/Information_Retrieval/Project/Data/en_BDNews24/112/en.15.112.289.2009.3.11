 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)Members of the Scotland Yard, who arrived from the UK Wednesday morning, would not investigate the Feb 25-26 mutiny, rather advise the local investigators, said British high commissioner on Wednesday. "The team is here to provide advice to the Bangladesh law enforcement agencies on how the UK would conduct an investigation of this magnitude," said British high commissioner Stephen Evans. "They are not here to solve the crime. That role must sit rightly with Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies," said Evans at a press briefing at the Lake Shore Hotel in Gulshan in the afternoon. A four-member team of the Scotland Yard, the metropolitan police of the UK, arrived in the morning. The Scotland Yard team would leave Dhaka Saturday, he said. "The team have already met with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Bangladesh police force," said Evans. They visited the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters later in the day. "The Scotland Yard team visited the different crime spots this afternoon. They are studying the case," CID officer Fazlul Kabir told reporters at the BDR gate. "But they are yet to inform about their future course of action," he said. The Scotland Yard team also met their FBI counterparts on Wednesday. Two FBI members, described as an 'advance team', arrived Sunday in response to the Bangladesh government's requests for assistance in the investigation. They spent over two hours Tuesday morning at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters surveying the site of the mutiny. The US agency has said it will set its terms of reference working with local investigators led by the Criminal Investigation Department. The length of their stay depends upon their work, says the government, which sought help from both the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard in the immediate aftermath of the Feb 25-26 mutiny. bdn
