 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League candidate Sheikh Helal Uddin became Tuesday MP Tuesday for Bagerhat-1, one of the two seats vacated by cousin, prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "He was elected uncontested, as the only candidate," returning officer and deputy election commissioner Mohammad Mohsin Ali told bdnews24.com. The relevant papers will be sent on to the Election Commission Wednesday, he said. The vote was due on Apr 2, along with six other by-elections, but the two other Bagherhat-1 candidates failed to pass EC scrutiny. Three Rangpur-6 candidates have challenged the EC decision to cancel their nominations. Rangpur-6 was also won by Hasina in the Dec. 29 general elections. Of the other five vacated seats, Khaleda Zia won Bogra 6-7, H M Ershad Rangpur-3 and Kurigram-2, and president Zillur Rahman Kishoreganj-6. bdnews24.c
