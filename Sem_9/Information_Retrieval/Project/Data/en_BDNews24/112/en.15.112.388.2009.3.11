<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.coim)  The government-instituted committee will not need time beyond the extended Mar 19 deadline to investigation the BDR mutiny, its chief M Anis-uz-Zaman said Wednesday. "Investigations are on fast track and, we hope we will conclude within the new time frame," he told reporters at the Secretariat on the first day of the fresh deadline fixed by the government. The committee, which was formed on Mar 2 to probe the Feb 25-26 BDR carnage, started work on Mar 3. The government granted it another seven working days on request as the probe body failed to finish the task by Mar 9. The new deadline is Mar 19 as there was an official holiday on Mar 10 for Eid-e-Miladunnabi and two weekends in between, Anis added. The original probe committee headed by the home minister was constituted on Feb 26 and reconstituted on Mar 2 with the former bureaucrat made as the new chief. bdnews24.
