 LONDON, March 11 (bdnews 24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool tore Real Madrid apart with a blistering 4-0 win to reach the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday while Premier League rivals Chelsea drew 2-2 with Juventus in Turin to progress 3-2 on aggregate. Bayern Munich cantered into the last eight by routing Portugal's Sporting 7-1 in Germany and 12-1 over the two legs for a Champions League aggregate record victory. Spain's Villarreal won 2-1 against Panathinaikos to edge the tie 3-2. Real, 1-0 down from the first leg, had no answers to a scintillating attacking display from Liverpool who condemned the Spaniards to a last-16 exit for the fifth successive season. Dirk Kuyt squared for Fernando Torres to convert after nine minutes and Steven Gerrard's penalty gave Liverpool a comfortable cushion following Gabriel Heinze's handball. There was no way back for Real when Ryan Babel's cross was finished by Gerrard two minutes after the break and substitute Andrea Dossena put the icing on Liverpool's cake. Chelsea twice came from a goal down to knock out Claudio Ranieri's Juventus. Vincenzo Iaquinta fired the Italians ahead before Michael Essien, making his first start since August, equalised in first-half stoppage time. Juve had Giorgio Chiellini sent off for a second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining. They were given hope when Alessandro del Piero converted a 74th-minute penalty but Didier Drogba, who hit the only goal of the first leg, put the contest beyond their reach seven minutes from time. Having netted five past a hapless Sporting defence in Lisbon, Bayern needed just eight minutes to breach their Portuguese opponents again through Lukas Podolski. Podolski again and an own goal from Anderson Polga made it 3-0 before the Portuguese side got one back through Joao Moutinho. Bayern refused to step off the gas, though, as Bastian Schweinsteiger hit a fourth before halftime and Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose and Thomas Mueller added further goals. Villarreal's Argentine playmaker Ariel Ibagaza scored the opening goal and created his side's second against Greece's Panathinaikos, who had equalised through Vangelis Mantzios.
