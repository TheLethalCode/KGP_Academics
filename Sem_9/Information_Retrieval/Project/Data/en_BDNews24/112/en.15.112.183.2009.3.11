 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  Anxious families who gathered in their hundreds outside the main Peelkhana gate for over a week, waiting to know the fate of their husbands, brothers and sons, were being allowed in to BDR headquarters on Wednesday. Authorities were allowing a maximum of ten family members to enter at a time from the morning. BDR families said they were being asked to register outside the main entrance. After giving names and addresses, they were given tokens with a serial number. One person per family was being allowed in, they said. The first group was taken into the Peelkhana compound at around 11.30am, said bdnews24.com photographer Nashirul Islam. They came out about one and a half hours later, said Islam. They were taken in and came out through two separate narrow passages, he added. Rashida, wife of a border guard, emerged with a gloomy face. She said she was allowed to meet her husband on a parade ground. Asked how the meeting went, she did not reply. Golam Kabir, father of Sepoy Shahiduzzaman, who is trying to contact his son, said he did not receive any piece of information since his son came to report back. "I just wanted to know that my boy is well as my wife is ill through getting no news," he said. Thousands fled Thousands of BDR members fled their Peelkhana headquarters in the capital during or after the Feb 25-26 mutiny that left scores of army officers, deputed to the paramilitary force, killed or missing. The border guards started reporting back to the headquarters in their hundreds between Feb 28 and Mar 2 on a government order that issued a deadline. Since then they have been kept inside the headquarters, with anxious relatives waiting outside. They were not allowed any contact until Wednesday. Allowed in by the handful A total of 245 names were registered up to 4pm, said officials of the information centre at the main gate of BDR headquarters. Remaining families were told to return after five days to resume the registration process. Just seven family members went in the morning and five members, including three children, were allowed to enter in the afternoon meet them. The information centre also said 20 more relatives would be let in Thursday morning. bdnews24.
