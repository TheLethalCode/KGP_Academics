 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  RAB said Wednesday it had found "preliminary proof" of 12 people linked to the BDR mutiny. "We have exacted preliminary proofs of 12 BDR men being involved in the carnage," RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker told reporters at the force's headquarters in the city. He said RAB, army and different intelligence agencies had been helping CID in investigations. The elite force is also cooperating with Operation Rebel Hunt, he said. "In the process, we have detained and questioned 12 BDR men who will be handed to Lalbagh police," Khandaker said. Investigating agencies will then quiz them, he added. The RAB chief said facts could not be disclosed at the moment for the sake of further probe. Lalbagh police filed a case on Feb. 28 against six BDR men and 1,000 unnamed 'mutineers'. 'Prime suspect' remanded for 3 more days Meanwhile, the CID was given another three days to grill one of the alleged ringleaders deputy assistant director Touhidul Alam and five others in the mutiny case. Touhid, DAD Abdur Rahim, Habildar Azad Ali, Nayek Firoz Ahmed and Sepoy Zakir Hossain were originally remanded into CID custody for seven days and cook Amirul Islam for five. They were taken to the Dhaka CMM Court Wednesday, where the chief metropolitan magistrate granted investigating officer Abdur Kahhar Akhand three more days for questioning. Akhand told the court further questioning of the accused was needed to find murder suspects at large and recover looted belongings of more than 50 officers killed during the BDR mutiny. Defence counsels Helal Uddin and M Afanur Rahman Rubel filed bail petitions for the accused. They said the remand requests were not submitted lawfully as a 'case docket' was not placed before the court. The defence lawyers also insisted on a medical check-up of the accused before further interrogation to prevent any human rights violations. The lawyers argued the accused were physically unfit for further interrogation. CID officials replied the accused were in proper custody and were not being abused. Five BDR men including Touhid have been in CID custody since Mar 4 and cook Amirul Islam since Mar 6. Police officer Ekhlasur Rahman told bdnews24.com 52 more BDR men were shown arrested in the Peelkhana case Wednesday. "The number of arrestees in the case now stands at 221," he said. bdne
