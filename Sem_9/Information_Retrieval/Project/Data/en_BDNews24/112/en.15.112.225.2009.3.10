 PORT OF SPAIN, March 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England spinner Monty Panesar has been fined 25 per cent of his match fee for excessive appealing during the fifth test against the West Indies, the International Cricket Council said on Tuesday. "On more than one occasion during the day he began celebrating a prospective dismissal rather than appealing and waiting for the decision to be made, thereby not showing due respect for the role of the umpire," match referee Alan Hurst said in a statement. Panesar took two for 114 in the West Indies first innings. England were 80 for three in their second innings at stumps on day four after taking a first innings lead of two runs. England fast bowler Amjad Khan was let off with a reprimand for a similar offence as he was playing in his first test. The statement said Stuart Broad had been cleared of making public criticism of match officials in a third hearing of the day
