 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Six more BDR members were remanded into CID custody for five days on Monday, in connection with the Peelkhana mutiny case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Md Abdur Rahim issued the order on a petition from investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand. Qahhar said the accused looted an arsenal inside the BDR headquarters during the armed revolt on Feb. 25-26 that left at least 60 army personnel deputed to the Bangladesh Rifles dead or missing. Seven border guards and three civilians were also killed. The six remanded Monday were named as Sepoys Fashiur Rahman, Sirajul Islam, Imran and Shah Alam, BDR medical aide Jamiruddin and cook Shahjahan.
