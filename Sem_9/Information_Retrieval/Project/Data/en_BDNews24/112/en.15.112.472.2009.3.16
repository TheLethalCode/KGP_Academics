 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  A 29-member task force to advise on Bangladesh's response to the global recession will convene from Mar 24, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Monday. "The task force will advise the government on ways to protect the country from the crisis," said Muhith. Its members will include representatives from the major parties, including the main opposition BNP, economists, specialists and businessmen, he said. "The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting earlier today," said Muhith, speaking after a seminar on "Global Financial Crisis and Impact on Bangladesh". The finance minister first announced in January that a task force would be formed to decide the must-dos to face the world recession. On an FBCCI-proposed Tk 6000 crore special package for businesses, the minister said, "The government is yet to decide the amount of money for the package pledged by the government. It will be fixed on careful appraisal." Muhith told the seminar earlier, "The world recession has already started affecting the exports of frozen foods, jute and jute goods and leather. The readymade garment sector is also poised for the impact." "We are keeping a close watch on the global economy, and giving priority to our agriculture and SME sectors." "The government is also looking to boosting employment generation." The minister said the government was contemplating direct foreign investment in the energy sector to resolve the gas and power crisis. He also emphasised the importance of increasing skilled manpower exports to keep the remittance inflow. The seminar was held by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. BIDS director general Kazi Salah Uddin presided, programme director KAS Murshid presented the keynote paper. Former foreign secretary Faruq Sobhan, executive director of Centre for Policy Dialogue Mustafizur Rahman, chairman of Association of Banks Bangladesh Kazi Mahmud Sattar and Prof Syed M Ahsan of Concordia University of Canada also spoke. bdnews
