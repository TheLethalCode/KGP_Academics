 KARACHI. March 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police clashed on Thursday with black-suited lawyers and opposition activists after the launch of a cross-country protest rally in defiance of government attempts to stop it. The so-called long march protest for an independent judiciary could destabilize President Asif Ali Zardari's government at a time when the nuclear-armed U.S. ally faces severe problems from Islamist militants and a sinking economy. Pakistan is vital to U.S. efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan and defeat al Qaeda. The United States wants Pakistan to focus on fighting militancy rather than on political power plays. Authorities banned rallies and detained hundreds of political activists Wednesday. But Thursday, the year-old civilian coalition government scrambled for a way to avert a showdown and Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said the long march that set out from the cities of Karachi and Quetta would be allowed to go ahead. "We'll not stop them, but if someone tries to take the law in his hand I must say in the house that he won't be allowed," Malik told the National Assembly. "This is a war for power and rule and unless we get out of this sphere, such things will keep on happening." Earlier in Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, paramilitary soldiers and police ringed the High Court where lawyers were assembling, stopping their cars and buses from approaching. Police lashed out with batons to disperse a crowd of members of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party allied with the lawyers outside the court. Undeterred, several hundred lawyers streamed out of the building on foot, where they joined the political activists. Protesters were later allowed to board buses and cars and head out of the city but they were stopped at a toll gate on the outskirts where police scuffled with protesters and arrested several leaders including Munir A. Malik, a former president of the Supreme Court bar association. "This movement is unstoppable. We'll fill the prisons," Malik said by telephone from a police van. Police said 150 activists had been detained in the city of Hyderabad, to the north of Karachi. "PLOT" Opposition leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has thrown his weight behind the lawyers, putting him into open confrontation with Zardari. Infuriated by a Supreme Court ruling barring him and his brother from elected office, and by Zardari ejecting his party from power in Punjab province and imposing central rule, Sharif has called the protest a defining moment for Pakistan. Stoking tension in a country with a grim record of assassinations, a spokesman for Sharif said the government had "hatched a plot" to kill him. Zardari's spokesman dismissed that as "political gimmickry" and said the Sharif bothers had been promised full security. As the protest got under way, a coalition partner said Zardari had agreed to two opposition demands, without giving details. The comments by Asfandyar Wali Khan, whose Awami National Party heads a government in the North West Frontier province, raised hopes for reconciliation. Sharif told Reuters last week his main demands were the restoration of the judge and a reversal of last month's court ruling. In another sign of possible compromise, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said late Wednesday, after meeting with army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, that the government wanted central rule in Punjab to end. If the crisis gets out of hand, the army, which has ruled for more than half the country's 61 years of history, could feel compelled to intervene, though analysts have little expectation that Pakistan would revert to military rule now. Lawyers also set off from Quetta, capital of Baluchistan province. The protesters hope to converge on Islamabad Monday to demand the reinstatement of former Supreme Court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. He was dismissed by former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf in 2007. Protesters plan a sit-in near parliament, although the government, which came to power after elections last year after nine years of military rule, has said they will not be allowed into the city center. Zardari has refused to reinstate Chaudhry. Analysts say he fears the judge could nullify an amnesty Musharraf granted Zardari and his late wife Benazir Bhutto. Worry about turmoil has weighed on financial markets but the main stock index was more than 2 percent higher on hope for an interest rate cut, dealers said. The rupee was flat.
