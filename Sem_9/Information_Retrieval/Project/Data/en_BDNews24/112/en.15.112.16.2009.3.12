 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The CID were given another three days Wednesday to grill six BDR men, including DAD Touhidul Alam, in the mutiny case. DAD Touhid, DAD Abdur Rahim, Habildar Azad Ali, Nayek Firoz Ahmed and Sepoy Zakir Hossain were originally remanded into CID custody for seven days and cook Amirul Islam for five. They were taken to the Dhaka CMM court on Wednesday, where the chief metropolitan magistrate granted CID investigating officer Abdur Kahhar Akhand three more days for questioning. Defence counsels Helal Uddin and M Afanur Rahman Rubel filed bail petitions for the accused saying the remand requests were not submitted lawfully as a 'case docket' was not placed before the court. The IO in his remand prayer said further questioning of the accused was needed to find murder suspects at large and recover looted belongings of more than 50 officers killed during the BDR mutiny. The defense lawyers insisted on a medical check-up of the accused before further interrogation, to prevent any human rights violations. The lawyers argued the accused were physically unfit for further interrogation. CID officials said the accused were in proper custody and were not being abused. Five BDR men including Touhid have been in CID custody since Mar 4 and cook Amirul Islam since Mar 6. Police officer Ekhlasur Rahman told bdnews24.com 52 more BDR men were shown arrested in the Peelkhana case. "The number of arrestees in the case now stands at 221," he said. bdne
