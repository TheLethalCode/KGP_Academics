<TITLE> NATO must deepen engagement with Pakistan: Scheffer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, Thu Mar 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO must deepen its engagement with Pakistan, ensure it has sufficient troops in Afghanistan and keep up a dialogue with Russia, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Thursday. "Of course we need to look beyond Afghanistan... and especially Pakistan, with which we must deepen our engagement," Scheffer told a conference in Budapest on the 10th anniversary of the accession of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO. He also said NATO must ensure it has enough troops in Afghanistan as that country prepares for elections. "We must ensure that we have sufficient troops on the ground to enforce security both during and after the coming election period," Scheffer said. He said NATO had considerable success in training and equipping the Afghan national army. "But there's a lot we and the international community as a whole can do on the civilian side as well in helping the Afghans to build functioning institutions, to fight crime and corruption and get a better grip on the narcotics problem," he said. US President Barack Obama last month approved the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan as Washington and other NATO nations try to stabilize the country, where insurgent violence is at its highest since US-led forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001. Other NATO countries are under pressure to boost troop commitments to the international operation in Afghanistan, though some are reluctant to do so. Scheffer also said NATO disagreed with Russia on several issues, including Georgia or the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but its relationship with Russia was too important to get stuck over those differences. "It is clear that the NATO-Russia relationship is too valuable to be stuck in debates over enlargement, or for that matter missile defence, or for that matter Kosovo," Scheffer said. "Afghanistan is one key area where we have obvious common interests but there are other areas as well, such as the fight against terrorism (and) piracy," he added. NATO agreed on March 5 to resume formal ties with Russia, suspended after Moscow's war with Georgia, in the hope of winning greater Russian support for its struggle to stabilise Afghani
