 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  The law minister, after a meeting with the attorney general and the army's judge advocate general Wednesday, said trial of the BDR mutineers under the Army Act is still being considered to fast-track the dispensation of justice. "Since Bangladesh Rifles is a 'disciplinary force' and it killed officers of another 'disciplinary force' their trial could be possible through notification under the 1952 Act," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters. The Speedy Tribunal, International Crime Act 1973, Special Tribunal and other laws were also discussed and the meeting decided that the trial might be held under the Army Act to make it faster, he said. He said among the laws in force, only the Army Act can ensure a quick trial, he said. "There is the need to amend the constitution if the trial is to be held in Special Tribunal. Asked if one sentenced to death in a trial under the Army Act would be executed in the firing squad, the minister said everything would be done according to that act. "Our neighbouring country has held trials under this act in such event. We are also looking at the possibilities of trial under this act." "If involvement of any civilians in the incident is found, they will also be tried under the Army Act," he said. "The accused will be allowed to appoint counsels and have the opportunity to defend themselves." The meeting was also attended by state minister for law Quamrul Islam and additional attorney general Enayetur Rahim, among others. bdnews24.co
