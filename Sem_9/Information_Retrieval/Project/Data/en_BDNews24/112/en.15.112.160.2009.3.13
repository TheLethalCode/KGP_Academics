 BRUSSELS, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA want Italian police to beef up security for this season's Champions League final after an Arsenal fan was stabbed before a match in Rome on Wednesday, but have no plans to move the showpiece from the capital. "We are two months from the event, so it is not really possible. We are not thinking of moving the final at this stage," William Gaillard, special advisor to UEFA president Michel Platini, told Reuters on Thursday. "This was a regrettable incident and any incident like this is one too many. We have been speaking to the Italian authorities regularly in the run up to final and we will be asking them to step up their efforts in light of this event." An Arsenal fan was stabbed in the leg and two others were injured in incidents before the London side's Champions League win over AS Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. The stab victim was attacked after AS Roma fans boarded a bus taking Arsenal supporters to the stadium but was not in a life-threatening condition, the English club said in a statement. Gaillard said the exit of Roma and Italy's other remaining clubs from European soccer's top competition this week will help to police the final on May 27. "Roma has no become a defacto neutral venue for the final which should make life easier. Wednesday's incident gives us food for thought, but we are confident we will have everything in place to ensure a safe final for all fans," Gaillard said
