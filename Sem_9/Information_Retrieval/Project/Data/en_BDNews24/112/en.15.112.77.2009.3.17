 BUENOS AIRES, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wilstermann midfielder Francisco Esteche kicked the referee in anger after being sent off in a Bolivian championship match at the weekend. Universidad Catolica beat arch-rivals Colo Colo 1-0 in Chile while two of Colombia's most popular clubs, Atletico Nacional and Millonarios, both drew and occupy the last two places in the table. BOLIVIA Francisco Esteche faces a ban of up to 40 games after his astonishing loss of temper in Wilstermann's 2-2 draw at home to Universitario de Sucre. Esteche was booked for dissent in the 34th minute and reacted by pushing referee Joaquin Antequera, which earned him a red card. The furious Paraguayan then kicked the official while his team mates also protested and had to be calmed by their coach. "He pushed me, so I showed him the red card and then he kicked me twice," Antequera was quoted as saying in La Razon newspaper. Nicolas Raimondi scored twice in three minutes to put Universitario ahead after halftime but the Aviators fought back to draw with goals from Pablo Salinas and Edgar Olivares. Universitario had Rolando Ribera sent off midway though the second half. There was more controversy in Oriente Petrolero's 2-1 win over The Strongest when television replays showed that Miguel Angel Cuellar used his hand to score Oriente's first goal in the 34th minute. The Strongest goalkeeper Damian Grosso was booked for protesting and later sent off after receiving another yellow card. Limberg Gutierrez equalised in the 53rd minute before Wilmer Zabala scored the winner eight minutes later to give Argentine coach Pablo Sanchez his first win. CHILE Universidad Catolica beat Colo Colo 1-0 in Sunday's derby with a 14th minute goal from Matias Rubio, who collected a pass in midfield, broke forward and found the top corner from the edge of the penalty area. The win enabled Catolica's outspoken coach Marco Antonio Figueroa to continue a run of success against Colo Colo which he also enjoyed last year in charge of Cobreloa. "Colo Colo still haven't been able to beat me as a coach," he said. Palestino's Juan Manuel Quevedo scored a hat-trick of penalties in his team's 4-2 win over Universidad de Concepcion. Roman Cuello scored the other goal and Julio Cesar Laffatigue replied twice for the visitors. PARAGUAY Olimpia, who fired coach Ever Almeida last week despite being unbeaten in their first four games, suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home to promoted Rubio Nu in their first match under his replacement Gregorio Perez. Sabino Leiva scored in the eighth minute for Rubio Nu, who are coached by former Paraguay defender Francisco Arce. Leaders Cerro Porteno have a maximum 15 points from five games in the Apertura championship after coming from behind to beat Sol de America 2-1 despite a missed penalty by Walter Fretes on the half hour. Cesar Ramirez and Jorge Britez scored in the second half to wipe out Carlos Alvarenga's early strike. Libertad, champions four times in a row, lost 2-1 to Sportivo Luqueno and dropped to seventh with seven points. COLOMBIA Thirteen-times champions Millonarios were held 1-1 at home by Once Caldas, leaving them 17th in the 18-team Apertura championship table with five points from seven games. Former South American champions Atletico Nacional, another popular side, are bottom with four points after drawing 2-2 at Cucuta. Titleholders America, 13th with eight points, also drew, 1-1 at home to Boyaca Chico. URUGUAY Nineteen-year-old Jonathan Ramis, who had made only two brief substitute appearances for Penarol, scored twice after replacing experienced Carlos Bueno to give them a 2-0 win over Cerro Lago. The win left Penarol level on 10 points from four games with Defensor Sporting at the top of the championship's second stage. Defensor came from behind to beat River Plate 3-1. PERU Modest Juan Aurich went top of the 2009 championship's first stage with a 1-0 win at CNI thanks to a 77th minute goal from William Chiroque while titleholders Deportivo San Martin came from behind to beat Melgar 3-1. ECUADOR Army club El Nacional went top of the 2009 championship's first stage with a 2-0 win over troubled Barcelona. Ronald Campos opened the scoring in the seventh minute and Jorge Ladines added the second on the break 12 minutes from time. El Nacional lead on goal difference from Espoli and Macara
