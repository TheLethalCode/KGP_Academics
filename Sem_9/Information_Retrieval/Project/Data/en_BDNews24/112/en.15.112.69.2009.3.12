 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has cancelled nomination of 10 of the 29 candidates for by-elections to seven parliamentary constituencies slated for Apr 2. The returning officers cancelled two each for Rangpur-3, Kurigram-2 and Bagerhat-1, three for Rangpur-6 and one for Kishoreganj-6, Farhad Ahmed Khan, senior assistant secretary (election) told bdnews24.com Wednesday. The nominations were cancelled on allegations of loan default, fake signatures of voters and being candidates from more than one party, he said. Those who had their nomination cancelled can petition the EC on Mar 12-14, Khan said. The commission would receive appeals from the appellants from 8am to 5pm, including Friday and Saturday. Candidates can withdraw their nominations until Mar 17. However, the commission would end hearing on appeals before the withdrawal, he added. The nomination papers were filed until Mar 9.
