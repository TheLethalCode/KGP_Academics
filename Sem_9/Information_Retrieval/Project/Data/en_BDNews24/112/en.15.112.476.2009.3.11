 Dhaka, March 11(bdnews24.com)  A second FBI team will arrive in Dhaka soon to directly assist the investigation into the Peelkhana tragedy, the US ambassador said Wednesday. James F Moriarty spoke to reporters after an hour-long meeting with home minister Sahara Khatun and state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed at the Secretariat. Moriarty said the US supports the democratic process in Bangladesh, which was why the FBI was assisting the investigation on the government's request. He said he hoped there would be a transparent investigation which would be accepted by the people of Bangladesh. An 'advance' two-member team of the US agency has been in Dhaka since Sunday, meeting CID investigators and visiting the site of the mutiny. A four-member Scotland Yard team also arrived on Wednesday to advise local investigators. The envoy said he would urge his government to send the second team as soon as possible. Tanzim said they discussed how and in what way the FBI can help and how the enquiries can be coordinated. bdnews24.c
