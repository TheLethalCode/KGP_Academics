 CHENNAI Mon Mar 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamil Nadu opposition leader J.

The only thing slowing its advance is tens of thousands of civilians, mostly being held by the LTTE at gunpoint and suffering in what aid agencies say are dire conditions in a narrow 12-km coastal strip the army has declared a no-fire zone. Hundreds of people have marched in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere in India in the last few months in support of Sri Lankan Tamils.
