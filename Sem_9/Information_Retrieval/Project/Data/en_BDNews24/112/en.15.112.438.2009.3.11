 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)A four-member Scotland Yard team arrived from the UK Wednesday to assist in the BDR mutiny investigation. A spokesperson for the British High Commission in Dhaka said they arrived around 9am. Two members of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, described as an 'advance team', arrived in Bangladesh on Sunday, in response to the Bangladesh government's requests for assistance in the investigation. The FBI men spent over two hours Tuesday morning at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters surveying the site of the mutiny. The US agency has said it will set its terms of reference working with local investigators led by the Criminal Investigation Department. The length of their stay depends upon their work, says the government, which sought help from both the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Scotland Yard in the immediate aftermath of the Feb 25-26 mutiny.
