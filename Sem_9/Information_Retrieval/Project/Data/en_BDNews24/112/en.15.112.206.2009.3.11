 Chittagong, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion started grilling nine border guards in the port city over rebellious actions at the Satkania Baitul Ijjat training centre in the wake of the Feb. 25-26 mutiny at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka. Nine BDR men were taken to Chittagong's RAB-7 office from the training centre in the morning for interrogation. "Grilling started in separate cells," the RAB-7 assistant director, ASP Mizanur Rahman, told bdnews24.com. "We cannot reveal the detainees' names as their involvement in any BDR violence is yet to be ascertained," he added. As news of the Peelkhana mutiny in the capital spread, disgruntled personnel around the country took up arms in rebellion. Border guards at Satkania Baitul Ijjat, the country's largest BDR training centre, started fires, vandalised their barracks and staged demonstrations. "The interrogation team is grilling them to find out the perpetrators of the incidents," said Rahman. The RAB officer said the detained personnel had given some important information. "We will disclose the findings from the interrogation in time," he added. bdnews
