<TITLE> Kallis named captain after selectors change mind </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, March 12 (bdnews24.com) - Ashwell Prince's appointment as South Africa's Test captain has lasted less than 24 hours. The day after Prince was named as the stand-in leader for the Cape Town Test in the absence of Graeme Smith, Cricket South Africa (CSA) reversed its decision and instead handed the captaincy to Jacques Kallis. Kallis will lead the side in a one-off capacity in the third Test at Newlands, which begins on March 19. A CSA statement said the decision was made to allow Prince to concentrate solely on his new position as opening batsman. Normally a middle-order player, Prince has been thrust into the opening role because the selectors were reluctant to tamper with their successful middle order of Hashim Amla, Kallis, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy. Prince was overlooked for the first two Tests after Duminy cemented his role during the tour of Australia, when Prince had a broken thumb. Prince, usually the vice-captain of the side under Smith, has led South Africa in two Tests. Kallis also captained South Africa during the final Test of Australia's previous tour, again when Smith was injured. Courtesy : Cric
