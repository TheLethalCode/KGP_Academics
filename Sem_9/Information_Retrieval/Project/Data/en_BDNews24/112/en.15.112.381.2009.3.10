 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)A two-member FBI team, in Bangladesh to assist the investigation into the BDR mutiny, spent over two hours Tuesday morning at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. "The FBI men, accompanied by CID investigators, were there from about 10am to 12.15pm," said the CID investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhan. The visiting agents reportedly viewed key sites within the complex, including Darbar Hall, and the shallow graves from which scores of bodies were unearthed in the days following the massacre that left at least 70 dead, mostly army officers. The FBI men, described as an 'advance team', arrived in Bangladesh on Sunday, in response to the Bangladesh government's requests for assistance in the investigation. They may also provide forensic expertise to trace bodies of still-missing army officers. The US agency will set its terms of reference working with local investigators led by the Criminal Investigation Department. The length of their stay depends upon their work, says the government, which sought help from both the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the UK's Scotland Yard in the immediate aftermath of the Feb 25-26 mutiny. A team from Scotland Yard is expected to arrive Wednesday.
