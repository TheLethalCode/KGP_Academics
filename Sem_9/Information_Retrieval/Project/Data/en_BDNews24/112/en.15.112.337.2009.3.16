<TITLE> Pakistan defuses crisis, agrees to restore judge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's government agreed on Monday to reinstate Iftikhar Chaudhry as chief justice in a surprise move to defuse a crisis and end agitation by lawyers and activists that had threatened to turn into violent confrontation. Chaudhry's reinstatement will cool tension but friction is likely to persist between President Asif Ali Zardari, who analysts say has been weakened by the controversy over the judge, and his emboldened rival, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. "It's the first time in the history of Pakistan that a movement launched by the middle class has proved successful," said retired judge Tariq Mehmud, a leader of the lawyers. Chaudhry became a cause celebre after being dismissed in late 2007 by then-president and army chief General Pervez Musharraf, apparently because Musharraf feared the judge would challenge his constitutionally questionable strategy to hold on to power. Opposition leader Sharif had thrown his support behind the anti-government lawyers' campaign that was bringing added turmoil to nuclear-armed Pakistan, where the government has already been struggling to stem militancy and revive a flagging economy. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani made the announcement in a televised address to the nation. Afterwards, Sharif called off a "long march" protest making its way to the capital, Islamabad. The crisis gripping the Muslim nation had alarmed the United States and Britain, which fear any slide into chaos would help the Taliban and al Qaeda become stronger in Pakistan. The United States welcomed Chaudhry's reinstatement. "This is a statesmanlike decision taken to defuse a serious confrontation, and the apparent removal of this long-standing national issue is a substantial step towards national reconciliation," the U.S. embassy said. The main stock index, which has been hurt by political worry, surged more than 5 percent on Monday. It had fallen 1.9 percent this year after a 58.3 percent slide last year. Some analysts saw Chaudhry's comeback adding to Pakistan's complexities. "The reinstatement ... will further complicate politics," said Brian Cloughley, a British defence analyst familiar with Pakistan. "Nobody knows what his allegiance is, in terms of Pakistan's constitution." Zardari, elected by parliament six months ago, had feared Chaudhry could wage a vendetta against Musharraf, which could also threaten Zardari's own position. Although he has a majority in parliament, Zardari's retreat on the issue will raise questions about his future and enhance Sharif's standing. Zardari yielded after Sharif and the lawyers held a day of protest in Lahore and set off for Islamabad for a sit-in outside parliament. Authorities had put shipping containers and trucks on roads to stop the protesters entering the capital. Chaudhry will be reinstated on March 21 when the incumbent retires. "CAUTIOUS PATH" Some analysts saw the move as helping stability in the long term as well as cooling the immediate situation. Professor and analyst Rasul Bakhsh Rais told Reuters that Chaudhry's reinstatement would enhance stability by restoring faith in the system. The judge with a reputation for ruffling feathers would be prudent, he said. "The judiciary will be treading a very cautious path. Zardari is already politically wounded, I don't think the opposition or the judiciary are going to go for the kill." Jubilant lawyers gathered outside Chaudhry's residence, which he refused to vacate after his dismissal when Musharraf declared emergency rule in a desperate move to extend his presidency for another term. Chaudhry briefly stepped outside to greet supporters and wave to the cameras. Western diplomats had tried to make Zardari pull out of a collision that could have destabilised the year-old civilian coalition and forced a reluctant army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to intervene. Kayani was involved in negotiations that led to the judge's restoration. Sharif, a two-time prime minister with conservative, religious-nationalist support, was overthrown by Musharraf in 1999. Since returning from exile in 2007 he has become Pakistan's most popular politician, thanks partly to his stand on the judge. Sharif was conciliatory, congratulating Zardari and Gilani. "We have got the fruit of our two-year struggle," Sharif told supporters in Gujranwala town where the protest procession stopped when news came through of the government's decision. Zardari, widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was elected by parliament last September after forcing Musharraf to quit the presidency. Deeply unpopular, Zardari was further damaged when he broke a promise to Sharif last year to reappoint Chaudhry. Sharif latched onto Chaudhry's cause two years ago, but the latest crisis began when Zardari ejected Sharif's party from power in Punjab last month, after the Supreme Court barred Sharif and his brother from holding elected office. In a first step toward reconciliation, the government said on Saturday it would seek a review of that court ru
