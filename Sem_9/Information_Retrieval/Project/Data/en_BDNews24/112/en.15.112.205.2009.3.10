 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)Clashes between Chhatra League activists at Jahangirnagar University sparked off again Tuesday, despite the dissolution of the university's BCL unit by central leaders last month. Supporters of the dissolved unit's president attacked at least 15 students of a "rival BCL faction" and ousted them from Mir Mosharraf Hossain Hall, said the hall's residents. JU proctor Arju Miah, confirming the incident, told bdnews24.com, "We will take strong action against the perpetrators." bdnews24.com's correspondent reported that the injured students were admitted to Savar Enam Medical College Hospital. Five of them were said to be "in critical condition". Bangladesh Chhatra League dissolved its JU unit on Feb 17, after weeks of bloody clashes between BCL factions over control of residential halls. BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon said at the time those who perpetrated the violence would be disciplined by the central committee of the Awami League-backed student body. He also said they had asked JU authorities to take academic and legal actions against the perpetrators. bdne
