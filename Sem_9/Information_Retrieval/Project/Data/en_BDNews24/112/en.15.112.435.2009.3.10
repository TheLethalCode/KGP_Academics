 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury Tuesday said the past BNP-led government had let party supporters live off fertiliser dealership. She also came down hard on the military-installed interim government for its poor fertiliser management. "Everyone knows the extent of irregularities and unfair means (in fertilizer sector) over the last seven years," Motia told an international conference on plant breeding and seed for food security in the city. "We have taken proper initiatives to reach the fertiliser to the farmers in time." Local government officials including deputy commissioners, UNOs and agriculture officials have been ordered to supervise the distribution and other measures, she added. Motia said transparency and accountability would be ensured in case of fuel price reduction through subsidies. Food and Agriculture Organisation representative Ad Spijkers said the challenge was to sustain farm production in the face of climate changes. "Scientists and breeders of Bangladesh have always taken the challenges of fulfilling the demand of food in the past; but will certainly require more specific and collaborative attention to the problems in future.," he said. The three-day conference organised by the Plant Breeding and Genetics Society of Bangladesh will end on Mar. 12. Food minister Abdur Razzaque, Bangladesh Seed Growers, Dealers and Merchants Association president Mahbub Anam, Prof Lutfur Rahman and Dr M Shahinur Rashid also spoke. PBGSB chairman Dr Kazi M Baruddoza presided. bd
