 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)Seven bodies of BDR men were recovered alongside those of army officers in the aftermath of the Feb 25-26 massacre at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. The bereaved families claim that the seven had been shot dead while combating the rebels during the two-day mutiny. They also complained of neglect at every turn, following the deaths of their loved ones. The lack of support from law enforcing authorities and local administration and the financial hardships to be faced have left them totally helpless, they say. Rabeya worries about son's studies Rabeya Khatun, wife of Lance Nayek Md Bashiruddin, said her husband left their BDR residence after breakfast on Feb 25 never to return. To save her five-year old son Opu, she fled the Peelkhana headquarters empty-handed on Feb 27. Rabeya eventually found her husband's corpse that night at Mitford Hospital morgue. She borrowed money from relatives to bury her husband in Jhenidah that very night. Bashir was recruited as a clerk with the border force in 1996. "My husband was an innocent clerk. Loyal to the officers. The rebels killed him," said Rabeya with conviction. "Bashir admitted Opu to the BDR primary school only this year. What will happen now that I have lost everything?" Rabeya said she had heard the prime minister announcing that the government would bear education expenses of the dead army officers' children. She said she would very much like the government to dole out similar aid to her family, so that she could continue Opu's education. "My son and I have temporarily put up with my brothers, which embarrasses me. Bashir's folks have offered to shelter us, but his brothers are poor farmers," said Rabeya. 'Look after my wife if I die' Ruhul Amin, a poor farmer's son from Islampur in Gaibandha, had joined BDR five years ago straight from school. He married Sumana just one and a half years ago. Mukul Hossain, Ruhul's father, told bdnews24.com: "My son phoned on February 25 at 9am amid the gunfire and chaos to tell us that he didn't know what was going. He phoned again at 11 am and asked us to take care of Sumana in case of his death." "We never spoke again," Mukul said. The father rushed to Dhaka on Feb 26. After searching about for two days, he saw Ruhul's photo posted at the Red Crescent Society's office and retrieved the body from Mitford Hospital morgue. 'My father wasn't a rebel!' Ashraful Alam Hannan, son of Subedar Major Nurul Islam, wants to know why his father was deprived of a proper burial "with state honours". Ashraf, an MBA student at Asia Pacific University, says: "My father didn't take part in the mutiny" "On February 25 at Darbar Hall, BDR's DG told my father to call everybody together to discuss their demands and grievances," said the son. "As he started miking the announcement, some soldiers sprayed him with bullets. He died on the spot. "A number of surviving officers' in interviews with the media have said my father was not a mutineer." After looking for the dead body for six days, the family finally located it at Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue, he said. The family carried the body to Luxmipur for burial. "We don't know what to do, whom to approach. We don't know when we can go back to our Peelkhana residence. We are awaiting the government's call." 'Moni trembles at the slightest noise' Fourteen year-old Jannatul Ferdous Moni, daughter of battalion head clerk Subedar Assistant Abul Kashem killed in BDR mayhem, trembles at the slightest noise since that bloody day, says her mother. Moni and mother Akter Banu were at their Peelkhana residence when Kashem was "shot by BDR soldiers in front of us", said his wife. They are now back in their village home in Choubarhia. "Nobody has come to us with a word of solace since. God knows what has happened to our home and possessions." "How will I take care of my children?" she asked. Awal was just 7 months from retirement Assistant Director Khandakar Md Abdul Awal was to complete his service and retire in September, his younger brother Khandakar Farukh Ahmed said. One of Awal's sons is Major Khandakar Monir Hossain, posted in Mymensingh. Another is Dr Khandakar Dilshad Hossain working at a Bogra hospital. Finding Awal's dead body at Mitford Hospital morgue on Feb 27, two days after the carnage, the family took the body to their Delduar home in Tangail for burial. "My brother was certainly not a rebel, or he wouldn't have been shot. Nor was he a fugitive," sdaid Farukh. 'The government doesn't even mention the BDR victims' Forty year-old Lance Nayek Md Manik was shot in the back of the head during the BDR mutiny, says his father. "He wasn't a rebel." "My son phoned on that day at around 9am to tell us that he was surrounded by gunfire. The next morning, we went to Dhaka and found Manik's dead body at Mitford Hospital morgue," said Saber Ali Sarkar's. "My son couldn't have been a rebel, or who would have shot him in the back? But now the government is regarding us as families of mutineers! They are busy only with the army officers' families." 'We don't know where to go for any assistance," said Saber. Relatives can't be found BDR deputy assistant director Masum Khan from Natore also died in the mutiny. But his relatives could not be contacted. bdnews2
