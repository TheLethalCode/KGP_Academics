 BRUSSELS, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Vice President Joe Biden urged NATO allies on Tuesday to help the United States tackle worsening security conditions in Afghanistan, warning that the situation posed a threat to the West as a whole. "The deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the United States but to every single nation round this table," Biden told representatives of the 26-nation military pact during a visit to Brussels. "It was from the very same mountains that the attacks of 9/11 were planned," he said. US-backed forces drove the Taliban from power in Kabul in 2001 in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. targets planned by Osama bin Laden from bases in Afghanistan. Western powers are increasingly concerned not only by the Taliban's advances in Afghanistan, but also by its growing influence in Pakistan, where Islamic militants have disrupted NATO's supply convoys to Afghanistan and are securing concessions from the government in Islamabad. Biden said US President Barack Obama wanted to consult with allies on a new strategy for the region and that Washington would "expect everyone to keep whatever commitments were made in arriving at that joint strategy". Obama last month approved the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan as Washington and other NATO nations try to stabilise the country, where insurgent violence is at its highest since the Taliban were toppled. Biden stressed that his trip to Brussels was intended simply to listen to the United States' allies, who faced calls by the former Bush administration to deploy more troops in what often became noisy transatlantic slanging matches over strategy. "When we consult ... we get the type of consensus that our political leadership needs," Biden said. "Absent that kind of cohesion, it will be incredibly more difficult to meet the common threats we are going to face." Obama has said he will make announcements about US policy on Afghanistan before a NATO summit in France in April
