 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)The country's top fire official admits that high-rise blazes above 14 storeys are beyond the capacity of the fire service in its present state to tackle, though buildings as high as 37 floors are under construction in the capital. Dhaka city had 11 fire stations in 1972, says another top official, but only one has been built since. The ineptness and inadequacy of the fire service and their fire fighting equipment were once again glaringly apparent during the recent Basundhara City blaze. The fire service directorate, a most crucial public service organisation, has suffered acute manpower and capacity shortages since inception. Though buildings as high as the 37-storey City Centre are under construction, our national fire fighters have the technological capacity to douse fires up to a height of just 14 storeys to date. They don't have hydraulic cutters required for cutting concrete floors or walls, which arises as a necessity in rescue operations. Fire chief Brig Gen Abu Nayyim Mohammad Shahidullah admitted that are virtually resigned when a fire erupts at any height above 14 storeys. "Following the fire accident at BCIC Bhaban on February 27, 2007, the directorate had asked the government to supply four area loaders. For rescuing people trapped on the upper floors, 11 equipment including turntable ladders were also sought," said the director general of fire services and civil defence. "Out of the whole lot of requested equipment, only one Finnish Bronto skylift of 55 metre length was supplied two months back, which can reach a height of 150 feet and spray water. "The older lifts could reach up to 11th floor. After the Basundhara fire, everyone has become suddenly aware of the need for modernising the fire service. "Our former request for equipment is still lying with the government. We'll send similar requests again if the government wants it." MA Mizanur Rahman, deputy director, Dhaka division of the fire services said, "Due to the shortage of both manpower and equipment, we are not in a position to handle two fire accidents occurring simultaneously." "Moreover, an old, dilapidated TTL imported in 1983 is still being used in firefighting, which may break down totally at any time. "Though every fire station is supposed to have an aerial platform ladder, only Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna have it. The stations also lack in supplies of portable generators, lighting units, fire detection devices, cutting tools etc." The fire fighters often have to cut through stuck doors, wearning masks and fireproof overalls. But they don't have necessary breathing apparatus, masks, lock cutters or concrete cutters. The fire fighting equipment are also ages old. They don't even have supplies of gumboots and therefore, get injured often. An official who participated at the Basundhara City fire crusades Friday said, they don't have sufficient quantities of fire suits, which was why only 30 of the total 183 fighters working at the site wore fire suits, which protect the wearers against 1200 degrees Celcius blazes. Major Sheikh Mohammad Shah Jalal, director (operation), fire services headquarters told bdnews24.com, "Dhaka city had 11 fire stations in 1972 after the independence. Only one more at Baridhara has been added since, though the city area and population have swelled manifold." "The ramshackle stations boast a water carrier and a pickup van each as equipment in most cases. All of those water haulers of all the city stations were parked before the Basundhara City through Friday helplessly as the blaze roared through its top floors. "The Sadarghat station is not even stationary, as it doesn't own any land for setting up an office and other infrastructure. The mobile station doesn't come to much help in case of fire, as it has to change address at all times." The official said, as per 1972 organogram of the service, each of the first class fire stations have an authorised strength of 30 personnel, the second class ones 22 and the third class stations, 20, which also hasn't seen any revision or expansion since. Selim Newaz Bhuiyan, former deputy director, Dhaka division now preparing to go on leave prior to retirement (LPR), who has the experience of leading important operations including Rangs Bhaban demolition told bdnews24.com, "The fire fighters are very brave, but they need appropriate training and necessary equipment to be effective." "Some officers receive training all right, but it's the firemen who need it first. "A number of factors including non-disbursement of risk allowance, absence of medical allowance, lack of promotions and pension facilities compel the firemen put on a gloomy face." Fire service officials said, along with appointing the service with modern equipment, appropriate training is a must to render the firemen more effective. "Almost all the highrise buildings have firefighting equipment, but the residents hardly know how to use them," said Shah Jalal. "Some organisations behave in a more responsible manner though. They organise fire fight training for their own personnel. "In some highrise fire accidents, we have witnessed people extinguishing fires themselves, averting huge losses successfully."
