<TITLE> Japan PM Aso won't resign, ex-rival says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's troubled Prime Minister Taro Aso won't step down despite abysmal poll ratings, Yuriko Koike, a former rival for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said in an interview on Monday. With Japan in the midst of a deepening recession and facing an election in a few months, there have been calls for Aso's resignation even from within his own party. Asked whether she would stand for the leadership again if Aso quit, Koike said that would not arise. "First of all, I don't think Prime Minister Aso will resign," she said. "That's because he's very confident in himself." Koike, a telegenic former newscaster who has served as environment minister and briefly as the country's first female defence minister, lost to Aso in a party leadership election in September and has since remained out of the cabinet. She has been tipped as a possible first woman prime minister for Japan but Koike said she did not believe a change in leadership at this stage would help the LDP, nor that the conditions were right for her to throw her hat into the ring. After governing almost continuously for more than half a century, the LDP risks losing to the main opposition Democratic Party in a general election due by October. "We have changed leaders three times already," she said. "I don't think a simple change of leadership would satisfy the Japanese public." Aso's two immediate predecessors each resigned in despair as they failed to make headway with parliament's opposition-controlled upper house, which can delay legislation. The only way for the LDP to restore its fortunes was to devise and carry out effective policies to deal with the economic crisis, Koike said. "Looking at the state of the economy, we are not in a situation to call a general election," she said, but declined to comment on the best timing for the vote, which is decided by the prime minister and must be held by October. Koike, who has a history of switching political parties, once allying herself with Ichiro Ozawa, the current leader of the Democrats, said the LDP risked falling apart if it lost power at the next election. "You could say that being in power is what holds the LDP together," she said. "So losing the election would strengthen the forces that tend to pull it apart," she added, saying the same logic applied to the Democratic Party. She warned that a collapsed LDP would prevent Japan escaping its tradition of operating as a virtual one-party state. "A two-party system means that one party can check the party in power and offer the public a choice," she said. "If the LDP crumbles into dust, there will never be a two-party sys
