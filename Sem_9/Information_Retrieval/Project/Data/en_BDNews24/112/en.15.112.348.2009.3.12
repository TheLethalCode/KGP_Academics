 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)There'll be no more handpicking women MPs for reserved seats as a top government spokesman announced Thursday that the constitution would be changed to hold direct vote for 100. "The constitution will be amended in due course," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters. "This is the last time (we are choosing our women MPs this way)." Syed Ashraf and HT Imam, an adviser to the prime minister, were at the Election Commission Thursday afternoon to formally file nomination papers for the Awami League's 36 women candidates. Of the 45 reserved seats distributed on basis of the parties' strengths in the House, the BNP got five while Jatiya Party for four. Thursday was the last day for nominations, March 15 is set for scrutiny, March 19 for final pull-outs. March 30 was set as the polling date, but the selections look to be uncontested for all 45 seats. JP names 4, 'rebel' also files The Jatiya Party named its nominees for women MPs Thursday, and the list included an owner-editor of a newspaper and wife of the party's secretary general. "Chairman HM Ershad has finally nominated Noor-e-Hasna Lily Chowdhury, Nasrin Jahan Ratna, Salma Islam and Mahjabeen Morshed," said secretary general Ruhul Amin Howladar. Ratna is Howladar's wife and Salma Islam is editor-publisher of daily Jugantor. Necessary papers were handed to EC officials around noon, Howlader said. However, JP's Merina Rahman also submitted a form to the commission though she did not get a party ticket.
