Irad surrendered to the court just after 2pm, after an arrest warrant was issued against him Sunday in connection with the Tk 50 crore case filed by BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah. In a press conference on Mar 9, in the presence of his father, Irad alleged that BNP chief Khaleda Zia had sought Tk 5 crore from him in return for the Dhaka mayoral ticket from the party.

He also called the BNP chairperson's adviser, ASM Hannan Shah, the "'bastard' child of democracy". He said none among Khoka, Abbas, Hannan and former FBCCI chief Abdul Awal Mintoolikely BNP picks for the mayor racewas acceptable. Hannan filed the defamation case Sunday under sections 500/501/502 of the penal code.
