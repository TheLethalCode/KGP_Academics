 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  A towering inferno engulfed mainly the corporate office of Basundhara City shopping complex in Dhaka Friday, with clouds of thick black smoke billowing from the burning building. The fire is dying down after the flames spread downwards from the top floors, trapping many inside. Seventeen injured were taken to Dhaka combined Military Hospital. Army and the navy's fire experts have joined rescue operations Brigadier general Anwar said they have come in aid of the fire service and secure the area. An officer of the fire-extinguishing department of Bashundhara Group Kazi Golam Mostafa was rescued by a helicopter after he was trapped inside. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the army, security agencies and all emergency rescue services to join the operations, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters. He added the prime minister's security adviser retired major general Tareq Ahmed Siddiqui has been tasked to oversee the operations. Home minister Sahara Khatun, commerce minister Faruq Khan, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, police chief Noor Mohammed and Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief Naim Ahmed were at the scene. Noor told reporters they were not able to give logistic supports but were observing the situation. Burning debris came tumbling down from the heights to land on lower rooftops of adjacent buildings as firefighters struggled against the flames. Senior correspondent Sumon Kaiser, immediately after the fire had broken out, said that flames and smoke were billowing from the 21-storey building. Another correspondent, Humayun Hashim, said he saw many people were looking out the window to get out of the building. Owner of Bismallah Store Tofael Ahmed said the fire started from the group chairman's office on the 20nd floor. He said they were not allowed to bring out their merchandise. The fires jumped to floors and flames ripped through the 20nd floor, burning everything in its wake. Deputy managing director of Bashundhrara Group Touhidul Alam said the corporate office caught fire and he sent men to salvage papers, but they could not. He said he had no idea how the building caught fire. Fire Brigade director Major Motiur told bdnews24.com the fire originated from the 17th floor and flames were going upwards. The firefighters were trying to climb up the 17th floor as the water sprayed was not reaching the floor. He said five fire units have been deployed and reinforcements called in. Hundreds of shoppers poured out of the main entrance as the fire broke out at the top of the building. The fire that began just before 1:30pm came under control at one point, but began raging again from 2:30pm as the flames were fanned by the wind, Major Motiur added. The shoppers joined crowds of spectators that had gathered on Panthapath, which had been quickly closed off to traffic causing long tailbacks on adjoining roads. Thousands of people have congregated around Basundhara and a sea of spectators from Panthapath reaching back towards Hatirpul. A security staff of the complex, Rafiq who gave only one name, had earlier said the 17th and 18th floors of the building that house corporate office of the Group caught fire. Panicked people rushed out and rescuers were forced to climb the top floors. bdnews24.com/sk/sit/
