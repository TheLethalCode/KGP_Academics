 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Mohammedan Sporting Club survived a scare to finish group champions in the Citycell Super Cup after playing an entertaining 1-1 draw against Brothers Union in the final Group B match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. It was their first draw in three matches, but meant Mohammedan topped the group securing seven points, two ahead of Brothers Union, who were also through to the semi-finals as the last team. Brothers' berth was almost ensured earlier after Farashganj Sporting Club defeated Chittagong Abahani 2-0 to finish third. In order to see Farashganj SC into the last four, Brothers had to lose to Mohammedan by at least a 5-0 margin. Nigerian striker John Goodwin, playing his first match in place of injured striker Hedayetullah Robin, gave the Black and Whites a seventh-minute lead before Henry Quaye levelled eight minutes later in a fast-paced game in front of the nearly 7,000-strong crowd. Both Mohammedan and Brothers wanted to avoid high-flying Abahani in the semi-final clash to emerge Group B champions and it probably forced them to play at a high-tempo and not let the other side settle into a rhythm. The ploy later saw six players cautioned and one being sent off. Though Brothers Union, coached by Wasim Iqbal, put up their best performance of the season so far, they could not avert a meeting with Abahani on March 19. Both sides fought equally in the first half, but the Gopibagh-based outfit shared the lion's share of the possession in the second half, but unfortunately they had to be satisfied with their second draw in three outings. Brothers came into the match on the back of a 3-0 win over Chittagong Abahani and launched the first attack in the second minute when Shakil Ahemd passed the ball back to Henry, who drove lamely to waste a good opportunity. It, however, was Mohammedan, who had the first laugh after seven minutes when Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken headed an Arman Aziz free-kick off the crosspiece and Goodwin celebrated his Dhaka debut sending the rebound past goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman. Mohammedan's joy, however, lasted only eight minutes as Henry restored parity with a marvellous side-volley. Winger Jahid Hasan released a well-judged lob for Mehdi Hasan Tapu, who saw his header bounce off a Mohammedan defender, but Ghanaian striker Henry drove the first-time shot giving Bangladesh goalkeeper Aminul Islam no time to react. The Oranges continued their wave of attacks to keep the Mohammedan defence, which looked a bit vulnerable, busy and went close twice to taking a lead. In the second half, the Black and Whites looked to adopt a defensive approach in the face of pressure from the Oranges. Mohammedan, however, managed to overcome the pressure with substitute stopper Murad Khan boosting the left to successfully handle speedy winger Jahid, who threatened several times. The game, however, was marred by many fouls and referee Azad Rahman was forced to dish out seven cards. The entertaining battle also saw Mohammedan playmaker Enamul Haq Sharif, who picked two yellow cards in the second half, to leave his side playing with 10 men in the dying minutes. Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz was also booked he will miss the semi-finals against their Chittagong namesakes along with Arman and Enmaul. In the first match of the day, Farashganj dominated to record their first win in three matches with Khokon Das and Idris Moutebi scoring one goal each. bd
