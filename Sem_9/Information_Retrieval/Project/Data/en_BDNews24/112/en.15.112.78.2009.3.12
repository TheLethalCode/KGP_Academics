 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Twelve accused in the BDR mutiny case, allegedly identified in video footage of the Peelkhana massacre, were remanded into CID custody for five days on Thursday. CID investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand sought ten days for interrogation from the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrates court. Magistrate Muhammad Abdur Rahim granted five. The remand petition accused the 12 of breaking into the BDR armoury in Peelkhana on Feb 25, killing army officers, looting and arson. Others in remand gave information about them in interrogations, the petition said. The accused are: Habildar Rezaul Karim, Subedar Major Gofran Mallick, Lance Nayeks Gausul Azam and Md Yusuf Ali, Sepoys Zamir Ali, Joyanta Kumar Sarkar, Md Abdul Latif, Md Sohrab Hossain, Md Ismail Hossain, Md Shariful Islam, Md Rafiqul Islam and Masudur Rahman. All pleaded not guilty and said they reported for duty at the BDR headquarters on March 3. They said they were told of the so-called video footage and then tortured in RAB custody. 'Preliminary proof' Rapid Action Battalion said Wednesday it had found "preliminary proof" against 12 BDR men of being involved in the mutiny. RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said his elite force was cooperating with Operation Rebel Hunt. In the process, it had detained and questioned the 12 BDR men before handing them to police, said the RAB chief. 236 arrested so far Over 200 have been arrested in connection with the mutiny case filed by Lalbagh police on Feb. 28. Police initially named six BDR men in the case, including one of the alleged ringleaders DAD Touhidul Alam, along with 1,000 unnamed 'mutineers'.
