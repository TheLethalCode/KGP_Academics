<TEXT>
 Beijing, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier Wen Jiabao said on Friday China was open to holding more talks with envoys for the Dalai Lama as long as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader renounces what Beijing describes as separatism. Wen said China's policies toward Tibet were correct and the region was peaceful and stable, even as security forces enforced a lockdown on ethnic Tibetan regions a year after widespread riots across ethnic Tibetan areas. Chinese officials and envoys from the Dalai Lama have held previous rounds of talks but little of substance has been achieved. "This kind of talks can continue. The key is that the Dalai Lama must demonstrate his sincerity so that the talks can achieve substantive results," Wen told his annual news conference at the end of the annual session of the Chinese parliament. The Dalai Lama marked March 10, the 50th anniversary of a failed uprising and his exile, with a speech in India calling for "meaningful autonomy" for Tibet and slammed Beijing for bringing "untold suffering and destruction" to Tibetans. The Nobel Prize-winning Buddhist monk denies China's charge that he is a separatist and seeks instead a "middle way." Wen also accused Western countries of "exploiting" the Dalai Lama, who he described as a political exile rather than a religious figure. "The Dalai Lama runs around the world to various countries, and can intoxicate some in the political world. Some western countries exploit him," Wen said. On March 14 last year, Lhasa erupted into riots that spilled over into ethnically Tibetan areas across the Himalayan plateau. A Tibetan crowd burned shops belonging to Han Chinese and Hui Muslims, killing 19 people. Groups abroad demanding Tibetan self-rule have said more than 200 Tibetans died across the region in the subsequent crackdown. Chinese officials have rejected these claims and said the authorities used minimal force. Wen described Tibet as peaceful and stable. "The Tibetan people hope to live and work in peace and stability," Wen said. "The peacefulness of Tibet and its ongoing progress have proven that the policies we have adopted are correct." In Tibet proper and Tibetan regions in surrounding provinces, security forces have stationed themselves in towns and are manning roadblocks to avoid a repeat of last March, when protests and demonstrations rocked nearly every Tibetan community. In some regions, the Internet and text messaging are blocked, while Tibetans are prevented from crossing other borders. Ethnically Tibetan areas, including Tibet proper, have been closed to foreigners. China says it has brought prosperity and a rising standard of living to Tibetan areas. "Both the Chinese constitution and law on autonomy have provided for the freedom and rights of people in Tibet, particularly in religious belief," Wen said. "Over the past few years the state has also made efforts to increase fiscal input in Tibet to improve the livelihood of farmers and herders." China has ruled remote and mountainous Tibet with an iron fist since People's Liberation Army troops marched into the region in 1950.
