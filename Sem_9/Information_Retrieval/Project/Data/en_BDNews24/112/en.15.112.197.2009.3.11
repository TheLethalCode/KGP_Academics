 BELFAST, Wed Mar 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of people took part in silent protests in Northern Ireland on Wednesday against republican dissidents who killed a police officer and two soldiers in the British-ruled province. In a show of unity, politicians from nationalist and pro-British parties joined the crowds of people who stood, some with flags and banners, to bagpipe music at the main rally outside City Hall in the capital Belfast. "That's a united Northern Ireland which we have never seen before," said Peter Bunting of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) which organized the rally. Irish and British politicians have vowed to defend the peace process in Northern Ireland after the Real IRA shot dead two British soldiers late on Saturday and another dissident group killed a policeman two on Monday evening. Members of Sinn Fein, an ally of the Irish Republican Army attended Wednesday's rallies, along with representatives from the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which Sinn Fein now shares power with in Belfast. A power-sharing agreement signed in 1998 has brought relative calm after 30 years of bloodshed between minority Irish Republican Catholics and pro-British Protestants. The agreement helped reduce sectarian violence, known as the Troubles, in which more than 3,600 people were killed in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s. SOLIDARITY AGAINST ATTACKERS The Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, which said it carried out Monday's attack, oppose the peace settlement and have pledged to keep up their fight until British rule is overthrown and Ireland is united. "What has happened over the last 10 years should not be surrendered," John Batch, a 49-year-old man was brought up as a Protestant but now describes himself simply as Christian. "I grew up through the Troubles in Belfast. I don't want that for my children." Pope Benedict condemned the killings, which he called a serious threat to the peace process. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government would enhance security in the province. "Out of this tragedy something is happening that shows that the people of Northern Ireland, as well as the politicians, want the political process to be both maintained and strengthened," Brown told parliament. The killings have raised fears of a backlash from pro-British loyalists. But a group close to the paramilitary Ulster Defense Association said on Wednesday it was so impressed by the response from mainstream Republicans that the loyalist community would also be inclined to be conciliatory. "Sinn Fein have been astonishing," said Frankie Gallagher of the Ulster Political Research Group. Isolated attacks could still not be ruled out but loyalists would not tolerate any retaliatory attacks from within their ranks, he said. "If anybody in the loyalist community was to try and knee-jerk here (they) would be equally isolated and society would come down on their heads like a hurricane," Gallagher told Irish state r
