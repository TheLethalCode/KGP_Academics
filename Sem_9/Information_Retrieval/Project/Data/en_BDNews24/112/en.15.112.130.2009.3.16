<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court stayed Monday for a week the High Court orders that asked the government to let former minister Moudud Ahmed withdraw Tk 5 lakh a month from one of his frozen IFIC Bank accounts. The Judge-in-Chamber of the Appellate Division Md. Abdul Aziz heard a government petition seeking a halt to the HC orders and directed the government to file regular leave to appeal petition. Attorney General Mahbubey Alam moved the petition on behalf of the government, while barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq appeared for Moudud. The HC directed the government on Jan. 23 to allow the BNP leader to withdraw Tk 5 lakh a month. The National Board of Revenue on Mar 5, 2007 froze five bank accounts on tax-dodge charges. Moudud challenged the freeze in the High Court and was allowed to withdraw Tk 1.25 lakh per month on May 22 last year
