 PORT OF SPAIN, March 11 (bdnews 24.com/Reuters) - England's tour of the West Indies ended in a 1-0 series defeat, but a team that appeared divided and disorientated at the start of the campaign showed they have plenty of character despite lacking some key elements. England hoped to level the series with a victory in the last test at the Queen's Park Oval on a tension-packed final day but ultimately paid the price for a horrific start to the tour -- the 51 all out batting collapse and innings and 23-run defeat in Kingston. The three tests that followed all ended in draws, two exciting ones in Antigua and Trinidad where England came close to bowling out their opponents and a boring high-scoring affair in Barbados. Flat wickets for those three tests allowed England's batsmen to get the runs they needed to recover from the shock of the Sabina Park rout. All the established frontline batsmen got centuries on tour, with skipper Andrew Strauss making three. However the final test, where England made 546 for six declared in their first innings while never playing with the urgency required in a must-win game, also exposed a one-dimensional aspect to the batting line-up. With the exception of Kevin Pietersen, who only really fired in the first and last tests, and wicketkeeper Matt Prior, England's batsmen look to have come from the same mould and while their ability is not in question their adaptability is. CONFIDENCE Nothing gives batsmen confidence like making runs and even if some of the tallies were racked up against second-string West Indian bowling on placid batting tracks, England can only gain from the likes of Strauss, Alastair Cook and Paul Collingwood bolstering their averages. If there is a batsman who came out of the tour with a question mark it is Owais Shah, who looked nervy and failed to grab his chance to make the number three spot, made available by the out of form Ian Bell, his own. The bowling attack was forced to toil on wickets that offered little easy help, Steve Harmison and Ryan Sidebottom were both abandoned due to form and fitness problems while Andrew Flintoff went home injured. A lot of responsibility was placed on the shoulders of Stuart Broad and James Anderson and the latter in particular bowled well, albeit for little reward. Anderson certainly impressed his skipper, who after Tuesday's play said: "Jimmy Anderson has been threatening all series. He's bowled outstandingly well and in some ways it is a travesty that he has not taken a five-wicket haul somewhere along the way because he has troubled every single batsman with both conventional swing and reverse swing. "He has come on a long way." TOUGHER TEST Broad, promising though he is, still has a long way to go and the flat tracks showed that lacking genuine pace, he needs to develop a more sophisticated artillery if he is to gain on a return of 12 wickets from eight innings. Monty Panesar, particularly in the last test, showed glimpses of the form that made him England's first choice spinner but that position is now held by Graeme Swann, the top bowler with 19 wickets at 24.05. Swann had two five-wicket performances and constantly troubled the West Indies batsmen. While he will find it harder against Ricky Ponting's Australians in the Ashes during the English summer, Strauss will be relieved to have found at least one spinner who takes wickets and bowls with economy. The captain though accepted there were limitations to England's bowling attack, which requires a focus on strategy to compensate for the lack of high-quality talent. "We don't have a Shoaib Akhtar who can blast people out, or a Muttiah Muralitharan, so we have to be realistic enough to realise that if we're going to take wickets consistently it has to be through pressure. "If you apply pressure, even on flat wickets, you will find that teams will collapse eventually," he said. West Indies, despite wobbling twice, never did collapse and England will find it harder work against better batting line-ups. The biggest plus for England though may have come off the field, with the memory of Pietersen's row with former coach Peter Moores fading quickly and Strauss appearing comfortable in the role of captain of a dressing room that no longer shows signs of division. After the conflicts that preceded this tour, the establishment of unity and leadership is no small matter for England
