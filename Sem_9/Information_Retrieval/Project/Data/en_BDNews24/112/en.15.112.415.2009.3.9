<TITLE> Total fails to see Bay gas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka Mar 09 (bdnews24.com)Total, France's top oil company, has failed to find oil or gas in the two offshore blocks it explored last year under PSCs with state-run Petrobangla. "Total has told us there's no commercially recoverable gas in the Blocks 17 and 18," Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed told bdnews24.com Monday. One of the largest oil companies in the world, Total Exploration and Production conducted 3-D surveys off the coasts of Cox's Bazar and Saint Martin's island over an area of 14,000 square kilometres. A report on the finds was handed to Petrobangla officials Monday. In the past two years, two foreign companies explored the Bay and the coastal belt in three blocks. Scotland-based Cairn Energy, which explored Block 16, failed to give encouraging results from its 2-D surveys. A 4000-metre well, dug in Oct 2007, did not find gas in Magnama, off Cox's Bazar. "But Magnama looks promising," said one senior Petrobangla official. "2-D surveys do not always see it." Cairn's venture into Hatia early 2008 also drew a blank. Cairn has since won rights for 3-D seismic surveys from Petrobangla for the two locations. Magnama is being explored now. Gas supply shortages are adding to Bangladesh's power crisis. According to state-run generators PDB, failure to supply required gas to power plants leads to a loss of output by 500 megawatts. Petrobangla has already told power officials not to expect any gas for power plants after 2012. Petrobangla subsidiaries also adopt a go-slow policy when it comes to new gas connections for commercial enterprises.
