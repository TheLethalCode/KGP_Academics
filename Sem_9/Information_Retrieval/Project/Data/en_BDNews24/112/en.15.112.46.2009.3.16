<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun told parliament Monday that poisonous smoke caused the death of Ganotantrik Party chief Nurul Islam in December 2008. Islam, who was the grand alliance candidate for Noakhali-1 ahead of the Dec 29 polls, died on Dec. 4 two days after suffering critical injuries in a fire at his Lalmatia residence. His son Tomuhor Islam was killed in the fire. Islam's family termed his death suspicious and filed a case. The government formed a four-member committee, headed by an additional commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Abdus Salalm, to probe the incident. Replying to a written question from Fazle Noor Taposh MP, the home minister said, "The committee reached a conclusion that the fire originated from a multi-plug kept under the refrigerator in the drawing room." "It concluded that hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide, from the burning of polyurethane contained in the sofa cushions, caused the death of Nurul Islam and his son Tomuhor Islam," said Sahara. bdnews
