<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan says JMB militants had links to the Feb 25-26 BDR massacre that left at least 59 army officers killed. "Not all BDR men were involved (in the mutiny) ... and some JMB links have been found," he told reporters Thursday, emerging from a conference he launched and addressed. Faruq, a former lieutenant colonel, was named Wednesday as head of a committee coordinating various inquiries into the carnage. The minister told the conference audience that the BDR headquarters incident was a "deep-rooted conspiracy". "It's a conspiracy against Bangladesh, its people and its moving forward." Faruq came down hard on the opposition. "They have not behaved in the manner which they should have in the time of 'national crisis'." "It was the fourth day when everything was over, they (opposition party) came up with their expert opinions," he said. It was an AGM of International Business Forum of Bangladesh (IBFB), held at Sheraton Hotel, which also heard from state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud, USAID official Todd Sorenson and IBFB president Mahmudul Islam Chowdhury. 236 arrested CID's senior assistantr superintendent of police Abdul Kahhar Akhand said they have arrested 236 BDR members so far. "Our investigation is on-going. Statements are being recorded. We're questioning the arrestees," he told reporters at around 6:45pm. Akhand said new names were surfacing and they were trying to arrest them. The investigation officer of the case said evidence had already been gathered against the 236. More would come, he said. He declined to be drawn on minister Faruq's comment. "I cannot say anything over what the minister has said." 12 'identified on film' remanded Twelve accused in the BDR mutiny case, allegedly identified in video footage of the Peelkhana massacre, were remanded into CID custody on Thursday. Qahhar sought ten days for interrogation from the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrates court. Magistrate Muhammad Abdur Rahim granted five. The remand petition accused the 12 of breaking into the BDR armoury in Peelkhana on Feb 25, killing army officers, looting and arson. Others accused in custody gave information about them in interrogations, the petition said. Moeen visits BDR HQ Army chief general Moeen U Ahmed spent about an hour and a half from noon at the Peelkhana complex. It was his second visit since the armed rebellion erupted on Feb 25. He first entered the border force's headquarters with home minister Sahara Khatun on the morning of Feb 27, the day after the mutiny was quelled.
