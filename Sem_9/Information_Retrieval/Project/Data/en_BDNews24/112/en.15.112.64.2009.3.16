 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Mon Mar 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two missiles believed to have been fired by US drone aircraft struck a house in northwest Pakistan on Sunday, killing four militants, including two Arabs, intelligence officials said. "The attack happened at around 10.30 p.m. (1730 GMT) near Bannu and we have reports that four militants, including two Arabs and two Pakistanis, were killed," one of the officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Bannu is a town at the gateway to the tribal region of North Waziristan, a known haven for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters. Missile strikes are seldom launched on Pakistani territory outside the semi-autonomous tribal regions bordering Afghani
