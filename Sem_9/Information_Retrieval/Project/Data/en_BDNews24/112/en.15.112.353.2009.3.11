 Dhaka, Mar11 (bdnews24.com)  The government came under fire from the High Court Wednesday for the delay in the passage of the judiciary separation ordinance. In a suo moto rule, the court questioned the legality of the judicial magistracy after Feb 24, the day the ordinance made by the emergency government expired. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haq and Abdul Hye gave the law secretary and the Supreme Court registrar to answer the rule by Mar 19. The judges wanted to know under what legal powers the judicial magistrates have been functioning after Feb 24. They also wanted to know why their functioning since the date should not be declared without proper legal authority. The court in the rule said that parliament did not pass the amended CrPC ordinances even 30 days after it was tabled in the maiden session. The ordinances expired on Feb 24 since those were not passed, according to section 93 of the constitution. The court solicited opinion of legal experts M Zahir and former attorney general Mahmudul Islam in the hearing on a petition on the appointment of staff to assist judicial magistracy and metropolitan magistracy. The lawyers were on the committee that reviewed the ordinances made by the interim government. They said they had suggested passage in parliament of the ordinance on the separation of the judiciary. The judiciary was made independent of the executive on Nov.1, 2007
