 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, Mar (bdnews24.com)  The Privatisation Commission chairman has said they will look into irregularities and politicisation in privatising state-owned enterprises in past 16 years. Mirza Jalil told bdnews24.com Wednesday legal steps would follow if any SoE was found to have been unfairly sold off. He also said a taskforce drawing on industry entrepreneurs, government officials, and experts will be formed to make recommendations to sell off 26 SoEs. He said the privatisation initiatives were meant to activate state-owned mills and factories, and boost production but those have remained elusive. "I believe real entrepreneurs did not get mills and factories, as most of the institutions have been privatised carelessly, keeping party and individual interests intact." Jalil also said the commission even did not care to check how those mills and factories had been doing since privatisation. "Some 15-20 enterprises could not start work properly even after privatisation as those institutions have been embroiled in various cases [because the privatisation process was not proper]." According to the commission, 74 state-owned institutions such as textiles, jute, fisheries, food processing, engineering, chemicals, tannery, sugar, and forest have been privatised since 1993, 54 by tenders and the remainder by offloading shares. Allegations are there that a different industry was built altogether after an industrial unit was privatised. In some cases, more than one enterprises were built. Allegations also have it that some bought land cheaply and sold it at a high price
