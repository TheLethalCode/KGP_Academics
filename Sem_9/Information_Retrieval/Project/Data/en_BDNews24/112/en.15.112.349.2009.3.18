<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)The government has asked a second FBI team in Dhaka to help uncover any foreign links to the BDR mutiny at Peelkhana, commerce minister Faruq Khan said Wednesday. "The second team has arrived. We've requested them to help investigate the killings with special emphasis on suspected ties to international organisations," said Khan, who is coordinating the probes into the mutiny. Asked why foreign links are suspected, the minister said, "One can't accept that so many army officers were killed just for a couple of kilogrammes of rice." "The Peelkhana killings were done to damage the country's economy and the morale of the army. Many have been party to it." Asked if 'anti-liberation forces' were involved, Khan said, "Please be patient, the probe reports will reveal everything." Khan again called on fugitive BDR men to turn themselves in. He also urged the public to help law enforcers nab suspected mutineers. The commerce minister was speaking to reporters after attending an hour-long meeting with the Sri Lankan high commissioner in the morning. FBI team visits BDR HQ A second eighty-strong FBI team arrived Tuesday to assist investigations into the Feb 25-26 massacre, US ambassador James F Moriarty told bdnews24.com. CID investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand said they were visiting the border force's headquarters Wednesday morning. BDR director general Brig Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com he had also met with them.
