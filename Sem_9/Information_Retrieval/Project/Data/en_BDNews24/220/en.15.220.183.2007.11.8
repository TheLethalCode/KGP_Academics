 ROME, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US army Blackhawk helicopter crashed in northern Italy on Thursday, killing four Americans and wounding at least six others, three of them seriously, officials said. Italian media said the helicopter was on a training mission when it crashed in a rural area near the city of Treviso. A spokeswoman at the US army base in Vicenza said she could not confirm the details, saying only that the crashed Blackhawk belonged to the army and had taken off from the US military base in Aviano, Italy. There were no details on the cause of the crash and a press officer at the US embassy in Rome said she had no information. Fire brigade officials, who were initially contacted about the crash by a motorist driving nearby, said they were still working through the wreckage. They estimated six wounded Americans, but Italy's ANSA agency reported there were seven wounded in addition to the four dead. "There are four dead - two bodies have already been extracted (from the wreck) while the other two are still inside," the fire brigade spokesman said. The crash took place in a rural area outside the northern Italian city of Treviso, along the bank of the Piave river. "It appears the helicopter was a single-rotor Blackhawk with four blades," said a fire brigade official. "It looks like it went down between the bridge on state (highway) 13 and the bridge on highway A27."
