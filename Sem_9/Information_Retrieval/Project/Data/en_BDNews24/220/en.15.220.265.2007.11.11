 Brisbane, November 11 (bdnews24.com)- A dour innings from Michael Vandort and some inclement coastal weather in Queensland allowed Sri Lanka to force the Brisbane Test into a final day. Resuming at 80-2, some 260 runs behind, they were 218-5 when play was called off for the day with only 56 overs played during the course of the day. Vandort was bowled by Stuart MacGill for 82, with skipper Mahela Jayawardene adding an even slower 49. Sri Lanka were 213-3 before two quick wickets gave the hosts some heart. It was a vastly improved batting performance from Sri Lanka compared to their first innings 211, played in much better coditions. Vandort and Jayawardene stayed together for the first 31 overs of the day, and their partnership was worth 102 when debutant Mitchell Johnson put a bit extra into a ball outside off-stump - which Jayawardene edged to Adam Gilchrist. After hitting 10 boundaries and facing 170 balls the tall left-hander Vandort was finally deceived by a superb ball from MacGill. The delivery drifted away from him and turned back sharply to hit his off-stump - providing the leg-spinner with his 200th Test wicket - and there was time for one more wicket too. That came when Thilan Samaraweera (20) played an aggressive shot off Johnson which flew to Michael Hussey at gully. An improved weather forecast for Monday means Australia should be able to wrap up victory without too much toil on the final day. But apart from the rain, the performance of Vandort, who batted for more than four hours in his first Test against Australia, was the main talking-point. (Courtesy : BBC
