<TITLE> London suicide bomb plot suspect pleads guilty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An African man pleaded guilty on Friday to helping to plot botched suicide bombings on London's transport system on July 21, 2005. Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, who was born in Ghana, admitted being part of the plot to carry out the failed bombings two weeks after four British Islamists killed 52 people in suicide attacks on three underground trains and a bus in the capital. A jury had failed to reach a verdict against him following a trial which saw his co-conspirators jailed for a minimum of 40 years in July. He was due to face a re-trial starting next Monday.
