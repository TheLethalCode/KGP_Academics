 AIN AL-HILWEH, Lebanon, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small bomb exploded inside a car belonging to a local Fatah commander at a Palestinian refugee camp in south Lebanon on Wednesday but he was not hurt, security sources said. Tension has risen at refugee camps in south Lebanon largely controlled by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah group since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in fighting with Fatah in June. The sources said Ali Shabaytah's car was parked in a square outside some of Fatah's offices in the Ain al-Hilweh camp near the port city of Sidon. They said the bomb contained about 200 grammes (0.44 pounds) of TNT explosives. There were no casualties in the blast. There are 12 refugee camps in Lebanon, home to half of 400,000 Palestinians in the country.
