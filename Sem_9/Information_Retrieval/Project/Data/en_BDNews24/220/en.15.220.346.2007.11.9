 MOHALI, India, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble was appointed India's test captain on Thursday, succeeding Rahul Dravid who quit the post in September. The 37-year-old Kumble will lead the team in the home series against Pakistan which starts in New Delhi on Nov. 22 after the selectors preferred him to wicketkeeper and one-day captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. "Anil Kumble has been appointed for the three tests against Pakistan. There will be no vice-captain," senior board official Mohinder Pandove told a news conference. Kumble, who has previously served as test vice-captain, is the third highest wicket-taker with 566 test scalps, behind Australia's Shane Warne and Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan. In 1999 the wrist spinner became the second bowler after England's Jim Laker to take all 10 wickets in a test innings, leading India to a series-levelling win over Pakistan in New Delhi. India's selectors faced a dilemma when Sachin Tendulkar declined to return as captain after two previously unsuccessful terms, mainly to avoid putting extra pressure on his batting. Dhoni, 26, has done well since being appointed one-day skipper in September. He led India to their Twenty20 World Cup triumph in South Africa on his captaincy debut. The home series with neighbours Pakistan will be followed by a tour of Australia before India host South Africa early next year
