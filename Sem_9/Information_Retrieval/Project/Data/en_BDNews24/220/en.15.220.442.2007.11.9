<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Friday made MA Aziz acting president and Quamrul Islam acting general secretary of the Dhaka metropolitan unit. The decision came from a meeting at the party's Dhanmondi office apparently to revamp the party since the government is planning the city corporation polls. Acting party president Zillur Rahman announced the new appointments at a post-meeting media briefing. But it was still unclear if the party would join the city corporation polls. Zillur said the decision was due, and the party's central working committee would make a final choice. "According to the government's pledge, the city corporation polls would be held soon. We have asked the party workers to be voter and help others to get enrolled," Zillur said. He said detained party chief Sheikh Hasina had formed eight teams to restructure the metropolitan unit of the party on May 30. The teams were assigned to see if there was any internal feud in ward and thana-level party committees. But the teams could not function because of many new political developments, he said. Hasina was arrested and sent to jail in mid-July on charges of extortion and the party was unsure what should be their strategy in her absence, the acting chief added. "Now the teams will start work all over again," Zillur said. Presidium member Abdur Razzak, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and other leaders including Mukul Bose, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Abdul Mannan and Sultan Mohammad Mansur attended the meeting. bdnews24
