 Manikganj, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)--Farmers blocked the Dhaka-Aricha highway for two hours Thursday demanding fertiliser, and assaulting the UNO of Shibaloy in Manikganj during the protests. Hundreds of farmers gathered for fertiliser at Uthali Bazaar Thursday and after waiting for two hours went on the rampage, said Shibaloy administrative officers and witnesses. They said that the farmers positioned themselves on the Dhaka-Aricha highway and blocked the road at around 11.45 am. At 12.30 pm, UNO Md Soleman Khan went to the scene with police and requested the farmers to lift the roadblock. At one stage of the discussion that ensued, the farmers attacked him. The UNO managed to leave the place with the help of law enforcers and local people. The farmers then continued their protests in the presence of police. Later, additional district commissioner Md Salahuddin and deputy director of the District Agricultural Extension Department Md Makbul Hossain went to the place of occurrence and convinced the farmers to stop their protests. Md Soleman Khan told bdnews24.com that a local dealer Ashraful Islam Raja had drawn 45 tonnes of urea, 30 of tonnes TSP and 10 tonnes of MOP fertiliser. "He could not distribute the fertilisers among the farmers as he did not receive any list from the UP chairman and members," Soleman said adding, "The fertiliser is in his (Raja's) storehouse." Raja blamed the UP chairman for the incident. Makbul Hossain, deputy director of DAED, claimed that they had enough stock of fertiliser. He said, "We have distributed 4000 tonnes of urea, 1475 tonnes of TSP and 500 tonnes of MOP among 70 dealers only for the month November." Al-Masud, Abul Bashar, Aftab Uddin and a few others said that they had not received any fertiliser in November, though each received 10 kilograms in October. bdnews24.com
