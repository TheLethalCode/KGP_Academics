 MUMBAI, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anil Kumble knows his appointment as India test captain is a short-term measure but he hopes he can make it easier for the country's next generation of cricketers to cement their place in the senior side. The 37-year-old Kumble was named skipper for the three-test series home series against Pakistan beginning later this month.

But Kumble said the doubters would not affect his focus. "It is definitely a great honour," said Kumble, who retired from one-day cricket after the World Cup in the Caribbean in March. "I'd like to take one step at a time. To ensure that we do well against Pakistan, and then the rest will follow
