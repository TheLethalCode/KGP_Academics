 SLAGELSE, Denmark, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen is confident he can win a third term for his centre-right coalition despite a meagre lead over the leftist opposition four days before a general election. Rasmussen, 54, had no need to call an election until 2009 but decided on an early vote in the hope that a strong economy, tax cuts and record-low unemployment would secure him a third term. But with polls showing him losing ground to rivals since last month's election call, he is facing a tough fight. "That's always the paradox -- during periods of crisis, people tend to stick to what they know, stick to security, while during an economic upturn they may be tempted to make experiments," he told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "But I'm confident that my government can continue after the 13th of November." Rasmussen's Liberal-Conservative coalition swept to power in 2001 and then won re-election in 2005 with promises to crack down on asylum-seekers and cut taxes. A Catinet poll for the Danish news agency Ritzau showed his coalition and its political ally, the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party, at 48.2 percent on Friday. This would give them 88 out of the 179 seats in parliament, compared to 94 today. The rival Social Democrat-led bloc, which includes three other leftist parties, polled at 45.5 percent, for 83 seats. All recent opinion polls suggest any governing bloc would have to include the New Alliance, a small centrist party formed just six months ago. In the Catinet survey, the New Alliance garnered 4.7 percent support, for eight parliamentary seats. "Maybe we will need the new party, the New Alliance, but all in all the majority is around 94 or 95 seats -- and that's actually our majority to date, so all opinion polls indicate that it will be possible to continue," he said. New Alliance has said it would back Rasmussen to lead a government, but wants concessions that directly conflict with the policies of the far-right Danish People's Party, a likely complication to any post-election negotiations. Rasmussen said he does not fear complicated talks. "I am quite experienced in compromising. Obviously it will be a bigger challenge than today -- but a challenge, not a problem," he said. "I think we can overcome the differences between our partners. I'm confident that we can establish a stable government," he said, adding that he would not dole out cabinet posts before the election. Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt has dismissed a grand alliance with Rasmussen, despite many similarities between the two parties' policies. Rasmussen will focus in the final days of the campaign on convincing undecided voters he deserves four more years. "I will remind them that my government represents stability, a sound economy," he said. This year, Rasmussen has sought to disarm the opposition in key areas where they could have challenged him in an election while still pushing forward with his tax-cutting agenda. He withdrew Denmark's ground troops from Iraq, softened his stance on asylum-seekers with children, and proposed an increase in public spending to improve the quality of welfare -- the top concern of Danish voters ahead of the vo
