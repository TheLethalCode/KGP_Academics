 TBILISI, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon on Wednesday to break up a six-day-old rally by protesters demanding the resignation of President Mikhail Saakashvili. The health minister said 250 people were taken to hospital after police used force for the first time since the protest began last Friday with a 70,000-strong rally, the biggest since a peaceful revolution swept Saakashvili to power in 2003. Police wearing gas masks and carrying shields charged about 3,000 protesters who had gathered outside parliament in eth capital Tbilisi and chased them away, hitting some with batons. The demonstrators fled, tripping over each other to escape the gas. Some could be seen being dragged bleeding into police cars. Ambulances sped through the streets, their sirens wailing. Health Minister David Tkeshelashvili said hospitals had admitted 250 people. "More than 50 have already been released. We have a few trauma cases, but basically it's people poisoned by tear gas," Tkeshelashvili said. The six days of protests have posed the largest challenge to Saakashvili since he came to power and he has not been seen in public since they started. The protesters accuse Saakashvili of economic mismanagement and corruption and want early elections in the former Soviet republic at the heart of the Caucasus region, a volatile area south of Russia which hosts a pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to the West. Saakashvili has ignored their demands. Pro-Saakashvili politicians are frustrated by the protests against a leader who has been feted in the West as a model of democracy and economic reform but whose image at home has become increasingly tarnished. POLICE DERESSED IN BLACK Police dressed in black and wearing balaclavas had earlier beaten and punched protesters before a water cannon hosed the streets, witnesses said. Clouds of tear gas filled the area in central Tbilisi and choked the protesters. "Only a fascist power could do this," Nana Abuladze, 56, said between vomiting. She had been protesting when the police fired the tear gas. The sting of tear gas still hung in the air in front of parliament an hour after the police charge, but hundreds of protesters shouted anti-government slogans at police lines further down Tbilisi's main street. Police pushed the protesters back and lobbed tear gas into the crowd to try and force them to disperse. But the opposition urged their supporters to be defiant and not to end protests until he resigns and reports from regional cities showed that people were marching against the government. "The authorities have used weapons against peaceful demonstrators and therefore the authorities will get what they deserve from the people," opposition leader Kakha Kukava was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. The opposition united last month after the arrest of former Defence Minister Irakly Okruashvili, who had accused Saakashvili of corruption and plotting murder on national television. The head of the Georgian Orthodox church urged both sides to be calm and offered to mediate between the protesters and the government. Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli told journalists the authorities had used a reasonable amount of force to clear the streets. "We have democracy and everybody can express their views and hold rallies," he said. "But part of the protesters wanted to block the road and we took the decision to clear it." Earlier opposition leaders had defied a police morning operation to break up their vigil by forcing around 100 protesters from the buildi
