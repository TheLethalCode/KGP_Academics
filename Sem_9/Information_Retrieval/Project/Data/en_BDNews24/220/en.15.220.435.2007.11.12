 SINGAPORE, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks tumbled on Monday after worries over more credit losses at financial firms and a steep fall in crude oil sent shudders through financial markets, bruising technology and energy shares. Tokyo's Nikkei dropped more than 2 percent to its lowest closing level in 15 months as investors dumped exporters on the back of a surge in the yen to an 18-month high versus the dollar. Spread betters in London expect the FTSE 100 index to open 36 to 39 points lower. Germany's DAX is seen down 47 to 49 points and France's CAC 40 down 25 to 40 points. Fresh concerns about further losses linked to the US subprime mortgage sector were rekindled on Friday when Wachovia Corp, the fourth-largest US bank, reported a potential $1.7 billion loss on mortgage-related debt. HSBC Holdings fell in Hong Kong after the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said the bank was expected to reveal a new $1 billion hit in its results this week from its exposure to the US mortgage crisis. "It's getting to the point where everything seems scary, and that it's hard to trust what financial institutions are saying," said a trader for a major Japanese trading house. Oil issues led losses amid dropping crude prices Tokyo's Nikkei average ended down 2.5 percent at 15,197.09, after falling below 15,000. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks plumbed seven-week lows, down 3.7 percent around 0615 GMT. China's stock market fell after the central bank tightened monetary policy on Saturday, sending the Shanghai Composite Index down 2.9 percent. Battling to restrain growth in money supply and inflation, China's central bank said it would lift the proportion of deposits that commercial banks must keep in reserve by 0.5 percentage point to a record high of 13.5 percent. South Korea's key KOSPI ended 3.4 percent lower, Taiwan shares fell 3.4 percent, Hong Kong' Hang Seng Index dropped 4.5 percent and Singapore's Straits Times Index was off 2.8 percent. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index finished only 1.4 percent lower, partly supported by miner Rio Tinto surging to an all-time high. Takeover target Rio Tinto extended its rally on hopes that suitor BHP Billiton would have to lift its original $140 billion bid, which Rio had rejected as too low. OIL, WALL STREET JITTERS The fall in Asian markets followed declines on Wall Street, which slid on Friday led by technology stocks after Qualcomm Inc's disappointing outlook. Nervousness over widening subprime-related losses and an unwinding of carry trades, in which investors sell low-yielding currencies like the yen and buy higher-yielding currencies, hit the dollar, sending it to a low around 110.10 yen -- the lowest level since May 2006. The dollar also dipped against the yen after Japan's top government spokesman Nobutaka Machimura said it was wrong to conclude that a high yen was a bad thing for his country since it heightens the value of Japan's assets. The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.4654 having pulled back from a record high of $1.4753 hit on EBS on Friday. Japanese government bond futures rose to a 21-month peak on tumbling equities markets, raising doubts about how soon the Bank of Japan can raise interest rates. Analysts said BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui was likely to repeat that the central bank would raise rates gradually at a news conference on Tuesday following a two-day policy meeting. The BOJ is widely seen keeping rates steady at 0.5 percent. December 10-year futures edged up 0.01 point to 136.69 but held off the day's peak of 136.87, the highest since February 2006, Oil fell more than $1 after OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia said on the weekend the exporter group would discuss a rise in output, and gold dropped over 2 percent as weaker oil and falling stocks pushed investors to book profits from a recent rally. NYMEX crude for December delivery fell as much as $1.28 in early electronic trading and was down $1.34 at $94.98 a barrel by 0604 GMT. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, said on Sunday the exporter group would discuss an increase in oil output at an upcoming meeting, in a bid to cool record prices nearing $100 a barr
