 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank has started offloading dollars to the inter-bank market to meet the shortage of the US currency and help appreciate the taka to check inflation, fuelled partly by import-led commodities, bankers said Saturday. "The market became dry. Export proceeds and remittance inflows were not enough for import paymentsmainly for petroleum and food grains," said Md Yasin Ali, executive director of the central bank. The central bank that holds $5.45 billion in US dollar terms, stepped in, as both state-run and private banks, were facing rising pressure to pay import bills. In the latest move, BB has sold $109 million to the banks in two weeks. "We think that the taka should appreciate a bit against the dollar which is eroding against other currencies worldwide," he told bdnews24.com by telephone. On the international market, the US dollar has been trading at record lows against major currencies after the Fed lowered its short term interest rates to restore confidence, slumped amid to credit mess in US mortgage industry and worries of recession. The dollar in the local inter-bank foreign exchange market, which faces average demand for $25 million a day, ended at Tk 68.64 Thursday, down 2.0 basis points from Tk 68.66 Monday, according to a weekly report from Citibank NA Bangladesh. "While we should do our best to manage the situation under agreed monetary parameters, in no way should we discourage our exports and wage earners by forcibly appreciating the taka," Mamun Rashid, an analyst, told bdndw24.com. Export earnings fell about 12 percent to $2.03 billion in the July-August period of the current fiscal year from $2.30 billion in the same period a year ago, due mainly to a downturn in the exports of garment which constitutes the bulk of total export proceeds. But Yasin, the BB official, said they were concerned about the impact on exporters and remitters, adding: "We are monitoring the market daily. We hope the market will ease soon." A fund manager at a private bank, who preferred not to be named, said that a mismatch in supply and demand due to lower export earnings resulted in the shortage of the greenback. "It's late. They should have allowed the taka to gain much earlier to curb inflation from import-led commodities," he said. Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled who had served the central bank as a deputy governor earlier, termed the step positive. "It may allow appreciation of the taka and increase imports if there is import demand," he said. bd
