 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Customs authorities Monday detained two persons bound for China with 16 packets of suspected "heroin" at Zia International Airport. "We have arrested two persons and seized 16 packets (each weighing about one kilogram) of white powder. We are not sure. That's why we've asked experts to identify if these are heroin or not," assistant customs commissioner Abu Hossain told bdnews24.com. "The legal process will start as soon as we are sure about the powder," he added. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the arrestees were identified as Mahmud Ali and Ariful Islam Bhuiyan. Their flight to China was scheduled for 1:20pm. He added that they were carrying the packets in a large travel bag. The joint forces recovered the packets. bdnew
