 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Norway have agreed to a "strategic relationship" that will cover bilateral issues and joint reviews of multilateral issues, a press statement issued by the Bangladesh Embassy in Stockholm Friday said. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury met with Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Store in Oslo Thursday. "We see Norway as an enlightened member of the international community committed to peace and development, with whom we have many common interests and objectives," the adviser said to the press after the meeting. "There are possibilities of exploring newer avenues of cooperation with Norway for Bangladesh. Norway needs skilled English-speaking engineers for her oil industry, which we would be in a position to provide," Chowdhury said. A memorandum of understanding between Bangladesh and Norway on development which had expired in April 2007 has been extended to April 2008. The MoU will come under review in Jan-Feb 2008. The Norwegian foreign minister said, "Norway welcomes this first-ever foreign ministerial level bilateral visit from Bangladesh and looks forward to a progressively enhanced relationship." Chowdhury met members of the parliamentary standing committee on foreign relations chaired by Olab Akselsen, MP, and with Bangladesh-born Norwegian parliamentarian Saera Khan, MP, during his visit. The foreign adviser spoke at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo. b
