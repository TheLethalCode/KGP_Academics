 Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are key facts about Slovenia, which holds a presidential election runoff on Sunday to choose a head of state for the fourth time since independence in 1991: POPULATION: 2.0 million; 90 percent are Slovenes who speak Slovenian, a south Slav language written in Latin script, and most of them are Roman Catholics; the rest includes Serb, Croat, Hungarian, Italian and Bosnian minorities. POLITICAL STRUCTURE: Parliamentary democracy. A centre-right coalition ended 12 years of mostly centre-left rule in the 2004 election. The next vote for the 90-seat parliament is due in late 2008. The president is elected for a five-year term and can serve a maximum two terms. The second round is taking place because none of the seven candidates got more than 50 percent of votes in the Oct. 21 first round. ELECTORATE: Some 1.7 million eligible voters choose between the two candidates who scored the most votes in the first round. Polling stations open at 0600 GMT and close at 1800 GMT. Preliminary official results are expected around 2100 GMT. ECONOMY: The thriving service-based economy is expected to grow 5.8 percent this year. Slovenia adopted the euro on Jan. 1, 2007, the first to do so of 10 nations that joined the EU in 2004. The main problem is inflation, expected to rise to 4.3 percent in 2007 from 3 percent in 2006. EXPORTS: Main exports are cars, Gorenje household appliances and generic drugs made by Krka and Lek. The sole car maker, Revoz, is a subsidiary of France's Renault. MODERN HISTORY: Slovenia was part of Austro-Hungarian empire until it ended in 1918, when Slovenia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia. In 1945, the kingdom was replaced by the communist Yugoslav federation. Slovenia was the first of Yugoslavia's six republics to hold free elections in 1990. It declared independence in June 1991, prompting a 10-day war against the Yugoslav army which killed 64 people. Slovenia was internationally recognised in 1992 and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. SIZE: 20,250 sq km (7,800 sq miles), more than half of it mountainous forest.
