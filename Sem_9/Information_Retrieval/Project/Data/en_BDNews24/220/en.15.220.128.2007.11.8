 Faridpur, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Freedom fighters at Sadarpur upazila in the district said Thursday that they would not allow Jamaat leader Abdul Quader Mollah to the area for his defamatory comment on the War of Liberation. Mollah was born at Jariperdangi at Sadarpur in 1948. He also did his schooling in the area. Quader Mollah, assistant secretary of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, had earlier reportedly said that some people had joined the war to fight against the Pakistani army in 1971 to have "beautiful women, some others for property and some to protect Indian interests". Mollah's comment came in October from a discussion on the life and work of late Baitul Mokarram Khatib Obaidul Huq. His statement created a wave of protest at a time when various political parties and social platforms renewed their demand for trying the war criminals. The demand to ban the religion-based politics is also vibrant as the liberal political and social forces argue that such politics goes against the spirit of the War of Liberation and democracy. At a news conference at the Upazila Muktijoddha Command Office, freedom fighter A Gaffar Thursday branded Mollah as a war criminal and demanded his trial. Gaffar, a former commander of the Mujib Force that had played a vital role in 1971, said the members of the Al Badr, Al Shams and other groups tied to Pakistani occupation forces killed 10 freedom fighters at Sadarpur during the nine-month war. He, speaking on behalf of freedom fighters, also accused the groups of looting and arson in 1971. According to historians, leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami had formed those forces to collaborate the Pakistani army. bdnews24.com/c
