<TITLE> Australian judge slams handling of terrorism case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian authorities dropped terrorism charges against a Sydney medical student on Monday, with a judge condemning police and intelligence agents for "grossly improper" behaviour in the case. Izhar Ul-Haque, 24, had been charged with receiving weapons training in 2003 from the Pakistan-based group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is listed as a terrorist group in Australia. The case was dropped after police interviews with him were ruled inadmissible in court. New South Wales Supreme Court judge Michael Adams said intelligence officers from the secretive Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) had kidnapped and falsely imprisoned Ul-Haque during their investigations. "It was a gross interference by the agents of the state with the accused's legal rights as a citizen, rights which he still has whether he be suspected of criminal conduct or not, and whether he is Muslim or not," Adams said. The development is a further blow to Australia's tough stand on national security after prosecutors in July dropped charges against an Indian doctor, saying they made a mistake by publicly charging him with supporting terrorism. Australia, a close ally of the United States with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has never suffered a major peacetime attack on home soil, although 92 Australians were among more than 220 killed in bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002 and 2005. Australia has gradually toughened anti-terrorism laws since 2001. In August the courts ruled that police had the right to impose strict limits on people suspected of links to militant organisations. Ul-Haque did not comment on Monday's developments, but his lawyer, Adam Houda, described the prosecution as flawed from the start. "From the beginning, this was no more than a show trial designed to justify the billions of dollars spent on counter-terrorism," Houda told reporters. "It has been one bungled prosecution after another."
