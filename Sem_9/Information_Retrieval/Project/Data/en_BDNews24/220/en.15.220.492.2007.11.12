 YANGON, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN human rights envoy to Myanmar Paulo Sergio Pinheiro visited Yangon's notorious Insein prison on Monday to try to meet Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi, two of the leaders of August's fuel price protests, a diplomat said. The Brazilian law professor, on his first trip to the army-ruled former Burma in four years, also went to Yangon's Ngwekyaryan Buddhist monastery, one of those raided during September's bloody crackdown on monk-led marches. Hundreds of maroon-robed monks were among the 2,927 people official media say were rounded up in the crackdown. State papers have denied any monks were among the 10 official dead, even though monks reported that at least five of their brethren were killed when soldiers and pro-government thugs raided monasteries thought to be leading the protests. Several photos have emerged on the Internet of what appear to be mutilated bodies of dead monks, although it is impossible to known when or where they were taken. Official media say all but 91 of those arrested were released after questioning -- a figure that, like the junta's death toll, Pinheiro is likely to probe in great detail. Western governments say the real toll is probably far higher. Relatives of political detainees, many of whom played a part in another mass uprising against decades of military rule in 1988, said conditions in Insein had improved in the run-up to Pinheiro's visit. "We were allowed to send things to them. We got a chance to learn their health condition. It's the first time since they were arrested in August," one family member told Reuters. It is not known whether Pinheiro, due to go to the junta's new capital, Naypyidaw, on Tuesday, actually managed to meet the people on his list. In the past, he has been allowed access to all political prisoners he wished to see, but stormed out of an interview with a detainee at Insein four years ago when he discovered a tape recorder stuck beneath the table. Before September's crackdown, Amnesty International estimated the junta was holding around 1,100 political prisoners, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 12 of the last 18 yea
