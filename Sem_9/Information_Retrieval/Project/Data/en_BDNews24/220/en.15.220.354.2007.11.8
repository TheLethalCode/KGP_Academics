<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Thursday questioned how a 'self-confessed murderer' and 'fugitive convict' had appeared in an interview on a private television channel recently. Speaking, of the Channel i interview of Bangabandhu murder convict Khandaker Abdur Rashid, aired early Wednesday, Zillur said: "I was amazed." "Rashid is a fugitive convict. Nobody knows his whereabouts. How the channel got his interview is also a matter to be considered. He is a self-confessed murderer," he told reporters at his Gulshan home. "I don't know how credible his comments were, but in any case, they are of no consequence to Bangabandhu or the country," Zillur said, of Rashid's stated belief that 'Sheikh Mujib is the Father of the Nation'. "There are many speculations regarding those linked to Bangabandhu's murder. But that many criminals were excluded, there is no doubt," Zillur added. He told assembled reporters that AL had had a successful dialogue with the Election Commission. But on the party's preparations for elections, he said: "With indoor politics still banned across the country, what preparations can we make? We will discuss reforming the ward committees at the metropolitan committee meeting of the party Friday." "We are likely to participate in the city corporation elections though there has been no preparation for the national elections by the party. The working committee will finalise such matters." Zillur reiterated his demand for the release of detained AL leaders and activists across the country as well as lifting the ban on indoor politics. bdnews
