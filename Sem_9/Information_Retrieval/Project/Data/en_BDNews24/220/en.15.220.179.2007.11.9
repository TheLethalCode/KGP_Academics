<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  The nation is poised to observe Saturday the 20th anniversary of death of young pro-democracy activist Noor Hossain. The democracy hero was killed in police firing on Nov 10, 1987 at the Zero Point in the capital while protesting the misrule and atrocities of military strongman HM Ershad. Since then the day has been observed as Shaheed Noor Hossain Day. Noor Hossain had the spectacular slogan, "Down with anarchy, democracy be freed" inscribed on his chest and back when he had taken bullets in the anti-autocracy rally. His killing fuelled the democracy campaign to reach to a crescendo and hastened the end of Ershad's dictatorial rule that came on Dec 6, 1990. Born in 1961 at Narinda in the city to an auto-rickshaw driver father and a housewife mother, Noor Hossain trained to be an automobile driver, besides being a passionate Awami League activist. Many organisations have drawn elaborate programmes to observe the 20th anniversary of the martyr's self-sacrifice. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman in a statement issued Friday paid his profound respects in remembrance of the hero. He said the sacrifices made by Noor Hossain and his comrades will be glorified through ensuring the people's rights to rice meals and fear-free voting. bdnew
