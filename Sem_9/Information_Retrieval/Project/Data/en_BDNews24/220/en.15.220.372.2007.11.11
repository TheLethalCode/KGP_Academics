 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Sunday ordered Sheikh Rehana, who is facing charges of extortion, to surrender by Nov 18. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Shawkat Ali Chowdhury issued the order. Earlier, the court had issued a warrant of arrest against Rehana, sister of detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The case involves alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from a businessman during the rule of Hasina, also accused in the case. Rehana, who lives in London, denied the charges against her. The court also ordered publication of the notice in national dailies in line with the report of Gulshan Police Station, as the police could not arrest or seize her possessions. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque on July 24 pressed extortion charges against Rehana showing her fugitive and her cousin and AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, showing him detained. On Oct 24, the court issued an arrest warrant against Rehana after accepting the chargesheet in the case and ordered authorities to attach all her movable property. The police arrested Hasina at her Dhanmondi's Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in the same case. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading Limited, filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on June 13. According to case details, Selim had taken extortion of about Tk 3 crore in several phases in 2000 and 2001 from the plaintiff for awarding a power plant at Siddhirganj in Narayanganj. bdnews24.com/p
