 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid Saturday said that he had warned tax officers against neglect of duty. At a meeting attended by about 50 tax officers from across the country, the National Board of Revenue boss said any sort of negligence in revenue collections would not be tolerated. Majid told bdnews24.com Saturday by phone that he had convened the meeting to strengthen revenue collection efforts Saturday although the day was a government holiday. "Everybody in the meeting was directed to carry out their responsibilities with integrity taking up the challenge of achieving the revenue collection target. They were asked to be careful so that no taxpayer was harassed during paying taxes." "Setting a target is not the end. We have to take it as a challenge to achieve that goal. Taxpayers have to be inspired to pay tax and a friendly environment has to be created," Majid said. He stressed the need to widen monitoring to boost collections. "In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, revenue collection exceeded the target. Against the Tk 9051.46 crore target, collection was Tk 9301.05 crore, Tk 250 crore up." The NBR chief hoped the trend would continue. "We want to have a friendly relationship with the taxpayers and ensure that they pay without hassles. bdnews
