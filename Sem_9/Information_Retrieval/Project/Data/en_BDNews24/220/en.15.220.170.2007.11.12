 LONDON, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US oil slid below $96 on Monday after top exporter Saudi Arabia said OPEC would look at raising output to brake oil's ascent towards $100 and safeguard world economic growth. But North Sea Brent crude oil recouped some losses on news of a militant attack on Nigeria's Qua Iboe oil terminal and the temporary closure of Russia's main Black Sea port of Novorossiisk as a storm approached.
