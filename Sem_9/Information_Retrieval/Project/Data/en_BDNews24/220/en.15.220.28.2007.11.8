<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's military said on Thursday the toll of Tamil Tiger rebels killed in a major fight the previous day in the island's far north was 60, up from 52 reported earlier, and two more rebels died in a separate fight. The Tigers meanwhile said 20 soldiers were killed and more than 100 wounded in the major battle on the Jaffna peninsula, while just one of their fighters was killed. The military said its death toll was 11 killed and 41 injured. There were no independent accounts of what happened. There have been near daily clashes recently in intensified fighting in the two-decade conflict. A government air strike last week killed the leader of the Tigers' political wing in a body blow to hopes of ending the civil war soon. The military said fierce fighting erupted on early Wednesday along a heavily defended 'border' that separates government and rebel-held territory on the Jaffna peninsula, and troops held territory on the rebel side of the line for two hours. "The intercepted LTTE communications confirmed the death toll of the terrorists had gone up to 60," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security, declining to be named. Rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan earlier said the Tigers foiled a bid to overrun their bunkers on the Jaffna forward defence line. "The Sri Lankan military came with the support of heavy artillery, multi-barrel rocket launchers, mortars and back-up fire from helicopters and tanks," he said by telephone. "The clash lasted about two hours, and they fell back to their original positions with heavy casualties," he added. Analysts say both sides, locked in a bitter parallel propaganda war, tend to exaggerate enemy losses and play down their own. The military said a separate confrontation on Wednesday afternoon in the northern district of Vavuniya killed two Tamil Tiger rebels while the military suffered no casualties. Earlier on Wednesday, President Mahinda Rajapaksa unveiled his budget for the coming year. Documents showed defence spending at 166.45 billion rupees ($1.5 billion), its highest ever. The Tigers say they are fighting for an independent state for minority Tamils in the north and east -- which Rajapaksa has ruled out of hand. An estimated 5,000 people have been killed since early last year amid near-daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes. The death toll since the civil war erupted in 1983 stands at about 70,000.
