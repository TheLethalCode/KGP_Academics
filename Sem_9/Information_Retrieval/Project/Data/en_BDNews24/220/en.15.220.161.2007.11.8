 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government's advisory committee on law and order has expressed satisfaction on the overall law and order situation despite the increasing number of cases in different police stations. Home affairs secretary Abdul Karim told reporters Thursday, the incident that occurred at the late president Ziaur Rahman's graveside was not serious. "There is no chance that the overall law and order is hampered," he said. Speaking after a meeting at the home ministry, Karim said the committee had discussed illegal price hiking in markets, ensuring distribution of fertiliser in the country, and maintaining peace within the garment industry. The committee asked representatives of the law-enforcement agencies to be vigilant in markets, to prevent traders illegally hiking up the price of essentials. The committee also suggested providing subsidies in rice, edible oil and other essentialsas the government has done with fertiliserto curb further price rises. It also recommended the government resume programmes such as open-market sales of rice, and BDR operated shops. Speaking of the rising incidents of 'extortion by mobile phone', Karim said most such calls come from border areas, although the callers collect numbers from Dhaka. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission was asked to take necessary steps in consultation with law enforcers on the matter. If necessary, the committee suggested, SIM cards should be traced and seized. Karim said the meeting approved the holding of elections for a number of organisations including Dhaka Reporters Unity and Bangladesh Medical Association. Law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein presided over the committee meeting. Education adviser Ayub Kadri, additional inspector general of police Nababikram Tripura and representatives of different organisations were among those present. bdn
