 Maruf Mallick Staff correspondent Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  Sex trade has seen a sea change. Whereas women and children were once kidnapped or bundled secretly across frontiers, traffickers now flash visas and alluring work permits to fool women into work abroadunwittingly to end up as prostitutes. Domestic trafficking is keeping pace with growth in international sex trade, according to research conducted by TdH Netherlands, a child-rights organisation. Research coordinator Mohiuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com said that human trafficking often makes headlines when a story hits the press, but follow-up news on the problem is inconsistent. Women in sex trade work in a variety of settings including out of hotels or homes, and as floating street walkers and call girls. Most sex workers in Bangladesh were hotel- and home-based, Ahmed said. Sheikh Abdur Rauf, deputy secretary of the home ministry, told bdnews24.com: "The government is working to curb trafficking. An intra-ministerial committee is active in this regard. Bangladeshis are usually trafficked to India, Pakistan and the Middle East. Labour trafficking is also taking place." He said that poverty played into traffickers hands, and that a social movement was needed to combat it. CARE Bangladesh reports that there are more than one lakh prostitutes in Bangladesh. Many ended up in the trade after falling prey to traffickers. Mohiuddin said there was no accurate figure on exactly how many Bangladeshi women and children have been trafficked domestically or internationally. His research work speculated that the figure was between 10,000 to 20,000 women and children trafficked to points in India, Pakistan and the Middle East. Most ended up as prostitutes, domestic workers and, among young boys, camel jockeys. There is also a brisk trade in body parts, he added. The International Labour Organisation and Unicef estimate that some 10,000 Bangladeshi children work as prostitutes. Just 10 percent are believed to have come to the profession willingly. The others were either coerced or sold into the trade. Child prostitutes in Bangladesh ranged between seven and 24 years of age, with 16 years old as the average. Advocate Salma Ali, executive director of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association, a organisation working to halt the trade in persons told bdnews24.com that the nature of trafficking had changed. "Trafficking has grown in different ways," she said. Recruiters and agents became savvier, fraudulently offering work abroad to lure women into the sex trade. As traffickers become more adept at manipulating the law and taking advantage of demand for overseas work opportunities, it was becoming increasingly difficult to catch and try them, she said. "The law on the repression of women and children makes provision to punish traffickers, but the definition of 'trafficker' should be more specific. Otherwise it is difficult to file a case. The United Nations definition should be included here." A report of anti-trafficking activities conducted by the home ministry said a total of 636 people had been rescued between June 15, 2004 and Oct 30, 2007. They have all been rehabilitated. A total of 4,170 suspects had been detained on suspicion of ties to trafficking as of Oct 30. Of them 3,888 were arrested at Dhaka's Zia International Airport, 120 at Sylhet airport, 88 at Chittagong airport, 48 at Benapole land port and 26 at Hili land port. The home ministry's Bangladesh country report on women and children trafficking said, of the rescued trafficking victims 49 percent were women, 42 percent children and 9 percent men. bdnews
