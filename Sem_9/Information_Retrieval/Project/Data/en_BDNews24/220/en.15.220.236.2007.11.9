<TITLE> China mulls new holiday calendar, more old festivals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has suggested changes to the nation's holiday calendar, a move backers hope will ease the travel chaos during the current May Day "golden week" break and put the emphasis back on traditional Chinese festivals. The Xinhua news agency said on Friday the government had proposed replacing the week-long May holiday, marked every year by a colossal exodus of city-dwellers heading for their family homes, with a simple one-day break on May 1. In return, the plan would provide additional one-day holidays to mark the springtime Qingming festival, when families traditionally tend ancestral tombs, the Dragon Boat Festival in early summer, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, when countless millions enjoy sweet "moon cakes". The proposal, posted on Internet sites for public comment, would also add a day to the Lunar New Year holiday. The break would start a day earlier, giving people relief from the stress of rushing home from work or school to prepare for the biggest festival in the traditional calender. The October National Day break, when rail and air travel systems, tourist attractions, shops and hotels heave under the weight of hundreds of millions of vacationers, would not change. The proposals are unlikely to make much difference to hundreds of millions of workers who employers expect to toil in factories, restaurants and shops even during the official breaks. But supporters said the plan would help revive traditional festivals and customs eroded in China's frenzied rush to economic prosperity. Many of these had already been strongly discouraged during the first decades of Communist rule. "Making traditional festivals legal holidays will help carry forward Chinese history and culture," Ji Baocheng, a university president and member of the national parliament, told Xinhua. Hundreds of thousands of people have already left comments about the proposal on Web sites, the vast majority applauding the proposed changes, the report said. But some also raised problems. "We still cannot go back home for a family reunion during the traditional festivals if there is only one day off," said one posting, according to Xinhua.
