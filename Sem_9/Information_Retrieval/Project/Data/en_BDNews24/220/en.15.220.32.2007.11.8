 Sanat Babla Senior Sports Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh under-19 cricket team's tour of Pakistan has been postponed indefinitely for security reasons, an official said Thursday. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman said the board sought better security arrangements for its cricketers amid growing political strife in Pakistan. A Nov 7 departure that had been pushed back to Nov 9 was postponed again after the board expressed its concern over security measures. The team was scheduled to leave the country at 11 pm Friday but Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Karachi advised the board to suspend the tour late Thursday. Mahmudur said the foreign ministry had given the BCB the green light, but Bangladesh's mission in Karachi Thursday asked the board to review the decision. bdnews24.
