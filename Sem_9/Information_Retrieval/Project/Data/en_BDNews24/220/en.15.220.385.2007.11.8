<TITLE> BoE holds UK interest rates, cut expected next yr </TITLE>

 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England held interest rates at a six-year high of 5.75 percent for the fourth month running on Thursday, but expectations of a cut soon are growing as trouble in the financial sector drags on. The decision was widely expected, but the pound hit a 26-year high against the dollar and the FTSE-100 share index slipped as many investors had prepared for a surprise cut due to the financial market problems. Experts said it is only a matter of time before the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee cuts interest rates, probably early next year, as surveys are pointing to the economy slowing down because of tighter lending conditions and rocketing oil prices. "There was no change today, but a rate cut is coming. There is a clear dilemma between where the economy currently sits and where business surveys suggest it is headed," said Andrew McLaughlin, RBS Group chief economist. "There is a strong case for cutting ahead of the deceleration in growth, but the MPC is minded to wait, not least because of elevated inflation risks." MPC members have repeatedly sounded the warning about rising price pressures. Before the credit crunch took hold of markets in August, they had looked sure to raise interest rates a sixth time in less than 18 months to 6 percent. Oil prices nearing $100 a barrel, soaring food prices and an economy growing very fast are all likely to have kept alive concern that inflation could be a problem. The inflation rate has only recently fallen below target after hitting a series high of 3.1 percent earlier this year. CALLING A PAUSE In Frankfurt, the European Central Bank also kept interest rates steady and a cut in the euro zone looks a long way off as policymakers there worry that inflation, already at a two-year high, will climb further. The US Federal Reserve may also have called a pause after cutting interest rates by 75 basis points since the market turmoil started because of worries about inflation. Even Britain's business lobby groups are not certain there is yet a clear case for cutting rates now due to signs that inflation is about to move higher. "The key question is whether the MPC judges the downward forces on inflation from the credit crunch and eroding consumer and business confidence to outweigh the upward pressure from $100 per barrel oil prices. Thus far they seem uncertain," said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. The big worry, however, is that financial market troubles spill over into the wider economy. Morgan Stanley became the latest bank this week to announce multi-billion dollar losses arising from loans to the US sub-prime mortgage market. BoE Governor Mervyn King predicted that City of London bonuses might shrink and jobs might go as a result. This could disproportionately hit Britain because of London's pre-eminence as a global financial centre. Credit conditions for borrowers are already likely to be tighter following September's run on Northern Rock bank which had built its business on consumers borrowing as much as six times their annual salary. That could mean the housing market might face a sharp slowdown. Data earlier on Thursday already showed house prices falling 0.5 percent in October, according to the Halifax index, the second monthly decline in a row. Economists said next week's Inflation Report will now be crucial to see how the MPC views the economy. Growth is likely to have been marked lower and inflation perhaps a bit higher. "Our own view is still that base rates will fall over the next few months. As far as timing is concerned, it is tempting to suggest February, the next Inflation Report month after November, and indeed this is our central view," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
