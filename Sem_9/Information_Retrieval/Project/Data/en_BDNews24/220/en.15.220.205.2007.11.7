 BELGRADE, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool revived their hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 with a record 8-0 drubbing of Besiktas while Rosenborg beat Valencia 2-0 to hand Ronald Koeman a disappointing start at the Mestalla on Tuesday. Liverpool's best performance of a patchy season in their Group A match at Anfield provided a record-breaking Champions League scoreline, beating 7-0 wins by Arsenal over Slavia Prague last month and Juventus against Olympiakos Piraeus in Dec. 2003. Chelsea stayed on course to reach the knockout stages after a 0-0 draw at Schalke 04 in Group B while AC Milan's Filippo Inzaghi equalled Gerd Muller's all-time record of 62 goals in European club football in their 3-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk. Celtic also remained in the hunt in Group D with a 1-0 win over Benfica after 21-year-old midfielder Aiden McGeady rifled in a deflected long-range winner on the stroke of halftime. The result left Gordon Strachan's side third on six points, three ahead of Benfica and level with second-placed Shakhtar. Inzaghi, who was a 63rd minute substitute in Ukraine, fired Milan ahead three minutes later and put his name in the history books with an injury-time goal after Kaka steered in the second. The win over Shakhtar left European champions Milan top of the group on nine points and with a chance to seal a berth in the last 16 when they visit Benfica on Nov. 28. Liverpool's win was a breakthrough for manager Rafa Benitez, who came under strong pressure after a 2-1 loss at Besiktas a fortnight ago left his side staring at early elimination. DIFFERENT STORY It was a different story on Tuesday though as Yossi Benayoun grabbed a hat-trick, Ryan Babel and Peter Crouch scored two goals each and Steven Gerrard added another to give Liverpool their first win in the group. The 2005 champions have reignited their campaign and moved up a place to third on four points, one more than Besiktas. Porto, who won Europe's premier club competition in 2004, leapt into the driving seat in Group A with eight points after a 2-1 home win over Olympique Marseille that left the French side in second place on seven points after four matches. Moroccan striker Tarik Sektioui sent Porto on their way with a dazzling solo run from the halfway line and Lisandro Lopez headed the winner off the underside of the bar after Mamadou Niang had equalised with a diving header. Chelsea's seven-game winning streak under Avram Grant ended in Gelsenkirchen but the stalemate left them a point ahead of Rosenborg, who registered their second 2-0 win over Valencia in as many weeks thanks to a Steffen Iversen double. The former Tottenham Hotspur striker gave the Norwegian side a 31st minute lead with a low shot that went in off the post and sealed the win shortly before the hour when he was left unmarked at the far post to nod the ball home. Chelsea (8 points) visit Rosenborg (7) later this month while Schalke (4) are at bottom side Valencia (3) as the battle for the top two qualifying spots and a consolation UEFA Cup berth for the third-placed team intensifies. Real Madrid lead Group C on eight points after a goalless draw at Olympiakos Piraeus, who have five points along with Lazio following a 2-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Olympiakos goalkeeper Antonios Nikopolidis produced a string of fine saves to keep the Greeks in the hunt while a Tommaso Rocchi brace gave Lazio a 2-0 lead at the Olympic Stadium in Rome before Diego pulled one back with a late penalty
