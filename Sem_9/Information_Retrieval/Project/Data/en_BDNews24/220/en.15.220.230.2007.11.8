 Bangladesh, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com) - Former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo was freed on bail Thursday after five months in jail. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general (prisons), told bdnews24.com that Mintoo was freed after jail authorities received a High Court bail order in an extortion case against him. "No other cases are pending against him," he said. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Mintoo said: "I hope my freedom will bring ease to ordinary businessmen. The economy will gain pace. Democracy will falter without a strong economy." Sons of the leading businessman and employees of his business firms received him at the gate of Dhaka Central Jail. Joint forces arrested Mintoo in a major anticorruption crackdown on May 29. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka sent Mintoo to jail on June 4 after he was quizzed in remand for four days. The High Court on Aug 7 granted bail to Mintoo and stayed his detention order. But he was not freed. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury gave the order on a writ petition filed on behalf of Mintoo. When the writ petition came up for hearing on August 6, the government sought more time. bdnew
