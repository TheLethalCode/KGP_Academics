 ISLAMABAD, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President President Pervez Musharraf, under pressure from rivals and Western allies to put Pakistan back on a path to democracy, was due to give a speech on Sunday that aides said could set a timetable for national polls. Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto left Islamabad for the eastern city of Lahore, where she plans to begin a mass protest on Tuesday unless General Musharraf rolls back emergency rule and restores the constitution. U.S. President George Bush, who values Musharraf as an ally in the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban, also expects Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless 1999 coup, to quit the army, become a civilian leader and hold elections. Pakistanis are wondering what their military leader will do next, though there have not been huge street protests. He has already sacked most judges, locked up lawyers, rounded up most of the political opposition and rights activist, justifying his draconian steps by saying the judiciary was hampering the battle against militants and extremism. With pressure piling up, Musharraf scheduled a news conference, his first since declaring an emergency a week ago, at his army office in Rawalpindi on Sunday afternoon. "He is most likely to give a date for the election," a senior government official said. Before Musharraf declared emergency rule last Saturday, setting off a storm of criticism, elections had been expected by mid-January, two months after the expected dissolution of the national and provincial assemblies. Faced with calls to clarify his intentions, Musharraf said late last week elections would be held by Feb. 15, and everything would fall into place once new judges appointed to the Supreme Court struck down challenges against his Oct. 6 re-election. Diplomats say Musharraf's main objective in imposing the emergency was to stop the court ruling his re-election invalid, upholding rivals' protests that he was ineligible to contest while still army chief. BUSH TAKES MUSHARRAF'S WORD Musharraf says he will quit as army chief and be sworn in as a civilian president once the legal obstacles are overcome. Bush said, at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting at his Texas ranch on Saturday, that he took the Pakistani leader at his word. "He knows my position," Bush said. "I do remind you that he has declared that he'll take off his uniform and he has declared there will be elections, which are positive steps. "We also believe that suspension of the emergency decree will make it easier for the democracy to flourish," Bush added. The United States is worried the turmoil will hamper its nuclear-armed ally's efforts against terrorism. Pakistani forces are battling a growing Islamist insurgency along the Afghan border -- where Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding. Bhutto, who Musharraf had been looking to as a potential ally after national elections, was released from house arrest the same day and has kept up a barrage of criticism of the general's retreat into authoritarianism. "Pakistan under dictatorship is a pressure cooker," Bhutto told diplomats at a reception hosted by loyalists at the Senate on Saturday night. "Without a place to vent, the passion of our people for liberty threatens to explode." Musharraf has also placed curbs on media -- private news channels are off the air and transmissions of the BBC and CNN have been blocked, although newspapers are publishing freely. The government further tightened the screws on media on Saturday by telling three British journalists to get out. A lawyers' movement, championing dismissed chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, held demonstrations early last week, and the lawyers are now boycotting courts. Supporters of Bhutto's Pakistan People's party clashed with police in Rawalpindi on Friday, after police stopped their leader from attending a anti-government rally there. Police have used batons and teargas to disperse protesters in various parts of the country but there has been no major violence. Musharraf briefed army commanders on Saturday, telling them the emergency had been a very difficult decision but necessary to ensure effective governance, maintain efforts against terrorism and provide for a stable political transition, the military sa
