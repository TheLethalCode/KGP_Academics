 TEHRAN, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence on a Kurdish dissident journalist convicted of charges including spying, his lawyer said on Friday. A Revolutionary Court in the western Kurdish city of Marivan sentenced Adnan Hassanpour to death in July. A colleague, Abdolvahed 'Hiva' Botimar, was sentenced to death at the same time but the Supreme Court referred his case to another court.

Iran's rights record is criticised by the West and rights groups often report that Tehran imprisons political dissidents without due legal process. Rights groups and Western diplomats say Iranian authorities have increased pressure on dissidents, intellectuals and critical journalists, adding this may in part be a response to mounting international pressure over its atomic programme. The West accuses Iran of covertly trying to build nuclear arms. Iran denies the charge, saying it needs nuclear technology to generate electrici
