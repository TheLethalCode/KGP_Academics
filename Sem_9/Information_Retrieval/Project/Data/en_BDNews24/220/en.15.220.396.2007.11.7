 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman Wednesday said solidarity between the army and civilians would usher in a new day. "I stood by Zia (former president Ziaur Rahman) on Nov 7, 1975 without fear against the nation's enemies. And I remain unafraid of them today." The retired lieutenant general was speaking at the National Press Club at a meeting organised by The Quest for a New Leadership to mark National Revolution and Solidarity Day. "The army came forward to help the government on January 11, as it did on Nov 7 out of a sense of responsibility to the nation," the retired army chief said. "Solidarity between the army and the civilians will begin a new day." "Nationalist forces will bring peace and ease back to public life," he said. The BNP standing committee member was assaulted by Khandaker Delwar Hossain's supporters Wednesday morning after he placed wreaths at the grave of Ziaur Rahman. AHM Mofazzal Karim, adviser to the BNP chairperson, said: "Neither Hannan Shah nor Khandaker Delwar Hossain is our rivals. Our political rival is the Awami League." "A number of leaders are hurting the party by dividing it for personal reasons," he alleged. Liberal Democratic Party presidium member Alamgir Kabir said, "The black sheep who sullied politics and were selling off the country will have to answer to the nation for their misdeeds." bdnews24.
