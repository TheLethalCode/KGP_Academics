 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  Hafizuddin Ahmed, who was appointed acting secretary general of the BNP amid disapproval by another faction, said Saturday the party would contest all local government polls. The Election Commission has recently said it would organise the city corporation polls but the timeframe was not clear. "The BNP will contest the city corporation polls. We are thinking of honest, popular and clean candidates. We will take part in other local government elections," Hafizuddin, former water resources minister, told reporters at his Banani home. The retired major also asked the government and the commission to create an atmosphere so that they could nominate popular and honest candidates. He also said his party would contest the general elections. At a recent meeting of the party's standing committee, Hafizuddin was given the post but another faction known as followers of detained party chief Khaleda Zia rejected the appointment. The faction led by former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain claimed to be in the mainstream. Hafizuddin Saturday demanded that the government start food rationing to rein in the soaring prices of everyday essentials. Referring to the rationing system in the West Bengal of India, he said the government could launch a similar project in Bangladesh to benefit the poor and low-income people. bd
