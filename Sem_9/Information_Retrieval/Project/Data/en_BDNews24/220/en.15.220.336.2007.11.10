<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  A clash between truck drivers and unofficial ferry agents led to a one-hour suspension of ferry services and huge traffic tailbacks at Paturia ferry crossing Saturday. At least 10 people were injured and 50 trucks vandalised in the incident amid heightened tensions since truck drivers barricaded the terminal Friday night. The bdnews24.com Manikganj correspondent reports that truck drivers and unofficial ticket agents started fighting at around 11 in the morning following 10 days of delayed ferry services due to low water levels in the Padma River. An army contingent rushed to the scene at about 1:15 pm, by which time the queue of vehicles reached beyond Aricha. Local police and officials of the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation decided to transport seven buses and five trucks on one ferry following the barricade. However, truck drivers allege the authorities had only allowed buses on the limited services since dawn. Truck driver Abdus Samad said: "The agents attacked us as we protested the situation. They vandalised 50 trucks while the police stood by." Police officers from Paturia Police Post denied the allegation, when contacted by bdnews24.com. Samad also said truck drivers sometimes have to wait up to two or three days to make the crossing unless they offered bribes to the agents. Bidyut Kumar Saha, the assistant manager of BIWTC in Aricha, denied the charges. "We are giving priority to the buses considering the passengers they carry," Bidyut said. "As water levels are low in the river, only one facility out of three is operational at each ferry terminal, that creates the problem," Bidyut added. bdnews2
