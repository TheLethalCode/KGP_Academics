 TALLINN, Nov 9 (bdnews24Reuters) - Serbia's goal of achieving European Union candidate status in 2008 is ambitious but possible, the EU's commissioner for enlargement said on Friday. The EU initialled an agreement with Serbia this week covering the reforms needed for entry to the bloc. Serbia wants to get the agreement fully signed and by the end of next year be recognised as an official EU entry candidate. "It is an extremely ambitious objective but it is still within the limits of the possible," Olli Rehn told reporters on a visit to Estonia, when asked about the candidate status goal. Rehn said he saw possibilities that Serbia would very soon achieve full cooperation with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which would allow a signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, initialled this week. The tribunal says Belgrade must arrest and hand over suspects such as Bosnia Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic, who is sought on genocide charges. " ... the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is really the gateway to candidate status in the European Union," he said. The talks with the EU coincide with tensions over Kosovo. The EU, Russia and the United States are trying to negotiate a deal for the breakaway province, which Serbia has offered autonomy, but which has demanded independence.
