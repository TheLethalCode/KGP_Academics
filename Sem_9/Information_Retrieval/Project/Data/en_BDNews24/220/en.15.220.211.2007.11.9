 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  A government report has said that seven out of eight motor vehicles used in various government jobs between 2002 and 2006 were not deposited at the government transport pool. "Most of these vehicles are now being used in breach of government rules," the planning ministry's Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) said in a report sent to the Chief Adviser's Office in August. In May, the CAO sent a letter asking IMED to launch an enquiry into the current status of motor vehicles used in public sector development projects. A six-member team led by IMED joint secretary Sheikh Abdul Gaffar carried out the investigation. It was found that some 1,441 motor vehicles out of 1,603 used in various projects completed between 2002 and 2006 were not returned to the government transport pool as required by law. Only 162 or 10 percent of vehicles used in projects were sent back to the government pool. The report also found mismanagement and irregularities in the use of the vehicles. Maintenance, fuel costs and drivers' salary were borne either by new projects or from the revenue budget. According to the report, a total of 1,603 motor vehicles were used by 40 ministries and divisions for 340 projects completed between 2002 and 2006. The environment and forest ministry did not deposit a single vehicle out of 214 used in nine projects, the report said. Only three vehicles out of 183, used in 10 projects under the communications ministry, were deposited at the transport pool. The power division used 151 vehicles for 22 projects. Not one was returned, according to the IMED report. The agriculture ministry did not deposit a single vehicle out of 135 used in 29 projects. Out of 227 vehicles used by the local government and rural division in 36 projects, 113 were deposited with the transport pool. The energy and mineral resources division handed over only 3 vehicles out of 104 used in 17 projects. The education ministry returned 8 vehicles out of 73 used in 29 projects. The fisheries and livestock ministry returned just one vehicle out of 143 used in 21 projects. The report made 11 recommendations, including issuing letters by the relevant ministries to deposit vehicles used in their respective projects. It also asked the finance ministry to punish the chief accounts officers who provided the costs for these vehicles. "I don't know what actions have been taken by the CAO after getting the IMED report," IMED secretary Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain told bdnews24.com. bdne
