 WACO, Texas, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it remained concerned about the continued state of emergency "and curtailment of basic freedoms" in Pakistan. "Former Prime Minister (Benazir) Bhutto and other political party members must be permitted freedom of movement and all protesters released," Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said. "It is crucial for Pakistan's future that moderate political forces work together to bring Pakistan back on the path to democracy," he added. On Thursday the White House welcomed Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf saying elections would be held early next year.
