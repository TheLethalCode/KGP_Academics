 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Sunday said they would ensure the supply of products to the market, even if it required subsidies. A meeting of the council of advisers discussed the spiralling prices of essentials as well as the fertiliser situation, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. "There were four items on the meeting's agenda. The advisers expressed their determination to maintain the supply of products to the market to avoid any crisis," Munaim said. The press secretary said the government launched the Vulnerable Group Feeding Programme in November and had now decided to increase the fund. The other items on the agenda include the Securities and Exchange Amendment Ordinance and the Consumer Rights Protection Ordinance. The cabinet also discussed ways to improve the efficiency of the police. A legal action brought against the government by Dutch company Tulip Computers was also part of the discussion. The education ministry under the last Awami League administration signed a contract with Tulip Computers to buy a large consignment of computers. The cabinet approved the deal on May 24, 2001. However, the subsequent BNP-led alliance government scrapped the deal. A Dutch court then fined the Bangladesh government Tk 31 crore for breach of contract following Tulip Computers' successful legal action. The BNP-led administration did not comply with the Dutch court's ruling, and refused to pay compensation. The company then filed a case with an international tribunal. The previous government attempted to mount a legal defence, but lost the case and was ordered to pay Tk 31 crore in compensation to the computer company. The government is now trying to find out if the compensation figure can be reduced. bdnews24.com/ahd
