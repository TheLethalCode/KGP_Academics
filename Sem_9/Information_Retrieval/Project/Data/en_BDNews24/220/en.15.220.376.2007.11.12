 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh will face a massive human tragedy if the problems of arsenic poisoning are not addressed immediately, government and NGO officials said Sunday. "It is unfortunate that even after several years of news on the presence of arsenic in groundwater many people, particularly in rural settings, still do not know the risks," said Dr Md Shajahan Biswas, director general of Health Services. "We must launch massive awareness programmes to inform everyone affected by the disaster about the consequences of drinking poisoned water and also offer safe options so they don't panic," Biswas told a ceremony in Dhaka to launch an arsenic mitigation programme. The Tk 9.9 crore Integrated Community Based Arsenic Mitigation Programme will be funded by the EU and implemented in 100 critical unions situated in 20 districts around the country. NGO Forum for Drinking Water and Sanitation is also receiving assistance from Misereor, a Catholic organisation based in Germany. The two-year project targets around 2.2 million people exposed to groundwater arsenic, and aims to provide them with clean water alternatives as well as offering treatment and education programmes. The project plans to establish special health camps and other medical support to the affected areas. SMA Rashid, executive director of NGO Forum, said: "We could face a human disaster in the near future if those affected by arsenic poisoning failed to gain treatment." A BUET teacher, Dr Firoze Ahmed, said: "It's a shame that after so many years of effort we have only reached 40 percent in mitigation activities." "Compared to us, West Bengal, where the arsenic problem is equally bad, has advanced far ahead of us, although they started much later." "We should follow the West Bengal model of supplying surface water to the affected areas. Engineers have built pipeline systems to take treated surface water to the affected people there," said Dr Ahmed. bdnews
