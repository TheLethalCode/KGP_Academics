<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Experts suspect that the deadly mysterious illness that has already killed 20 people in Sylhet could be hepatotoxicity, hepatic infection or encephalitis. Professor Nazrul Islam, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Rahman Medical University's virology department chairman, told bdnews24.com: "We suspect that poisonous material (hepatoxicity) may have caused the unknown disease. But we are not ruling out hepatic viral infection or encephalitis as causes of the disease in Sylhet." "We won't rule out hepatic viral infection and encephalitis but we need to do more investigations," he said. Some 90 people have been hospitalised since November 4 in Sylhet's Gwainghat and Companyganj upazilas. Twenty people have died so far, officials said. Experts sent blood samples to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA to verify tests done locally at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research. A team of experts led by neurologist professor Din Mohammad is leaving for Sylhet Monday to determine whether further diagnosis and laboratory testing will be necessary, officials said. The expert team will also include professor Abul Faiz, professor Selim Sakur and professor Mahmudur Rahman. Encephalitis is an inflammation of brain tissue. It usually results from an infection, most often by a virus, but sometimes by bacteria, a fungus, or parasites. In rare cases, it may be caused by brain injury, a drug or vaccine reaction, or poison. In hepatotoxicity, toxic material causes damage to liver tissue. Similarly, in hepatic viral infection, a virus invades the liver tissue causing the liver to malfunction. bd
