<TITLE> China stops exports of bead toy, vows inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China froze exports of the "Aqua Dots" bead toy on Friday, following recalls of the potentially toxic toy in the United States and Australia, state media reported. US safety officials recalled about 4.2 million Aqua Dots toys this week for possibly containing a "date rape" drug. Australia too announced a ban on the popular toy, sold there in a version called "Bindeez", and Spain also announced a recall. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said the Aqua Dots toys include a chemical, 1,4 butanediol, which if swallowed can turn toxic and cause unconsciousness, earning it notoriety as a "date rape" drug. China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine announced it had sealed up remaining "Aqua Dot" toys at the manufacturer, the Xinhua news agency reported. The quality watchdog, battling a string of international recalls and safety scares that have stained the "made-in-China" brand, did not reveal the maker's name but promised a swift investigation. The toy involves arranging small, multi-coloured beads coated with a glue into shapes and then spraying them with water to fix them together. In some cases, instead of the safe chemical 1,5 pentanediol being used for the glue, the dangerous chemical 1,4 butanediol was used in manufacturing. Two American and three Australian children were hospitalised after playing with the toy.
