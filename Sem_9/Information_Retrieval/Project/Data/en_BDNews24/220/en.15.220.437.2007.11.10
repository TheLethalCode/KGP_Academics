 AMSTERDAM, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A witness in the UN war crimes trial of Kosovo's former prime minister was arrested on Friday for failing to appear in court, the tribunal said. The court issued an arrest warrant for Kosovo Albanian Avni Krasniqi after he ignored an order to appear on Oct. 29 at the trial of Ramush Haradinaj, who has been indicted for murder, rape and torture alleged to have been committed by his forces.

Considered a hero by many Kosovo Albanians, Haradinaj is the most senior former KLA guerrilla to be indicted over the war and the first serving head of government to be indicted since former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
