<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The health ministry Sunday formed an eight-strong committee of specialised doctors to resolve the unidentified disease. The disease has killed 23 people and affected over 1,500 people at Goainghat and Companiganj in Sylhet, Ramgati in Laxmipur and seven upazilas in Cox's Bazaar. The decision came from a meeting of the ministry chaired by health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman and attended by officials of the Directorate General of Health Services and experts. Professor Nazrul Islam of the virology department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University was made chairman of the committee and Professor Moazzem Hossain, director of disease prevention department of the health directorate, member secretary. "The unknown disease might be the impact of Japanese encephalitis or NIPA virus. The disease first affects liver and later kidney. But the cause of the disease might be malnutrition," the health adviser said. "The disease attacks when there is a shortage of sugar and glucose in the body. It is cured by fulfilling the needs." "Whatever the disease is we are trying to detect it. We will take long-term steps so that the diseases cannot strike in the future," he added. bdne
