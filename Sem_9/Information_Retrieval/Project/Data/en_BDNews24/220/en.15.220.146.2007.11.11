<TEXT>
 MILAN, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palermo moved up to seventh in Serie A after coming from behind to beat Napoli 2-1 on Saturday thanks to a second-half double from Giovanni Tedesco. The first top-flight meeting between the sides in 34 years lost some of its edge when Napoli fans were banned from the Stadio Renzo Barbera because of recent crowd trouble. But the players still served up an entertaining game. Palermo, who had not won at home since Sept. 26, controlled the first half with Franco Brienza hitting a post before Mariano Bogliacino gave promoted Napoli a surprise lead in the second. Midfielder Tedesco levelled on 57 minutes when his clever lob took a deflection on its way into the top corner. The derby of the two Sicilies, so called because of former monarchs who ruled Sicily and the kingdom of Naples, was settled in the 67th minute when Tedesco turned in a corner from close range. Palermo were later awarded a penalty for handball but the referee reversed his decision after consulting his linesman. Earlier, Sampdoria recorded a 3-0 home win over third from bottom Empoli. Eighth-placed Sampdoria, one spot higher than Napoli, took an early lead when Sergio Volpi's free kick went in off defender Guillermo Giacomazzi. Experienced striker Vincenzo Montella doubled their advantage before halftime and Paolo Sammarco tapped in a late third to help the Genoa-based side erase memories of the 5-0 hammering by AC Milan in their last home game.
