<TITLE> US, EU have to settle for less in Doha-Mandelson </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A "substantial" new world trade deal is within reach after six years of talks, but both the United States and the European Union will have to settle for less than they wanted, the EU's top trade official said on Thursday. "After six years, there is more or less a deal on the table. It is substantial and valuable," EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in the prepared text of a speech to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "It is not ideal for anyone, and less in important respects than both Europe and America had originally hoped for ... There are no overwhelming negotiating triumphs to be brought home from the conference room," Mandelson said.
