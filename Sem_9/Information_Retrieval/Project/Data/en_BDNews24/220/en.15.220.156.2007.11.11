 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday said there was no scope to overlook that fact that women were repressed in a male-dominated society. "We have to reduce the discrimination to form a right society. All of our national achievements will count for nothing unless we stop inequality and injustice," he said in his address to a conference on women's rights at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "We have to pursue our relentless effort for equal dignity and right of men and women in all walks of the society. Over decades, women have come to a better position both in society and in the family. "They have learnt to be self-sufficient and earn their livelihood through education. They are playing active roles in establishing their rights and preventing all kinds of deprivation and repression. The men in society are also being involved in the battle," the interim government head said. In his written statement, Fakhruddin expressed solidarity with the battle for a Bangladesh free of domestic violence. Presenting statistics of women's repression in Bangladesh, he said: "It is unfortunately true that a UN organisation reports that 47 percent of women are victims of physical torture by their husbands." Fakhruddin said domestic torture can be cut by following social ethics and religious and social values properly. He said the government had made some headway in establishing gender equity in primary and secondary education. "But to achieve the aim fully we have to ensure equity of men and women and empowerment of women in other areas. There is no alternative to a combined battle to fight in government and private sectors." bdnews24.com
