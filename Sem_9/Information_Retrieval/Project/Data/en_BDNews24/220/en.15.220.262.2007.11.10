<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Motiur Rahman Rentu, the veteran freedom fighter and author of the controversial book Amar Fashi Chai, died in Paris Saturday after a battle with lung cancer. The former aide to Awami League president Sheikh Hasina published Amar Fashi Chai (I want my hanging) in June 2000. The then AL government banned the book almost as soon as it came out on the grounds that the contents were inflammatory and could provoke hatred toward the government. In his controversial book Rentu criticised the then ruling Awami League administration and specifically targeted some of its leaders, including party chief Sheikh Hasina. Rentu left Bangladesh four years ago with his wife and two daughters and stayed in different parts of Europe for a year before settling down in Paris. The son of Abdul Bari from Muksudpur in Gopalganj, Rentu maintained a close working relationship with Hasina from 1981 to 1997. Rentu's nephew Bablu told bdnews24.com by telephone from Paris that his uncle had succumbed to cancer and would be buried in Paris. Rentu was 53 and is survived by his wife and two daughters. bd
