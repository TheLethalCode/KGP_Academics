 DUBAI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dubai-based airline Emirates has picked Airbus's new A350 XWB mid-size airliner in preference to Boeing Co's rival 787, it was announced on Sunday, in a deal that could be worth almost $35 billion at list prices. The deal, unveiled at the Dubai airshow, includes 70 A350s, another 50 on option and 11 A380 superjumbos as Emirates extended its lead as the largest customer for the world's biggest airliner. It also revealed that it has bought 12 Boeing long-range 777-300ERs worth $3.2 billion. The Airbus deal closes the gap on Boeing in the European planemakers annual tally of new orders and is the biggest boost yet for the A350, a project that has seen fitful design changes over the last two years. "The 787-9 is a smaller aircraft with fewer seats," said Tim Clark, Emirates president. "The 10 is just not being offered," he said, referring to a stretched version of the 787 which some airlines have urged Boeing to launch. Emirates had signed a tentative deal for eight of the 11 A380s previously and the Boeings were already on the US company's books as an unnamed customer. Rolls-Royce said it would supply engines for the A350s in a deal that could be worth $8.4 billon if Emirates firms up the options. It includes a long-term maintenance contract. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates' chairman and chief executive, announced the order at the 10th Dubai Air Show with Airbus's chief executive, Tom Enders, and Lee Monson, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president for Middle East and Africa sales. The Dubai show runs until Thursday and is expected to include other big orders for both Airbus and Boeing.
