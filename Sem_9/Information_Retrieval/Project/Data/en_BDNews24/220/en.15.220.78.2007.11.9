 SANTIAGO Fri Nov 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez hit the ground singing in Chile on Friday, joining leaders from the Latin world for a summit on social equality.

As far as I know, nobody has asked me for one and neither have I. But if I bump into somebody and they want to talk, I'm happy to do so," he said. Among several expected bilateral encounters to focus on energy is a possible meeting between Bolivian President Evo Morales and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva to discuss potential new investments in Bolivia's natural gas indust
