<TITLE> Banning religion-based politics isn't our job: CEC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Banning religion-based politics is not a job of the Election Commission, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said Monday. "It is the government that is responsible for holding trial of war criminals and banning politics based on religion. If this government is unwilling, the next government has to do it," the CEC told reporters Monday after a meeting on the electoral roll at the Government Devendra College in Manikganj. On which faction of the BNP the EC will hold dialogue with, Huda said: "We will accept the court order." The CEC ruled out having dialogue with both the factions after reporters asked him if both the factions could be invited to the electoral reforms dialogue. "It would be terrible. We would have to invite many small factions of many parties such as Jatiya Party and NAP then. We invited one BNP faction in line with own our policy. We had no other option." At the meeting, the CEC said that the next polls would be free of black money and muscle. He said that the electoral roll prepared in 2006 was flawed. "It is not acceptable. It is very difficult to elect honest, efficient people on a flawed voter list." Deputy commissioner for Manikganj district Ataur Rahman presided over the meeting. bdnews2
