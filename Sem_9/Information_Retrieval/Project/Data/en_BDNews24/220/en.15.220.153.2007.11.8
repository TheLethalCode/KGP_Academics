 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government Thursday approved purchase of 3.75 lakh tonnes of urea fertiliser to avert a crisis in the future. The cabinet committee on public purchase, headed by finance adviser ABM Mirza Azizul Islam, gave the go-ahead. "There is no crisis of fertiliser in the country. We are importing to avoid any future crisis," Aziz told reporters after the meeting. The meeting also approved purchase of 93,000 tonnes of boiled rice and 20,000 tonnes of non-boiled rice. A senior official with state-run Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation said most of the fertiliser would come from China.
