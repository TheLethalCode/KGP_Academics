<TITLE> India selectors draw flak over new captain's term </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The appointment of Anil Kumble as India captain for only three tests is too short to serve as a proper stop-gap arrangement, former Indian players say. Kumble, 37, was chosen ahead of one-day and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Dhoni on Thursday and will skipper the side in the home series against Pakistan beginning later this month. India's highest test wicket-taker came into contention for the job after Sachin Tendulkar declined a third term as captain. Rahul Dravid quit as captain in September. "A stop-gap arrangement is made for a specific reason. But I see no reason in naming Anil for just three tests," former test batsman and national coach Aunshuman Gaekwad told Reuters on Friday. "The stop-gap move is appreciable as far as Dhoni is concerned, but not for Anil." Dhoni, 26, who led a young team to success in the Twenty20 World Cup, is widely acknowledged as the next generation leader. However, many experts had warned that giving him the test captaincy would be too much, too soon. India face a tough test tour of Australia and host South Africa for a test series. "They should have named him (Kumble) until the Australia tour at least. This move suggests they are not sure of what they are doing," Gaekwad added. Former chairman of selectors Kiran More also felt Kumble should have been given more time. "Dhoni's an excellent captain, but he should play another year of test cricket before being handed the test reins," More told Reuters. "Given the situation, Anil was the best choice. He's experienced and hightly respected. But they should have named him for the next three series, which would have given the team surety and direction.
