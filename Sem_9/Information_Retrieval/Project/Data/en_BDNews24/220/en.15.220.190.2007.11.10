"I need a political answer. This is an emergency and for emergency situations we need emergency action," he said during Friday's visit to three scientific bases on the barren continent, where temperatures are their highest in about 1,800 years. Antarctica's ice sheets are nearly 2.5 kilometers thick on average -- five times the height of the Taipei 101 tower, the world's tallest building. But scientists say they are already showing signs of climate change. Satellite images show the West Antarctic ice sheet is thinning and may even collapse in the future, causing sea levels to rise. Amid occasional flurries of snow, Ban flew over melting ice fields in a light plane, where vast chunks of ice the size of six-storey buildings could be seen floating off the coast after breaking away from ice shelves. "All we've seen has been very impressive and beautiful, extraordinarily beautiful," he told reporters. "But at the same time it's disturbing. We've seen ... the melting of glaciers."
