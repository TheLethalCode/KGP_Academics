<TEXT>
 Madaripur, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com)  A Madaripur lawyer Thursday filed a case against Abdul Quader Mollah, assistant secretary general of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, for his defamatory comment against the Liberation War. Lawyer M Obaidur Rahman Khan filed the case with the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court in Madaripur. The magistrate sent the case to Madaripur Sadar Police Station to open an investigation. The lawyer moved the case on the basis of a newspaper report in which Mollah was quoted to have said that some people had joined the war to fight against the Pakistani army in 1971 to have "beautiful women, some others for property and some to protect Indian interests". Daily Ittefaq editor Anwar Hossain, acting editor Rahat Khan, publisher Saju Hossain and three others have been made witnesses in the case since the report was published in the leading newspaper on Oct 31, according to case documents. Mollah had reportedly made the statement at a discussion on the life and work of late Baitul Mokarram Khatib Obaidul Huq in Dhaka. Obaidur Rahman accused Mollah of trying to destroy peace of the people through such a statement. He also called the senior Jamaat leader "a cheat and fanatic". Mollah's statement, Obaidur said, has humiliated the freedom fighters who had joined the Liberation War to earn freedom. His statement has created unease in the country, Obaidur said. bdnews2
