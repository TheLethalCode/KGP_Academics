 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Javed Omar century Sunday powered Dhaka to a 100-run lead against visitors Chittagong on the second day of the fourth round four-dayer of National Cricket League. Dhaka were 300 for five in the first innings at the close of Day 2 in reply to Chittagong first innings total of 200 all out at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Away at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna, the hosts were trailing by 13 runs against league leaders Rajshahi despite a fine 95-run knock from opener Nazmus Sadat. Khulna were 190 for seven at stumps after Rajshahi made 203 all out in the first innings. Despite a top-order collapse, Barisal responded well against Sylhet to make 215 for six at stumps, riding on two fifties from Raisul Islam and Abul Bashar at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Barisal, however, need another 120 runs to make Sylhet bat again with Bashar on 56 and Arafat Salahuddin one. Dhaka vs Chittagong Javed and Anwar Hossain put on solid 104 runs for the opening stand before Al Shahriar Rokon and Mohammad Ashraful contributed 44 and 35 to help Dhaka reach the 300-mark. After the departure of Anwar (62), Javed paired with Rokon to put on 94 for the second wicket and added another 57 runs with Ashraful for the third wicket. The gritty opener was caught by Tamim Iqbal off Dickens for 101 to leave the side at 268 for four. Javed hammered 14 boundaries in his 241-ball knock. Mehrab Hossain Junior (21) and Mahmudullah Riad (9) remained unbeaten at the close of play. Khulna vs Chittagong After a spectacular show from teenage pacer Dollar Mahmud, who snared seven wickets including a hat-trick on Saturday, Khulna failed to cash in on the Dollar feat as they were still trailing by 13 runs against Rajshahi, who finished their first innings at 203 all out. Rajshahi pacer Farhad Reza struck first to send Khulna's in-form opener Imrul Kayes (5) back with the team score on six. Opener Nazmus and one-down Habibul Bashar, however, steadied the innings to take the side to 78 for two before Farhad Reza removed Bashar, who scored 31 off 57 balls. Nazmus stuck to the one end but saw Tushar Imran (4), Saqib Al Hasan (2) and Mostafizur Rahman (6) go back one after another before the left-handed opener was the sixth Khulna batsman out to leave the side to 182 for six. Nazmus was five runs shy of the triple figure when he was trapped lbw by Mohammad Shahazada, having hit eight boundaries in 201 deliveries. Earlier, Rajshahi, having resumed the day on 174 for nine, added another 29 runs to cross the 200-mark. Overnight batsman Farhad Reza remained unbeaten on 48 but Alamgir Kabir (9) was trapped lbw by Ziaur Rahman. Sylhet vs Barisal Barisal were 66 for four at one stage before Raisul put on 42 runs for the fifth wicket with Mohammad Shaheen (10) and 98 runs for the sixth with Bashar. Raisul made 83 off 168, studded with a dozen of boundaries before becoming the third victim of pacer Shuvasish Roy. Sylhet resumed the day on 316 for four and declared their first innings at 335 for nine as Alok Kapali added only 11 runs to his overnight 157 to finish at 168 off 230, belting 22 boundaries and two sixes. Medium pacer Arafat Salahuddin captured four wickets for 94 and Sajidul Islam took three wickets for 69. b
