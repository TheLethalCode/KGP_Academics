 Sylhet, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  One more child fell victim to an unidentified disease in Companiganj Friday night raising the number of deaths to 20 in a week. Prof Shefayet Ullah, acting director general of the Directorate General of Health Services, Saturday visited the affected area. Rubel Ahmed, 10, of Dalarpar village under Companyganj Upazila, was the latest in a long line of child victims, locals said. Explaining the symptoms of the disease, Dr Subodh Chakrabarty of Goainghat Upazila Health Complex said that the victims were first affected by diarrhoea. Sylhet district civil surgeon, Dr AZ Mahbub Ahmad, told bdnews24.com that they were trying to detect the disease. "It is not diarrhoea. We think they might have died of 'viral encephalitis'. A joint team of ICDDR, B and IEDCR was researching the disease, Mahbub said, adding that preliminary medical tests showed the disease affected the liver and kidneys of the victims. The disease appeared to have broken out in Lathi village of Goainghat Upazila on November 3. It later spread to neighbouring areas. Dr MA Malek, chief scientific officer of the Directorate General of Health Services, gathered some samples for test in Dhaka. bdnews2
