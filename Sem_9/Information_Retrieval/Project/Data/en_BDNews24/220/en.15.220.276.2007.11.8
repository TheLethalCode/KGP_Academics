 SEOUL, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two leading South Korean football officials are unhappy another foreigner might be chosen to head the national team, according to a local media report. The team has been without a coach since Pim Verbeek quit after steering the side to third place at the Asian Cup in July. Verbeek had succeeded fellow Dutchman Dick Advocaat in the job. "The Korea Football Association's (KFA) possible decision to go ahead with another foreign coach without any evaluation or reflection on past cases, seems to be to avoid doing it at all," Ahn Jong-box, head of Incheon United and the K-League was quoted as saying in sports daily Sports Seoul. Daejeon Citizen head coach Kim Ho, who lead the 1994 World Cup team, was also quoted by the daily as saying: "I am under the self-destructive impression that not only the coaches, but the ones who choose them should also be imported." KFA technical committee head Lee Young-moo has said it expected to name a new coach by the end of the month
