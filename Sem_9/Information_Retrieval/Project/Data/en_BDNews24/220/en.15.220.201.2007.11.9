<TEXT>
 DAKAR, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senegal's media union on Friday welcomed the release of four journalists detained for offences to the head of state and called on the government to scrap the laws that allowed prosecutors to hold reporters without trial. President Abdoulaye Wade ordered the release of the four journalists late on Thursday during a visit to France in a move aimed at "defusing relations between the press and the government," the Interior Ministry said in statement. The men had been taken into custody during the last month. Senegalese journalist union SYNPICS applauded their release, but condemned the spate of detentions and said the situation had arisen because press offences are governed by criminal law, which gives far-reaching powers to public prosecutors. The union has lobbied the octogenarian Wade to press ahead with the decriminalisation of media infractions, as many African states have already done. Wade gave his blessing to the reform three years ago but his government has dragged its heels. "We are not worse than other Senegalese. Why should we go to prison before we are found guilty of an offence?" Babacary Domingo Mane, member of the SYNPICS, told a news conference. Pape Amadou Gaye, publisher of the private daily Le Courrier du Jour, was arrested on Nov. 1 after publishing an article blaming the government for price increases in staple goods and suggesting the army could force a change in policy. Two other Senegalese journalists were detained on similar charges last month. Moussa Gueye, editor of the daily L'Exclusif, and another employee of the same paper, Pape Moussa Doukar, were arrested in early October after their paper ran an article about Wade's "nighttime escapades". A fourth publisher, El Malick Seck of rewmi.com, was detained on Wednesday by security services. Long regarded as a bastion of stability in turbulent West Africa, Senegal has drawn criticism from rights groups in recent months for jailing journalists and some members of the opposition, which has accused Wade of adopting an increasingly authoritarian style.
