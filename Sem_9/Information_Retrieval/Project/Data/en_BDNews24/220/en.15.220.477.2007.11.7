 BEIRUT, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon faces `disintegration' unless its rival leaders solve their political conflict, the country's influential Maronite Christian bishops warned on Wednesday. A power struggle between rival factions is now focused on the fate of presidency. The term of Emile Lahoud, the pro-Syrian incumbent, ends at midnight on Nov. 23.

Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a leading member of the opposition, will postpone the session again if there is no deal on a candidate acceptable to both the governing coalition and the opposition, political sources said. Leading members of the governing coalition have said their MPs, who have a slim majority in parliament, have the right to gather in the last 10 days of Lahoud's term to elect a president without the two-thirds quorum. The powerful Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran, has consistently warned against such a step, previously saying it would be tantamount to "partition". Paris, also backing the governing coalition, has been at the forefront of international efforts to solve the crisis. French envoys are expected in Beirut on Thursday to continue the pu
