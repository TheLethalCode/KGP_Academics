 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday sent BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah to Dhaka Central Jail after his three-day remand ended in a case filed under emergency rules. Magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka issued the order. The court sent three other BNP menAli Arshad Mamun, Zakir Hossain and Abul Basharto jail in line with an appeal of investigating officer Asaduzzaman, sub-inspector of Tejgaon Police Station. They were remanded in the same case. Asaduzzaman told the court that the four should be kept behind bars for a further investigation of the case as all the people involved in the Nov 7 incident could not be identified. The magistrate asked the jail authorities to provide Hannan Shah, former jute minister, with division. Lawyers Sanaullah Mia and Masud Ahmed Talukder defended the BNP leader in court. The same court remanded Hannan Shah on Nov 8 after he was arrested on charges of emergency rules violations. Hannan Shah was arrested at his DOHS home in Mohakhali on Nov 7. The charges against the BNP leader stemmed from violence near former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Tejgaon police filed the case against eight people, including Hannan Shah. bdnew
