<TITLE> Slovenia set to elect leftist president in runoff </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LJUBLJANA, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slovenians voting in the presidential runoff on Sunday are expected to elect Danilo Turk, extending the post-communist tradition in the small but wealthy European Union member of picking left-wing heads of state. Turk, a law professor and former diplomat supported by the main left-wing parties, leads the opinion polls and looks set to beat conservative Lojze Peterle, who is backed by most of the right-of-centre ruling coalition. The winner will be sworn in only days before Slovenia takes over the rotating EU presidency on Jan. 1. The latest available opinion polls, published last week, gave Turk between 58 and 69 percent support and analysts said a win for him could boost the social democrats ahead of a general election due in autumn 2008. "Although the president does not have much say in decision making, the poll will be a possible indicator of the parties' current standing," Meta Roglic, an analyst at the daily Dnevnik, told Reuters. "If Turk wins by a big margin, it could cause alarm on the centre right, in which case the campaign for the parliamentary vote next year could start as early as Monday," she added. The president's role is largely ceremonial but will include an active part in international contacts during the EU presidency, when analysts say Turk's diplomatic background could be an asset. Turk was Slovenia's first ambassador to the United Nations. He chaired the UN Security Council in 1998-1999 and then became UN assistant secretary general for political affairs. Turk came second to Peterle in the first round of the election in October, but has gained support from backers of a losing leftist candidate. Since Slovenia quit Yugoslavia in 1991, every president and most governments have been left-wing. Incumbent Janez Drnovsek, a popular left-winger who has often clashed with the centre-right cabinet, did not run for a second five-year term. Polling stations for some 1.7 million eligible voters open at 0600 GMT and close at 1800 GMT. First exit polls are expected immediately after the polls close, and preliminary results are due around 2100 GMT.
