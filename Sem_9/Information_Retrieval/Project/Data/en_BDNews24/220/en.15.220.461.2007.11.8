 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Thursday lauded the announcement by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that national elections would take place before Feb. 15, 2008. President George W. Bush had joined Western allies and opponents in demanding that polls be held on time and emergency rule scrapped. "We think it is a good thing that President Musharraf has clarified the election date for the Pakistani people," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.
