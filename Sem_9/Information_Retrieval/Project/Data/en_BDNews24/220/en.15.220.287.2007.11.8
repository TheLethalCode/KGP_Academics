 PARIS, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France coach Raymond Domenech has omitted striker David Trezeguet from his 24-man squad for this month's Euro 2008 Group B qualifier in Ukraine. Trezeguet, who has scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season, has not featured for France since a 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in a Euro qualifier in September. "He's made a bright start to the season. He is good," Domenech told a news conference. "But there is a lot of competition (to make the squad). However, the Euro finals are in eight months and we can still discuss things again. "I hope he will keep going like this and that he will be at the Euro finals with us," he added. Olympique Marseille midfielder Samir Nasri, who also played his last France game against Scotland, has recovered from a virus and is back in the squad that will host Morocco in a friendly on Nov. 16 five days before the match in Kiev. Olympique Lyon centre back Sebastien Squillaci has also returned at the expense of AS Roma's Philippe Mexes. World Cup finalists France need a draw in Ukraine to reach next year's European Championship finals, although they will qualify four days earlier if Italy win away to Scotland. However, Domenech said France had to prepare for the Ukraine match without worrying about Italy's result. "The other game (Scotland v Italy) does not exist. It is not our problem," he said. "We must not be trapped in waiting for the result of this game to get ready for our match." Squad: Goalkeepers: Sebastien Frey (Fiorentina), Mickael Landreau (Paris St Germain), Ulrich Rame (Girondins Bordeaux) Defenders: Eric Abidal (Barcelona), Sebastien Squillaci (Olympique Lyon), Patrice Evra (Manchester United), William Gallas (Arsenal), Francois Clerc (Olympique Lyon), Bakary Sagna (Arsenal), Lilian Thuram (Barcelona) Midfielders: Alou Diarra (Girondins Bordeaux), Lassana Diarra (Arsenal), Mathieu Flamini (Arsenal), Claude Makelele (Chelsea), Jerome Rothen (Paris St Germain), Jeremy Toulalan (Olympique Lyon), Samir Nasri (Olympique Marseille) Forwards: Nicolas Anelka (Bolton Wanderers), Karim Benzema (Olympique Lyon), Sidney Govou (Olympique Lyon), Thierry Henry (Barcelona), Florent Malouda (Chelsea), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich), Hatem Ben Arfa (Olympique Lyon) (Writing by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris
