 KANPUR, India, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India clinched a 46-run win in the third one-day international against Pakistan on Sunday, despite a career-best 129 from Salman Butt, to take a 2-1 lead in the five-game series. Indian left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh underlined his form with a neatly paced 77 to guide India to a 294 for six before dismissing Pakistan for 248 in 47.2 overs on a slow pitch. Yuvraj, who also took a wicket and ran out Mohammad Yousuf, raised 100 runs from 92 balls with skipper Mahendra Dhoni (49) and both attacked the inconsistent Pakistani bowling after Saurav Ganguly (39), dropped first ball, and Sachin Tendulkar (29) put on a breezy 68 runs for the first wicket. Pakistan, who chased down 322 to win the second one-dayer on Friday on a good pitch, began brightly before Indian bowlers and fielders tied down Butt and took wickets at the other end. The 23-year-old Butt still made a valiant bid after reaching his fourth one-day hundred, all against India, having lost the explosive Shahid Afridi (12), back as opener, and Younis Khan (21), who hit a match-winning 117 in the last game, early on. The left-handed batsman put on 80 runs for the fifth wicket with Misbah-ul Haq (38) to renew hopes but Indian bowlers chipped away at the other end before Butt fell leg before to a desperate reverse sweep against off-spinner Harbhajan Singh. His heroic 142-ball effort was studded with 17 fours and showed his determination after being recalled into the team to boost the opening combination. LOOSE SWING Afridi, who smashed 100 from just 45 balls at Green Park in 2005, was bowled swinging at an Irfan Pathan delivery which nipped back and kept low after pitching. Butt played glorious drives through the off side but the Indian bowlers changed their line of attack and reorganised the field to cut down his run scoring. Left-arm Rudra Pratap Singh bowled Younis shouldering arms to a delivery which came in late and the experienced Yousuf (16) was run out by point fielder Yuvraj going for a single. Butt dug in with Misbah-ul Haq, who once again excelled in a supporting role, to ease India's hold on the field until he was bowled by left-arm spinner Murali Kartik before the tail caved in. Left-arm paceman Rudra Pratap Singh was the most successful Indian bowler, claiming three for 62. The fourth match will be played in Gwalior on Thursday
