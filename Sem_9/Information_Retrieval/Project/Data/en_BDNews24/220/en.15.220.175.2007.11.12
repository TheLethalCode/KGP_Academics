 JERUSALEM, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli museum has recovered dozens of European antique clocks stolen more than two decades ago, including a pocket-watch made for French Queen Marie Antoinette. Jerusalem's L A Mayer Museum of Islamic Art said thieves stole some 100 clocks and watches from its 200-piece collection in 1983. The collection included some of the world most valuable time pieces, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries The museum last year received a call from a Tel Aviv watchmaker who had recognised the stolen clocks in a 40-piece collection that a British woman had inherited from her husband and wanted valuing.

The collection features pieces by renowned Swiss horologist Abraham Louis Breguet, including an intricate gold and crystal pocket watch made in the late 18th century for Marie Antoinette, who was jailed before it was finished.

The clocks are not connected to Islamic Art but were donated by Sir David Salomons, the first Jewish Lord Mayor of London, whose daughter founded the museum in Jerusal
