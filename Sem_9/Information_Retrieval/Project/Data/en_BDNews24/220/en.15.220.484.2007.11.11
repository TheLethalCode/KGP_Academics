<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Garment entrepreneurs Sunday called on the government to mobilise support for a US law in the making that would give Bangladesh duty-free export access to the US market. "If the government starts building opinion in the USA, getting duty-free access will be possible," Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) president Anwarul Alam Chowdhury said at a news conference. BGMEA organised the press briefing after a seven-member delegation visited Washington to lobby for zero-duty access under a new US law  The New Partnership for Development Act (NPDA), 2007. The bill proposed awarding least developed countries, including Bangladesh and Cambodia, duty-free access for ready-made garments subject to labour standards compliance. Currently, Bangladesh's apparel products face a duty of over 16 percent in US markets. For some items, the duty stands at over 30 percent, the BGMEA president said. The bill, pending ratification by both houses of Congress, offered zero-duty entry to products with 35 percent value addition. The NPDA could raise Bangladeshi ready-made garments exports by 15 percent a year. The country faced a 12 percent fall in export earnings in the July-August period of fiscal year 2007-08 due mainly to slumps in earnings from the garment sector. "We need the support of congressmen and senators. We must all work to raise voices in our favour," said the BGMEA president. He said the sector had made progress in labour standards issues. A higher number of workers have appointment letters and identity cards, he said. "We are improving. We need to highlight this and build our image abroad," the BGMEA boss said. He wanted the government to send a delegation to the US to drum up support for the bill so the country could withstand increased competition from January 2009 when restrictions on Chinese and Vietnamese garments are lifted. "We will lose our market share after the quota restriction on China is eliminated and the Vietnam apparel monitoring system expires," he said. "This will affect our goal of cutting poverty by half by 2015." bdne
