 TBILISI, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, facing a major political crisis, said on Thursday to bring forward presidential elections to Jan. 5 from the autumn. "It is my proposal to hold presidential elections on January 5," Saakashvili said. "You demanded early presidential elections but now you have them even earlier." Bringing forward the elections was one of the opposition's main demands. Georgia had been scheduled to hold both presidential and parliamentary elections in the autumn of next year.
