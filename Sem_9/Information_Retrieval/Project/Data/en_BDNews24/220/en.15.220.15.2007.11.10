 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Rizvi Ahmed Saturday said the Election Commission became part of a "conspiracy" by inviting Hafizuddin Ahmed to the electoral reforms dialogue. Rizvi, acting office secretary of the BNP installed by Khandaker Delwar Hossain of a faction of the troubled party, renewed a claim to the BNP "mainstream" and threatened to take legal action against the commission. He took a dig at the Election Commission for not inviting the "mainstream" BNP to the dialogue slated for Nov 22. "The commission ran into a controversy by issuing the invitation letter. They (Hafizuddin Ahmed and his supporters) don't represent the BNP," he said, adding that his faction was preparing documents for the legal fight. Speaking to reporters at Delwar's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar home, Rizvi said they would continue their activities under the leadership of detained party chief Khaleda Zia. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman took charge of the BNP as acting party chief at a recent meeting of the standing committee, with Hafizuddin as acting secretary general. But the decision was labelled by the Delwar-led faction as a conspiracy against the BNP. Rizvi said Saturday they could not think of the BNP without Khaleda. He hoped their struggle to free the party chief from detention would succeed, and demanded unconditional freedom of Khaleda, saying: "Her freedom is a must for a free and fair election." "We'll free our uncompromising leader from jail," Rizvi said. On whether his party would contest the local government polls, Rizvi said the decision was pending as the party chief was behind bars. His comment came hours after Hafizuddin separately said they were ready to contest all local government elections including the city corporation ones. "We are yet to take any decision on the mater. The party's high command will take the final decision," Rizvi said, trashing Hafizuddin's statement. Rizvi recalled the sacrifice of Noor Hossain, who was killed by police during the autocratic regime of former president HM Ershad on Nov 10, 1987, in the struggle to restore democracy. bdnew
