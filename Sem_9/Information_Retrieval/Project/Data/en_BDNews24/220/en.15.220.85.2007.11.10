<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has contributed to instability in Pakistan by not fully supporting President Pervez Musharraf as the best bulwark against Islamic fundamentalists, former UN envoy John Bolton said on Friday. Bolton, US ambassador to the United Nations from 2005-06, told a news conference at UN headquarters army chief Musharraf was the best hope for keeping Pakistan's nuclear weapons out of the hands of radicals. The former diplomat, who quit his UN job last December after failing to win Senate confirmation and now works at a conservative Washington think tank, urged the administration to drop its focus on elections in Pakistan and "get a grip." "The consequence of a radical fundamentalist regime getting its hands on those nuclear weapons would be very grave," he said. Promoting a book released earlier this week, Bolton said he was not happy with the situation in Pakistan or defending Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency, "but I think you have to consider what the US strategic interest is." "The question is ... what is the policy to maximize the chances that the weapons do not fall into the wrong hands?", said Bolton, an outspoken conservative both as UN ambassador and earlier as an assistant secretary of state.

We forced an election in the Palestinian territories and got Hamas as the victor. So I think that we need to try and get a grip here." Bolton said history gave little confidence civilian rulers in Pakistan could keep the military under control or keep the nuclear weapons secure. He called the news conference to promote his book, "Surrender Is Not An Option," which lays bare his disagreements with US policymakers and UN officials and ambassadors. On Iran, a subject that occupies two chapters of his book, Bolton repeated his view that the United States had wasted four years following its European allies in trying to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear program. Washington should have devoted that time to seeking "regime change" in the Islamic Republic and should now be considering military force, he said. He sharply attacked Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, who has spent years negotiating with Tehran, as an "apologist for Ira
