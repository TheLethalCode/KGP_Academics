<TITLE> Republican Giuliani has little to lose in Iowa </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CEDAR FALLS, Iowa, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rudy Giuliani, leading the 2008 Republican presidential race in national polls but still an unknown quantity in Iowa, has little to lose here -- and he campaigns like he knows it. In a state where many observers never expected the former New York mayor to even compete, Giuliani is under no pressure to win as he focuses on later nominating contests in big states like California and New York. He has made relatively few appearances and skipped the traditional August straw poll that benefits the state party. Relying heavily on radio advertising and direct mail to reach potential backers, he has been outspent and out-hustled in the state by top rival Mitt Romney. But two months before Iowa opens the state-by-state battle for the Republican nomination, Giuliani is in a tight four-way fight for second place in state polls behind Romney and looking stronger than many expected. "He has not spent a lot of time here, but I think he has a chance to do well, maybe finish in the top three," said Steve Roberts, a Republican National Committee member and former state party chief in Iowa. "If he came in third it would not be a bad finish for him," Roberts said. "He is looking down the road to South Carolina, Florida and New York anyway." Polls in Iowa show Giuliani battling presidential rivals Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson and John McCain for the runner-up spot behind Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who has poured more money and time into Iowa than any other candidate in the November 2008 election. Giuliani, who has built his campaign around his reputation for leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks, has made just a dozen trips to Iowa in 2007 -- less than half of Romney's. On stops at two college campuses on Thursday the crowds were more curious than enthusiastic. Many said they were interested in his message of fiscal responsibility and strength against terrorism, but were waiting to make a final choice. TRYING TO CHOOSE Bill Ashby, a Fayette County Republican committee member who attended a Giuliani town hall meeting at the University of Northern Iowa, said he was choosing between Giuliani and Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and actor. "I'm an economic and social conservative, but I may support Giuliani because he's the one who can get elected," he said, adding that Giuliani's endorsement by religious conservative leader Pat Robertson might influence some Iowans. Steve German, a junior business student at the university, said he was focused on Giuliani and Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor. Giuliani's support for abortion rights was a problem, he said. "It does concern me a little bit. Huckabee has a little stronger moral values," German said. Giuliani's strategy of focusing on states that vote later in the campaign -- particularly the nearly 20 states that will hold contests on Feb. 5, 2008 -- runs counter to conventional wisdom that a win in Iowa is crucial to build momentum. But his support for abortion rights was expected to be a stumbling block in a state where social conservatives have been kingmakers, and his assertive style is sometimes an uneasy fit in Iowa's polite small-town and rural culture. When a Des Moines Register poll asked Iowans in October what factors might keep them from backing a candidate, 55 percent said Giuliani's support for abortion rights would be a major factor. The only issue with a higher negative impact was the 58 percent who said they might not back McCain, an Arizona senator, for supporting a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. It was uncertain whether the corruption indictment of Giuliani's former New York police commissioner and protege, Bernard Kerik, on Thursday would have any impact on the race. Giuliani has promised to compete hard in Iowa and shrugs off questions about his abortion rights stance, focusing instead on his similarities with state residents. "I think we have a great deal in common with many, many people in Iowa who believe we have to be on offense in the terrorist war," he told reporters in Dubuque. "We have a great deal in common with those people in Iowa who believe we have to have lower taxes." But some Iowans said Giuliani's style seemed strained. "I think he's very rehearsed, very polished. You could almost hear him saying 'ladies and gentlemen of the jury,'" said Aneliak Dinitrova, a college journalism professor who brought students with her to hear Giuliani.
