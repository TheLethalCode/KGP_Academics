 MOSCOW, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia ordered three Georgian diplomats on Thursday to leave the country, retaliating for a similar move by Tbilisi a day earlier. "We are expelling three senior diplomats from the Georgian mission," a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said, without giving further details. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili expelled the Russians after accusing Russian intelligence of fomenting a bitter political crisis in the Caucasus republic, a charge rejected by Moscow and by the Georgian opposition.
