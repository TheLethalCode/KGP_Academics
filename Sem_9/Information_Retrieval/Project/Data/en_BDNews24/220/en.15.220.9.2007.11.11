 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The caretaker administration has found itself between a rock and a hard place in trying to formulate a policy to cope with soaring oil prices in the international market. If domestic oil prices are allowed to keep pace with international rates, experts feel the already double-digit inflation rate will shoot even higher. However, if protectionist measures are employed, and subsidies are increased, few observers can see where the money will come from. Further intervention will simply widen the government's deficit financing, said finance and energy ministry officials. World oil prices jumped to a new high of $104 a barrel Thursday, boosted by increased demand, the weak US dollar and widespread concern over unstable and inadequate supplies. "The government is subsidising the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation by at least Tk 5,500 crore for this fiscal year at current international oil rates," BPC chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com. The estimate for oil subsidies for the current fiscal year's budget was initially calculated at no more than Tk 2,500 crore, Karim said. A senior energy ministry official said: "We've sent two written proposals to the finance ministry, one before Eid and the other just after. We are pushing for an adjustment to retail prices, or for an injection of more subsidies." According to the energy ministry, crude oil at the rate of $98 a barrel costs $109 per barrel after refining. At that rate, a litre of diesel would cost Tk 61 in the market, instead of the current retail rate of Tk 40. The ministry's data indicates that Bangladesh needs a total of 38 lakh tonnes of oil this fiscal year. Of the total requirement, 21 lakh tonnes are diesel, five lakh tonnes kerosene, 2.5 lakh tonnes petrol and octane and the remaining is others such as jet fuel. As much as 55 percent of diesel requirement is used in the transportation sector, with a further 20-22 percent pegged for agriculture and the rest taken up by industry and other sectors. "Senior figures in the government think an adjustment in the oil price will push up the already double-digit level inflation even further," a senior finance ministry official, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com. "If that policy is not pursued, the government will have to pump up at least Tk 3,000 crore more in oil subsidies than it originally projected in the last budget," Karim said. Inflation, on a point-to-point basis, reached 10.1 percent in July, 10.12 percent in August and 9.6 percent in September. Prices of staple foods and other essentials continue to soar in the local market in the face of international price hikes. According to energy ministry data, figures until December 2006 show local banks owe the BPC approximately Tk 10,000 crore, including interest and loans from foreign banks the figure stands at around Tk 14,000 crore. According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency in October, daily global demand for crude oil is expected to reach 88 million barrels next year, a 2.4 percent rise over this year's figure. According to the Paris-based agency's latest forecasts, global daily demand is likely to grow steadily in the longer-run and is expected to hit 98 million barrels a day in 2015. Geopolitical factors are at the root of worries over future oil price hikes. The lingering dispute over Iran's nuclear capabilities has, many observers feel, the potential to further destabilise an already chaotic region. Turkey has been itching to retaliate against ongoing Kurdish Workers' Party attacks on their territory. Such retaliation would, however, involve cross-border attacks on rebel bases in northern Iraq, a worrying prospect for many. News of an attack Monday on an oil pipeline in Yemen adds to the gloomy outlook for the major oil-producing region in the world. Political instability in these countries continues to have a critical impact on crude supplies in the international market, and a knock-on effect in Bangladesh. bd
