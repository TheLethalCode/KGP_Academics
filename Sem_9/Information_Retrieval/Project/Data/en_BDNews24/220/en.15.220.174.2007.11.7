 MARRAKESH, Morocco, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Interpol got approval on Wednesday to issue wanted notices for six Iranians in connection with the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Argentina in which 85 people were killed. Despite heavy diplomatic pressure from Iran, delegates at the world police body's annual general assembly in Morocco voted by 66 percent in favour of issuing the "Red Notices" seeking the extradition of the wanted people, delegates said. Argentina last year ordered an international warrant for the arrest of former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and eight other Iranians on charges of masterminding the attack. Interpol said in March it would issue its own wanted notices against six people, leaving out Rafsanjani. Iran has repeatedly denied any link to the bombing and says Interpol risks being dragged away from police work into the realm of politics.
