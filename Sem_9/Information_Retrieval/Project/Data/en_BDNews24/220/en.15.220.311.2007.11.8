<TITLE> Serbia's Seselj says Hague tribunal illegitimate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AMSTERDAM, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Serbian radical accused of stirring nationalism and promoting ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia said on Thursday that the UN tribunal trying him for war crimes was "illegal and illegitimate". Prosecutors say Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj incited such hatred of Croats, Muslims and other non-Serbs it sparked mass deportations and drove Serb paramilitaries to a frenzy of murder and torture. He denies the charges. His trial, which opened on Wednesday, is a new chance for prosecutors to hold Serb leaders responsible for crimes during the wars that tore apart former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, after the death of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague in March 2006 ended his trial without a verdict. Seselj, 53, was defiant and condemned the court as a tool of the United States, which led a NATO bombing campaign that drove Milosevic's troops out of Kosovo in 1999. "I am being tried by an illegal and illegitimate court. I am talking about an institution that was unlawfully established ... the (UN) Security Council did that according to the diktat of the United States of America," Seselj said on Thursday. "The task of this court has been carried out through many of its judgments, and that task is to falsify modern Serb history." He is accused of a joint criminal enterprise with Milosevic to create a "Greater Serbia" by inciting the forced removal of non-Serbs from large swaths of Bosnia and Croatia. "A joint criminal enterprise was organised by those breaking up Yugoslavia, not by us, who opposed the breakup of Yugoslavia, who opposed one-sided secession," Seselj said. At one point during Seselj's opening statement, the court asked him to speak more slowly so interpreters could keep up and also to speak less loudly as judges had trouble hearing the translation in their headsets above his voice. Seselj promised to try but said: "Adrenalin has been rising in me for five years and now is the day." Last year, Seselj went on hunger strike for 28 days to win the right to represent himself in court, causing the start of the trial to be suspended.
