<TITLE> Moderate quake strikes Indonesia's Sumatra </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale struck Indonesia's Sumatra island on Sunday, but there were no reports of casualties or damage, the meteorology agency said. The epicentre of the quake lay 129 km southwest of Bengkulu at a depth of 10 km. There was no tsunami warning. The tremors were followed by a 5.7 Richter aftershock. Bengkulu was hit by a powerful quake of magnitude 8.4 in September that killed at least 25 people and toppled thousands of homes. It has been jolted by frequent tremors since then. Indonesia suffers frequent earthquakes as it is on an area of intense seismic activity in the "Pacific Ring of Fire".
