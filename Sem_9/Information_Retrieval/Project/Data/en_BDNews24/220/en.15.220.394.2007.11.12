 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Israeli army arrested two Hamas legislators in the occupied West Bank on Monday, Voice of Palestine radio said. The report identified them as Mariam Saleh and Khaled Tafesh. Saleh, a woman, was arrested in Ramallah and Tafesh was taken into custody in the village of Zatara, east of Bethlehem. An Israeli army spokesman in Tel Aviv confirmed Tafesh's arrest but said he had no information about the detention of any other Hamas member of parliament. Hamas won a majority of the seats in the Palestinian parliament in a January 2006 election, but Israel has arrested more than half of the group's 74 legislators and it can no longer assemble a majority. The Islamic group, which opposes Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's peace efforts with Israel, seized control of the Gaza Strip in June after fighting with his Fatah faction. Palestinian security sources said Israel also arrested 16 other Palestinians, most of them Hamas members, in raids on Monday in the West Bank city of Tulkarm and nearby villages
