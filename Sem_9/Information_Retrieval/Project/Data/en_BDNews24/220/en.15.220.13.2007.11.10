 ISLAMABAD, Nov 9(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was freed from house arrest late on Friday, after being stopped from leaving her home in Islamabad to lead a rally against President Pervez Musharraf's imposition of emergency rule earlier in the day. "The detention order has been withdrawn," Aamir Ali Ahmed, Acting Deputy Commissioner of Islamabad, said. Pakistani police had blocked Benazir from leaving her home in Islamabad and sealed off the capital and nearby city of Rawalpindi to stop the rally. Benazir, the politician most capable of galvanising mass protests against Musharraf's imposition of emergency rule, tried to breach a cordon and appealed to police to let her through. "The government has been paralysed," Bhutto shouted to supporters across a barbed-wire barricade. Two buses and an armoured personnel carrier blocked the road outside her house. bdnews24.
