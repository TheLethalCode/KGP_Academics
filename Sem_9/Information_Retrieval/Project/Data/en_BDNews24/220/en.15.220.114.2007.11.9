<TITLE> Obesity gene may control other genes, study finds </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A very common gene that appears to predispose people to obesity may control other genes as well, and may affect parts of the brain linked with appetite, British researchers reported on Thursday. The FTO gene was discovered earlier this year and is found in more than half of all Europeans surveyed. It appears to control an enzyme that can act directly on DNA to modify it, which suggests it might help turn other genes on and off, a team at Britain's University of Oxford and University of Cambridge reported. And FTO also seems especially active in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain important to the control of hunger. Levels of the FTO gene appear to be affected by feeding and fasting, the researchers report in the journal Science. "This is the first glimpse into the possible mechanisms whereby this very common genetic variant might influence a person's risk of obesity," said Stephen O'Rahilly of Cambridge. "The finding that FTO is an enzyme with these actions on DNA is very surprising and a lot of work is still needed to work out how its actions influence body weight," he added in a statement. In April, Andrew Hattersley of the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter and Plymouth and Mark McCarthy of the University of Oxford reported they had found a version of FTO that raised a person's risk for obesity, and it was very common in the people studied -- 63 percent had one or two copies of it. People with two copies had about a 70 percent higher risk of being obese than people with none and were an average of nearly 7 pounds (3 kg) heavier than similar subjects with no copies. Those with one copy of the gene had a lower but still elevated risk. Oxford's Thomas Gerken, O'Rahilly and colleagues studied FTO's function and were surprised at what they found. "It may play some role in the influencing how well the brain senses hunger and fullness," O'Rahilly said. They said drugs could potentially be used to alter its function and treat obesity. The World Health Organization estimates 1.6 billion adults worldwide are overweight and at least 400 million adults are obese. That includes a third of all US adul
