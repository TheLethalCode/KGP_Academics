 Islamabad, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto tried to breach a police cordon surrounding her Islamabad residence on Friday, hours after being placed under house arrest. "Get out of the way. We are your sisters. My father laid down his life for you and this nation, We have no hostility towards you," Benazir appealed by megaphone to police as her bullet-proof car tried to break through their ranks. She failed to get through police barricades. Fehmida Mirza, a close aide accompanying Benazir, told Reuters that Bhutto's vehicle, surrounded by supporters had crossed one obstacle, but a police bus blocked the narrow road at the back of the house. Pakistani authorities detained Benazir at her home on Friday to stop her from holding her first rally since President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule, a government minister said. "She has been detained at home. This is temporary and is being done to stop her from going to the meeting," Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, a close Musharraf ally, told Reuters earlier. Army chief Musharraf imposed emergency rule last Saturday, citing a hostile judiciary and rising militancy in the nuclear-armed U.S. ally. Ahmed said Benazir's rally had been banned because of fears of suicide bomb attacks. Islamist militants opposed to Benazir's ties with the United States were believed to be responsible for a suicide bomb attack as she led a procession in Karachi to welcome her back to Pakistan on Oct. 18. Nearly 140 people died in the attack. Benazir is demanding Musharraf set a date for a general election, steps down as army chief, restores the constitution and releases people detained since the weekend. She had been planning to attend a rally in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, but police were out in force early, erecting barbed-wire barricades on all roads leading to the park where the rally was planned and sealing off Benazir's Islamabad home. PROTESTS BROKEN UP Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless 1999 coup, said on Thursday national elections would be held by Feb. 15, about a month later than they were due. He also said he would quit as army chief and be sworn in as a civilian president once the Supreme Court ruled whether he had been eligible to stand for re-election last month while still army chief. However, two-time prime minister Benazir, who returned from more than eight years of self-imposed exile last month, said she wanted more than vague statements on the elections. Benazir has been holding power-sharing talks with Musharraf for months and political analysts say that despite her confrontation with the government this week, cooperation is still likely. Benazir had earlier said that in addition to the public meeting in Rawalpindi, she planned a mass motor procession from Lahore to the capital from Nov. 13. PPP officials say thousands of their activists have been detained over the past few days. An Interior Ministry spokesman said 2,500 people had been detained since the emergency was declared. Police wielded batons and fired teargas to disperse hundreds of opposition protesters in the northwestern city of Peshawar and a nearby town on Friday, police and witnesses said. Outside Benazir's home, small groups of her supporters gathered, some chanting "long live Bhutto". About 30 were detained
