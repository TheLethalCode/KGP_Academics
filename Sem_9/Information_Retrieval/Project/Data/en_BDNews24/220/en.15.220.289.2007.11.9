 WARSAW, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish President Lech Kaczynski nominated political rival Donald Tusk for prime minister on Friday after Tusk's centre-right party's victory in a parliamentary election last month. Tusk replaces the president's twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The new cabinet is due to be formally appointed next week. Tusk, 50, has vowed to pursue liberal economic policies and closer ties with Poland's European Union partners after two years of rocky relations under the Kaczynskis.
