 BRUSSELS, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union is sending a special envoy to Georgia to consult on the situation there after mass anti-government protests turned violent on Wednesday, an EU spokeswoman said. "The High Representative has asked Peter Semneby to travel to Tbilisi as soon as possible. He will go their and meet all the relevant parties," a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. Semneby, a former Swedish diplomat, is the EU's special representative to the south Caucasus region. Separately, NATO said it was watching the situation closely and called for the rule of law to be respected in the country, which is seeking membership of the military alliance. "It is important that the Georgian government affords its citizens the right to express their opinions openly, and that seems to be happening," a NATO spokesman told a briefing. In Tbilisi, riot police fired tear gas and water cannon in repeated clashes with Georgian opposition protesters calling for President Mikhail Saakashvili's resignation. The health minister said 250 people were taken to hospital after police used force for the first time since the protests began last Friday, the biggest civil demonstration since a peaceful revolution swept Saakashvili to power in 2003. Saakashvili has pursued Western-style economic reforms and closer links with Washington but critics say living standards have not improved for many Georgians and corruption and human rights violations remain a problem in the former Soviet state.
