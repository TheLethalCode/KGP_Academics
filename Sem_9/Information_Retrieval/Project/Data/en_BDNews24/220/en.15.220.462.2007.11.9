 TOKYO, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on Friday for Japan to assume a more prominent role in global security -- even as Tokyo struggled to resume a stalled naval mission in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan. Gates, visiting Tokyo to conclude an East Asian tour, noted Japan had been accused of "chequebook diplomacy" in the 1991 Gulf War when it sent no military forces but helped fund the US-led coalition that forced Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. He said Japan, whose military is constrained by a pacifist constitution, had nonetheless found ways to contribute to missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and encouraged it to do more. "Japan has the opportunity -- and an obligation -- to take on a role that reflects its political, economic and military capacity," he said in a speech to students and faculty at Tokyo's Sophia University. "That is why the US strongly supports Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. And that is why we hope and expect Japan will choose to accept more global security responsibilities in the years ahead." In talks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and other top officials on Thursday, Gates urged Japan to restart its mission to refuel U.S. and other coalition ships patrolling the Indian Ocean for drug runners, gun smugglers and suspected terrorists. The naval mission was halted this month after Japanese opposition parties refused to vote in favour of a new enabling law. Also on Gates' agenda on Friday was a meeting with Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga, who said Japan was examining whether it could make funding it provides to support US troops based in the country "more efficient and rationalised". Faced with a tight budget and bulging public debt, finance ministry officials want to trim Japan's funding for U.S. bases in the country by about 10 billion yen ($89 million) in the fiscal year from April 1, Japanese media have said, from 217.3 billion yen budgeted for non-obligatory spending in the current year. "As for host nation support, our stance is the same and we're going to see if there is room for us to make it more efficient and rationalised," Nukaga said. Gates said the support should be extended, adding that it was a symbol of the alliance. "I told them that it wasn't just the money but the symbolism that it represented in terms of the health of the alliance and the fact that Japan attached real importance to the continuation of the alliance," Gates told reporters on his plane as he flew back to Washington from Tokyo.
