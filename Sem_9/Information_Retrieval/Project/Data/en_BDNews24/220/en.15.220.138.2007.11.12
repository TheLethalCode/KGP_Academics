<TITLE> No out-of-court settlement in Suharto son lawsuit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian state prosecutors failed on Monday to reach an out-of-court settlement in a multi-million-dollar civil suit filed against the youngest son of former President Suharto. Prosecutors are trying to recover 500 billion rupiah ($55 million) in losses to the state in a property deal between a supermarket chain controlled by Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra Suharto and the state logistics agency Bulog, which took place in 1995. Chief prosecutor Dachmer Munthe said mediation talks had failed to reach an agreement and both sides decided to continue the case in court. "He objected to paying Bulog a specified amount of money. Of course we can't accept that," Munthe told reporters. One of Tommy's lawyers, Elza Syarief, said his client had no obligation to pay anything to Bulog and threatened to lodge a counter-suit. Tommy, 44, was sentenced to 18 months in jail in 2000 after being found guilty of corruption in the property deal. But he went into hiding and the Supreme Court overturned his sentence after he was captured for another case in which he was found guilty and sentenced for ordering the murder of a Supreme Court justice. Tommy has also been questioned over a 175 billion rupiah graft case involving Indonesia's lucrative clove monopoly agency, which he chaired in the 1990s. That case revolves around the alleged misuse of central bank assistance given to the agency, which was set up to stabilise the price of cloves used to make kretek, or clove-flavoured cigarettes. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono came to power in 2004 promising to tackle endemic graft, considered among other things as a major impediment to much-needed foreign investment, and officials ranging from former ministers to provincial governors have been jailed on corruption charges. However, some critics say the anti-graft drive has failed to take on some powerful vested interests. The former president, who resigned in 1998 amid civil unrest, was himself charged with graft, but escaped prosecution because the Supreme Court chief justice declared him too ill to stand trial. Suharto and his family members deny any wrongdoing. Tommy Suharto, who owned numerous businesses during his father's 32-year rule including an airline, and a failed national car project, was conditionally released from jail last October, after serving a third of his original sentence for plotting the judge's murder.
