 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein has said the main responsibility of the caretaker government is to hold "proper" elections. "The government has been carrying out a lot of additional activities, besides efforts to hold a free and fair election," Mainul told reporters at the Press Information Department Sunday. Asked if his government will open trial of war criminals, the adviser said: "Why are you asking us? Why don't you put this question to those who avoided the issue for the last 36 years? You've waited so long, why don't you wait for another two years?" Launching the 38-volume "Bangladesh Code", Mainul expressed hope that expected changes in politics would take place by February. "I am not very optimisticthoughabout the changes the political parties are trying to make. But it is true that the Mafia rule is over. Honest citizens should come forward now," he said. Replying to a query on the release of some businessmen detained earlier on different charges, Mainul said: "If the politicians take to stealing and robbing, what will the thieves and thugs do? It is difficult to distinguish between politicians and businessmen." "After the Truth Commission bill is approved, businessmen won't have any problem getting bail, if they confess," Mainul said. He said the government moved to set up the Truth Commission to revitalise the economy. "We should not assume that everything will be all right as soon as the elections are held by 2008," the adviser said. Mainul brushed aside any possibility of imposing martial law in the country and said: "The caretaker government advisers will not gain anything if the elections are delayed. The polls will be held on schedule." bdnews24.com
