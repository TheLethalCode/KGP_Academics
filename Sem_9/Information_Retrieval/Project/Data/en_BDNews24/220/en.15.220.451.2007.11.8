 MARRAKESH, Morocco, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new database to catch migrants, drug traffickers, and fugitives who use lost or stolen passports has netted thousands of people travelling under false identities, a senior Interpol official said on Thursday. Judicial obstacles, lack of money and political opposition have meant a slow start for a project Interpol considers a vital weapon against increasingly international criminal networks. Immigration officials have used the system to catch 5,000 people this year trying to cross borders with stolen documents, said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol executive director for police services. "It will be more than double that next year, you can believe me," he told Reuters on Wednesday. "These cases would not have been discovered if the Interpol database did not exist." In the five years since it was launched, police in 20 countries have linked up to the database, which now holds records of 14 million documents. Interpol expects Russia, Britain, Ukraine and other countries to join soon. People pay around 1,000 euros for stolen blank passports, most of which appear on the black market after being grabbed from factories or seized from secure convoys by armed gangs. Speaking on the sidelines of Interpol's general assembly in Morocco, Louboutin listed cases where the database could have tracked down criminals or prevented serious crimes. The 1993 attack on New York's World Trade Center was blamed on Ramzi Yousef, a Pakistani using a stolen Iraqi passport. Milorad Lukovic, prime suspect in the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, made 20 journeys around the world in three years using a stolen Croatian passport. STOLEN PASSPORTS Louboutin said this year Interpol dismantled an illegal immigration ring from Iraq to the United states, tracking passports stolen in Cyprus in 2003 that turned up in Mexico. "Now we're working on the case of 2,500 blank passports stolen in Venezuela and we are finding these passports all around the world," he said. U.N. security experts have urged governments to work more closely with Interpol to identify lost and stolen passports to help thwart international militant groups like Al Qaeda. Louboutin said the United States was testing the database on arrivals to New York airports and planned to extend it. Forty countries should be hooked up by next year, he said. After several years hesitating, Britain has begun work to link up to the database after Interpol criticised it for failing to use the system or share information about militants. "How can you say to citizens that you have an efficient system to control migration in your country when someone can point out that there's a database with 15 million documents and you never check it?" said Louboutin. "There is not a single terrorist act in the world that doesn't implicate several countries, if not several continents," he said. "What works in one police station, we want to put at a global level because there are no more frontiers."
