 Chittagong, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Sunday filed five cases against Portlink Logistics, owner of a container depot at Bhatiary in Chittagong, on charges of cargo mishandling. Md Nurul Goni, a BGMEA official, filed the cases with the Chittagong Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court on behalf of five member companies of the association, after he was given power of attorney by the firms. On June 11, land slides in Chittagong damaged millions worth of readymade garments stored in one of Portlink's depots. At least 50 companies stored their goods in the depot for export. BGMEA's 1st vice-president MA Salam told bdnews24.com: "We coordinated the cases on behalf of the companies." Salam had earlier said two lakh cartons of readymade garments were stored in the depot and at least 30,000 cartons were damaged. Zia Ahsan Habib, counsel for the plaintiff, told bdnews24.com that the court had accepted the cases and asked the officer in charge of Sitakunda Police Station to submit a report after completing an investigation. Earlier, the BGMEA issued a legal notice asking for damages, but received no response from Portlink. Portlink's general manager BS Gill told bdnews24.com that he was unaware of any case filed against his company. BGMEA's lawyer said that the five companies incurred losses of Tk 2.97 crore due to negligence of Portlink. BGMEA deputy secretary Md Aziz said a further 69 garments manufacturers are preparing to file cases against the same company. The Chittagong Customs House had earlier ordered Portlink to stop its operations on Oct 23 to ensure the Military Academy in Bhatiari is free of pollution. Customs officials also ordered the company to remove its machinery and other equipment from the depot within three months. bdnews
