 WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy assured a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday that his country would stand by Washington in the fight against nuclear proliferation in Iran and terrorism in Afghanistan. "America can count on France," Sarkozy said in a speech that underscored his desire for warmer ties with Washington and was filled with effusive praise for American values. "Together we must fight to defend and promote the values and ideals of freedom and democracy that men such as Washington and Lafayette invented together," he said, referring to the French military officer who fought along side George Washington in the American war of independence. Sarkozy, 52, is on a 26-hour visit. Unashamedly pro-American, he has made clear he wants to renew a trans-Atlantic friendship that was badly strained by the Iraq war and a chilly personal relationship between President George W. Bush and Sarkozy's predecessor, Jacques Chirac. Sarkozy told Congress he wanted France to "assume its full role" in NATO, raising the prospect of France's rejoining the alliance's military command structure after several decades outside it. He also said success in the battle against nuclear proliferation in Libya, and progress in North Korea, shows that weapons proliferation is not inevitable.
