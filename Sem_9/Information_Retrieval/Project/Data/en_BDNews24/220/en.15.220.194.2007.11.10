 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday inaugurated a mausoleum built over Yasser Arafat's grave and vowed to continue on the late leader's path in seeking statehood. At the ceremony Abbas said he hoped Arafat's wish to be buried in Jerusalem could still be fulfilled when the dream to make the disputed city the capital of a future Palestinian state. "We will continue on the path to set up the independent Palestinian state with (Jerusalem) as its capital, God willing," Abbas said. Arafat, founder of the secular Fatah movement in the 1960s, signed a peace deal with Israel in 1993, but the agreement broke down and led to a violent uprising in 2000. In the West Bank city of Nablus on Saturday, Palestinian security forces say they seized explosive devices and home-made munitions as part of a campaign to curb militant actions, the local police chief said. Since the start of the month hundreds of Palestinian security officers have deployed in Nablus in what is planned as the first stage of a Western-backed drive to improve law and order ahead of a peace conference with Israel.

"The police and other security forces have seized dozens of suspicious objects and home-made explosive devices...we found more than 100 devices and suspect objects hidden in various places and we have detonated many of them," police chief Ahmad Sharqawi told Reuters. Israel, which is trying to bolster Abbas against his Islamist Hamas rivals, approved the deployment in the flashpoint city. If it is successful, Palestinian forces could deploy in other West Bank towns, Israeli officials say. Nablus, home to 200,000 Palestinians, has been a bastion for militants since a Palestinian uprising, or Intifada, in 2000. Israel seized control of West Bank cities, handed to the Palestinian Authority under the 1993 interim Oslo peace deal, after the outbreak of the uprising and had barred Palestinian security forces from operating in them until recently. Israel also launches frequent raids against Palestinian militants in Nablus and controls entry to the city through checkpoints, which it says are needed to stop suicide bombers. In the Gaza Strip Palestinian ambulance workers recovered the bodies of two teenagers who were shot dead on Friday by Israeli troops close to the border fence in the northern part of the territory, local officials said. An Israeli army spokesman said the two men had been spotted crawling towards the fence and were shot by troo
