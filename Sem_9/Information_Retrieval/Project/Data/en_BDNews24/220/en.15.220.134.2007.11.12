<TITLE> Bangladesh looks to Myanmar gas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh has proposed to use Myanmar gas to produce fertiliser that could, in turn, be exported to Myanmar to reduce the trade deficit, a top government official said Monday. "We've given Myanmar a concrete proposal to utilise its gas to produce fertiliser here in Chittagong," commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed told reporters after the 2nd Bangladesh-Myanmar Joint Trade Commission meeting at Sonargaon Hotel. "Later, the fertiliser will be exported to Myanmar," he said, "Myanmar has a huge demand for fertiliser". In reply to Myanmar's demand on why the factory would not be in that country, Ahmed said, "We have the infrastructure and two factories in Chittagong and the new plan will be an extension of the existing capacity". Myanmar has recently explored huge gas reserves in its Rakhaine area, in the proximity of Chittagong. Commerce secretary who led the Bangladesh side at the meeting, said Myanmar wanted to know detail on the issue. Brig Gen Aung Tun, deputy commerce minister of Myanmar, led his country at the meeting. Senior trade and commerce ministry officials of both the countries were present. Bangladesh also intends to produce hydro-electricity in Myanmar. Technical teams from both the countries will sit soon for a feasibility study on it. Both countries have discussed different issues like reducing trade gap, inclusion of some essentials in the border trade facility, allowing conventional vessels under the coastal arrangement and introducing banking facility in the border areas to enhance bilateral trade. Bangladesh has also asked the Myanmar government to reduce the time it takes for registration and testing of exports of pharmaceuticals from Bangladesh. On Bangladesh's interests in contract farming, Feroz Ahmed said that Myanmar was also interested, but it would take time to examine the existing land leasing and contract farming policies. The two policies are different in Myanmar, he said. Ahmed said that Myanmar had also agreed in principle to increase the amount of a letter of credit to $20,000 from the present $10,000 under the border trade agreement. According to Bangladesh, the bilateral trade between the two closest neighbours is about $35 million. Of the amount, Bangladesh exports only $5 million. But according to Myanmar, Feroz Ahmed said that the bilateral trade figure was about $60 million. Ahmed said: "We've agreed to sort out the million gap and discrepancy in the trade figure between the two countries." Bangladesh also asked the Myanmar government to ease visa and border pass processes to increase movement between the two countries. The first JTC meeting was held in three years although it was supposed to be held once every year. bd
