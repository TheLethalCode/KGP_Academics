<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - The government Thursday appealed to the Appellate Division seeking a stay order on bail granted by the High Court to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the barge-mounted power plant corruption case. The court also stayed a hearing of Hasina's writ petition challenging an Anticorruption Commission notice on her wealth statement until Wednesday. ACC lawyer barrister Karisma Zahan told bdnews24.com that state lawyer Khalequzzaman filed the appeal that the court will hear Sunday. Hasina's lawyer barrister Fazle Noor Tapash confirmed that the government had filed an appeal. The High Court on November 4 granted bail to Hasina. The court also stayed the proceedings of the case, which was later brought under emergency rules. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Hasina on Sept 2 on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes from a power company while she was prime minister. The sum was later allegedly used to buy a building for the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in Dhanmondi in 1997, according to case details. Apart from Hasina, six other people, including the then power secretary Dr Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury and the then Power Development Board chairman Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, have been accused of having had roles in the alleged corruption. Hasina had allegedly received the sum in eight cheques and pay orders of American Express Bank, Standard Chartered bank, Eastern Bank, Dhaka Bank, Arab Bangladesh Bank and the former ANZ Grindlays bank at different times from Oct 20, 1996 to Nov 24, 1997. Local representatives of Wartsila Power Development Ltd paid the money to obtain a work order to install a barge-mounted power plant in Khulna, although the company was not the lowest bidder for the tender, the case said. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 20. On Oct 28, Hasina filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the trial of the case under emergency powers rules. She also sought bail in the case. The High Court Thursday heard Hasina's writ petition that challenged the trial of the case under emergency rules. A High Court bench of justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury also heard the writ petition challenging the ACC notice on her wealth statement. Barrister Rafiq-ul Haque defended Hasina in court. He told the court that it was mandatory to conduct a preliminary investigation before serving anybody notice for wealth statement according to ACC rules. He said the ACC broke the rules when serving notice to Hasina. Attorney general Fida M Kamal said Hasina held an important government post. The ACC served the notice in the interest of transparency and accountability, he said. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 at her Dhanmondi home. The ACC sent the notice a day after she was arrested. bdnew
