<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said the interim government was working to put in place a system that checks misuse of public fund and corruption. "The incumbent government is facing difficulties in its efforts to get the country on the right road. We are working to install a system so that the misuse of government fund is stopped, corruption is prevented and men can live safely," he said. Mainul made the remark at a ceremony marking the launch of 'Audit Directorates' Manuals 2007' conducted by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General at Audit Bhaban in Kakrail in the city. He said he believed the political parties would work for the welfare of the country learning from past mistakes. "Personally I am an optimist. I think the political parties will work for the development of the country with new spirits taking lesson from the past mistakes. We will get rid of our past disgrace," he said. Comptroller and auditor general Asif Ali presided over the event where law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and director general Nurun Nobi Khan of the Commercial Audit Directorate also spoke. "One government will go and another will come. But the government employees are always a part of the government. They have to set good example s by accomplishing their jobs with honesty and firmness." "The main reason of corruption is dishonesty. We will get rid of corruption if the government officials go about their jobs with honesty." Continued Mainul, "I consider the introduction of Audit Directorates' Manuals 2007' an excellent initiative as success of all works depend on proper planning and instruction of necessary provisions and methods for the implementation." "The incumbent government is giving priority on changes and reforms to old rules and regulations. For this we have formed a regulatory commission on reform rules and regulation." "But the commission has limitations. It is not possible for the commission alone to reform all provisions of all ministries and government organisations." "It will be good if the ministries and the government departments bring changes on their own without depending on the commission to do them," Mainul said. He said the role of the auditor general was crucial for transparency and accountability in the functioning of the state. "That's why there is no alternative to the efficiency of audit. The office of the auditor general plays a significant role in reducing corruption, misuse and disorder in state activities," Mainul added. bdnew
