<TITLE> India to form new panel for spectrum rules </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will set up a new panel with representatives from industry and experts to revise norms for allotment of spectrum to wireless telecoms operators, the telecoms ministry said. India is the world's fastest growing mobile services market, adding about 8 million users a month, but the boom has caused a strain on the scarce spectrum that is issued by the government based on the number of subscribers an operator has. Telecom Engineering Centre, a technical body of the telecoms ministry, last week recommended a four to 15 times rise in subscribers for operators, depending on their telecom circle, to become eligible for additional spectrum. It said the spectrum could serve more subscribers if operators adopted new technologies such as a compression system for audio and another that reduces interference in signals. The criteria was tougher than the two to six times rise recommended by the telecoms regulator in August, and drew more protests from the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) that had earlier challenged the regulator's recommendations. The COAI, which represents dominant GSM platform used by top mobile firm Bharti Airtel and others like Vodafone Essar, a unit of Vodafone Plc, says the stringent criteria would affect their expansion. But the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India, which represents operators on the CDMA platform such as Reliance Communications, welcomed last week's recommendations saying these would ensure efficient utilisation of spectrum. India has permitted operators to provide nationwide wireless services on alternate platforms, and some CDMA operators, like Reliance, have applied for licenses to operate GSM networks. "As spectrum (for GSM) is limited, its allocation to new operators would mean denial of additional spectrum to existing operators whenever they reach the next subscriber benchmark," Macquarie Securities' Subhabrata Majumder wrote in a note. The new panel, which will have representatives from both the lobby groups and other industry experts, will submit its report in three weeks, the telecoms ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday. The ministry will use existing rules to process applications it has received seeking licences to provide telecoms services, it said. India has received more than 500 applications to provide telecoms services in some or all of the 23 telecoms zones from companies ranging from real-estate firm DLF Ltd to the diversified Videocon group.
