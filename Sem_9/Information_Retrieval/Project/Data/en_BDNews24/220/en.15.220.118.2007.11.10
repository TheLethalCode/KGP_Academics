 KOLKATA, Nov 10 (NDTV/bdnews24.com) -- Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee resigned as Member of Parliament Saturday in protest against the continued violence in West Bengal's Nandigram. Mamata, who is backing the Bhumi Ucched Pratirodh Committee (BUPC), an anti-land acquisition front, called for an 'indefinite protest' on the issue. Meanwhile, the situation in Nandigram seems to be getting worse as two more people have died in fresh clashes between the BUPC men and CPM supporters on Saturday. According to reports 20 others have been injured. However, there is no confirmation yet on who started the firing. The two who died were fired upon during a march protesting against being evicted from their village in Nandigram. Social activist Medha Patkar, who has not been allowed inside Nandigram, is on a two-day hunger strike. The Union Home Ministry has dispatched a Central Reserve Police Force battalion to Nandigram. Mamata has threatened that her party will 'paralyse' West Bengal from Monday. The Congress and the Socialist Unity Centre of India have also called for a 24-hour state-wide strike on Monday in protest against Nandigram voilence. Meanwhile, in a major development, state PWD minister and senior RSP leader Kshiti Goswami has decided not to continue in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cabinet and seeks permission from party to resign over violence in Nandigram. Governor vs government A war of words has broken out between the West Bengal Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and the state's Left Front government over Nandigram. The CPI(M) has accused the Governor of overstepping his constitutional mandate by criticising the state government's handling of the Nandigram situation. In a strongly worded statement the CPI(M) said the Raj Bhavan has once again out-stepped the constitutional limit of the highest office of the state. The party said this will only embolden the forces determined to destabilize peace and democracy in the state in the most undemocratic manner. Also, senior Left leader AB Bardhan slammed the Governor, saying that he had crossed 'lakshman rekha' and that his remarks were uncalled for. Earlier, the Governor expressed serious displeasure at the state government's handling of the situation in Nandigram and had criticised the CPI(M) for what he called its strategy for recapturing villages in Nandigram. In a late night communique, Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi said: ''Enough is enough. Nandigram has become a war zone. No government or society can allow a war zone to exist without immediate and effective action.'' Referring to the CPI(M) takeover of villages in Nandigram the communique says: ''The manner in which the recapture of Nandigram villages is being attempted is totally unlawful and unacceptable.'' The governor further said: ''The treatment meted out to Medha Patkar, who was not allowed to enter Nandigram on Thursday defies all norms of civilised behaviour.'' The governor's communique goes on to say: ''I have asked the administration to remove the new, unauthorised man-made blocks at entry points. Unless these steps are taken within hours and the syndrome of capture and recapture is not ended, the beginnings of a resumed dialogue will not get off the ground.'' However, the CPI (M) claimed that his assessment on Nandigram is not based on ground realities but indirect sources. The party said that the Governor is misinformed about the situation in Nandigram and described his comments as unfortunate and unexpected. Meanwhile, filmmakers Aparna Sen and Rituparna Ghosh have joined Medha Patkar in protest against the violence in Nandigram Sen and Ghosh had earlier boycotted the Kolkata Film Festival over the issue.
