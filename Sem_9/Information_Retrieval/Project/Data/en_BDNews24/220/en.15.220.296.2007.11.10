 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) - Asian Football Federation (AFC) vice president Manilal Fernando will pay a one-day visit to Bangladesh to see the progress of establishing two football centres and a football academy. Fernando, also an AFC development director, is scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh Wednesday night and to meet the highups of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) and the National Sports Council chairman the next day. The AFC sanctioned US$ 2.5 lakh Tsunami fund in 2005 to build two football centres and it extended the timeframe after the dateline had expired in June last. The AFC under the second goal project also sanctioned US$ 4,00,000 to build a football academy. After taking over, NSC Chairman and Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed declared that the Tsunami fund would not go back and he would manage the lands to build the football centres and the academy. With the assistance of the NSC, the BFF has already got the allotment of a three-acre land in Barisal and another three acres of land in Cox's Bazar are under process. The government is also looking for a suitable land in Gazipur to build the football academy. "Fernando has expressed his desire to meet the NSC chairman, and we have informed the authority concerned of AFC vice president's desire, but the meeting is yet to be finalised," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. Malu said that the AFC vice president would first meet the BFF president and the secretary and then have a meeting with its executive committee members.
