<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocksfell for a fourth time in five sessions on Wednesday as a record high euro fuelled worries over corporate profits, but rising commodity prices and merger talk boosted mining stocks. French oil firm Total gained 3 percent after posting quarterly earnings that beat forecast and reiterated its output target. At 1200 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,541.68 points. Europe's benchmark index has lost 3.4 percent so far this month. The dollar slid to a fresh all-time low against the euro and a basket of currencies after comments from senior Chinese officials stirred concerns the central bank might shift reserves away from the US currency. At 1200 GMT, the euro was at $1.4677. Shares of European manufacturers were among the worst hit, with aerospace group EADS down 2.3 percent, Volkswagen down 2.3 percent, BMW down 2.8 percent and Renault down 4 percent. "The main problem is not really the impact on European companies' earnings, even though some sectors such as aerospace and autos are suffering. It's more that the dollar's slump is a sign that, behind the crisis in the banking sector, there is a crisis looming in the financing of the US deficit," said Romain Boscher, head of equity management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris. "The US already faces problems to absorb losses in the subprime mortgage market, and now they might face problems related to the financing of their deficit. The question is: how long will the rest of the world agree to finance the U.S. deficit?" Mining shares advanced along with base and precious metal prices, and boosted by continued market talk of a possible bid by BHP Billiton for rival Rio Tinto. BHP gained 0.7 percent, Rio rose 2.5 percent, and Anglo American added 1.3 percent. Shares of airline companies dropped, hit by buoyant crude oil prices. US crude oil futures rose above $98 a barrel for the first time, closing in on the landmark $100 level, lifted by worries over a winter fuel supply crunch as well as the fall in US dollar. British Airways tumbled 4.2 percent, Air France fell 2.1 percent and Lufthansa dropped 1.7 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.5 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 1 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.7 percent. Banking shares, hit by continued worries over the impact of the crisis in the credit market, slid again. Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 3.7 percent, while Barclays fell 2.3 percent and BBVA shed 1.4 percent. Shares in Austria's state-controlled Austrian Post plunged 14.5 percent after it said it will lose more than 10 percent of its annual operating earnings because one of its biggest customers has cancelled its parcel delivery contract. German pay-TV broadcaster Premiere fell 7.8 percent after several banks downgraded the stock on uncertainty over the next Bundesliga soccer TV rights auction -- a large source of income for Premiere. Telefonica dropped 3.2 percent after weaker-than-expected results in its Brazilian fixed line business Telesp and as investors took profits after a strong rally. Dutch financial services group ING shed 2.3 percent after the company reported weak third quarter resul
