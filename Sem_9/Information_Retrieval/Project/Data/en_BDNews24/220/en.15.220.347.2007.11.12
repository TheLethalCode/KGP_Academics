<TITLE> Govt has no immediate plan for oil price hike: Tapan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government has yet to come to a decision on whether it will raise the price of oil on the domestic market to meet the cost of record-breaking international crude oil prices. The government is now buying fuel at over $110 a barrel on the international market, energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury told reporters after a ministerial meeting Monday. If the government does not raise oil prices the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation will need to be subsidised to the tune of around Tk 5,000 crore, BPC chairman Anwarul Karim had earlier told bdnews24.com. Neighbouring countries have already boosted their domestic retail pricing, Tapan said. "It is of great concern that the price of essentials continues to soar, and the hike in international oil prices adds to the problem." "However, it is impossible for the government to continue giving subsidies to stabilise oil prices," Tapan said. The adviser said the meeting also discussed proposals from private businessmen to market excavated stone from Madhyapara hard-rock quarry in Dinajpur. Around 1.6 lakh tonnes of stone that has already been excavated remains unsold, Tapan said. Businessmen import six lakh tonnes of stone in the rainy season and 2.5 lakh tonnes in the dry season a month, although excavated stone is not being marketed properly, said Tapan The adviser said various governmental organisations including Bangladesh Railways and the Roads and Highways Department were offered the unsold stone, but none of them had accepted the offer. bdnews24.
