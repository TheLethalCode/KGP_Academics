 LONDON, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in two minutes on Sunday to send Manchester United three points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers. With unbeaten Arsenal playing at Reading on Monday, the champions seized their opportunity at Old Trafford with Ronaldo heading home in the 34th minute and doubling his tally with a right-footed shot in the 36th. Blackburn, managed by former United stalwart Mark Hughes, came close when Christopher Samba hit the bar in the first half but had David Dunn sent off for a second yellow card in the 53rd minute. The first league fixture of Alex Ferguson's 22nd year as manager left United, without injured Wayne Rooney, alone on 30 points from 13 matches to Arsenal's 27 from 11. "The decisive moments were a fantastic header from Ronaldo and a quick goal after it, that killed them really," Ferguson told Sky Sports television. "The second half was a professional performance, they kept the possession well and didn't take a great deal of risk," added Ferguson, who singled out the indefatigable Ryan Giggs for particular praise. "They could have scored a couple more but I'm really happy because they (Blackburn) are a good side." Hughes was disappointed, saying: "I thought we more than held our own in the first half." As for Dunn's sending off for tripping Louis Saha, he added: "It wasn't a really poor or a violent challenge. He was unlucky to get booked in the first half in my view as well, so we feel a bit harshly done by. "Unfortunately the game was taken away from us.
