<TEXT>
 SANAA, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twelve people were killed when Yemeni tribesmen clashed on Thursday with security personnel for a Ukrainian oil firm during a protest, the Yemeni ruling party's Web site said. Six guards and six tribesmen were killed in the clash, which has ended, according to the Web site of the People's Congress Party. "Tribal and security forces efforts have succeeded in containing the armed clash," it said adding that the incident occurred in the eastern province of Shabwa. The Web site did not give the name of the Ukrainian company, but quoted provincial sources as saying that the Bel-Hareth tribe has been pressing to secure jobs for its members at the oil firm and to secure contracts without consideration to professional skills and requirements. US ally Yemen is a small producer of oil with output of around 330,000 barrels per day (bpd) and exports of about 200,000 bpd. Tribesmen blew up a crude oil export pipeline on Monday, apparently to press for tribal demands. Scores of holidaymakers and foreigners working in Yemen have been kidnapped over the past decade by tribesmen demanding better schools, roads and services, or the release of prisoners. Most have been released unharmed. In September, a tribe in Shabwa abducted two foreign engineers and their Yemeni driver in a dispute between a local contractor, apparently a member of the tribe, and the hostages' employer. The were freed unharmed.
