 TBILISI, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's parliament on Friday unanimously approved a 15-day countrywide state of emergency called by President Mikhail Saakashvili to crush a wave of protests. The United States had called for Saakashvili to lift emergency rule. Saakashvili has said emergency rule was needed to counter the threat posed by Russian security services who he said were stirring up civil disorder in Georgia. "The threat that existed until now is still present despite the calm that has been restored," Speaker Nino Burdzhanadze told parliament. "I do not exclude we will rescind today's decision before these 15 days expire."
