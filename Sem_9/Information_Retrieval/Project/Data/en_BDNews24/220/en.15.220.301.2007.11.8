 PORT OF SPAIN, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Patrick Manning began a new five-year term after taking the oath of office on Wednesday, two days after voters returned the ruling party to power with a comfortable majority. The swearing-in ceremony, normally a solemn affair at the president's residence, was held at noisy Woodford Square in downtown Port of Spain, commonly called the "People's Parliament" as the site of political debates by ordinary citizens. "This departure from tradition signifies our intention to bring government closer to the people," said the 61-year-old Manning, now serving his third term. Manning's People's National Movement won 26 of 41 parliamentary seats in the energy-rich southern Caribbean nation. The opposition United National Congress took the remaining 15. The square and surrounding streets, packed with PNM supporters, were transformed into a mini-carnival as spectators danced, sang and clapped throughout the ceremony. Manning, a geologist, said the government intended to boost revenues via its main exports, which include oil, natural gas and petrochemicals, and to diversify the economy by building plastics, aluminum and steel industries. Trinidad and Tobago's offshore oil and gas resources have made it the envy of the Caribbean, with economic growth of 12 percent last year. Manning also said the government aimed to push inflation down to 7 percent by year end and to 5 percent next year. Inflation measured 7.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in September compared with 7.9 percent in August.
