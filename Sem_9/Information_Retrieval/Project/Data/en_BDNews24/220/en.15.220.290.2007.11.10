 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Saturday sent Hotel Purbani International managing director Mahbubur Rahman Joynal into another three-day remand in a narcotics case. Magistrate Mohammad Waliul Islam of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka granted the remand after Joynal was produced in court at the end of a three-day interrogation in an arms case. RAB-3 sub inspector Osikur Rahim Siddiqui, investigation officer of the case, appealed for seven days. In the arms case, investigation officer Abdul Bari, sub inspector of Mohammadpur Police Station, appealed to court to keep Joynal behind bars in the interest of investigation. Osikur Rahman in his remand appeal alleged that Joynal was using liquor and aphrodisiacs such as Viagra to destroy the young generation and harm the society. Joynal distributed the drugs among adolescent girls and boys through a syndicate, he added. Joynal's lawyers Barrister Abdullah al Mamun and Advocate Jahanara Begum opposed the remand appeal in court saying that Viagra did not fall in the narcotics category. It was a medicine. Besides, their client was sick, they went on. The lawyers also appealed for bail to Joynal in the arms case. They said that law enforcers had not found any arms despite quizzing Joynal for three days. And the knives seized from his residence were for kitchen use. The RAB arrested Joynal and his girlfriend Jannatul Ferdous on November 4. Joynal faces four cases with Mohammadpur Police Station. Of the cases, one is under the Special Powers Act and the other for money laundering. bdnew
