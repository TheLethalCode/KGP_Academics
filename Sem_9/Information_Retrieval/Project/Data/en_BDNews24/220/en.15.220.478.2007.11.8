 MUMBAI, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Ravi Sawani has been appointed as the new chief investigator and general manager of the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, the ICC said on Thursday. Sawani, 57, who has served in India's federal intelligence agency, was part of the inquiry set up as corruption rocked cricket in 2000 after several prominent players were named in an Indian federal police investigation. Sawani takes over from Jeff Rees, who is retiring after holding the post since the inception of the ACSU in 2000. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said Sawani's experience of working in India would help the sport's governing body in their drive to eradicate corruption in cricket. "The history of match-fixing and betting in cricket... a good proportion of it has revolved around bookmakers and betting and illegal activities in India," Speed told a news conference. "India is the financial powerhouse of the game. We are well aware of the amounts of money that are bet on cricket matches in India. "India is playing Pakistan at the moment. The amount of money bet on the match we believe to be somewhere between $500 million to a billion," he added. "So it's great we are able to appoint Sawani to the position." Sawani will begin his role next week and will work alongside the chairman of the ACSU, Paul Condon, three investigators and five regional security managers
