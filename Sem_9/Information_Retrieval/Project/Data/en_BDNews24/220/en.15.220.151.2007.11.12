 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com) The president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association Fazlul Hoque Sunday took a dig at the efforts of overseas diplomatic missions for failing to boost domestic exports. "Not one of the 44 Bangladeshi missions abroad made any contribution to increasing exports, although that is their main task," Hoque said at a press conference at BKMEA'S Sonargaon Road office Sunday. "They are tasked to work on reviewing the market and increasing the profile of Bangladeshi products. But they have completely failed to do this," Hoque said. The BKMEA leader asked the government to take steps to ensure the missions carried out this aspect of their work more efficiently. Hoque said a BKMEA team travelled overseas a year ago to review the local market, but he claims to have received no help from the chief of mission at their destination. The trade association's chief declined to name the country in question, adding only: "All the missions are the same." "Bangladesh's export earnings have seen a decline. Proper efforts from the diplomatic missions could help remedy the situation," Hoque said. The BKMEA president said recent developments in the country had impacted negatively on the knitwear sector: "Everybody is suffering from a lack of confidence." "We ask the government to lobby hard for duty-free and quota-free access for Bangladeshi goods to the US market," he added. Export earnings targets were not achieved in first two months of the current fiscal year, according to the BKMEA. bdnews
