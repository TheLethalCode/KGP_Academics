 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee Friday asked the government to form a special tribunal to try 1971 war criminals. Prof Kabir Chowdhury, at a meeting of the organisation's council of advisers held at his home, said the government could form a commission to prepare a list of war criminals and collect evidence of war crimes. He asked the Election Commission not to register Jamaat-e-Islami and other parties that base their politics on religion. Shahriar Kabir, acting president of the organisation that campaigns against war criminals and collaborators in the 1971 independence war, said: "We believe this government is a pro-liberation war government. It is not a government of Jamaat or war criminals." "The government, as representative of the nation and of the families of martyred freedom fighters, has to take the initiative to try war criminals," he said. Retired Supreme Court judge Justice KM Sobhan said: "The government takes the initiative to try war criminals everywhere in the world. Traditional law did not have provisions for war crimes. "After World War II, countries enacted special laws and formed tribunals to try war criminals. Why can't the Bangladesh government do this?" Golam Quddus, general secretary of Sammilita Sangskritik Jote, called on supporters of war crime trials to be united. Architect Rabiul Husain, Prof Muntasir Mamun, social activist Shyamoli Nasrin Chowdhury and sculptor Ferdousi Priyabhashini were present at the meeting. They demanded that Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, assistant secretary general Abdul Quader Molla and former bureaucrat Shah Abdul Hannan be tried for what they called their anti-state role. bdnews2
