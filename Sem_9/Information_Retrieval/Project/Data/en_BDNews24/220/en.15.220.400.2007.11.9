<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Friday said senior party leaders were trying to reunite the party. "There are some misunderstandings within the party, but the senior leaders are trying to bridge that. We hope everything will be all right." "A united BNP will take part in the upcoming national polls," Hafiz told bdnews24.com at his Banani home. Renewing the claim that his faction represented the 'mainstream', he said: "There should not be any confusion since the Election Commission has recognised us as the mainstream BNP." "The last two governments patronised crime and corruption. BNP also moved away from the ideology of Ziaur Rahman. As a result, some people polluted BNP with black money," Hafiz said. "We want to filter them out and establish the empowerment of honesty and sincerity." He, however, negated his own words to say: "There is no partition in BNP. We are one party." "The senior most leader M Saifur Rahman has taken the charge because our chairperson [Khaleda Zia] is behind bars now." "We will participate in the polls with our election logo, a sheaf of paddy," he added. The acting secretary general reiterated his demand for punishment of those who had harassed standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman at Zia's graveside on Nov 7. He also alleged that the Jan 11 incident was a result of miscommunication among political parties. bdnews24.
