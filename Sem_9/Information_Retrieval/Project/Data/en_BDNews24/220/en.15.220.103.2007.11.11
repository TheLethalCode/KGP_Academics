<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division Sunday turned down two government appeals seeking permission to file formal appeals against Chittagong city mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. A thee-judge bench led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin delivered the verdict. The government made the appeals for permission to challenge the High Court's dismissal of the cases on February 7, 2005. Mohiuddin's lawyer Harisadhan Dev Brahman told bdnews24.com that the Appellate Division verdict cleared his client of the two cases. But the latest verdict does not ensure freedom for Mohiuddin as he runs up against several other cases. The now-defunct Anticorruption Bureau filed a case against Mohiuddin on February 9, 2002 charging him with causing a loss of Tk 4.12 crore to the Chittagong City Corporation during the construction of the Singapore Market in Agrabad. The bureau filed another case on the same day in relation to losses of Tk 1.2 crore during the construction of an intercity bus terminal at Garibullah Shah Mazar Road in Nasirabad. Chargesheets were submitted in the cases on July 9, 2002. Advocate AKM Faiz defended Mohiuddin in court and deputy attorney general Abu Bakar Siddiqui represented the government. Mohiuddin was arrested in the anticorruption crackdown in March. bdnews24
