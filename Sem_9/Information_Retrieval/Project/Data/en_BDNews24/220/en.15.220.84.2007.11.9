<TEXT>
 MOHALI, India, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vice-captain Younis Khan dedicated his match-winning 117 in the second one-dayer against India on Thursday to Pakistan's late coach Bob Woolmer. Younis anchored the innings as Pakistan recorded their highest successful one-day run chase to win with a ball to spare and level the five-match series 1-1. His third one-day hundred lifted the visitors to 322 for six after India totalled 321 for nine. "The situation required such a knock," Younis told reporters. "Today I tried hard and it worked and I can say it is special. "I would like to dedicate this innings to Bob Woolmer, especially the way he used to work with me." Younis, named man of the match, put on 102 for the fifth wicket with Misbah-ul Haq (49). When the centurion was out in the 46th over, Shahid Afridi took Pakistan over the finishing line with 29 not out off 14 balls. Woolmer died a day after Pakistan's shock first-round elimination at the World Cup in the Caribbean in March. The former England batsman was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room. Police started a murder investigation days later after it was revealed the autopsy, which investigators said was inconclusive at first, found he died of manual strangulation. That investigation ended on June 12 when Jamaica's police commissioner said the constabulary would accept the opinion of three independent pathologists that Woolmer had died of natural causes, possibly a heart attack
