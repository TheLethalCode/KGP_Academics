<TEXT>
 PHNOM PENH, Nov. 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rifle-toting police and foreign security guards from Cambodia's "Killing Fields" tribunal surrounded the home of former Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary on Monday. A foreign court official outside Ieng Sary's Phnom Penh villa said he would be arrested, although the tribunal's official spokesman declined to confirm it. Ieng Sary was the international face of the Khmer Rouge during its four-year reign of terror from 1975-79. An estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of torture, disease or starvation under the ultra-Maoist revolution. The long-awaited $56 million tribunal has already arrested and charged two of Pol Pot's top surviving henchmen in connection with the atrocities. Duch, the former schoolteacher who ran the notorious S-21, or Tuol Sleng, interrogation and torture centre has been charged with crimes against humanity, as has "Brother Number Two" Nuon Chea, who is also accused of war crimes. Nuon Chea has proclaimed his innocence, although in interviews with Western reporters Duch has confessed to his role in the mass killings and is expected to be a key witness against other senior cadres. Pol Pot died in 1998 in the final Khmer Rouge redoubt of Anlong Veng, a jungle-clad mountain on the border with Thailand. In all, prosecutors have so far identified five top suspects. In addition to Ieng Sary, Nuon Chea and Duch, they are widely believed to be former president Khieu Samphan and Meas Muth, a son-in-law of military chief Ta Mok, who died last year.
