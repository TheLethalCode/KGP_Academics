<TITLE> EU lawmakers criticise data privacy law </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union justice ministers agreed a data privacy law on Friday that EU lawmakers said gave inadequate protection to individuals' privacy rights. The ministers agreed a minimum set of standards on the protection of data transferred from one country to another for police or judicial cooperation, or to EU police or migration authorities' databases. EU lawmakers Sarah Ludford and Sophia in't Veld said the text applied only to the transfer of data from one EU state to another, and not to domestic processing of data nor to the conditions under which data can be sent to non-EU states. "It is simply inadequate in view of the proliferation of measures about data collection and EU databases," Ludford told Reuters. Asked what added value the text would bring, Portuguese Justice Minister Alberto Costa, who chaired the talks, said "moving from nothing to something ... that's positive." He referred to the right of access to data and to have it corrected if it was wrong. An EU diplomat said: "These standards are all already applied, the only good thing is that we will never be allowed to go lower." The text states unused data has to be deleted after a certain time, but does not say how long that is. Data concerning race, religion, or political beliefs can be used only when strictly necessary and when the law provides for adequate guarantees. Data can be transferred to a third state only if the state which first collected it agrees to this, or if it can be used to prevent an immediate danger. Referring to existing EU databases including visa and asylum seekers, and a plan to collect data on air passengers travelling to and from the bloc, British Liberal lawmaker Ludford said: "This measure (law) is not up to the job." National regulations apply to how people should be informed that data has been collected on them, the EU text says. People can ask to know what data has been collected on them. Authorities can refuse to answer if that could hinder investigations or public security. "We are weakening the position of the individual citizen vis-a-vis the authorities," in't Veld said earlier this week.
