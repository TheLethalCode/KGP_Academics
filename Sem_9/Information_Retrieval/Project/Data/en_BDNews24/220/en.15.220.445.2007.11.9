 COLOMBO, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed eight Tamil Tiger rebels in fighting in the north of the island, while two policemen were killed by a suspected rebel roadside bomb, a military spokesman said on Friday. The clashes, in the northern district of Vavuniya and northwestern district of Mannar on Thursday, were the latest in a series of near-daily engagements in recent months between government forces and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

The fighting follows a major battle in the Jaffna peninsula on Wednesday in which the military said they killed 60 rebels. The Tigers said 20 soldiers were killed and more than 100 wounded in the clash, and that just one of their fighters was killed. An air strike last week killed the leader of the Tigers' political wing in a body blow to hopes of ending the two-decade conflict soon. The military has launched an offensive to drive out the rebels from Mannar, after evicting them from jungle terrain they controlled in the east earlier this year. Around 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the LTTE guerrillas since early 2006.
