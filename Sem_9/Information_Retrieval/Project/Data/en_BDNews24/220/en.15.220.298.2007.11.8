 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Thursday remanded ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, for three days after he was arrested on charges of emergency rules violations. Magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka granted three-day remand after investigation officer Asaduzzaman, a sub-inspector of Tejgaon Police Station, appealed to the court seeking seven days to quiz Hannan Shah. Hannan Shah's lawyers appealed to the court against the remand appeal. Police also took three other BNP men into remand. They are Ali Arshad Mamun, Zakir Hossain and Abul Bashar. Hannan Shah was arrested at his DOHS home in Mohakhali at about 11:40pm Wednesday. Assistant police commissioner for Tejgaon zone Kazi Mashiur Rahman had earlier told bdnews24.com that the charges stemmed from violence near former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Sub-inspector Golam Mabud filed a case against seven people in connection with the violence. BNP supporters loyal to deposed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday physically harassed standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman as he went to place wreaths at the grave of Ziaur Rahman. bdnew
