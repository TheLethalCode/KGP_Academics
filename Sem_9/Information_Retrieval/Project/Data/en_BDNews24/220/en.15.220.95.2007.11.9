 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened more than expected to hit a record high in September, driven by higher imports of cars and other consumer goods, official statistics showed on Friday,. The Office for National Statistics said that Britain's goods trade gap grew to 7.754 billion pounds from 6.948 billion pounds in August. Economists had forecast a deficit of 6.9 billion pounds.

"It's a pretty horrible number and has taken the shine off sterling," said George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank. The pound, trading close to 26-year highs against the dollar, fell a fifth of a cent immediately after the data before popping up again.

The overall oil trade deficit narrowed slightly to 609 million pounds from 665 milli
