 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent NEW DELHI, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  The chairman of this year's Nobel peace prize co-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said he would shine the spotlight on Bangladesh at the upcoming Bali climate change summit. "I am going to focus on Bangladesh. People don't know what is happening there," IPCC chairman R K Pachauri told Asian journalists last week at the United Nation's office in New Delhi. Indonesia will host the 13th United Nations Climate Change Conference on the island of Bali next month. About the details of his plans for Bangladesh, Pachauri said: "I won't disclose everything now." He said he was not expecting a major breakthrough at the Bali conference. "But there may be some perceptible progress," he said. The world's climate is changing rapidly because increased CO2 emissions, especially by developed countries, are causing global temperatures to rise. The US, Australia and Canada are the world's three major CO2 emitters. China and India are increasingly contributing to green house gas emissions. Although CO2 emissions tend to originate in industrialised and affluent countries, the world's poorest countries are its worst victims. Bangladesh is highly vulnerable, because it is a low-lying country crisscrossed by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, it lies on the Bay of Bengal and is densely populated. Its economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and natural resources that are sensitive to climate change and sea level rises. According to the IPCC, continuing CO2 emission at current rates will cause global temperature to rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius by century's end. A temperature increase of this magnitude will submerge about 10 percent of Bangladesh's area. The country already faces unseasonal flooding, precipitation and other natural disasters, which experts blame on climate change. The IPCC chair said Bangladesh needed to improve its physical infrastructure to deal with the climate change issue, but lacks the resources. "The international community doesn't pay enough attention to this country. They need to take a closer look at Bangladesh," Pachauri said. "Bangladesh, being an impoverished country, can't divert its resources to tackle climate change issues," he said. The IPCC chairman said South Asian countries lack cooperation among themselves to deal with climate change issues. "The governments of this region are not aware of the consequences," he said. Chairman of the IPCC, the organisation that shared the Nobel prize with former US vice president Al Gore, stressed adaptability to address climate change. bd
