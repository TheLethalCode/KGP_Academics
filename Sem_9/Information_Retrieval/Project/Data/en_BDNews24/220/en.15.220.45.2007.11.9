<TITLE> Kurd rebels say open to dialogue on giving up arms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TUNCELI, Turkey, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Kurdistan Workers Party guerrilla group, which Turkey has threatened an incursion into Iraq to fight, said on Friday it was open to dialogue that could lead to its downing arms, a news agency close to the rebels reported. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said this week after talks with US President George W. Bush that the army would go ahead with an incursion against the PKK militants in Iraq. Turkey, like the United States and European Union, condemns the PKK as a terrorist group and has always refused any dialogue with the guerrillas.
