<TITLE> Elections to be held by Feb 15: Musharraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani national elections will take place before Feb. 15, President Pervez Musharraf said on Thursday, after Western allies and his political opponents had demanded polls be held on time. Pakistan had been scheduled to hold elections by mid-January until the military ruler imposed emergency rule on Saturday and suspended the constitution to the horror of the international community. "It was my commitment and I am fulfilling it," Musharraf told official media after chairing a meeting of the National Security Council. Musharraf's announcement came just hours after US President George W. Bush called him personally for the first time since he imposed emergency rule, urging him to hold elections and quit as army chief. Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party plans to hold a public meeting on Friday in Rawalpindi, next to the capital Islamabad, to protest over emergency rule. Bhutto has threatened a mass motorcade from Lahore to the capital on Nov. 13 unless Musharraf quits as army chief. The United States had hoped Bhutto would share power with Musharraf after the elections, but imposition of the emergency left US policy towards Pakistan in disarray. Musharraf has been a valued asset in its fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban.
