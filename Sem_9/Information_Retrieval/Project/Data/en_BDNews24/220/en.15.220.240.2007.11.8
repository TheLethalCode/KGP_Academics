 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Wednesday night on charges of emergency rules violations. Assistant police commissioner for Tejgaon zone Kazi Mashiur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the charges stemmed from violence near former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Hannan Shah's special assistant Babul Ahmed had earlier told bdnews24.com that he was arrested at his DOHS home in Mohakhali at about 11:40pm. Sub-inspector Golam Mabud filed a case against seven people in connection with the violence. BNP supporters loyal to deposed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday physically harassed standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman as he went to place wreaths at the grave of Ziaur Rahman. The activists of the party's youth wing Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal and student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal threw shoes at him when Mahbubur, an ex-army chief, was on his way back after placing the wreaths. Police used batons to disperse the angry supporters and arrested three of them on the scene. Hannan Shah had earlier been arrested in a case filed by the Awami League and freed on bail. bdnew
