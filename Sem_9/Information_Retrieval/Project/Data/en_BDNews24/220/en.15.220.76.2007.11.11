<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool scored twice in the last nine minutes to beat Fulham 2-0 to move up to fourth in the Premier League on Saturday. The home side, who scored eight against Besiktas in the Champions League on Tuesday, were frustrated by a resolute Fulham side who held out until substitute Fernando Torres struck with his left foot from close range in the 81st minute. Steven Gerrard converted a penalty four minutes later after Carlos Bocanegra tripped Peter Crouch on the edge of the area to give manager Rafa Benitez victory in his 200th match in charge. Earlier, West Ham United won 5-0 at bottom club Derby County and Sunderland drew 1-1 with Newcastle United in their north-east derby. Six matches will be played on Sunday while leaders Arsenal visit Reading on Monday. Liverpool have 24 points from 12 matches with Arsenal (27), Manchester United (27) and Manchester City (25) above them. "We knew we had to be patient and keep passing and moving the ball," Benitez told Setanta Sports. "We had a lot of chances but couldn't score until the end and we have some experience of these kind of games this season. "If you want to stay at the top of the table you have to keep winning. We have been winning away but not at home and now I hope we will start winning at home as well." Fulham have never triumphed at Anfield in 27 league and cup visits dating back to 1934. HAPLESS DERBY West Ham's victory over Derby was their biggest in the Premier League since December 2000. Three of West Ham's goals came in an eight-minute spell in the second half as Billy Davies's hapless Derby recorded their fifth successive game without a goal, the club's worst run since 1920. Derby have six points from 13 matches while West Ham move up to ninth with 18 points from 12. Lee Bowyer put West Ham ahead after 42 minutes before Matthew Etherington (51), an own goal from Eddie Lewis (55), a second from Bowyer (59) and a free kick by Nolberto Solano (69) piled on the home team's misery. "We did all right for the first 40 minutes or so but then it was men against boys," said Davies. Sunderland, without a league win in six games and a home victory over Newcastle since 1980, went ahead after 52 minutes when Danny Higginbotham headed his first goal for the club. Newcastle equalised 13 minutes later as James Milner's cross-cum-shot went in off the far post. Sunderland occupy 15th place on 10 points while Newcastle are 11th with 18
