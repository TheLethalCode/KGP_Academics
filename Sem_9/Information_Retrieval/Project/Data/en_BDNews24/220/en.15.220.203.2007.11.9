<TEXT>
 Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Statements from Myanmar's junta, detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the United Nations pointing to possible talks have raised hopes of political reform and reconciliation in the former Burma. Similar apparent breakthroughs have occurred in the past and optimists have been proved wrong each time. Following are examples of hopes kindled, then dashed in a country that has now been under military rule for 45 years: 1989 - After as many as 3,000 people are killed in a crackdown on a 1988 democracy uprising, the army announces elections will be held in May 1990. Even though she was placed under house arrest the previous year, Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy wins 392 of 485 seats in parliament. The generals backtrack, saying a new constitution must come first, and ignore the result. 1995, July - Suu Kyi is released, leading then UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to express hope of a restoration of civilian rule and multi-party democracy. A year later, Suu Kyi's car is attacked by club-wielding, stone-throwing crowds as she travels to meet supporters. She accuses the junta of orchestrating the attack. In 1998 and 2000 she is prevented from leaving Yangon by car or rail. 2000, April - Malaysian diplomat Razali Ismail is appointed as the latest UN special envoy. Suu Kyi is placed under house arrest again five months later. 2001, Jan - It emerges that Suu Kyi and the junta have been holding secret talks. The negotiations generate a rare meeting between her and Senior General Than Shwe, but little else. 2002, May - Suu Kyi is released and told she can travel freely. The junta declares the "start of a new page". A year later, her convoy is attacked by pro-government supporters and she ends up back in custody. She has been in prison or under house arrest ever since, with her telephone line cut and the only visitors allowed being her doctor, maid and cook. 2006, May - New UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari becomes the first outsider to meet Suu Kyi in more than two years, rekindling talk of reconciliation and dialogue. Within a week, her house arrest has been extended by anoth
