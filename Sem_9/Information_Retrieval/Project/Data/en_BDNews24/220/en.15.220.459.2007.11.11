 Malayasia,Nov.11 (bdnews24.com/AFP) Malaysian police have detained 245 people following protests calling for electoral changes in the largest political demonstration in almost a decade, a police spokesman has said. They face charges and up to a year in jail if convicted for taking part in the illegal protest on Saturday, a police spokesman said. "We are still investigating but they have all been freed on bail," the spokesman, who declined to be named, said on Sunday. Police used water cannon and tear gas on thousands of people who defied a government ban against the rally near Merdeka Square in downtown Kuala Lumpur.

Anwar later founded the People's Justice Party, one of three opposition parties involved in the latest demonstration. "It is a good signal that Malaysians want freedom and democracy, and they want free and fair elections," he said.
