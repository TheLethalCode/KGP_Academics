 HARARE, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's attorney general has been arrested and charged with corruption in connection with allegations he promised to help a fugitive banker who had fled the southern African nation, police said on Thursday. Attorney General Sobusa Gula-Ndebele was arrested on Tuesday and then released after a statement was recorded, chief police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said. "So far we don't know when he will appear in court, but we have finished everything, including the investigations, which meant taking statements from witnesses," Bvudzijena told Reuters. If convicted, Gula-Ndebele could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and face a heavy fine. Bvudzijena said Gula-Ndebele had met James Mushore, the former director of banking group NMBZ Holdings, in September and promised him that he would not be arrested if he returned to Zimbabwe. Mushore fled to Britain in 2004 at the height of a Zimbabwean banking crisis that saw several finance houses shut down by the country's central bank. He was arrested last month upon his return to Zimbabwe.
