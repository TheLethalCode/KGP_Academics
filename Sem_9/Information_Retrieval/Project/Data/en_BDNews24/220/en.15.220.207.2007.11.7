 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal leaders Wednesday ruled out their party's links to the murder of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. At a discussion, the JSD leaders said the party wanted to see an end to Mujibur Rahman's politics, but did not want his death. They termed late president Ziaur Rahman a 'traitor' and 'antagonist' saying his name would go down in history next to Mir Zafar. JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu said: "Taher's role saved the lives of scores of army officers including Ziaur Rahman's on November 7. But Zia, after grabbing power, killed several thousand freedom fighter army personnel in connivance with Mujib's killers. At a talk organised at Colonel Taher Auditorium at JSD's headquarters, Inu said: "That was not the end of it. Zia sheltered 'war criminals' and stood against the spirit of the Liberation War to tighten his grip on power." Inu blamed the present crises in the country on Zia. He alleged that Zia's party, the BNP, along with the 'Jamaat clique' caused the problems through "looting, corruption and grabbing power". The party executive president Mainuddin Khan Badal said the JSD wanted the political demise of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But the party was not involved in his killing, he said. Citing Bangabandhu murder convict Khandaker Abdur Rashid's interview on Channel i, Badal said those who had hoped the words of a murder convict could sow rifts in the 14-party alliance had failed. JSD vice president Sharif Nurul Ambia said the party steering committee never discussed the assassination of Sheikh Mujib although the party based its politics against the Awami League. Bimal Biswas, general secretary of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, and Dilip Barua of the Samyabadi Dal also spoke at the function. Media reports referred to an interview of Rashid on Channel i in which Rashid linked Colonel Taher and the JSD to the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. JSD leaders denounced the allegation as a deep-rooted conspiracy. JSD president Inu and general secretary Syed Zafar Sajjad strongly protested the remarks of Rashid in a statement. bdnews24.
