 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  A depleted Khulna Saturday host leaders Rajshahi as the fourth-round of the four-dayers of the National Cricket League gets underway at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Second-placed Khulna will miss the services of pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak. The national stars have been rested by the Bangladesh Cricket Board that does not want to take any risk ahead of next month's New Zealand tour. Rajshahi after two straight wins drew with Chittagong in the third round to lead the six-team table with 38 points, five clear of Khulna, who are yet to win after three draws in a row. "It's a crucial round and I am hopeful that the boys will give their full against Rajshahi," Khulna captain Habibul Bashar told bdnews24.com by phone. "It is not possible to get over the loss of Mashrafee, but I think his replacement Dollar Mahmud is a promising pacer," Bashar said. "Spinners Murad Khan or Fariduddin will replace Razzak," he added. Bashar banked on in-form opener Imrul Kayes and his struggling partner Nazmus Sadat to get them off to a good start before Saqib Al Hasan, Tushar Imran and himself can take over. "We are having a bit of a problem with the opening as Sadat has been going through a bad patch while his partner Kayes is in superb form having smashed two centuries in the last round," said Bashar. Rajshahi, however, are in a great stride with national discards Mushfiqur Rahman and Khaled Mashud Pilot and rising national stars Farhad Reza and Junaed Siddique all in great touch. "We don't want to see who is or isn't playing for the opposition," said Rajshahi captain Pilot. "Our aim is to do individually better in every match and we are taking tomorrow's match just as we would take any other match," the former Bangladesh skipper said. "We will play the same squad that played the last match against Chittagong," he added. Third-paced Barisal with 29 points take on bottom-placed Sylhet, who have only 14 points having lost to Rajshahi and Dhaka, at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Holders Dhaka with 26 points host Chittagong, who have 17 points, at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. b
