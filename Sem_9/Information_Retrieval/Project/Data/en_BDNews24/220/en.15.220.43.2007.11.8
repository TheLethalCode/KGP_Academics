<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The discordant elements in the BNP harassed standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman Wednesday, alleged BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Thursday. "Despite such unwanted occurrences, our process of bolstering solidarity will be a continuous movement. We'll sit at the BNP Naya Paltan headquarters after consolidating our stance," he said to reporters at his Banani home. Hafiz demanded punishment to Mahbub's persecutors but declined to comment on BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah's arrest. He said that it was a legal step taken by the state and that law will be taking its own path. Hafiz trashed Bangabandhu murder convict lieutenant colonel (dismissed) Khandaker Abdur Rashid's allegation aired at a TV interview Wednesday and the statements given by some political parties about independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination on August 15, 1975. "(BNP founder and former president) Ziaur Rahman was not involved in any conspiracy. The news made public in this regard by the media is false and ill-motivated. "Some quarters have launched this propaganda campaign only to damage BNP's image," said Hafiz. Commenting on the two BNP factions and the issue of unity, he said, "Senior party leaders are discussing the matter and we hope that BNP will participate in the next polls as one party." Describing his faction as the mainstream BNP, Hafiz said, "Our chairperson is in jail, but the senior most leader of the party is at the helm of affairs. And, you see, the Election Commission has invited us to the reform dialogue." Replying to a question, he said Hannan Shah was not 'a top brass of BNP'. "The standing committee members and the vice presidents are considered as senior party leaders and Hannan Shah doesn't fall in either category," he explained. "The use of muscle power and black money resulting in continued conflicts between the top political parties in the past ten years led to the imposition of emergency rules in the country," Hafiz said. "Though opposed to terrorism and corruption inside the party, our chairperson failed to contain certain elements, who tarnished the image of the party by using her name. "We want to establish honest and sincere leadership now after freeing BNP of its disrepute." AHM Mofazzal Karim, ZA Khan and other leaders were present during the briefing. bdnews24
