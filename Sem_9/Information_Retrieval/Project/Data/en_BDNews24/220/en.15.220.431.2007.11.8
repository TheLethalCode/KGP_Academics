 FRANKFURT, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent on Thursday, as expected, while the ECB weighs the risk of rising inflation and concerns about economic growth due to the soaring euro. All 77 economists polled by Reuters had expected rates to remain on hold for a fifth straight month as the ECB waits for a clear picture of the impact of recent financial market turmoil. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will present the ECB's latest economic assessment at a news conference at 1330 GMT, where he will also face questions about the euro's surge to record highs above $1.47 . Trichet said a month ago that inflation risks were to the upside but growth risks to the downside, a combination most economists think will make the ECB leave rates on hold until the end of 2008 [ECB/INT]. Still, a surprisingly large jump in October inflation has increased the risk of inflation staying higher for longer than the ECB earlier expected, and oil prices are at record highs. The ECB also left its marginal lending rate, at which banks can get emergency overnight loans, unchanged at 5 percent and the deposit rate stayed at 3 percent.
