 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com reporter Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Fourteen-year-old Poppy was sold into sex-slavery in Dhaka. Khodeja paid Tk 25,000 to a women trafficker to own her. Poppy, not her real name, is one of countless girls and young women who are uprooted from their families and trafficked around the country or smuggled abroad for huge sums of money. The victims of this age-old trade often fall prey to prostitution syndicates through a lack of education. They are usually poor and socially marginalised, and often divorced for failing to meet dowry demands. Victims of the sex trade are as likely to come from rural backgrounds as urban ones, although a fertile hunting ground for traffickers remains the garment workers. Many girls who work in garment factories report traffickers' agents as being a regular sight outside their workplaces, often preying on newcomers' naivety. The highly fluid nature of the workforce in garment factories means young women often find themselves between jobs, and therefore vulnerable to outlandish promises, victims say. Modern brothels are often well run businesses operated by savvy syndicates who protect their investments in well-guarded brothel houses. Mohiuddin Ahmed, a researcher at Terre des Hommes Netherlands, a children's aid organisation, conducted a study on women trafficking. Mohiuddin told bdnews24.com that traffickers track vulnerable and poor families that contain young women, and attempt to entice them from their homes. In extreme cases, girls and young women are simply kidnapped and sold to middlemen engaged in the trade before eventually landing in brothel houses. Surprisingly, Terre des Hommes' findings reveal that most traffickers in Bangladesh are women, partly because their motives are less likely to be suspected. Women traffickers often employ local women and police to ensure safe passage for their victims. In common with many illegal businesses, the top bosses usually remain untouched, even when victims are liberated by law-enforcement agencies. Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association executive director Salma Ali told bdnews24.com: "Rescued victims cannot usually name their traffickers because they change hands so frequently." Mohiuddin's research also highlighted the fact that traffickers pay off different branches of the police as well as prostitution syndicates on a monthly basis. Sabiha Khanam from the Police's Trafficking Monitoring Cell told bdnews24.com: "We don't have any information on the police's involvement, or of police assisting traffickers at the present time." "But I can assure you that we'll take all necessary measures if we do receive a complaint against any policeman in this regard," Khanam said. bdnews24.
