 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - A group of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain Thursday demanded the release of ASM Hannan Shah and denied that the party was linked to an incident Wednesday in which pro-reform BNP leader Mahbubur Rahman was harassed. The BNP leaders were speaking at a press conference at Delwar Hossain's home in the Jatiya Sangsad area. At the press conference, BNP's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said the arrest of the BNP chairperson's adviser and cases against party leaders under emergency rules were part of a 'conspiracy against nationalist forces'. In a statement, forty-seven former lawmakers said Wednesday's incident was unexpected and unfortunate. Rizvi said the group that the Election Commission had invited to talks had no ties to the mainstream BNP. BNP leaders Mohammad Shahjahan, retired major Akhtaruzzaman, Selim Reza Habib, Shah Nurul Kabir Shahin and Prof Sohrab Uddin were present at the press conference. They expressed concern at cases against BNP leaders including former lawmaker Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal and demanded a fair investigation into the matter. Hannan Shah was arrested at his DOHS home in Mohakhali Wednesday. Assistant police commissioner for Tejgaon zone Kazi Mashiur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the charges were in connection to violence near former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Sub-inspector Golam Mabud filed a case against seven people in connection with the violence. bdnew
