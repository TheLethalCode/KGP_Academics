 JERUSALEM (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police raided government offices on Sunday as part of three criminal investigations into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's conduct in a previous cabinet post, a spokesman said. Fraud investigators scoured 20 premises including the Industry and Trade Ministry, Israel Lands Administration, Jerusalem Municipality and Postal Authority for potential evidence in their probe, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Olmert, a former Jerusalem mayor, is suspected of having arranging an illicit discount on a house he bought in the city. He is further under investigation over allegations of bid-rigging and cronyism while serving as industry minister. The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing in the affairs, which have overshadowed a tenure already challenged by an Israeli public backlash at last year's costly Lebanon war.
