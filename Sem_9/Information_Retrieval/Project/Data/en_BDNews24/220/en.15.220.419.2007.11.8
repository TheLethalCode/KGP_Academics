 BERLIN, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tommy Haas will undergo hair and blood tests, while the International Tennis Federation (ITF) will investigate a claim that he was poisoned during Germany's Davis Cup semi-final defeat by Russia in Moscow in September. "I want to find out if any poison can be traced or confirmed," Haas told Bild newspaper, which reported the 29-year-old would fly to New York on Friday for the tests.

Russia won the tie 3-2 with victories in both of the reverse singles rubbers. Alexander Waske, a doubles player in the beaten German team, was quoted in German media on Wednesday as saying an unnamed person had told him in Moscow that Haas had been poisoned.
