 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Hindus countrywide Friday celebrate the Shyama Puja or Kali Puja, one of their major religious festivals. The Hindu faith teaches that the Goddess Shyama visits earth on this day to punish evil doers and nurture good behaviour. A press release from the 500-year-old Radha Govinda Jeo Thakur Temple in Old Dhaka said the celebrations would start with the Shyama Puja and Dipanwita Parbon (candlelight festival). The next day the Annakut and Mohotshob ceremonies will be held while the Bhatriditiwa and Artee contests will take place Sunday. The festival comes to a conclusion Monday with the immersion of the Goddess in the river Buriganga. bdnews24.
