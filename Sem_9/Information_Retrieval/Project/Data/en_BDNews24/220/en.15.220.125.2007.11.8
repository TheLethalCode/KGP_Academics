 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Finnish operator Elisa has again made history by activating third generation (3G) mobile phone services using the frequency designated for the first generation of GSM mobile telephony. Finland's trade and industry minister Mauri Pekkarinen and Elisa's CEO Veli-Matti Mattila made the world's first commercial UMTS900 video phone call at 9:30am Finland's local time, the company said in an announcement Thursday. UMTS900, which uses a 900 MHz frequency, makes it possible to build the 3G networks profitably outside densely populated areas. Earlier Elisa made history by launching the world's first GSM mobile phone service in 1991. It also made the world's first GSM data phone call in 1993. Elisa's current 3G network operates in 2100 MHz frequency. The costs of building 3G network in 900 MHz "can be only one-third of the present costs", the company said. Ericsson and Nokia Siemens provided infrastructure and handsets for Elisa's landmark network. Ericsson said its 3G solution for the 900MHz band provides more coverage because of the improved radio wave propagation at lower frequencies, making it easier to provide low-cost mobile broadband services in rural areas as well as improved indoor coverage in urban areas. The Swedish vendor's solution is built on its existing portfolio of radio base stations, which provides commercial mobile broadband services with up to 14.4Mbps download speeds in more than 70 commercial networks. Elisa's UMTS900 is a solution to provide fast mobile broadband for sparsely populated areas. The present 3G coverage area can be expanded significantly and in the future it will cover all of Finland. "Thanks to UMTS900, in the future all Finns will be able to use fast and affordable 3G mobile Internet access and other mobile services," said Elisa's CEO Veli-Matti Mattila. Currently Elisa's 3G mobile data provides up to 2 megabits per second speed, which is comparable with good fixed broadband connections. The operator expects to increase it by five folds, close to 10 Mbps, over the next few years. The UMTS900 terminals include Nokia 6121 classic phone, which is available from Elisa and data cards from various manufacturers, which will be sold by the operator. The commercial launch of UMTS900 strengthens Finland's position as one of the leading information societies in the world. UMTS900 also enables better implementation of the fast mobile internet access that will cover the whole country, said Mauri Pekkarinen, trade and industry minister. bdn
