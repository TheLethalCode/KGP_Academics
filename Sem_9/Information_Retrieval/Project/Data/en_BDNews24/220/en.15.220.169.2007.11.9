 London, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The dollar hit record lows against the euro and a 26-year trough versus sterling on Friday as a warning from the Federal Reserve chief on U.S. growth reinforced interest rate cut expectations, which in turn supported stocks. Dollar weakness lifted safe-haven gold towards this week's 28-year peak and helped oil prices, which launched a fresh assault on the $100 a barrel milestone. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that the U.S. economy might see slower growth going into next year and that credit market strains have persisted. Credit concerns returned to the fore after ratings agency Standard & Poor's said late on Thursday that the trustee of a collateralized debt obligation managed by State Street Global Advisors may have started selling assets. The report raised worries that a wider array of structured securities may face similar action. "There is ongoing nervousness about the U.S.. The markets have taken the negative warnings from Bernanke to heart and have used that as another reason to sell the dollar," Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at Rabobank. "The market continues to anticipate additional Fed cuts, so those interest rates spreads continue to work against the dollar." The dollar had fallen to around $1.4740 per euro , and it hit the low of $2.1144 per pound sterling . Interest rate futures price in a 90 percent chance of a Fed interest rate cut in December to 4.25 percent. STOCKS MOSTLY REBOUND Expectations of growth-supportive U.S. rate cuts helped stocks, which took a beating earlier this week on credit concerns and inflation fears from surging commodity prices. The FTSEurofirst 300 index (.FTEU3: Quote, Profile, Research) was up 0.5 percent, led by financial services sector shares and mining stocks. MSCI main world equity index was steady on the day. Emerging stocks (.MSCIEF: Quote, Profile, Research) were up 0.15 percent, gaining support from firmer commodity prices. Tokyo stocks fell more than 1 percent on a report that an unlisted brokerage arm of Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T: Quote, Profile, Research) may post a subprime-related loss of over 100 billion yen ($888.1 million) and delay a merger. The iTraxx Crossover index, a most-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, was little changed at 366 basis points. Emerging sovereign spreads (11EMJ: Quote, Profile, Research) tightened by 5 bps. The December Bund future was down 3 ticks. U.S. light crude was up 0.9 percent at $96.36 a barrel. Gold rose to $834.15 an ounce, closing in on the peak of $850 -- a record hit in January 1980
