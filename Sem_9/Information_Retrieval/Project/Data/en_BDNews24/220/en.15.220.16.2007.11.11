 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Sweden and Norway are going to pass new laws next year to import skilled manpower from Bangladesh and some other countries, the foreign adviser said Sunday. The two countries may accept skilled Bangladeshis having knowledge in English and information technology, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters at a news conference at the foreign ministry. "Because of their aging population and negative birth rates, Norway and Sweden will pass laws next year to import manpower from other countries including Bangladesh," Iftekhar said on his return Saturday from a five-day official visit to the Nordic countries. He said Bangladeshi engineers with knowledge of English could get jobs in Norway. Iftekhar disclosed that Libya would import 2000 more workers from Bangladesh. He also announced that the government had prepared a seven-point strategy to export manpower across the world. According to the proposed strategy, the government will explore new markets to export labour to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Romania, Poland and Canada. In addition, the government will also try to expand the labour market in countries such as the UAE, Oman, Qatar and Libya. The strategy also aims to raise awareness about overseas employment in the poor regions like monga -hit Rangpur region. Besides, law enforcers will be deployed to stop workers from being cheated. The adviser said the Qatari labour minister had written to him and showed interest in visiting Bangladesh soon. Iftekhar said the government earned $ 5.31 billion in remittance in the first 10 months of the year. Bangladesh's labour markets are mainly concentrated in the Middle Eastern countries, the UK and Malaysia. bd
