<TITLE> Export earnings drop on labour unrest, floods: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank has blamed labour unrest in the garment sector and recurring countrywide floods for the slump in overall exports in July-August period. "It appears that consistent floods, and unrest in the garment sector, have had a negative impact on the overall export earnings," said Bangladesh Bank, in its weekly economic review. "Overall exports may also face a downturn ahead of the end of EU quota restrictions on imports of Chinese commodities by 2008," BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury also told bdnews24.com that labour unrest could well have affected export earnings. "A sense of instability prevails in the sector. Our export earnings have been affected because of workers' demonstrations and some unexpected incidents," he said. Export earnings fell about 12 percent to $2032.80 million in July-August of the current fiscal year, from $2301.81 million in the same period a year ago, due mainly to the downturn in the export of garments which constitutes the bulk of total export proceeds. The weekly review, sent to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, also observed that a rise in global commodity prices influenced by record-breaking oil prices, and recurrent flooding in Bangladesh, encouraged inflationary expectations. However, month-to-month inflation dipped to 9.60 percent in September, from 10.12 percent in August, the report said. The central bank was upbeat on foreign exchange reserves which stood at $5.43 billion on Nov 5, as remittance inflows have been recording a steady rise in the first four months of fiscal 2007-08. It also said that imports of essentials and industrial raw materials, by value of settlement of letters of credit, grew in the first three months (July-September) of the present fiscal year from a year ago, although capital machinery imports dropped. bdnews2
