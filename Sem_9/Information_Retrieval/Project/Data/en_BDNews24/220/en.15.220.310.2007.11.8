 BELFAST, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gunman shot and wounded an off-duty police officer as he dropped his child off at a school in Northern Ireland on Thursday, local politicians said. Mark Durkan, leader of the moderate nationalist SDLP party, which favours a united Ireland, pointed the finger of blame at dissident republican guerrillas who continue their armed campaign against British rule in defiance of ceasefires. "This was a despicable and cowardly attack on a policeman who was leaving his child off to school," Durkan said. "Dissident republicans have already shown their ability to cause disruption and damage," he said of splinter groups which unlike the Irish Republican Army (IRA) have refused to disarm. Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is now deputy first minister in a power-sharing government formed with pro-British foes in May, said it was time such groups woke up to the fact the war was over. "They are determined to plunge society back into a state of conflict," he told reporters. Three decades of conflict that killed over 3,600 people largely ended with a 1998 peace deal. Political stability followed this year with a regional administration in which politicians who both favour and oppose British rule share power. The Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed a 43-year-old, off-duty officer was shot earlier on Thursday in the city of Londonderry, also known as Derry, but did not give details. Chief Superintendent Ricky Russell said the officer sustained injuries to his face and arm but was able to drive himself to a local police station. "The injuries are not believed to be life threatening at this time," he said. A report by Northern Ireland's Independent Monitoring Commission on Wednesday said small splinter groups such as the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA), continued to procure weapons, build bombs and attack police officers. It added that paramilitary groups carried out three murders between March and August, blaming two of them on the CIRA.
