 Dhaka, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com) - Promising pacer Dollar Mahmud belted seven wickets including a hat-trick as hosts Khulna were in the commanding position against Rajshahi at the close of the first day of the fourth round four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Saturday. Dollar has entered the national league's record book by striking the first hat-trick in the domestic nine-year first class competition so far. League leaders Rajshahi were struggling at 174 for nine with national cap Farhad Reza on 26 and Alamgir Kabir 3 when the bails were drawn for Day 1 at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Shrugging off the batting blues, Sylhet posted 316 for four at stumps against Barisal as Alok Kapali remained unbeaten on a superb 157 at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. At Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka were trailing by 183 runs to score 17 for no loss at stumps after bundling Chittagong out for 200 in the first innings. Khulna vs Rajshahi After deciding to bat first, Rajshahi faced a blow from Mashrafee Bin Mortaza's replacement, teenage Dollar, who shared the new ball with Syed Rasel. Dollar first sent Rajshahi opener Jahirul Islam (8) back and then completed the spectacle. Dollar, supposed to go to Pakistan with the Under-19 side, trapped Juaned Siddique (14) leg before in the fifth delivery off his fifth over and then had Nayeem Islam (o) caught by keeper Sahagir Hossain in the next ball, on way to his hat-trick. In the first delivery off his next over, the tall bowler struck the national league's first hat-trick removing Mushfiqur Rahman (1) and finished the day with seven for 39. Spinner Murad Khan, playing as a replacement of Abdur Razzak, took the remaining two wickets out of nine to add salt to the wounded Rajshahi. Rajshahi skipper Khaled Mashud top-scored with 35 followed by Anisur Rahman (26) and Farhad Reza (29 not out). "He (Dollar was amazing. The wicket had nothing in it for quick bowlers, but Dollar was outstanding. I still can't believe a pace bowler had taken seven wickets on such a surface," Khulna skipper Habibul Bashar was quoted by tigercricket.com as saying. Sylhet vs Barisal After being invited to bat first, Sylhet struggled against Barisal to lose three wickets at 60 runs as medium pacer Arafat Salahuddin grabbed all three wickets. However, Sylhet skipper Rajin Saleh and Alok Kapali provided stiff resistance to put on 223 runs for the fourth wicket before Rajin (82) became the fourth victim of Salahuddin. Alok remained unbeaten on 157 off 211 balls that studded 25 fours and two sixes and Golam Mabud (10) was with him at the close of the day. Dhaka vs Chittagong Dhaka bowlers bowled superbly as Chittagong's decision to bat first proved wrong after being restricted to 200 soon after tea break on the first day. Wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh was the most successful Chittagong batsman with 41 while Aftab Ahmed scored 38. Left-arm spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel was the peak of the attack with three for 38 while Mohammad Ashraful, Mohammad Sharif and Mohammad Rafique chipped in with two wickets each. Openers Anwar Hossain (16) and Javed Omar (0) resume the Dhaka first innings Sunday on 17 for no loss.
