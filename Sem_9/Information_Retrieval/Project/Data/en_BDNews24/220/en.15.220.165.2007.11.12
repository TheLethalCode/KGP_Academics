Tim Cahill scored with a brilliant overhead kick in the 89th minute to leave goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, standing in for the injured Petr Cech, with no chance. Didier Drogba, who has now scored in his last four league matches against Everton, had put Chelsea in front in the 70th minute when he nodded in at the near post off a corner by Ivory Coast compatriot and substitute Salomon Kalou. "It's frustrating, especially as we played very well and created a lot of chances. They had one chance and they scored," said Chelsea manager Avram Grant.

Chelsea, who had won their four previous Premier League matches, remain unbeaten at home in 69 league matches while Everton, in ninth place, added to their run of five wins in a row with a deserved point.
