<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks slid on Wednesday as General Motors Corp's biggest ever quarterly loss, oil prices near $100 a barrel and a slide in the the dollar combined to fan worries about corporate profits and inflation. Shares of GM, the largest US automaker, were the biggest decliners on the Dow, falling more than 3 percent. With investors still nervous about prospects for more loan losses at major financial institutions, shares of banks and brokerages, including Morgan Stanley, also declined. U.S. crude for December edged up 90 cents to $97.56 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before weekly US government data expected to show a drop in crude supplies. The report is due at 10:30 a.m. (1530 GMT). As higher energy costs threatened to squeeze consumers, investors unloaded shares of major retailers and some manufacturers, such as 3M Co, whose stock declined 1.3 percent. "There are three concerns. Firstly, it's the price of energy, which seems to be out of control. Secondly, it's what the heck is going on in the financials in terms of who's got what portfolio, valued at what, where and when," said Cummins Catherwood, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood in Philadelphia. "The third thing -- there's a great developing concern about inflation. All of these commodities are getting ridiculous. It's like Halloween, you don't know where the next boogeyman is coming from," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 123.96 points, or 0.91 percent, at 13,536.98. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 14.97 points, or 0.98 percent, at 1,505.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 25.35 points, or 0.90 percent, at 2,799.83. GM shares fell to $35.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of 3M slipped 1.2 percent to $84.42. Shares of Morgan Stanley were down 3 percent to $52.78, while those of American Express slumped 2 percent to $57.42. General Electric, considered an economic bellwether, weighed on the S&P 500, falling 1.02 percent to $39.
