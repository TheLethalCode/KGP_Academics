 MOHALI, India, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian cricket selectors retained their 15-player squad on Thursday for the third and fourth one-dayers against Pakistan. The decision meant there would be no immediate return for former skipper Rahul Dravid after he was dropped for the first two matches. Pakistan won the second game in the five-match series by four wickets on Thursday to level the series 1-1. The third game will be played in Kanpur on Sunday. Squad: Mahendra Dhoni (captain), Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik, Zaheer Khan, RP Singh, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Praveen Kumar
