<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - The benchmark DGEN on the Dhaka Stock Exchange reached a record-breaking high Thursday, spurred by a rally especially in the financial, power and cement sectors. Overall financial stocks, which constitute over 50 percent of bourses' market capitalisation, rallied following the central bank's June 2009 deadline for banks to raise their capital to a minimum of Tk 2.0 billion. "Investor expectations about the increase of paid-up capital of other financial institutions resulted in the overall rally in the financial sector," said Manira Khan, an analyst at Equity Partners. The market rallied from the beginning to the end due to a strong buying pull, especially in the financial sector. The DGEN added 54.45 points or 1.88 percent to hit 2940.14, up from the previous highest ever mark of 2901.99 points on October 25. The DSI or all-share price index gained 42.72 points or 1.74 percent to 2494.01. The DSE-20 blue-chip index closed at 2252.21, up 27.58 points or 1.23 percent. "It appears that investors are giving more weight to technical analysis rather than fundamental analysis. But I am worried about small investors," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. "What I see is that some have already realised gains and are reinvesting them in a cyclic order especially in some selected issues still remaining low priced," he said. Turnover on the bourse rose to Tk 2.49 billion from trading of 1,20,65,477 shares with 133 issues closing up, 60 down and 21 steady. "It has surpassed the previous day's corrections," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh that recorded the highest percentage of total market turnover added 1.78 percent to Tk 640.75. "There was no irrationality in the market behaviour. But it is still overheated although there had been a correction in the previous days," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. Summit Power edged up 3.91 percent to Tk 1573. DESCO also gained reporting a rise in its earnings. BRAC Bank, the second most active issue, grew 1.43 percent to Tk 1516.75. An end session profit taking drove Trust Bank 0.13 percent lower to Tk 1096 but Social Investment Bank, Al-Arafa Bank, One Bank, Standard Bank and Jamuna Bank put additional pace to the rally on capital increase speculation. Market major Lafarge Surma Cement surged 8.35 percent to Tk 434.50 on speculation that the problem about importing limestone from India would be solved as the hearing of its appeal on limestone mining in Meghalaya in the Indian Supreme Court is set for November 16. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied led by cement, energy, bank and financial sectors. A total of 83 scrips advanced, 27 declined and eight remained unchanged with turnover standing at Tk 413.10 million from the transactions of 28,49,605 shares. bd
