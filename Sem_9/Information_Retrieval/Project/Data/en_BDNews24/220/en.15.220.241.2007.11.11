<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Dale Steyn completed a 10-wicket haul to seal South Africa's record win in the first test against New Zealand on Sunday. Steyn, who took five for 34 in the first innings, claimed five for 59 to finish with match figures of 10 for 93 as South Africa wrapped up victory by 358 runs with more than a day to spare. New Zealand, who needed 531 to win, were dismissed for 172 after lunch on the fourth day. The result marked New Zealand's heaviest defeat, surpassing the 299 runs Pakistan beat them by in Auckland in 2001. The visitors resumed on 57 for three and they lost their fourth wicket to the ninth ball of the day when Steyn had Scott Styris caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for 16. Steyn struck again eight overs later when Brendon McCullum, who scored 26, flapped at a delivery outside his off-stump and was caught by Herschelle Gibbs. New Zealand slipped to 109 for six when Michael Papps edged a delivery from fast bowler Jacques Kallis and was caught by AB de Villiers at third slip for five. Jacob Oram, who batted with a runner because of a hamstring injury, scored a doughty 40 before driving a delivery from left-arm spinner Paul Harris into the hands of Andre Nel at long-on. Steyn ripped through the tail by having Iain O'Brien caught by Hashim Amla at short leg for a duck and bowling Chris Martin for nought to end the match nine overs after lunch. Shane Bond did not bat in the second innings because of the torn abdominal muscle that has ruled him out of the rest of the tour
