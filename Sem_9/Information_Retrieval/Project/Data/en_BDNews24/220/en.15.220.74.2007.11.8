 Dhaka, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court dealing with a tax fraud case Thursday set Nov 18 for the verdict against Tanvir Ahmed, son of ex-BNP MP Salauddin Ahmed. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Judges' Court-5 set the date after the trial proceedings ended. On Oct 1, tax commissioner Md Moniruzzaman of the National Board of Revenue filed the case against Tanvir, son of the ex-lawmaker of Dhaka-4 constituency. The Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge court later issued an arrest warrant against him and sent the case to the special judge's court for trial. The special judge's court accepted the charges on Oct 25 and began the deposition on Oct 31 against Tanvir. According to case details, Tanvir allegedly suppressed Tk 30 lakh in his income tax returns in two tax years. He also did not submit any tax returns in 2006-07.
