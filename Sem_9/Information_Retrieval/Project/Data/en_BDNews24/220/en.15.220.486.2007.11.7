 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com) - Pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak have been given a rest for the next round of the ongoing Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League (NCL). The fourth round of the NCL starts Friday and Khulna will miss both Mashrafee and Razzak when they host table toppers Rajshahi at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. "This is a precautionary measure so that they (Mashrafee and Razzak) don't get injured," Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) spokesmen Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Boby told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "They are both key players in the national squad and we don't want to take risks ahead of Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand in December," said Boby, adding that the two cricketers would play for the Khulna team in the fifth round.
