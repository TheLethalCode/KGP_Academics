<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Deposed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has denounced the recent remarks of Bangabandhu murder convict Khandaker Abdur Rashid about late president Ziaur Rahman as motivated. In a statement released Friday, he said: "Retired colonel Abdur Rashid in an earlier interview with reputed journalist Anthony Mascarenhas said Ziaur Rahman was opposed to joining a plot to overthrow the government." "Rashid is now trying to misguide people with contradictory speech. People believe that his remarks were part of an attempt to stain the name of Ziaur Rahman." Delwar, who was appointed secretary general by detained party chief Khaleda Zia, also questioned the motives of private television station Channel i in broadcasting the interview with Rashid, the dismissed lieutenant colonel. "It wanted to make Zia controversial by broadcasting the interview on Nov 7, National Revolution and Solidarity Day." He asked Channel i to publicly apologise for broadcasting the interview. BNP acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed signed the statement released to the media. bdnews24
