 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond has been ruled out of the rest of the tour after tearing an abdominal muscle on the third day of the first test against South Africa on Saturday.

"It's hard to picture a win at this stage but I think the guys who have yet to bat have everything to play for." South Africa's Jacques Kallis became the eighth player to score 9,000 test runs when he made 186.
