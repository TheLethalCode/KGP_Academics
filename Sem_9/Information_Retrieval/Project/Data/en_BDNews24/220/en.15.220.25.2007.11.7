 LONDON, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea would reject an invitation to join an expanded G14 group representing some of Europe's top clubs, the Premier League side's chief executive Peter Kenyon said on Wednesday. "I think European football has changed a lot since the formation of G14," the Chelsea Web site (www.chelseafc.com) quoted him as saying at the International Football Arena conference in Zurich. "Then there was no real dialogue between the clubs and (European governing body) UEFA, now the situation is different. There are a lot of major issues to discuss, and find a resolution to, with UEFA. "Our position is that the clubs would best be served by a new independent club body working together with UEFA within the framework that has already been set up in co-operation with them," added Kenyon. "So if we were to be officially invited to join an expanded G14 I think we would politely decline." The G14 said in September that it would expand from 18 to around 50 members by the end of the year to try to resolve differences with soccer's governing bodies over issues such as the calendar and release of players for international duty. The group includes powerful clubs such as Manchester United, Real Madrid and AC Milan
