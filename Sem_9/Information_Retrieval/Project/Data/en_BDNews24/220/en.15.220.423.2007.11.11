<TITLE> Kate Moss thought I was a plumber: top UK politician </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British opposition leader David Cameron has told how supermodel Kate Moss asked for his phone number after mistaking him for a plumber. Cameron said he was introduced to Moss at a charity dinner after floods hit Britain this year. The Conservative Party leader said he could not think of anything to say and so lamented the downpours that had affected his central England constituency where she has a home. "So I went on like this, twittering on, and she turned around and said: 'God, you sound like a really useful guy, can I have your phone number?' "I went back to my table and said 'The good news is, I met Kate Moss and she wanted my telephone number'," Cameron told chat show host Michael Parkinson on ITV television on Friday. "The bad news is I think she thinks I'm something to do with drainage."
