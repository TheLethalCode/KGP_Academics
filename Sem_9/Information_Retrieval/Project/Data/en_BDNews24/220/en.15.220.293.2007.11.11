 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Sunday approved in principle the Consumer Rights Protection Ordinance 2007, a spokesman said. "The draft ordinance will again be placed at a cabinet meeting in two months' time after a review by the law ministry," Syed Fahim Munaim, the chief adviser's press secretary, told reporters. The draft ordinance was approved at a cabinet meeting, chaired by Fakhruddin Ahmed at the Chief Adviser's Office. The proposed ordinance mentioned up to 19 crimes, including illegal hoarding and sales of adulterated foods. The ordinance proposed that the guilty would be sentenced to a jail term running from one year to a maximum of three years or be fined up to Tk 2 lakh or both. The ordinance also proposed a separate department and mobile courts to deal with the cases. Consumer rights activists have long been demanding the enactment of such a law on consumers' rights but the initiative did not get through. The government first started drafting the law in 1994 but the related ministries dithered, hindering its progress. The detailed draft of the Act was first made in 2004 and the draft of the Consumer Rights Protection Act 2004 was approved in principle by the cabinet on August 9, 2004 and sent to the law ministry for scrutiny. In 2006, the proposed law was revised again but was not enacted. bdnews2
