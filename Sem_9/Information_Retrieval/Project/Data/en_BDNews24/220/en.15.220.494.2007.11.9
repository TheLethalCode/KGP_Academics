 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Hindus in Bangladesh celebrate their four-day major religious festival, the Shyama Puja or Kaali Puja starting Friday. The first day of the festivities kicks off with the Dipannwita Parban (Festival of Lights) rites with solemnity and enthusiasm. Saturday, the second day, will be marked by the rituals Annakoot, Mahatsav and distribution of offerings dedicated to the deity Kaali. The third day, Sunday, will be celebrated by observing Bhrattreedwitiya or Bhai Phonta and dance dedication competition. The devotees will observe the final day parading with Goddess Kaali's idol and concluding the rites by immersing the icons in the running waters of rivers. In Dhaka, the major Puja Mandaps are at the Dhakeshwari National Temple, RamSita temple, Banagram Radha Govinda Jiu Thhakur Temple, Ramna Kaali Temple, Thhatari Bazaar Shiva Temple and Sutrapur Bihari Lalji Temple. Besides, devotees were reportedly assembling at other localities such as Shankhari Bazar, Tanti Bazaar, Luxmi Bazaar, Panni Tola, Postagola and Lalbagh burning ghats to observe the festival rites. The Hindu faith teaches that the Goddess Shyama (Kaali) visits the Earth on this day to punish the evil and nurture the goodness in creatures. The Goddess Kaali is celebrated as the symbol of struggle for establishing peace, solidarity and cordiality. Arun Sarkar, the general secretary of the 500-year-old Radha Govinda Jiu Thhakur Temple in Old Dhaka, said quoting the almanac that Mother Shyama will arrive this year on the Earth as the benevolent mother. "Shyma puja is a festival of lights symbolising the victory of justice and fair play, dispelling the dark palls of the after world. The festival is observed to laud the victory of the right against the wrong and the glory of light," he said. Sadhan Chakravarti, Dhaka University's Jagannath Hall priest said, "The devotees will offer prayers to the goddess for the welfare of all earthly creatures. "Simultaneously, they will light lamps in each of their houses praying for the salvation of their departed dear and near ones." bdnews24
