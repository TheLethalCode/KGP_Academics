 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party chairman retired colonel Oli Ahmed Wednesday demanded that the government make a list of the collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces during the War of Liberation and try them. The LDP president made the demand at a party meeting in Moghbazar to mark National Revolution and Solidarity Day. "We want the present government to make a list of collaborators immediately, as the previous government made a list of freedom fighters," the LDP boss said. "The government should form a council to do this. Collaborators must be tried," Oli said. "However, the government should be careful so that democracy is not undermined," he added. "Basing on the comments I hear, I doubt whether elections will take place on time [October, 2008]," he said. The retired colonel said: "I hope the army chief keeps his promise." Professor Jahanara Begum, Alamgir Kabir and Didar Bakht delivered speeches at the function. bdnews24.co
