 NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh's appeal against a three-test ban for alleged racial abuse will be heard over two days from Jan 29, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday. New Zealand judge John Hansen, the appeals commissioner, will hear the appeal in Adelaide after the fourth and final test against Australia, an ICC release said. The Indian and Australian boards had requested the hearing should be held in between the tests and a Twenty20 game on Feb 1 followed by a ODI tri-series also involving Sri Lanka. ICC match referee Mike Procter found Harbhajan guilty of calling Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds a monkey during the acrimonious second test in Sydney last week following a complaint by Australia skipper Ricky Ponting. India threatened to pull out of the tour if the racial slur stuck as the squad members rallied around the player, denying the charge. Tensions ran high between the teams after the Sydney test was marred by poor umpiring. Australia won the match to take a 2-0 lead in the series. The ICC caved in by dropping umpire Steve Bucknor, blamed for some of the decisions, for the third test starting in Perth on Wednesday before the Indian board withdrew their pullout threat. On Monday, India dropped a counter-charge against Australian spinner Brad Hogg for allegedly abusing skipper Anil Kumble and Mahendra Dhoni in Sydney in a bid to further ease tension. The Indian board has vowed to clear Harbhajan's name. "We would have preferred the appeal to be held earlier but it was not possible," ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. "Both CA (Cricket Australia) and the BCCI (the Indian board) have requested the hearing to be held after the Test series for logistical reasons and, following due consideration, Justice Hansen agreed. "The reality is that it is likely to go into a second day as lawyers will be involved so we needed to have two clear days to assign to it." The ICC Code of Conduct rules stipulate the hearing should be held within a week of the commissioner being appointed, but there is provision for a delay if required. Harbhajan was banned after being found guilty under Level 3 of the ICC Code of Conduct which refers to players or team officials "using language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that person's race, religion, gender, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin". The appeals commissioner has the power to modify the earlier decision and his ruling will be final and binding. Harbhajan has been cleared to play pending his appeal
