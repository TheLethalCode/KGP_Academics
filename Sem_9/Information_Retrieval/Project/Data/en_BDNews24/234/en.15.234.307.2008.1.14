<TITLE> India's batsmen braced for test of courage at the WACA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's batsmen are braced for a brutal examination of their courage in the third test against Australia at the WACA starting on Wednesday. The WACA is widely regarded as the fastest and bounciest pitch in the world and the tourists are expecting a barrage of short-pitched balls from Australia's pace attack. Adding to their trepidation is the fact India have not played a test at the WACA since 1992. But coach Gary Kirsten has told them they have nothing to fear if they approach it in the right manner. "It's very important you focus on the good stuff and the positive," Kirsten told a news conference on Monday. "If you get all beaten up about it, it can affect you. There's plenty of experience in this team and they know how to play and what they need to do." Kirsten said the WACA's notorious reputation as a dangerous pitch was a myth and the wicket was actually great to bat on because the extra pace made quick scoring easier. "The Australians always argue this is the best place to bat on and they get very excited about playing cricket here and one needs to embrace the challenge in that fashion," he said. "You're not coming here to lose the test match, you're coming here to give everything you've got and play with lots of courage. PLEASANTLY SURPRISED "When I played here for the first time I was pleasantly surprised that if you got in, it was the most magnificent place to bat because there was pace on the wicket and you don't have to hit the ball too hard." Sachin Tendulkar is the only member of the side who played in India's last test at the WACA in 1992 but most of his team mates appeared in a one-day international there in 2004. On that occasion, India's top-order failed to cope with the pitch and the tourists lost the game. Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said memories of that game had given his side a psychological edge. "I guess it's the pace and the bounce that can shock you a little bit," he said. "It's world-renowned this wicket. "A number of these players played a one-day international here a few years ago and that had plenty of fire and bounce in it. We'll be hoping to open up any little scars or wounds they may have from that day because we bowled them out pretty comprehensively." The Australians used three fast bowlers when winning the first two matches of the series but may include Shaun Tait in a four-man pace attack this week. Tait is arguably the fastest bowler in the world and is desperate to get back into the test side after making a big impression in the one-day squad. "If he did play he'd be a really useful weapon. He feels comfortable bowling in these conditions and he looks fit and he's striving to make an impact at test level," Gilchrist said
