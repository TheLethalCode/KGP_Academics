 BRUSSELS, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soccer's authorities and Europe's top clubs look to have finally buried the hatchet with a deal on Tuesday paving the way for the G14 to disband and an end to any more costly court cases. But the landmark deal reached between soccer's world governing body FIFA and G14, representing 18 of Europe's most powerful clubs, is unlikely to eradicate the thorny issues that lay at the heart of the problem -- money and power. G14 were in search of three wishes: - compensation for players injured on international duty - a portion of the revenue from soccer's showcase finals such as the World Cup and European Championship in return for the use of their players - a greater say in the running of the sport, such as the planning of the international calendar and whether to release players for non-competitive matches. FIFA, and in particular its president Sepp Blatter, refused to acknowledge G14 and vehemently dismissed its claims, forcing the Brussels-based group to take court action over compensation for players injured while playing for their country. To date, G14 has court cases pending alongside three clubs. The first case involving Belgian first division club Charleroi has been referred to the European Court of Justice -- Europe's highest court, while Olympique Lyon of France and Spain's Atletico Madrid have similar cases awaiting judgement in their domestic courts. Alongside these court actions, the growth of the game in terms of popularity and financial rewards -- notably the UEFA Champions League -- pushed the struggle for money and power to new levels. Although denied by G14, there was talk of Europe's top clubs going it alone. The players' union FIFPRO sought to defend its position and more significantly the continent's top leagues decided it was time for them to also talk as one voice. LUCRATIVE PIE The sport became fragmented with all side's grasping for their piece of a very lucrative pie. At the same time it was battling against match-fixing scandals, increased crowd violence and what it perceived as interference by Europe's politicians. Something had to give and it did. After 16 years at the helm, Lennart Johansson gave way to former French international Michel Platini as president of European soccer's governing body UEFA. Platini set his stall out early -- reform of the money-spinning Champions League, help solve the game's problems by engaging the help of Europe's politicians and most importantly bring an end to the row with G14. Tuesday's deal was the icing on a perfect first year in charge for Platini who has now all but achieved what he set out to do during his whole four-year tenure. Platini heralded a new era of democracy and inclusiveness for the clubs, leagues and players, while at the same time being able to use his influence at FIFA to successfully walk the tight rope between Blatter and himself. The deal looks set to end the divisions between the clubs and their governors for now, but Blatter may not be so willing to continue to follow the lead of his lieutenant Platini on future issues. Blatter once declared war on G14 and both Platini and Europe's elite clubs will claim to have won that war in light of Tuesday's agreement. But history is more likely to show that this deal is merely a truce in the continuous battle for control of the beautiful game
