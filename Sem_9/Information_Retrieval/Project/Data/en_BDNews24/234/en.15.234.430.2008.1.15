 BUENOS AIRES, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina have named Sergio Batista, a midfielder in their victorious 1986 World Cup team, as coach of their Olympic side for this year's Games in Beijing. "It will be Sergio Batista," Argentina Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona told Radio La Red in an interview. "We intend to send the strongest possible team but we have to see how things work out." Batista is currently coach of Argentina's Under-20 team. Grondona added that Alfio Basile, coach of the senior side, would be concentrating on the World Cup qualifiers.

Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme has already said that he would like to play in Beijing
