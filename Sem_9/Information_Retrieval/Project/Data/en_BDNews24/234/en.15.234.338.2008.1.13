 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies opening batsman Brenton Parchment has been fined 50 percent of his match fee for deliberately running into South African bowler Dale Steyn during the third test, officials said. Parchment, playing in his first test, was found guilty of "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact" at a hearing after the match, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a statement on Saturday. Roshan Mahanama of the elite panel of ICC match referees concluded that in the eighth over of West Indies' second innings on Friday Parchment intentionally ran into Steyn, the statement said. The 25-year-old Jamaican had denied the offence. South Africa won the test with two days to spare on Saturday, wrapping up a 2-1 series win
