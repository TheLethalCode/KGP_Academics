 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Small and medium businesses in Bangladesh spent nearly $380 million, around Tk 2,600 crore, on IT and telecom solutions in 2007, according to Access Markets International Partners (AMI) in its latest study. New York-based organisation also predicts that small businesses will continue to be the major contributor to this spending in the future. "SMBs in Bangladesh may have started off a bit slower than their counterparts in the Indian subcontinent in terms of overall IT adoption," said Dev Chakravarty, senior analyst at AMI Partners. "However, SMBs IT adoption is set to take off more rapidly in the near future. That's because SMBs in Bangladesh are becoming more aware of the advantages of IT in increasing business process efficiencies and enabling them to move up the growth ladder," he said. According to AMI Partners, companies of between 100 to 999 employees are considered medium businesses, while companies with up to 99 employees are termed small businesses. The study forecasts spending on computing and the internet will dominate the IT spending pattern among SMBs, as they move to build a robust IT infrastructure. However, medium businesses will spend a greater proportion on networking compared to small ones, as MBs are keen to enhance their focus on connectivity technologies, said the study. According to AMI Partners, SMBs typically go through three distinctive phases of IT deployment  from building infrastructure solutions, to deploying connectivity solutions and ultimately enterprise solutions. These advances extend business' reach with remote locations, customers and business partners. "Most of Bangladesh's SMBs are still in the first wave of technology adoption, or building the basic infrastructure, and are yet to progress to the second wave, connecting the enterprise, as is evident from their technology penetrations," the study continued. They have already reached substantially high usage levels in technologies like desktops, printers, basic productivity software applications, antivirus and to some extent, even Internet, it said. However, they still have a long way to go in terms of adoption of technologies like basic networking, high-speed access, websites and e-commerce. Medium businesses are much better performers, with complete PC saturation and substantially higher IT adoption. MBs comprise above 20 percent of the SMB ICT expenditure in spite of contributing just 5 percent towards the overall SMB universe by volume. "Only around one-in-ten SMBs in Bangladesh have adopted computers at present," says Chakravarty, who added: "Nevertheless, this is more as an opportunity rather than a shortcoming." "PC vendors can focus on this huge, relatively untapped, SMB market in the country to gain significant returns. PC-adoption plans are quite positive," said Chakravarty. About 30 percent of PC-owning SMBs indicated that they intend to purchase new PCs in the next 12 months. A sizeable proportion of first-time PC buyers are also likely to join in, thus boosting the overall SMB-PC market, the study revealed. Currently, multi-national company vendors like Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Dell dominate the Bangladesh PC market. However, they are facing increasing competition by local PC manufacturers such as Daffodil and Flora, which are also performing well. The assembled, or whitebox market, has a huge share within SMBs. More than 50 percent of SMBs own assembled PCs, although adoption of branded PCs is also on the rise. AMI Partners specialises in IT, Internet, telecommunications and business services strategy as well as venture capital and actionable market intelligence. They also have a strong focus on global SMB enterprises. AMI's 2007 Bangladesh Small Business Overview and Comprehensive Market Opportunity Assessment and 2007 Bangladesh Medium Business Overview and Comprehensive Market Opportunity Assessment studies have highlighted the major trends in the context of current and planned IT, Internet and communications usage and spending. bd
