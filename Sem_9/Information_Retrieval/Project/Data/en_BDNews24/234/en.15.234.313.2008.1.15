<TITLE> Bahraini royals in rare public clash over reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANAMA, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Splits between state bodies headed by different members of Bahrain's royal family have forced the Gulf island's king to step in with a public warning not to allow squabbles to delay economic reforms. Bahrain is on a drive to restructure state firms ahead of planned privatisation and overhaul the labour market to give more jobs to Bahrainis over foreigners who make up about a third of the kingdom's population. In a rare public display of royal disharmony, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa warned the government headed by his uncle, the prime minister, not to delay reform efforts led by his son, the crown prince. The king was responding to a letter from his son, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, complaining of a lack of cooperation from the government with the Economic Development Board (EDB) he runs. "There is no echo (of EDB efforts) from some government officials which has led to great difficulties in economic development projects," the crown prince said in a letter issued late on Monday and published in Bahraini newspapers on Tuesday. "It is obligatory for government bodies to overcome delays and slow implementation," a response from the king, also published in newspapers, read. "Whoever is deficient in performance ... may be affected negatively in their standing in the formation of the government," the king warned, without naming any ministries. Bahrain's royal court confirmed the letters in the newspapers were genuine, but declined to give Reuters a copy. REFORM SPLITS A statement carried by Bahrain's state news agency said the prime minister -- for more than 35 years Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa -- had ordered ministers to identify and find solutions to any delays in programmes set up with the EDB. It was unclear what triggered the exchange, but analysts pointed to a difference in vision for Bahrain's economic future between the crown prince and the prime minister. "The crown prince wants to speed up economic reforms but the prime minister is slower, and wants to ensure the business community is not displeased," MP and parliamentary finance and economic committee member Jasim Ali said. The crown prince had earlier proposed businesses should be charged a fee to employ foreigners to encourage employment of Bahrainis and raise revenues for their training. About a third of the kingdom's population of 743,000 are foreign workers. The prime minister reduced the fees and delayed the proposal's implementation, Ali said, adding that the move was likely to be key to the crown prince's frustration in his letter.
