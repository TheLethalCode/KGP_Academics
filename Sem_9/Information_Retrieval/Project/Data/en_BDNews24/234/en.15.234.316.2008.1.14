 Amsterdam, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutch troops forming part of the NATO-led force in Afghanistan probably killed two of their own soldiers while fighting Taliban insurgents, the Dutch Defence Ministry said on Sunday. The two soldiers were killed on Saturday near the southern Afghan town of Deh Rawod as Dutch units approached Taliban forces from two sides amid heavy firing, a Defence Ministry spokesman said. "It was a big problem that the Taliban crossed through the Dutch units which created an unclear situation, adding to low visibility and lack of air support," the spokesman said. It was "very likely" that the two Dutch soldiers, aged 20 and 22, were killed by fire from their compatriots, and an investigation had been launched to find out what had happened, he said. In the same area on Saturday, Dutch troops killed two allied Afghan soldiers when the Afghans, who were not in army uniforms, approached and acted strangely, the spokesman said. The Dutch soldiers were also under fire and were treating a colleague whose legs later had to be amputated, the spokesman said. The deaths bring the total number of Dutch soldiers who died in Afghanistan to 14, including one suicide. Deh Rawod is seen as a stronghold of support for the Taliban Islamist insurgents, and Dutch and Afghan forces are undertaking an operation to see if it is safe enough for refugees to return to the region, the spokesman said. More than 1,600 Dutch soldiers are serving in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led force.
