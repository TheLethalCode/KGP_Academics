<TEXT>
 Wellington, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  New Zealand wrapped up their two-test series against Bangladesh when they bowled the visitors out for 113 just before lunch on the third day of the second test at the Basin Reserve on Monday. New Zealand won the match by an innings and 137 runs, and wrapped up the test inside for three days for the second time. They won the first test in Dunedin by nine wickets. All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was dropped by Matthew Bell in the slips early in the day top-scored for the visitors with a defiant 41 not out. Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal did not bat in the second innings after he broke his thumb while fielding on Sunday. Resuming on 51 for five and with little hope of saving the test, Bangladesh lost batting mainstay Habibul Bashar in the first over of the day when he only made a half stride forward and was trapped in front by Chris Martin for 25. Shahadat Hossain was the next to fall when he poked his bat at a swinging delivery from Iain O'Brien before Sajidul Islam was run out for three after a mix-up with Shakib. Shakib and Mushrafe Mortaza then combined for the most productive partnership of the Bangladesh innings by adding 30 runs for the ninth wicket before Mortaza was the last wicket to fall when he was caught by Kyle Mills off Jacob Oram for six. All four of New Zealand's front line pace bowlers took two wickets each with Chris Martin, who took five in the first innings, named man of the match.
