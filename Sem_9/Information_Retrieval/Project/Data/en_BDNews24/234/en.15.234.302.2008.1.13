 Amsterdam, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Dutch soldiers have been killed fighting insurgents in Afghanistan as part of the international force there, the Dutch chief of staff said on Sunday. The soldiers were killed in separate incidents on Saturday in the Deh Rawod area of southern Afghanistan and two Afghan soldiers also died in the fighting, Defence Chief of Staff Dick Berlijn said in a statement. The deaths bring the total number of Dutch soldiers killed in Afghanistan to 14, according to information on the Defence Ministry's Web site. Deh Rawod is seen as a stronghold of support for the Taliban Islamist insurgents. Dutch and Afghan forces are undertaking an operation to look at the possibility of refugees returning to the Deh Rawod area, Berlijn said. Several hundred Dutch and Afghan forces are involved in this operation, he said. More than 1,600 Dutch soldiers are serving in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led force
