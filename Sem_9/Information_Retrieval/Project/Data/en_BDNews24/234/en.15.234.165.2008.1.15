 LONDON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian plans to impose visa restrictions on staff working for the British government's cultural arm can only worsen a diplomatic row between London and Moscow, Britain said on Tuesday. Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that in addition to planned tax measures and immigration restrictions against British Council regional offices, Russia had said it may take further action against the British Council in Moscow, including visa restrictions against British diplomatic staff. "Such threats can only make matters worse. It is not in the interests of either the UK or Russia for flourishing cultural, educational and scientific links to be held hostage to unrelated issues in this way," he said in a statement. Relations between London and Moscow -- soured by spying charges, the murder of a Russian emigre and differences over Kosovo -- are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Russia imposed visa restrictions on staff working for the British Council in two regions on Monday, punishing London for defying a Kremlin order to halt work there. Russia says the legal status of the two regional Council offices is not in line with Russian law. Miliband said the British Council's activities across Russia fully complied with both Russian and international law. He has called the Kremlin order illegal. "The government will consider these latest actions by Russia carefully and will continue to engage with our international partners on them. We will respond to the Russian government shortly," Miliband said. LITVINENKO DISPUTE Moscow told the Council to suspend operations at its offices in two Russian cities from Jan. 1 in a move both sides linked to a festering dispute over the murder in London of Alexander Litvinenko, a Kremlin critic.

Russia's Foreign Ministry called in British ambassador Tony Brenton and later called the Council's actions "an intentional provocation aimed at inflaming tensions in Russian-British relations." Russia said it would not issue visas to new employees sent to work in the British consular offices of St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg to carry out British Council work. It also said Russian authorities would take steps to recover tax arrears it says are owed by the Council's office in St Petersburg. Britain denies tax is owed. The Council promotes British culture abroad and arranges educational exchanges. But it has found itself at the centre of a dispute between London and Moscow that erupted in 2006, when Litvinenko died in a London hospital from radiation poisoning. Britain named former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoy as its suspect in the murder and expelled four Russian diplomats in July last year after Moscow refused to extradite him. Russia, which says the constitution prevents it extraditing Lugovoy, hit back by expelling four British diplomats. Lugovoy himself has denied gui
