"I hope the political parties will better use the situation to make them democratic and corruption-free," the head of the government said. Reaffirming his administration's commitment to a free and fair election, he said that there was "no room for doubt" about the holding of Jatiya Sangsad elections by December 2008. "If possible, we are determined to hold the elections" well ahead of the December-deadline, he said. He said the soaring prices of daily commodities during his first year in office created an "unbearable situation" for citizens, particularly for the limited-income group. He admitted that the prices went beyond control. "The prices of rice, oil, wheat and some other daily commodities have increased, creating an unbearable condition for the citizens in general and the limited-income people in particular," Fakhruddin said. He described various measures by his administration to arrest the situation. He said 2008 would be the most important year in the country's history as "we will reach real democracy following the announced roadmap for the elections reflecting the aspirations of the people and the government". "As per our pledge after the completion of the Election Commission's talks with the political parties the reform of the election laws and rules will be finalised." The chief adviser said though Bangladesh is a young country it boasts glorious civilisation and heritage. "This kind of spontaneous elevation is rare in world history. But we are going to do that, because we believe there is no alternative to democracy." Fakhruddin went to speak of the government's anticorruption drive: "After assuming office we signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The signing of the convention will brighten the image of Bangladesh in the international arena." "Besides trial of the corruption suspects we have been formulating a mid-term strategy paper for checking corruption." The chief adviser also mentioned that after 36 years of independence the government has following the guidance of the constitution by separating the judiciary from the executive branch in November last year. He said it would be considered a milestone in the history of Bangladesh in establishing rule of law. "Though the political parties of the country always pledged separation of the judiciary in their manifestoes, after coming to power they did not keep their word," he added. The chief adviser said that the patriotic assistance the armed forces were rendering to the civil administration in running the country and facing disasters deserved special mention. "At present they are giving significant assistance in checking serious crime, terrorism and corruption and in relief and rehabilitation of the flood and cyclone survivors." "They are also playing important role in preparing a voter list with photographs," he added.

He also said the government has taken significant steps to strengthen the institutional structure of the Anticorruption Commission through restructuring.
