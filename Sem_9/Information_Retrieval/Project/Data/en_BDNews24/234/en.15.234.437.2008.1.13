<TITLE> EC will press on with redefining constituencies: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will redefine constituencies before the next polls despite reservations by the big political parties, election commissioner Sohul Hossain said Sunday. "The constitution vests the responsibility of redefining the constituencies upon the Election Commission," said Sohul while briefing reporters in his office. "We'll rethink about the issue only if all the political parties object to our accomplishing this mandatory task." "To convince the sceptics, we'd like to assure them that we'll be able to perform the task very well using the GIS (Geographical Information system) and 2001 census reports. "We must realise this constitutional obligation as the seat-based representation in the parliament must be proportional to the ever-increasing population." He said to a question that implementation of the electoral roadmap would not lag behind when hundreds of litigations were likely to be filed over the fresh electoral district demarcation. "Not a chance. We'll face the cases once they're filed. And, the courts are not lazily awaiting such events only." After a long span of 23 years since 1984, the EC has undertaken the task of redefining the 300 electoral districts. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said in a press conference Tuesday that the EC started the demarcation job in Dec 2007, which should run through to June 2008. The EC will obtain the opinions of the people's representatives and publish any differences in the form of 'gazettes' after the exercise is over, he said. The top election office had undertaken the task in 1991 and 1995, but the jobs were only partly done in the face of hundreds of litigations. bdnew
