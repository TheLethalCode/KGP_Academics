 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of Kimberly Garments on Rokeya Sarani in Mirpur took to the streets Sunday for pay hike and overtime payment but the protest ended after an agreement was reached. The workers went back to work around noon after authorities conceded to the demands following a meeting with the representatives of the workers and the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association. "The owners and workers have signed a deal. The workers have resumed work but for security reasons additional police have been deployed in the area," deputy police commissioner for Mirpur zone Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com. Workers of other garment factories in the area took to the streets Saturday and Jan 2 to press similar demands. Director of Kimberly Garments Sadikur Rahman said the salaries of the workers would be disbursed by the seventh day of every month, according to the agreement. The workers will receive full Eid bonuses and attendance bonuses and get leave in line with labour law as well. Agitated workers started demonstrating around 10am and vandalised several cars, causing traffic to grind to a stop on the busy road. Police deployed to ease the traffic jam clubbed and wounded some workers and passers-by at that time. Workers panicked on rumour that the police charged baton inside the factory as well. Ruby and Rekha were hurt when they tripped trying to hurry down the stairs on the seventh floor of the building that houses the factory. Police took them to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment. bdnews24.com/
