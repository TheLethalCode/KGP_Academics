<TITLE> Kenya shilling value hinges on solving vote impasse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A quick solution to Kenya's crisis -- which has already hit the key tourist sector -- is vital if the shilling currency is to avoid major long-term losses, commercial bank treasury officials say. International mediation efforts, including by the United States and the African Union, to resolve a bloody crisis caused by a disputed election on Dec. 27 have so far failed. "The key thing is how quick the crisis can be resolved. The longer it draws out, the more problematic I think it is for the currency," said Andrew Murugu, head of treasury at Stanbic Bank. "It all depends on which way things go in parliament and the direction the market starts getting from the politicians, because we haven't seen any so far." Parliament met in a stormy session on Tuesday for the first time since the elections with the opposition Orange Democratic Movement holding the highest number of seats. The opposition has vowed to block government work in parliament. Dealers said the market was watching for further action from the United States and the European Union, who have applied increasing pressure on President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga to come to a deal. On Monday the EU said it could cut aid if mediation failed. The shilling hit a nine-year high of 60.45/55 against the dollar in November but has weakened, mainly in the last two weeks, to close at 67.05/15 on Monday. The Kenyan shilling rose 15 percent against the dollar in the first 11 months of 2007 but has since fallen by 11 percent, hitting an eight-month low at its weakest point. The currency is on course for its largest monthly drop in January in over 10 years, losing 6 percent so far this month. It is one of the worst performing emerging market currencies this year, which has seen investors flocking to emerging currencies seen to be safer bets. Treasury officials forecast the shilling will trade in the 69-70 levels against the dollar in the first quarter, but to weaken further if the political stalemate persists. "If things don't work out within the quarter, we are likely to see the shilling trading above 70," said Caroline Mugadi, treasurer at Cooperative Bank. "There will be a lot of pressure on the local currency, because of statements from the U.S. and EU. There is panic buying and (dollar) inflows have dried up," said Andlip Mohamed, a senior dealer at I&M Bank. The east African economy has been in flux since the Dec. 27 election led to riots, looting and ethnic clashes in which over 600 people have died. For a few days at the year's start, foreign currency dealers stopped posting rates to keep the shilling from spiralling out of control, while the Nairobi Stock Exchange closed on one day because of clashes between police and demonstrators. Finance Minister Amos Kimunya says the economy lost about $1 billion because of the crisis. He expects it to recover the losses within the year, and forecast expansion at 7 percent similar to estimated growth in 2007. The Central bank kept its 8 percent growth forecast. But many analysts are sceptical and expect growth to slow sharply because of the crisis. HIGHEST FOREX EARNER HIT The tourism sector, Kenya's top foreign exchange earner, has been the hardest hit so far due to cancellations. The industry earned some $902 million last year, but now risks losing half that amount if first quarter high season bookings are dropped. Currency traders say they expect a slowdown in foreign investment until the political situation clears. "Any new investor may review the level, if at all they still want to invest here, and those who have already invested may be thinking of downgrading," said Mugadi. If the impasse persists, it will affect foreign activity on the stock and bond markets too. "Wherever there's foreign investor interest, be it an IPO, the bond markets or just the stock exchange, I am not totally convinced there would be a lot of interest now," Murugu said. The government plans to offer a 25 percent stake in the country's largest mobile phone service provider, Safaricom on the Kenyan bourse in the first quarter of the year. Safaricom's chief executive told Reuters in an interview on Monday that local demand for shares in the long-awaited IPO would be dampened, but foreign interest would not be hurt. Traders also expect inflation from rising international oil prices to hit the shilling. "We import lots of fuel and its price will affect the prices of other commodities in Kenya. I see inflation surely going up and that is definitely going to affect the level of the currency," Mugadi sa
