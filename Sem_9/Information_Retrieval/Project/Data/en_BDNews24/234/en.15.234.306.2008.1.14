<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security forces killed 23 tribal militants but lost seven of their own men in fighting after the tribesmen ambushed a paramilitary troop convoy in northwest Pakistan, an army officer said. Residents in Mohmand, a tribal agency bordering Afghanistan, said the army had opened up with artillery and helicopter gunships after the early morning attack on the convoy.. "The fighting broke out at 7:30 when militants attacked a paramilitary convoy," the officer said. The convoy was heading to Mohmand's main town of Ghalanai when it came under fire. There have been few reports of clashes in Mohmand previously, but militancy has been spreading through northwest Pakistan since mid-2007, after commandos stormed Islamabad's Red Mosque to crush a Taliban-style movement that had sprung up in the capital. Mohmand adjoins Bajaur, another border tribal region which is known to be a hotbed of support for groups allied to al Qaeda.
