 Bissau, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guinea-Bissau extradited five suspected members of al Qaeda to Mauritania on Saturday, a day after they were arrested in connection with the killing of four French tourists in Mauritania last month. "Guinea-Bissau will pay for what it has done," one of the five Mauritanians said as he was bundled into a plane by the security forces in Bissau. "Watch out! If I'd had a gun I would have killed you all," he shouted to the security officers, speaking in the local Creole language. On Dec. 24, three attackers, who Mauritanian officials said were suspected Islamic militants linked to al Qaeda, gunned down four French tourists and wounded a fifth as they enjoyed a Christmas Eve picnic on a road in southern Mauritania.
