<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid both made half-centuries to lead a determined Indian fightback on the opening day of the third test against Australia on Wednesday. The pair batted through the entire middle session in an unbroken third wicket partnership of 118 runs to steer the tourists out of trouble to 177 for two in their first innings by tea at the WACA. Tendulkar followed up his century in the last test in Sydney with a flawless 59, while Dravid continued his good recent form with 52 not out after surviving a dropped catch on 11. Australia had captured two wickets before lunch to put the brakes on India's promising start but were unable to find a way to remove Tendulkar or Dravid on a WACA pitch that failed to live up to its reputation as the world's fastest and bounciest deck. Mitchell Johnson dismissed Virender Sehwag for 29 and Brett Lee removed Wasim Jaffer for 16 after the two openers had given India their best start of the series with a 57-run stand. Both batsmen fell to regulation catches behind the stumps to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist just after the first drinks break. Sehwag, making his first test appearance in over a year, was first to go. The dashing righthander had played and missed several time but struck six boundaries before his luck ran out and he got a thick edge off leftarm paceman Johnson. Jaffer, who kept his place in the side despite failing to make a big score in the first two tests, adopted a more cautious approach, batting for over an hour and a half, striking two fours, before Lee found the edge. GOOD SPIRITS Dravid, back in his preferred batting position at number three after opening in the first two tests, was dropped at first slip early in his innings but steadily grew in confidence, driving Andrew Symonds through the covers for four to reach his half century off 95 balls. Tendulkar also brought up his fifty with a boundary, deliberately deflecting a short-pitched delivery from Shaun Tait over the slips cordon to the rope. The opening day was played in good spirits after both teams promised to be on their best behaviour after the ugly fallout to the last match in Sydney. Relations between the two teams slumped to an all-time low when the Indian cricket board threatened to cancel the rest of the tour after spinner Harbhajan Singh was found guilty of racially abusing Symonds. The Indians lodged a counter claim of abusive language against Brad Hogg but dropped the charge and the threats to abandon the tour after the International Cricket Council agreed to a range of compromises. Harbhajan was allowed to continue playing in the series until his appeal is heard after the final test while West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor was sacked for his performance in Sydney. Despite being cleared to play, Harbhajan and Hogg were both left out of their sides with both opting for an extra seamer
