<TITLE> SEC goes tough on Z category companies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has barred sponsors and directors of Z category companies on the bourses from selling, buying or handing over shares until further notice. However, institutions which have a regulatory body other than the SEC such as banks, insurers and financial institutions will not fall under the regulation, SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters Tuesday at his office. The SEC official said the decision stemmed from an earlier directive, issued on Aug 1, 2002. "The High Court stayed the decision on a writ petition on Jan 19, 2003. However, the court dismissed the writ petition on Dec 3, 2007," Farhad said. Under the directive, Z category companies will be given six months to remove themselves from the designation, or reconstitute their board of directors through an extraordinary general meeting. "After reconstituting the board, companies will have 24 months to get themselves out of the Z category. If they fail, they will be de-listed from the bourses," said Farhad. Regarding why banks, insurers and financial institutions are being exempted from the decision, the SEC official said: "These cases are not the same as other Z category companies." "Technical problems, mostly AGM related, led these companies to fall under this category," added Farhad. The SEC executive director said the market watchdog's initiative aimed to discipline the market, and bring Z category companies up to standards. A total of 100 companies have been designated as Z category on the bourses, including banks such as UCBL and Shahjalal Islami Bank. bdn
