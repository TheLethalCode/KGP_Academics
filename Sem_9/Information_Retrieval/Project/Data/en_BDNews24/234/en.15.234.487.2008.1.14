 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  At least 70 people were injured Monday when angry garments workers clashed with police in the Mirpur area of the capital. MBM Garments worker Shefali, who was injured by a police teargas shell, alleged: "Two of our colleagues have been killed and their bodies have been stashed away inside Opex Garments." "Police indiscriminately clubbed and hurled teargas shells at us when we went there to recover their bodies," claimed Shefali. The allegations of deaths could not be independently confirmed. Reporters were also caught up in the violence as garment factory employees in the Kachukhet area of Mirpur took to the streets, calling for full payment of their salaries and protesting the sacking of workers without notice. Several hundred workers from about 20 factories including MBM Garments and Opex Garments burst onto the streets at about 2pm. The incident resulted in several different factories being targeted by the workers as well as some cars being damaged. The road from Mirpur 10 roundabout to Kachukhet was closed for some time, leading to severe traffic jams in the area. Akram Hossain from Kafrul Police Station told bdnews24.com: "At around 3pm workers from MBM Garments took to the streets with their demands." "Later they urged employees from the nearby Opex Garments to join the agitation. However, the workers from Opex refused to join them, and the two sides clashed," said Hossain. A large number of riot police went to the scene at about 4.30pm in an attempt to disperse the garment workers with batons and teargas. The factory employees responded by hurling brickbats at the police. This latest unrest follows on from a demonstration by SQ Garments workers in Sheorapara on Jan 2. Workers from MBM Garments said they had been demanding an increase in their salaries, allowance and an improvement in the quality of their food for several days. The unrest spilled over following a breakdown in talks between workers representatives and factory owners. Deputy police commissioner Anwar Hossain for Mirpur zone, who participated in a meeting with the workers at 7.30pm told bdnews24.com: "Both sides signed a written agreement." "Four points were settled at a meeting with BGMEA on Sunday. The workers have accepted it. Another meeting will be held on the factory premises at 8am tomorrow (Tuesday) on unsettled issues." bdnews24.
