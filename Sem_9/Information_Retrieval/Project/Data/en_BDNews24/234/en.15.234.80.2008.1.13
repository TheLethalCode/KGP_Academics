<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran accused the United States on Sunday of `adventure-seeking' policies in the Middle East and said Washington owed the region an apology for fooling its people over a naval incident in the Gulf last week. The two foes have stepped up a war of words since the Jan. 6 incident, when Washington says Iranian speed boats threatened US ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil transport route. Iran says it was a routine identification. The increase in tension coincides with a Middle East tour by US President George W.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday US pressure would not bring Iran "to its knees" in the dispute: "Americans are mistaken by thinking that by pressuring Iran over the nuclear issue they can break Iran." Bush visited the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in the Gulf island kingdom of Bahrain on Sunday and the fleet's commander made it clear his forces took the incident in the Gulf "deadly seriously", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. In Tehran, Hosseini said: "We exercised restraint and we very calmly announced that this was a routine procedure but they tried to create a certain amount of commotion here."
