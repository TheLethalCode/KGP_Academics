 Manila, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine Supreme Court will designate special courts to speed up a backlog of environmental cases and ensure polluters are penalised for breaking the law, a spokesman confirmed on Monday. Illegal mining, logging and overfishing are serious problems in the Philippines but few violators are punished either because they pay off officials or because overworked judges tend to prioritise civil and criminal cases over environmental disputes. "We want to come out with decisions so that we can set an example that environmental cases are really being prioritised and so we can enforce these environmental laws properly," said Jose Midas Marquez, the chief justice's head of staff. "It seems that many of the violators don't really care because no one gets penalised. If we have cases clearly penalising violators this might serve as a wake-up call." Water pollution, poor sanitation and air pollution cost the Philippines around 14 billion pesos ($350 million) a year, according to a recent study by the World Bank. Marquez said about 150 courts would be designated as environmental courts within the next two weeks and guidelines for hearing the cases would then be issued. Judges would have to attend training seminars. Greenpeace welcomed the move. "We are one of the countries with the most environmental laws. But the problem is still enforcement," Southeast Asia campaign director Von Hernandez said. ($1 = 40.585 pesos)
