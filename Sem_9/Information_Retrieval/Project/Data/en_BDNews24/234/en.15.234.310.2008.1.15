 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com) - Prime Bank Tuesday said they could not sponsor football in Bangladesh citing their involvement in other games such as Golf, Chess and Tennis. "Prime Bank Tuesday, in a written statement, said they will be not able to sponsor football this year," said Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) media manager Syed Al Fatah. Fatah said the reason for not sponsoring football was commitments in other fields such as Golf throughout the country as well as sponsoring Chess and Tennis in Dhaka. National Sports Council Chairman and Bangladesh army chief General Moeen U Ahmed urged different banks and corporate houses last October to come forward and sponsor different federations. Afterwards, the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) selected 19 banks to increase the ties between banks and sports federations. Prime Bank was requested to sponsor football. Prime Bank and the BFF held three meeting for sponsorship, after which the federation proposed a budget of Tk 9.5 crore for 21 events a year. "We had three meeting with them, but they didn't respond positively and we requested them to put their position in black and white," said BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. "Actually we have no scope to give football a huge amount of money, especially after our budget was finalised," Prime Bank senior vice president Ehsan Habib told bdnews24.com. "A door is still open, and we must come forward to sponsor football if we get the opportunity," said Habib
