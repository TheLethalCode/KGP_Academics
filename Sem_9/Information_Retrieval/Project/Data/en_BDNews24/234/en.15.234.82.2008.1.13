<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to free the detained teachers and students of Dhaka University but it is not clear exactly when. DU vice chancellor SMA Faiz made the announcement Sunday after he met chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office. Another teacher of the university, however, hinted that the teachers could be freed in less than a week amid protests by students, who set the government a deadline for the release. In another development, Faiz visited the detained teachers in Dhaka Central Jail. "I have let them know about the outcome of my discussion with the chief adviser," Faiz told reporters after spending more than an hour with the teachers. Asked to comment on the ways for the teachers to get out of prison, Faiz said: "It would be better if the court verdict ensures their freedom. If it does not, there would not be any lack of cooperation from the government." Faiz, however, would not say any specific date or time for their release. But there was a hint from acting president of DU Teachers' Association Tajmeri SA Islam. "It seemed the detained teachers and students would be freed in less than a week," the professor said, adding that the students' deadline is "rushed one". Meanwhile, the students continued their peaceful protest Sunday and vowed to move toward tougher movement if the detainees are not freed by Wednesday. The students boycotted classes for two hours Sunday and took out a silent procession on the campus. They laid out elaborate programmes to press for the demand: rallies on Jan 15-16 and a human chain on Jan 17. Five teachers expressed solidarity with demonstrating students. They are Professor MM Akash of Economics Department, Professor Muhammad Samad of Social Welfare and Research Institute, Professor Akmal Hossain of International Relations Department, Professor Md Anwar Hossain of Microbiology Department and associate professor Mesbah Kamal of History Department. Mesbah Kamal said: "The university is the place to express opinion. The autonomy of the university and the right to express opinion must not be curbed by any law or emergency rules. Rights must be preserved." He said the "unjust" arrest of DU students and teachers stained the reputation of the government. Students enforced the class boycott in most faculties. The students in a separate procession paraded the roads past Curzon Hall and later joined other students at Aparajeo Bangla. At 1.00pm, the students vowed to continue their protests against what they said was injustice to detained teachers and students. bdnews24
