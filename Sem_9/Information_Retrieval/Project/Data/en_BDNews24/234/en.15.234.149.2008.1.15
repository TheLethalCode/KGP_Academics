<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)Parents of Dhaka University students gathered Tuesday to call for the release of teachers of the institution, detained since the student unrest last August. The parents and some DU teachers gathered at Aparajeya Bangla to join a rally under the banner of Anti-Repression Student Forum. The solidarity calls came as four teachers and a student were produced in court Tuesday, which completed the taking of evidence in the cases. Family members of the arrested teachers attended the rally where they asked the government to release their relatives by Jan 18. Prof Saduddin from DU said: "It is imperative that teachers and students are released in the interests of the spirit of the campus." Another teacher from the institution, Kaberi Gayen, said: "The situation may become out of control if the teachers are not unconditionally released." Dolly Dev, the mother of arrested student Manabendra Dev, added her voice to the demands. The student movement has recently gained momentum following the universities reopening on Jan 8. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters that the detained teachers and students would be released immediately after the judgment. DU vice-chancellor SMA Faiz, who had earlier met the chief adviser, said: "The government has taken the decision to release the teachers and student." The cases against the four teachers and fifteen students proceeded in the court of Md Golam Rabbani, additional chief metropolitan magistrate. Prof Harun-or-Rashid, Prof Sadrul Amin, Prof Anwar Hossain, Prof Nimchandra Bhowmik and student Moniruzzaman Sardar Rubel were produced in court. Defence lawyers cross-examined investigating officer SI Srajul Islam. The accused will conduct their self-defence Wednesday. Dr Rashid's lawyer Shofiul Bashir told bdnews24.com: "The teachers do not want their release on compassionate grounds." "Since there was no application from the home ministry to withdraw the two cases under section 494 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the case will continue accordingly," Bashir said. Dr Sadrul Amin's lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukder said: "Perhaps the government wants to see the judgment on DU teachers the same as on RU teachers." "However, the teachers will not apologise to the government," said Talukder. On Dec 11-12, charges were brought against the four teachers and fifteen students. bdnews24.co
