<TITLE> Brazil`s Lula offers Cuba oil knowhow, credit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Havana, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva offered Cuba millions of dollars in credit on Tuesday and committed Brazil to help the communist-run country explore for oil in the Gulf of Mexico. But it was not immediately clear whether the leftist former labor leader achieved his cherished goal of meeting ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro during a 24-hour visit, his second to Cuba as president of Latin America's largest nation. The 81-year-old Castro has not appeared in public since undergoing stomach surgery that forced him to hand over the running of Cuba to his brother Raul in July 2006. Brazilian officials said Brazil has the resources, technology and diplomatic clout to help Cuba as it approaches a crucial moment of its history without Fidel at the helm. Lula dined with acting President Raul Castro after arriving in Havana on Monday night and met on Tuesday at the Palace of the Revolution government house where the two countries signed a slew of agreements to bolster economic ties. Brazil's export financing agency COFIG announced approval of credit for food purchases and for the expansion and overhaul of the Che Guevara nickel mine, one of three that produce Cuba's main export commodity. Brazil is offering Cuba up to $1 billion in credit lines to pay for Brazilian goods and services in such areas as road building, the sugar industry, the biotechnology and hotels. That includes $600 million for road building. PETROBRAS COMMITS ITSELF Cuba secured the commitment of Brazil's state oil company Petrobras to explore for oil in the deep-sea Cuban water of the Gulf of Mexico where six foreign oil firms have already contracted 24 of 59 blocks. Petrobras president Jose Sergio Gabrielli told reporters the Brazilian giant, a world leader in off-shore drilling, was acquiring and analyzing seismological data and had yet to identify which blocks it would sign risk contracts for. Petrobras and the Cuban state oil company CUPET agreed to study the formation of a joint venture to build a lubricants plant in Cuba, a project that has been discussed for years. The one concrete agreement to emerge from Lula's visit was the licensing of Cuban interferon to Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation for tropical medicine research. Lula planned to meet later Tuesday with some of the 600 Brazilians studying to be doctors in Cuba. The Cuban degree is not recognized in Brazil, but his government will set up additional courses and exams at Brazilian universities to allow the Cuban-trained doctors to practice when they return home. The influential Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper praised the credit splurge for Cuba in a editorial, saying it would pave the way for Brazilian companies to take part in Cuba's necessary modernization and reform process. A Brazilian foreign ministry official said Brazil, Mexico and Canada -- countries with good ties to the United States yet critical of its trade embargo against Havana -- could ease a painful process of change expected in Cuba. "We want to see Cuba back in the fold and can provide the Cubans with a level of comfort in the transition ahead by not being confrontational like the United States," he said.
