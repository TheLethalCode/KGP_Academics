The tests also studied surrounding buildings and the terrain.

In 2006, Pyongyang fired more missiles and tested a nuclear device. bdnews24.com/lq/1642hrs PAC-3s, which are meant to shoot down incoming missiles in the final phase of their flight, are scheduled to be deployed at two more locations near Tokyo by the end of March.
