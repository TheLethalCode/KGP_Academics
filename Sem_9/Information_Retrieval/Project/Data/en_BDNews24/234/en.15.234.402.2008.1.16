 Manila, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hooded gunmen, suspected to be Abu Sayyaf militants, killed a Catholic priest in a botched kidnapping attempt in the restive southern Philippines, officials said on Wednesday. The men took away a local teacher seized along with Father Rey Roda, a parish priest on Tawi-tawi, a remote Muslim island in the southernmost tip of the archipelago, late on Tuesday. "The reports indicated that Fr. Roda resisted and he was gunned down and killed," chief superintendent Joel Goltiao said. "There are pursuit operations going on." The police chief on Tawi-tawi island blamed the Abu Sayyaf, a group of local Islamic militants, for the attack on the priest. "He has been receiving kidnapping threats from the Abu Sayyaf but he has refused our offers to provide him with police guards," Senior Superintendent Wyneright Taup told reporters, adding the priest vowed never to be taken alive by the militants. Muslim militants use Tawi-tawi and nearby Jolo as bases and banditry and kidnap-for-ransom are common on the islands. Roda, 55, was the third missionary killed in the region since 1997. The Philippines is a largely Catholic country, but a Muslim minority in the south has been fighting for decades for some measure of self-rule. An army intelligence officer said the attack on a Catholic priest was an indication of the growing influence of al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah radicals on the local militant group, brought about by the rise of a new Abu Sayyaf leader, Libya-trained Yasser Igasan. "They're going back to the basics," the army intelligence officer told Reuters, recalling that when the Abu Sayyaf started in the early 1990s, the group was attacking Catholic churches, priests, nuns and Protestant missionaries. But in the early part of this decade the group switched to mainly kidnap-for-ransom, taking dozens of Westerners and others captive and freeing them for enormous sums of money. "Igasan is trying to consolidate his control over the Abu Sayyaf and is trying to win support from Muslim communities by hitting religious targets, such as priests," the officer said. "He is trying to heighten the religious conflict."
