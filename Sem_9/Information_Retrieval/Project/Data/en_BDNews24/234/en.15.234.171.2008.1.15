 STRASBOURG, France, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission may step up legal action against Italy over a rubbish crisis in Naples unless the country takes faster action to tackle the problem, the EU's environment chief said on Tuesday. Refuse collection in Naples and the surrounding Campania region stopped around Christmas when almost every dump was declared full. As a result, 110,000 tonnes of garbage has piled up in the streets, triggering sporadic violence. The Commission launched legal action against Italy last spring for breaching EU waste legislation amid a previous breakdown of rubbish collection and disposal in Campania. "The Commission will continue putting pressure on the Italian government to solve the crisis and it is ready to pursue its legal proceedings against Italy," EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas told the European Parliament.
