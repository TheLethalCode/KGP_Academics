 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh were demoted to the third-tier nation in Asian football through allowing their club to play the AFC President's Club instead of the AFC Cup, but Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) officials seem not to be bothered about it. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has recently invited Bangladesh's national football league champions to play the AFC President's Cup, scheduled for April 1 to May 15 with the venues still to be confirmed. The 2007 season saw no national football league held in the country and the BFF sought permission of the Asian football governing body to allow its professional league champions Abahani Limited in the meet without seeking the reason for demoting Bangladesh in the third-tier meet. Earlier, Mohammedan SC, Brothers Union and Muktijoddha Sangsad KC participated in the AFC Cup, the second-tier clubs meet where the league champions from India, Hong Kong, Oman, Jordan and Turkmenistan played in the last season. Not only the clubs, Bangladesh are also restricted to the second-tier nations' meet of the AFC Challenge Cup as they have been asked to play the qualifying round first along with other third-tier nations like Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan before joining India, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, North Korea in the final round. Bangladesh hosted the first AFC Challenge Cup in 2006 and made their exit losing to Tajikistan 6-1 in the quarterfinals. Surprisingly, BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu has no idea about the demotion. "Actually we have no idea and we don't know in which place we are at present as the AFC didn't officially inform us of it," said Malu whose committee is apparently busy forming the district sports football associations before the BFF election. However, outgoing BFF general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal said the demotion was not only based on the national team's performance, but also on the domestic league, infrastructure and the activities of the respective federation. "Tajikistan are a standard team, but the AFC keeps them in the third tier because of their irregularity in the domestic league," said Helal, who could not say whether Bangladesh were demoted. bdnews
