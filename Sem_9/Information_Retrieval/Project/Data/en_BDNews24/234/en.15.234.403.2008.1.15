<TITLE> McCain, Romney in tight race as Michigan votes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DETROIT, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republicans in Michigan began making their choices in the US presidential race on Tuesday, with native son Mitt Romney battling for political survival in a primary that could either revive or sink his campaign. As the results roll in from Michigan, Democratic White House contenders Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards are scheduled to meet in an evening debate in Nevada, site of the party's next contest on Saturday. The hectic schedule reflects the heightened intensity of the wide-open US presidential race, as both parties choose candidates for the November election to succeed President George W Bush. Polls show Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who was raised in Michigan, running neck-and-neck with Arizona Sen. John McCain in a state where the ailing economy has moved to the top of the agenda. A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released early on Tuesday gave McCain a statistically insignificant 1-point edge, 27 percent to 26 percent, over Romney. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was third with 15 percent. Romney needs a breakthrough win to keep his White House hopes alive after second-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. A McCain win after last week's New Hampshire victory would thrust him into the front-runner's role heading into contests in South Carolina and Florida. Asked in an interview on CNN if his campaign would recover if he failed to win in Michigan, Romney said: "Oh, sure." "I'm not going to let four states, only four states, decide for 50 states who the nominee ought to be," said Romney, who has pumped tens of millions of his own dollars into the race but whose only victory so far was in sparsely populated Wyoming. Wearing his lucky green sweater and clutching his lucky penny, McCain visited a polling place early in Traverse City. "It's going to be a very close race," he told reporters who outnumbered voters at the polling site shortly after voting began at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT). "We're confident because of the enthusiasm at the town hall meetings and the rallies but we've got a long way to go." Most of the state's polls close at 8 p.m. EST (0100 GMT on Wednesday) and results will begin rolling in soon afterward. Democrats also will hold a primary in Michigan, but a dispute over the date of the vote led the national party to strip the state of its delegates to this summer's presidential nominating convention. As a result, Obama and Edwards kept their names off the ballot and Clinton is the only top contender listed. None of the top Democrats have campaigned in the state since the dispute arose. ECONOMY TOPS AGENDA The Republican race in Michigan, which suffers the highest unemployment rate of any U.S. state at 7.4 percent, nearly 3 points above the national average, elevated the struggling economy to the top of the campaign agenda. McCain promised lower taxes and reduced government spending would make the United States more competitive globally and create new jobs in the slumping auto industry, but he said those jobs that had been lost would not be coming back. Romney, stressing his experience running the Salt Lake City Olympics and as a venture capitalist, has called McCain a pessimist. He has said he would restore Detroit's lost power by lifting the regulatory burden on companies and boosting research to generate new jobs. Both candidates have advantages in Michigan. McCain won the state during his failed 2000 presidential bid and has considerable support among Democrats and independents who can vote in either primary. Romney is the son of George Romney, the former governor of Michigan and an auto executive, giving him a well-known name in the state. Democrats are focusing on Nevada, and the debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday night will be the first showdown between the top contenders since Clinton's upset win in New Hampshire last week stopped Obama's surge following his victory in the opening contest in Iowa. A poll on Monday showed Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first black president, with a slight lead on Clinton and Edwards a close third. That creates a three-way scramble in a state that will give the winner valuable momentum ahead of the potentially decisive Feb. 5 "Super Tuesday" primaries in 22 states. Both Clinton, a New York senator who would be the first woman president, and Obama tried to put a dispute over race behind them on Monday, making conciliatory remarks to each other after several sharp exchang
