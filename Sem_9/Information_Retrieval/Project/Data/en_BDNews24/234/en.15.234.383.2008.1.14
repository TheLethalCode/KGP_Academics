<TITLE> Activists chase Japan whalers, but split on tactics </TITLE>

 Canbera, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-whaling activists on Monday said they had chased the flagship of Japan's whaling fleet from hunting grounds near Antarctica, but were divided over protest action if the Japanese returned to resume the yearly slaughter. Greenpeace said its protest ship, Esperanza, had successfully stopped Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean after intercepting the fleet's factory processing ship, the Nisshin Maru, at the weekend and chasing it north through heavy seas. "We are a mile or two behind and matching them for speed. At the moment we are reaching our objective which was to stop them whaling, so there is no need to do anything more than keep them on the run," spokeswoman Sara Holden told Reuters from the ship. Japan plans to hunt almost 1,000 minke and fin whales for research over the Antarctic summer, but has abandoned the cull of 50 humpback whales after international condemnation and a formal diplomatic protest by 31 nations. Holden said the Nisshin Maru had been clear of whaling grounds for 24 hours and appeared to be joining a refuelling and supply ship from the six-vessel fleet, the Oriental Bluebird. A second activist ship, the Steve Irwin, operated by the hardline Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, was also closing on the Japanese fleet and her skipper accused Greenpeace of being obstructive to planned protest actions. "We tried to cooperate with Greenpeace, but they are not cooperating. They refuse to give their position," Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson said. "They claim they don't like our tactics, but they are protesting whaling and we are policing whaling." Watson, who last year threatened to ram the Japanese flagship and collided with a whale hunter, said he was 50 miles from the fleet and he would do everything he could to disable the Japanese and stop their operations. But Holden said Watson's group was prepared to place lives at risk in the hostile Southern Ocean, while Greenpeace planned only to disrupt whaling by placing inflatable boats between harpoon boats and the whales. "We don't believe that the methods they use to try to stop whaling are compatible with our principles of non-violence," Holden said. "Our actions are peaceful and are not designed to do anything other than defend the whales." Both Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd have beaten Australia's government in finding the Japanese, with an Australian fisheries patrol icebreaker still en route to monitor the fleet and gather evidence for an international court challenge to the hunt. Australia's government at the weekend urged both groups to be careful on the high seas after the collision between Sea Shepherd and a Japanese harpoon ship last year. Japan has long resisted pressure to stop scientific whaling, insisting whaling is a cherished cultural tradition. Its fleet has killed 7,000 Antarctic minkes over the last 20 years.
