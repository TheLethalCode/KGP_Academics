<TEXT>
 Canbera, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia said on Tuesday it was reviewing security for its Afghanistan embassy following a suicide attack on a luxury hotel in Kabul, but Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the attack would not lead to a troop increase. "This is sober reminder of the difficult, dangerous operating environment in Afghanistan," Rudd said after Monday's attack on the Serena Hotel, which killed seven people. Australia, a close U.S. ally, has almost 1,000 reconstruction and special forces troops in Afghanistan, mainly in the insurgency-racked south of the country The Australian embassy was located inside the hotel, although no Australian diplomats were injured in the attack. Rudd said there was no need to reinforce troops, although his centre-left government has been pressing European nations to lift numbers and redeploy military forces to areas bearing the brunt of resurgent Taliban attacks. "The Australian government condemns this attack on the Serena Hotel, which we're advised has resulted in loss of life," Rudd told local media on Tuesday. The hardline Islamist Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, in which police said up to four attackers threw hand grenades at the gates, shot their way into the high-walled compound and at some point set off a suicide bomb.
