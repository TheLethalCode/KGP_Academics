 Zagreb, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's Prime Minister Ivo Sanader won parliament's backing on Saturday for his proposed centre-right coalition cabinet, which faces the uphill task of speeding up Zagreb's European Union membership talks. The cabinet, agreed after an inconclusive Nov. 25 election, comprises most ministers from the previous Sanader administration, as well as from two small coalition allies and, for the first time, the ethnic Serb community. The new government was endorsed by 82 deputies in the 153-seat parliament and Sanader said he wanted to kickstart reforms and conclude Croatia's EU accession talks, started in 2005, by the end of its four-year mandate. "We want to speed up EU negotiations by quickly meeting all the requirements and adopting European legislation," Sanader told deputies before the vote. "We want to complete all the reforms, particularly the judiciary, public administration, health and privatisation." However, analysts were unimpressed by the cabinet's make-up and said it hardly heralded a renewed commitment to reforms, many of which will be costly and painful for the country's 4.4 million people. "The next Sanader government will be just as incompetent as the previous one. The public had expected Sanader to make use of his fresh start for a thorough redesign of the cabinet," the influential Globus magazine said this week. "But it seems that Sanader simply does not have better people." Sanader's first task will be to end a row with EU members and Adriatic neighbours Italy and Slovenia over Zagreb's decision to enforce a protected fishing zone on its side of the Adriatic from this month. EU officials have warned Zagreb that a failure to reach a deal on the fishing zone would derail its plans to complete accession talks by mid-2009. Sanader said he would immediately launch fresh talks with Italy and Slovenia on the issue. The government will also have to overhaul loss-making shipyards, cut high subsidies to state firms and implement a costly farm reform demanded by its partner, the Peasant Party. Political analyst Andjelko Milardovic praised the ruling coalition for clearly stating its four-year programme and policy goals, making them measurable like never before. "Another thing is whether the government will have enough financial strength and expertise to reach its goals. For starters, it will face demands for higher wages and pensions, amid rising inflation and at a time when the most painful reforms are yet to be tackled," he said
