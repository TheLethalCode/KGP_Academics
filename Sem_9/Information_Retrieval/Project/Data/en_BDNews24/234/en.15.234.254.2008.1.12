 Sylhet, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury has said the government was "appraising ways" of trying war criminals. "The Liberation War is our greatest glory," the adviser said Saturday at a discussion in memory of freedom fighter Manik Chowdhury in Habiganj. "Freedom fighters are respected by all. The government must pay respect to every freedom fighter as deserved." He said the present government was duly appraising what steps could be taken in this matter. Liberation War sector commanders KM Shafiullah, CR Dutta and Abu Osman Chowdhury spoke on the occasion. Shafiullah asked the younger generation to keep up opposition against the '71 collaborators. He said the government had tried its best to stop distortion of history, but there were still some mistakes remaining. Speakers stressed unity of the freedom fighters for the trial of war criminals, saying they had been tried in many countries of the world. The state must take responsibility for trying them, they said. bdnews24
