<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Three firms owned by former adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury and husband Nazim Kamran Choudhury Monday claimed to be the legal tenants of a Gulshan building after its owner accused the couple of trespass and illegal occupation. In a statement, the companies said that a Dhaka court judge had asked Adcomm, Signage and Megavision, housed in the building, to continue paying house rents to the court. The companies believe that the judgement would end "rumours and speculation" about the tenancy of the building on Road 41 in Gulshan. In a raft of complaints, Farhana Islam, owner of the house, charged Geeteara and her husband with trespass, land-grab and intimidation. Farhana alleged that the couple had kept occupying the building, even after a rental agreement expired. The statement sent to bdnews24.com Monday by Adcomm said: "It may be mentioned that in October last, the landlord of the premises refused to accept the monthly rent." The statement further said the judge had ruled that the tenant petitioners such as Adcomm, Signage and Megavision were allowed to continue submitting rents to the court under the Premises Rent Control Act. Referring to the judgement, the statement said the landlord failed to explain in court why the companies would be bound to vacate the "rented premises". A copy of the judgement was filed with Gulshan Police Station, according to the statement. bd
