 NEW YORK, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Citigroup Inc on Tuesday said it is raising at least $14.5 billion and cutting its quarterly dividend 41 percent to help shore up a capital base depleted by losses on subprime mortgages and consumer credit. The largest US bank also posted its first quarterly loss since Citigroup's creation in 1998, hurt by $18.1 billion of write-downs and related expenses for exposure to subprime debt, plus a $4.1 billion increase in US credit costs. The net loss was $9.83 billion, or $1.99 per share, roughly twice as large as analysts expected. Citigroup cut its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share from 54 cents, a move that could save it more than $4 billion a year. "You expected the figures to be shocking," said Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global in London. "You cannot say it's definitively over but you have got to say this is probably the big one." Among the investors injecting new capital are Singapore's government, former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford "Sandy" Weill and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Citigroup's largest individual investor. Analysts and investors said the New York-based bank's attempt to preserve capital will help it steer through the credit market and housing crises, but that Citigroup still faces a tough road. "People knew it would be a kitchen-sink quarter," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "I don't think they're out of the woods yet. Some people see tremendous value in this stock, but I think there will be more pain to come." Citigroup shares fell 71 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $28.35 in pre-market trading. The shares have fallen 47 percent in the last year, compared with a 28 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX>. Citigroup said it is raising $12.5 billion from a private sale of convertible preferred securities. It said this includes $6.88 billion from a Singapore-affiliated fund, and investments from Weill and his family foundation, Alwaleed, the Kuwait Investment Authority, the money manager firm Capital Research & Management, and the state of New Jersey. The bank also plans to sell $2 billion of convertible preferred securities to other investors, and sell additional preferred securities. "We are taking comprehensive action to position Citi for the future with the capital strength that will allow us to refocus on earnings and earnings growth," Vikram Pandit, who became chief executive in December, said in a statement. Pandit also called fourth-quarter results "clearly unacceptable." Tony Tan Keng Yam, deputy chairman of the Singapore fund, said the fund's investment "will meet our long-term investment objective in terms of risk and return." Meanwhile, Alwaleed in a statement said his investment reflects his "strong support of Citigroup, and belief in its long-term success and profitability." BIG WRITE-DOWN Mounting credit losses and a failure to consistently boost revenue faster than costs led to the November departure of Charles Prince as chief executive, and Pandit's elevation the following month. Pandit joined Citigroup in July when the bank bought his hedge fund firm, Old Lane Partners LP, for $800 million. The $18.1 billion write-down includes $17.4 billion related to collateralized debt obligations, roughly twice the $8 billion to $11 billion that Citigroup had estimated on Nov 4. Citigroup also in December brought billions of dollars of debt-laden structured investment vehicles onto its balance sheet, after an attempt to create a "super-SIV" to help sell those securities foundered after a lack of investor demand. The bank ended the year with a Tier-1 capital ratio of 7.1 percent, down from 7.32 percent on Sept. 30, though above the 6 percent that regulators say indicates a "well-capitalized" bank. The ratio measures a bank's ability to cover losses. Citigroup said that if it completes the $12.5 billion offering and its planned purchase of Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp, its Tier-1 ratio would be about 8.2 percent, above its 7.5 percent target. "What Pandit's doing here is setting the table for 2008," said William Smith, chief executive of Smith Asset Management in New York. "The investment from Sandy Weill is a huge vote of confidence on his part. I'm surprised to see his name ther
