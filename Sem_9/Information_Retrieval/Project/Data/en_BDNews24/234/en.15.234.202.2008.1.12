 WELLINGTON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand were closing in on a first innings lead after dominating the opening day of the second test against Bangladesh on Saturday. The Kiwis reached the close on 134 for three, just nine runs behind Bangladesh's total of 143 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. Former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming was unbeaten on 39 with Mathew Sinclair not out nine and the home team perfectly placed to build a big lead and push for a quick victory. Chris Martin took five for 65 as New Zealand's bowlers made light work of Bangladesh's fragile batting line-up, dismissing the tourists in less than three and a half hours. Iain O'Brien captured three wickets while fellow paceman Kyle Mills and spinner Daniel Vettori collected one each as the Kiwis wrapped up the innings in less than 46 overs. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful top-scored with 35 and Aftab Ahmed made an unbeaten 25 but no other player made more than 15, leaving the tourists facing the prospect of another heavy defeat. Bangladesh lost the first test in Dunedin by nine wickets. Mills made the early breakthrough when he dismissed teenage opener Tamim Iqbal, who made half-centuries in each innings of his test debut in Dunedin, for 15, caught by Sinclair at backward point. Martin claimed his first victim when Habibul Bashar (1) edged behind to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum, then his second when opener Junaid Siddique (13), who also made a half-century on his debut last weekend, was caught at third slip by Matthew Bell. Shariar Nafees was caught by Peter Fulton at second slip off O'Brien, who also claimed Ashraful's wicket, caught by McCullum, although television replays showed the skipper was unlucky to be given out as the ball had not made contact with the bat. Bangladesh limped to lunch on 86-5 and the wickets kept tumbling after play resumed, Martin picking up three more to complete his eighth five-wicket haul at test level. New Zealand suffered an early setback in their reply when Bell, who made a century in Dunedin last week, was caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off Sajidul Islam. Craig Cumming and Fulton both made starts but failed post a big score. Cumming was trapped leg before wicket by Shakib Al Hasan for 42 and Fulton was dismissed the same way by Mashrafe Mortaza for 22, leaving Fleming and Sinclair to carry on
