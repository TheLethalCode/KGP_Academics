 NEW DELHI, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels has been reported for suspect action relating to the occasional off-spinner's fast delivery during the third test defeat against South Africa in Durban. The Jamaican player scored a hundred in the final test, which South Africa won easily to clinch the series 2-1 on Saturday. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has been asked to commission a biomechanical report into that particular delivery under its bowling review process, match referee Roshan Mahanama said in an ICC statement. Samuels will undergo an independent analysis of his action by a member of the ICC's panel of human movement specialists. He can continue playing while the study is done. Samuels would be suspended from bowling that particular delivery in international cricket with immediate effect if found to have been bowling with an illegal action. He would then have the option of applying to the ICC for a re-assessment of his fast ball
