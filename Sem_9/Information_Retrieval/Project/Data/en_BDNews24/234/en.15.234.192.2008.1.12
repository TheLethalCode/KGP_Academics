<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki said on Saturday he had put national police chief Jackie Selebi on a leave of absence before the commissioner faces expected corruption charges. The decision to charge Selebi, a Mbeki ally, is likely to raise the political temperature in South Africa, where power struggles in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) have created political instability and unnerved investors. "With effect from midnight last night we have given the national commissioner of police an extended leave of absence," Mbeki told a news conference. Mbeki, who had stood behind Selebi despite calls for his sacking, made the announcement a day after prosecutors said they would charge Selebi with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering. Selebi's deputy, Tim Williams, will act as national police commissioner, Mbeki said. Critics have argued that Mbeki's decision to keep Selebi in office was another example of how he uses state institutions to protect allies and purge opponents, allegations he denies. Asked why he had taken so long to act, Mbeki said: "I have said this before many times. If there was anybody who brought information to me that showed that the national commissioner of police had done wrong things I would act on it. And nobody did." "The position that we take, that nobody is above the law, is a real serious position," he said. Selebi is also president of the international police body Interpol, which said it was monitoring his situation carefully and would discuss it at a meeting next month. There has been no word from the Lyon-based organisation on whether the pending charges will impact his position. "While it would be inappropriate for INTERPOL to comment on the ongoing investigation in South Africa, it should be stated that President Selebi has significantly helped the organisation and its member countries to enhance security and police cooperation worldwide," it said in a statement. CHARGES A copy of Selebi's indictment, made available to the media by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), covers a range of charges that include receiving payments from his friend Glenn Agliotti, a convicted drug smuggler accused of playing a role in the 2005 murder of a South African mining magnate. The indictment said between 2000 to 2005 Selebi received at least 1.2 million rand ($175,500) from Agliotti and his associates, including 30,000 rand from Agliotti a day or two after magnate Brett Kebble was killed. Selebi has denied any wrongdoing. His legal team went to court on Friday to try to prevent his prosecution, but the judge rejected the application. NPA spokesman Tlali Tlali said on Saturday afternoon Selebi had not been charged yet. Court papers filed by the NPA before the decision to charge Selebi was made public said he faced no prospect of imminent arrest and that arrangements over a court date would be made. The charges will be the latest in a series of scandals. The NPA charged new ANC leader Jacob Zuma with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering eight days after he won the party leadership from Mbeki last month, fuelling allegations it had been used as a political weapon. Murders, rapes and carjackings have put Selebi's police force under pressure to make the streets safe before South Africa hosts the soccer World Cup in 2010. The government has said it is making progress in the fight against crime but criticism of its policies is growi
