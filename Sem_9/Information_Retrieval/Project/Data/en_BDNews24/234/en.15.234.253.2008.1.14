 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) - Students attending Dhaka College set the National University authorities a 24-hour deadline to accept their three-point demand Sunday, following three days of agitatation. The students demanded that the university award 45 percent marks to all examinees by accepting the now-cancelled Nov 11 honours second-year English exams (compulsory) as valid. Unrest among students at the institution boiled over after the second suspension of examinations following an apparent question paper leak. The students have called for increased action at the college, which comes under the purview of the National University, from Tuesday if their demands have not been met by Monday. Dhaka College student Zamiur Rahman Faisal, speaking on behalf of the students, said: "If our demands are not met by Monday, we will increase our programme in the educational institutions under the NU from Tuesday." "We have not yet fixed the programme. We will announce it after the expiry of the 24-hour ultimatum," said Faisal. The student leader said they held a demonstration on Mirpur Road from 10.30am to 1pm Sunday. Police stopped traffic on both sides of Mirpur Road from Science Laboratory crossing to Nilkhet crossing during the protest, resulting in a serious traffic jam in adjoining areas. Following the protest, the students submitted their demands to the vice chancellor of the National University through the Dhaka College principal. The English paper examination for second year honours students had been scheduled for Jan 12, prior to the National University suspending the exams Friday, citing leaked papers. The examination was originally scheduled for Nov 11, but was cancelled on the same grounds. The NU issued a statement Saturday which said the suspended examination of the English paper would now be held on Jan 29-30. The statement also said a committee has been formed to probe the alleged leaks. bdnews24.com/
