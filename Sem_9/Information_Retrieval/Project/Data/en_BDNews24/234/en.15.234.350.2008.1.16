<TITLE> Juventus reach last eight by beating Empoli in thriller </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus reached the Italian Cup quarter-finals after beating Serie A strugglers Empoli 5-3 in a Turin thriller on Tuesday to advance 6-5 on aggregate. An under-strength Juve lost 2-1 at Empoli in December's first leg and Claudio Ranieri's decision to field a few of his big guns in the return match paid early dividends when Marco Marchionni burst through the defence to score. Pavel Nedved doubled the lead on 10 minutes but an injury to defender Giorgio Chiellini knocked Juve off their stride. Empoli capitalised when Luca Antonini slid in to pull one back and Nicola Pozzi produced an excellent header to bring the scores level on the night. Italy forward Vincenzo Iaquinta then struck twice for Juve either side of Pozzi's second before substitute Alessandro Del Piero sealed the home side's passage with a penalty. Holders AS Roma will go out unless they can overcome a 3-1 first-leg deficit in Wednesday's second leg at home to Torino while AC Milan are also in arrears as they travel to Catania
