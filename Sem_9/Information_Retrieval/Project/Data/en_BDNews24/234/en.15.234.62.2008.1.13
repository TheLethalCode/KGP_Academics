 ABU DHABI, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush visited the US Navy's Fifth Fleet on Sunday amid new tensions with Iran over an incident in which the United States says its ships were harassed in the Strait of Hormuz. Bush went to the sprawling naval complex in Bahrain, a Gulf island kingdom that is home to the Fifth Fleet, before going on to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, where he will give a signature speech on the advancement of democracy. On the visit to Bahrain, Bush entered a US naval mess hall to loud applause and shouted "good morning" to sailors, Marines and soldiers assembled for breakfast. Joining the chow line, Bush picked up some pancakes, syrup and bacon, then sat down with to breakfast with the sailors. On arrival in Abu Dhabi, Bush was greeted in light drizzle by UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan and Vice President and ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. The UAE is the third stop on his tour of US-allied Arab states aimed at rallying support against non-Arab Iran. Bush's visit to Arab allies comes amid heightened tensions over a U.S.-Iranian naval incident in the Gulf a week earlier. Washington says its warships were threatened by Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital route for crude oil shipments from the world's biggest producing region. Tehran dismissed it as a routine contact and accused the United States of exaggerating for propaganda purposes. Bush discussed the Strait of Hormuz incident with Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff, the commander of the Fifth Fleet, who made clear that his forces took it "deadly seriously," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters travelling with Bush. "All of the people in the military remember what's happened in the past such as the USS Cole," she said, referring to the deadly attack on the warship in Yemen in 2000. PUSH TO ISOLATE IRAN During a stop in Israel at the start of the Middle East trip last week, Bush warned Iran of "serious consequences" if it attacked U.S. ships, and said all options were on the table. Washington is leading efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear ambitions, and Bush said late last year that a nuclear-armed Iran could mean "World War III." The Bush administration has kept up a campaign of harsh rhetoric despite a U.S. intelligence report in December that concluded Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003, contradicting the president's longstanding assertion that Tehran was actively pursuing development of a bomb. Bush has insisted that Iran remains a danger. Tehran says it wants nuclear technology for strictly civilian purposes. But the National Intelligence Estimate has left Washington's Arab allies worried and confused. They share US concerns about Tehran's growing regional influence but want efforts at containment to be done without resorting to military means. Kuwait, the first stop on Bush's Gulf tour, has said it will not allow the United States to use its territory for any strike against Iran. Saudi Arabia said ahead of Bush's arrival in the Gulf that it would listen to Bush but that national interests came first in dealing with Iran, and it could directly talk through any problems with its large Shi'ite Muslim neighbour. The UAE, which has historic trade links to Iran but is a close economic and political ally of the United States, passed an export control law last year that is expected to clamp down on the smuggling of dual use goods to the Islamic Republic. Bush will visit the UAE's trade and tourism hub Dubai before heading for Saudi Arabia and then Egypt as he tries to rally Arab support for his Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking effor
