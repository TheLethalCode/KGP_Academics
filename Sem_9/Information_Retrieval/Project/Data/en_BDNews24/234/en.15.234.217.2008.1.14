 PERTH, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia spinner Brad Hogg has been cleared to play in this week's third test against India after the tourists withdraw a complaint against him. Hogg was due to face the International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Mike Procter at a Perth hotel on Monday after being charged with using abusive language during last week's ill-tempered second test in Sydney. However, the case was dropped when India captain Anil Kumble and team manager Chetan Chauhan told Procter they were withdrawing their complaint. "It's all behind us now, so we can get on with cricket," Procter told reporters. "It's a wonderful gesture by India, showing what sportsmanship they possess in the way they play the game." Kumble said India had agreed to drop the charges after he held a face-to-face meeting with Australia skipper Ricky Ponting. "It was just one of those incidents, probably made in the heat of the moment, and it was important that we moved on," Kumble said. "So in view of that, we have withdrawn the charges." 'LOVELY GESTURE' Hogg was accused of making an offensive remark to Kumble and India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the final day of the Sydney test. India lodged the complaint after their own spinner Harbhajan Singh was found guilty and suspended for three tests for racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds. Harbhajan has maintained his innocence and lodged an appeal. He has been cleared to continue playing until the appeal is heard, although no date has been set. Hogg said he was grateful to India for dropping the charge. "It's a kind gesture, a lovely gesture by the Indian team and it's much appreciated by myself and the Australian cricket team," he said. "Cricket would like to move forward and hopefully any future games between India and Australia are going to be close contests, good viewing for the spectators and played with much enjoyment by the teams." The third test begins on Wednesday
