 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com) - Law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff Tuesday said there were some cases where fundamental rights were being hampered due to the state of emergency. "The state of emergency is not hampering fundamental rights in all spheres, but has done so in some cases," the adviser told reporters at the law ministry Tuesday "Withdrawing the state of emergency will be considered when a normal atmosphere returns. We surely do not want to return to a situation such as occurred on Oct 28," Hassan Ariff said. About the detention and subsequent release of businessmen by the High Court, Hassan Ariff said when the court cancels a detention order it is to be understood that the detention order was not legal. "A detention system exists in all democratic countries." Mentioning the system in neighbouring India, the adviser said: "There are 22 laws regarding this in India." Asked whether the appointment of special assistants to the chief adviserand giving them power to approve the activities of the ministries and divisionswas contrary to the constitution, he said: "Of course it is constitutional. An amendment was brought to the rules of business in this regard." On the demand for the release of Dhaka University teachers, the adviser said: "The government cannot take any decision in this regard before the legal process ends." Recently appointed education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had earlier said that whatever the verdict of the court, the teachers would be released. Drawing his attention to Hossain Zillur's comment when reporters asked whether it amounted to contempt of court, Hassan Ariff said: "There is no relation between their release and the verdict of a court." On formation of the Truth Commission, the adviser said: "The matter is underway. But I have not yet received any documents in this regard." bdnews24.
