 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University vice-chancellor SMA Faiz Sunday said the government decided to free detained DU teachers and students. After a meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the CA's office earlier in the day, the VC said the teachers and students would be freed in two cases. Hundreds of DU students continued their protests Sunday and set a deadline for the government to free their teachers and fellow students. The students vowed to launch a tough movement if they were not freed by Wednesday. The students boycotted classes for two hours Sunday and took out a silent procession on the campus. They laid out elaborate programmes to press for the demand: rallies on Jan 15-16 and a human chain on Jan 17. Professor Tajmeri SA Islam, acting president of Dhaka University Teachers Association, said the students had rushed the programmes, which was not necessary, adding: "It seemed the detained teachers and students would be freed in less than a week." Meanwhile, five teachers expressed solidarity with demonstrating students. They are Professor MM Akash of Economics Department, Professor Muhammad Samad of Social Welfare and Research Institute, Professor Akmal Hossain of International Relations Department, Professor Md Anwar Hossain of Microbiology Department and associate professor Mesbah Kamal of History Department. Mesbah Kamal said: "The university is the place to express opinion. The autonomy of the university and the right to express opinion must not be curbed by any law or emergency rules. Rights must be preserved." He said the "unjust" arrest of DU students and teachers stained the reputation of the government. Students enforced the class boycott in most faculties. The students in a separate procession paraded the roads past Curzon Hall and later joined other students at Aparajeo Bangla. At 1.00pm, the students vowed to continue their protests against what they said was injustice to detained teachers and students. bdnew
