 ROME, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian students staged a sit-in on Tuesday to protest against plans for Pope Benedict to address Rome's most prestigious university this week, ratcheting up demonstrations that have divided the country. The Vatican said the Pope would still speak at La Sapienza university on Thursday despite the protests, which critics in the Church and beyond say smack of censorship. The controversy began with a signed letter by 67 professors who portrayed the Pope as a backward theologian who put religion before science and should not be allowed to speak. They pointed to a speech he gave nearly two decades ago, saying it showed he would have favoured the Church's 17th century heresy trial against Galileo for teaching the Earth revolved around the sun. The Pope's supporters deny that. "I think the Pope's visit is not a good thing because science doesn't need religion. The university is open to every form of thought but religion isn't," said Andrea Sterbini, a computer science professor and one of the signatories. Still, the debate has won unusual allies for the Pope. Outspoken critic of the Church Dario Fo, a Nobel prize winner, defended the Pope's right to speak. "I'm against any form of censorship because the right to (free) speech is sacred," the writer told La Repubblica daily. The protests have widened to include Italians -- including some within the government -- who complain the Roman Catholic Church has too much sway in Italian society. "Nobody wants to muzzle the Pope or take away his right to speak," said EU Affairs Minister Emma Bonino from the secularist Rose in the Fist party. "I find worrying what we see every day: the only one who has the floor, morning or night, is the Pope." Some students, who launched an "anti-clerical" week ahead of the Pope's speech, say higher education must be secular. They occupied the offices of the chancellor, seeking the right to protest on university grounds during the Pope's visit. "The Pope is holding La Sapienza hostage. Free the thinkers," read one banner. The Pope's supporters pointed out that the protesters were in the minority. Officials at La Sapienza, founded by a pope 705 years ago, noted that there were 5,000 professors at the university -- only 67 of them dissenters. "I really don't see the point of this protest. He's a person, like every other person, coming to talk to us," physics student Federico Magni told Reuters.
