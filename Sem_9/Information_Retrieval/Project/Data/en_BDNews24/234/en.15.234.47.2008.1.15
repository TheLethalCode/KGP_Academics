 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)  Brothers Union Tuesday decided to withdraw a writ petition they had filed against Bangladesh Cricket Board, clearing the way for the premier and first division cricket leagues to finally start. "We've decided to withdraw our writ petition in the greater interest of the country, cricketers and of the game," Brothers general secretary Minjanuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com by phone after attending an emergency meeting. Brothers Union in October last year petitioned the High Court for a freeze on a BCB decision to relegate them and Indira Road KC to the first division from the premier league. The court halted BCB's decision for two months. In a bid to clear the clouds, BCB president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali convened a meeting of the representatives of the all premier and first division teams on January 10. Brothers skipped the meeting, deepening uncertainties over holding of the leagues. The BCB chief later said they would not sit with the Gopibagh-based club until it retracted the write petition. The meeting had also asked Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club to convey the board's decision to Brothers and try to talk it into retracting the writ appeal. "We are happy after making Brothers understand the need of withdrawing the writ petition in the interest of the game," said Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan, general secretary of Mohammedan SC. "I had a successful discussion with a few Brothers officials Monday and they promised me that they would withdraw the petition soon," added Bhuiyan. bdnew
