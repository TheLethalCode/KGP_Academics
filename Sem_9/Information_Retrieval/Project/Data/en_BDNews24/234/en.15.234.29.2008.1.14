<TITLE> Hong Kong accuses radio activists of contempt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong has accused activists who made an unlicensed radio broadcast of contempt of court, a case that highlights sensitivities over media freedom in the city 10 years after it returned to Communist-ruled China. The Department of Justice said it had filed legal papers against activists running the Citizens' Radio station accusing them of contempt after they made the broadcast in violation of an injunction. In a statement issued late on Sunday, the department added it was considering whether legal action would be taken against others who assisted in the short pirate broadcast. These included several lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp. "Assistance by anyone in the violation of the injunction including taking part in any unauthorised broadcast ... may also constitute contempt of court", the statement added. Hong Kong has one of Asia's freest media arenas, but in the decade since the city's return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, tensions have simmered over press freedom. RTHK, the city's respected and critical public broadcaster, now faces an uncertain fate under a broadcasting review which critics fear could see it turned into a government mouthpiece. Demonstrators shouted slogans outside a local court on Monday denouncing the city's radio laws, which they said violated the bill of rights. The Citizens' Radio activists have been involved in a lengthy legal fight against the government to make their anti-establishment voices heard on local FM airwaves. Last week they were seemingly awarded a victory when a lower court ruled Hong Kong's radio laws curbed freedoms. But the ruling was suspended pending an appeal by the government to a higher court, and the activists were slapped with a temporary injunction banning them from going on air, given the risk of disrupting the airwaves for local emergency services. Hours later though, the radio operators openly defied the court order with an unauthorised street broadcast.
