<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 14 (bdnews24.com)  The new socio-political organisation Samajik Rajnoitik Andolan (SRA) Monday said it will run the national elections by "shaping popular opinion". SRA leaders outlined some of their policies and strategies for the upcoming elections while formally announcing the launch of their organisation at a press conference at the National Press Club. They also highlighted political analyst and former Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal ideologue Sirajul Alam Khan's 14-point government and governance charter. "We'll form political alliances, nominate honest and competent candidates for contesting the national elections. "We'll introduce alternative politics through changing governance systems so that the country cannot be made to suffer situations prevailing prior to Jan 11," said SRA coordinator Abdul Baten Chowdhury. Baten read out Khan's charter that proposes federal governance, a national parliament with two houses and a government based on national consensus. Further points in the charter include dividing the republic into seven to nine provinces, a national security council headed by the president, a judicial council and a constitutional court. Also proposed is the formation of a regional economic alliance, potentially comprising Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, eastern India, southern Myanmar and China's Kunming province. Humayun Kabir Hiru, another former JSD and JP leader, said: "This organisation will introduce neo-political modes. We congratulate and welcome other political parties which emerged after Jan 11." Hiru declared that the new political entity would not nominate war criminals or individuals accused of corruption. The SRA emerged as a new socio-political organisation in Sept 2007. Other organisations to have emerged since the caretaker government took over are the National People's Party, Guardians' Party, Progressive Democratic Party, Kalyan Party, Naya Shamaj Dal and Naypanthi Dal. bdnews24.co
