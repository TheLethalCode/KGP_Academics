 MOSCOW, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, hoping to prevent any attempts to sabotage his bid to become president, showed off on Tuesday what he said were the signatures of 2.2 million voters supporting his candidacy. Kasyanov, a Kremlin critic, described himself and his opposition Popular Democratic Front last month as the Russian authorities' public enemy number one and says obstructions are often put in the way of his party's meetings. He is running as an independent in the March 2 election because he does not have the backing of any party represented in parliament, which is dominated by pro-Kremlin groups. Independent candidates need 2 million signatures of support. "We are law-abiding people and, even though we consider this law wrong and its demands excessive, it is the law," Kasyanov told reporters as workers put reams of paper with the signatures into cardboard files labelled by geographical region. He intends to hand the signatures to the Central Election Commission on Wednesday to register as a candidate. FROM POWER TO OPPOSITION Kasyanov was Russia's prime minister for four years and also served as President Boris Yeltsin's finance minister. After President Vladimir Putin dismissed him as prime minister in 2004, he opened a consulting firm and entered politics as an opposition leader. Kasyanov is not widely liked in Russia, where some parts of the media have nicknamed him "Misha 2 percent" because of rumours he took kickbacks on contracts in the government. No evidence of this has been produced and he denies any wrongdoing. He said he was certain to qualify with the Central Election Commission as a presidential candidate, but campaigning would be at outdoor meetings around the country as television was denied to him on state-controlled channels. "Insofar as it is the current regime's chief propaganda weapon, we won't have the same capacity to use television time as much as we would like and as much as the regime's candidate will," Kasyanov said. Critics say Putin will exploit his power and control over the biggest media outlets to ensure victory for Dmitry Medvedev, the man he endorsed to replace him. Putin has to step down because of a constitutional ban on heads of state serving three consecutive terms. His endorsement means Medvedev is almost certain to win. Putin has said he is ready to serve as prime minister under a Medvedev administration, an arrangement welcomed by many Russians and investors who associate Putin -- named as Time magazine's 2007 person of the year -- with stability. Kasyanov called the arrangement "a con and a usurpation of power" and said that if Medvedev wins it will only serve to darken domestic opinion of Russian democracy. "If what happened in the December elections, this institution of technical ascendancy, happens once more, it means people will see this as Russian democracy, as what is supposed to happen in a democracy, and we are against that," he said. In the Dec. 2 parliamentary election, Putin swung his weight behind United Russia, the dominant pro-Kremlin party, and set in motion a series of public appearances that assured the party's victory and eliminated all but the most pliant opposition.
