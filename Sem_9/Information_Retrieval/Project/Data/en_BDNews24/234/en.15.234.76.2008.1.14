 COLOMBO, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have picked six fast bowlers in a 15-man squad for next month's tri-series in Australia which also involves India. Chaminda Vaas leads the pace attack with support from Lasith Malinga, Farveez Maharoof, Chanaka Welegedara, Nuwan Kulasekera and Ishara Amerasinghe. Dilhara Fernando is not available after undergoing an ankle operation in December. There is no specialist spinner to support Muttiah Muralitharan although Dilruwan Perera is an off-spinning all-rounder and Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya are effective one-day slow bowlers. Middle-order batsman Chamara Kapugedera returns to the squad in place of Jehan Mubarak. Sri Lanka leave for Australia on Jan. 24 and will play two warm-up games against the Prime Minister's XI on Jan. 30 and against Tasmania on Feb. 2. Their first tri-series game is against India in Brisbane on Feb. 5.
