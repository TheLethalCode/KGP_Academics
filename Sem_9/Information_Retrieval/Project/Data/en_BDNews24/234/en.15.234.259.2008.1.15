<TITLE> Iran says Turkmen move to cut gas "immoral" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An senior Iranian official said Turkmenistan was "immoral" to halt gas exports to Iran in the depths of a very cold winter in a bid to change the terms of a supply contract, Iran's state radio reported on Tuesday. Turkmenistan halted daily deliveries of up to 23 million cubic metres to Iran in late December, citing technical issues, and it has since said Tehran's failure to meet some payments was delaying pipeline repairs. Iran, which has the world's second largest gas reserves but still imports some gas, insists it is up to date with payments. Iranian officials say Ashgabat wants to charge more for its gas. Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Akbar Torkan said Ashgabat wanted to change the terms of an existing gas contract. "The contract is transparent. Turkmens want to cancel it and put forward new claims," Torkan told state radio. "Cutting off the flow of gas in the coldest days of the year is immoral." State media previously said Iran had a 25-year contract running to 2024 but had signed another agreement for additional supplies since that original deal was signed. An Iranian TV report and a senior member of parliament have said Turkmenistan wants to double the price of gas it supplies to Iran to $140 per 1,000 cubic metres. Iranian Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari said price talks could only start if Turkmenistan resumed gas supplies and has warned that Iran would stop buying Turkmen gas if supplies did not restart. The head of parliament's energy commission, Kamal Daneshyar, said Iran planned to complain to international courts about the halt in Turkmen gas deliveries, without specifying which court. "Turkmenistan wants to double the price of gas. Their excuse is technical problems but the main issue is an increase of the price," the Oil Ministry's Web site Shana quoted him as saying. Iran gets about 5 percent of its needs from Turkmenistan and the supply disruption has caused shortages in some northern areas of the Islamic Republic. The disruption has also prompted Iran to cut its own gas exports to Turkey. The supply cut has come at a particularly sensitive time because Iran is suffering some the coldest winter temperatures for decades, pushing up demand for heating. Turkmenistan reached an agreement in November to increase the price of gas it delivers to Russia's gas export monopoly, Gazprom, to $130 per 1,000 cubic metres in the first half of 2008 and $150 in the second half, up from $100.
