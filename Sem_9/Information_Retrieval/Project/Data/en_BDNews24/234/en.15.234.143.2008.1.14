 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Samuel Eto'o heads for the African Nations Cup after a goal-scoring performance for Barcelona that is sure to lift his Cameroon team mates ahead of the tournament in Ghana. Most of the top Africans have already linked up with their national squads but Eto'o was granted special dispensation to play in Barca's league match against Murcia. The quicksilver striker responded by scoring twice in a 4-0 victory on Saturday for the Catalans, a welcome show of form ahead of the finals which run from Jan. 20 to Feb. 10. Kalu Uche was also on target in the Primera Liga, the Nigerian substitute heading the only goal of the game three minutes from time in Almeria's home win over Espanyol. In England, Congolese defender Christopher Samba nodded his third goal of the season in Blackburn Rovers's 2-1 win at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. Emmanuel Adebayor also underlined his position as one of the Premier League's deadliest strikers by converting a penalty in Arsenal's 1-1 home draw with Birmingham City. DIANE DOUBLE In France, Ivorian forward Amara Diane scored twice to help Paris Saint Germain to a first home win of the season, a 3-0 thumping of Racing Lens. Diane came on as a second-half substitute and sealed victory with two goals in two minutes thanks to a smart volley and a header. Senegalese central defender Massamba Sambou also flicked in a brilliant stoppage-time header to clinch three points for Monaco against Lorient. In Netherlands, Kwame Quansah of Ghana scored the opener in Heracles Almelo's 2-0 victory over Sparta Rotterdam. He pounced on a loose ball after a corner to finish well from 15 metres. In Italy, Senegalese defender Ferdinand Coly's headed goal failed to prevent his Parma team losing 2-1 at home to Fiorentina. Ivorian striker Shabani Nonda was the hero for Turkish side Galatasaray, bagging a hat-trick in a 5-2 triumph at Rizespor. Nonda was handed a start because of the club's injury problems and responded in the best possible way. In Portugal, a 76th-minute penalty from Cameroonian forward Albert Meyong Ze earned Belenenses a 2-1 victory at home to Naval. Angolan striker Edson Nobre was also on target in Pacos Ferreira's 3-1 win over Maritimo on Friday
