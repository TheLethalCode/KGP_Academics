 Feni, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Sunday said the fight against corruption requires a change in the "national mindset" and will never be eliminated purely by enacting laws. He said a mindset ingrained against corruption has to be cultivated in the country, with upcoming generations made aware of the potential pitfalls as well as being made active partners in the fight. Speaking as chief guest at a meeting at Feni District Shilpakala Academy, the ACC chairman said efforts were underway to create awareness on the issue through programmes at all levels of society, with corruption prevention committees to be installed at district and upazila levels. Chowdhury stressed that although corruption affects many people, the majority do not themselves behave in a corrupt way. "They hate corruption. We must all come forward to prevent corruption from our own respective positions," said Chowdhury. The ACC chief added that those accused of corrupt practices should also receive legal aid. "If this is not done the transparency of the commission may be compromised." bdnews24.com's Comilla correspondent reports that Chowdhury's car was dented in a collision with a microbus on the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway Sunday morning. Tapan Chandra Saha from Kotwali Police Station said a microbus struck Chowdhury's vehicle from behind around 9am. No-one was injured. No case was filed with the local police station. Police seized the microbus. bdnews24
