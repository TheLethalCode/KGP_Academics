<TITLE> Australia select Rogers and Tait for 3rd test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening batsman Chris Rogers will make his test debut and fast bowler Shaun Tait will earn his first cap in more than two years as Australia make two changes to the side to play India in the third test at the WACA starting on Wednesday. Rogers, 30, will make his test debut after Matthew Hayden was ruled out with a hamstring injury while Tait replaces spinner Brad Hogg. Captain Ricky Ponting said selectors had given Hayden every chance to prove his fitness but did not want to take any chances. Hayden scored centuries in each of the first two tests but had to bat with a runner in the second innings in Sydney after straining a hamstring. "It was just too much of a risk of him going into this game with that sort of niggle just in case it did blow up again in the first innings," Ponting told a news conference on Tuesday. "Obviously he probably wouldn't have been able to get a runner from there on and it was too great a risk coming into this game." Hayden said he was disappointed to miss out after playing in each of Australia's last 86 test matches. "This is going to be a special test but I couldn't look the skipper in the eye and say that I was going to be fully fit," Hayden said. 'MISSED THE BOAT' Rogers sympathised with Hayden but was thrilled to be finally given his opportunity. The left-hander has been a prolific batsman in the Australian and England first-class competitions but struggled to break into the side because of the presence of Hayden and Justin Langer. Rogers scored a double century playing for Leicestershire against the touring Australians on the 2005 Ashes tour but lost out to Phil Jaques when the selectors looked for a replacement for Langer. "This is a fantastic opportunity to represent Australia and it something I have been dreaming about for a long time and it has finally come my way," Rogers said. "I thought I might have missed the boat but I always thought there might be an opportunity. You never want to wish an injury on anyone but there is always a chance that might happen. I feel for Matt but it is a great opportunity for me." Ponting said he was confident Rogers would make the transition to test level and expected him to benefit from making his debut at his home ground. "It's a terrific achievement for him, he's someone who's been waiting in the wings for the last couple of years," Ponting said. "He deserves his opportunity there is no doubt about that. He'll be excited, he'll probably have a fairly sleepless night I'd imagine, hopefully he makes some run in front of his home crowd." Hogg was cleared to play after India dropped a code of conduct charge against him but the selectors opted to replace him with Tait because the WACA wicket traditionally favours paceman. Tait's inclusion means Australia will go into the match with a four-prong pace attack including Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson. "I don't think there's any doubt that we can -- with Tait, Lee and Johnson -- rattle them," Ponting said. "What it does give us as far as our fast bowling goes is really good balance and a good mix."
