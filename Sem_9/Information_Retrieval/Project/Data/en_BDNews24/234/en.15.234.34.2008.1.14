<TITLE> New South Korea leader ready for summit with North </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect said on Monday he was willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-il if it would help in ending his reclusive neighbour's nuclear weapons programme. Lee Myung-bak, who takes office on Feb. 25, has pledged to take a tough line with Pyongyang, but also said he would implement a massive aid package for the impoverished state if it abandons nuclear arms. "The leaders of the South and the North can meet any time if it helps in the dismantling of North Korean nuclear programmes and with other affairs," Lee told a news conference. Outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun, criticised for giving away too much to North Korea for little in return, met the North's leader last October for only the second summit between the two states that remain technically at war, having ended their 1950-53 conflict with a ceasefire instead of a peace treaty. Lee said his government would be willing to follow through on the pledges Roh made for aid, which could be worth billions of dollars, "as long as they meet business feasibility standards". Lee, a former CEO of Hyundai's construction arm, has said he would tie aid to progress the North makes in taking apart its nuclear programme, considered one of the region's greatest security threats. North Korea failed to meet a year-end deadline set in an international disarmament deal to give a full accounting of its fissile material and weaponry as well as answer U.S. suspicions of having a clandestine programme to enrich uranium for arms. Lee also said he would work to improve ties with the United States, which have been strained under the Roh government, arguing this would be helpful for North Korea because it would reduce distrust.
