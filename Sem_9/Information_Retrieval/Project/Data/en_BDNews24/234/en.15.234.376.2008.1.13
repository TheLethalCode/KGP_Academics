<TITLE> KMT must ride momentum to retake Taiwan presidency </TITLE>

 Taipei, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A landslide victory in Taiwan's legislative polls gave the opposition Kuomintang a fresh mandate to control parliament, but it needs to ride that momentum to retake the presidency in March, newspapers said on Sunday. While KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou is frontrunner for the March presidential election, the party that once governed the whole of China must act quickly to capitalise on Saturday's trouncing of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). "The Kuomintang's landslide victory cannot be translated into a sure win for Ma in that race," the China Post said in an editorial. "The ruling party will be trying to lick its wounds after such a heavy loss in yesterday's election, hoping for a pendulum effect to help them to beat the Kuomintang a little more than two months from now," the English-language paper said. The KMT, or Nationalist Party, won 72 percent of the vote on Saturday, taking 81 seats in the newly streamlined 113-member chamber. This sweeping victory strengthens its bid to regain the presidency after eight years of Chen Shui-bian, the pro-independence leader who must step down this year. A KMT presidency would herald better relations with China as the party favours closer economic ties and more dialogue with Beijing. There was no immediate official comment from China after Saturday's elections. Beijing insists Taiwan is a breakaway province which must return to mainland rule, and has threatened to use force to prevent a formal move towards independence. A combination of Taiwan's lacklustre economic performance and a string of scandals plaguing the DPP helped boost the KMT vote on Saturday, but the China Times newspaper urged the Nationalists not to be complacent. "The Taiwan people used their votes to teach the DPP a lesson and also give the KMT a chance," the Chinese-language China Times said, adding that the KMT should be humble while the DPP should reflect on its record. While the DPP won just 27 seats, or 24 percent, the rest going to smaller groups, analysts said it was too early to write off the party completely. DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh vowed on Sunday to do his best to win the March elections. "One party dominating three quarters of the parliament is not conducive to Taiwan democracy," he told reporters. Analysts said Hsieh was likely to take over as party chairman after President Chen resigned to take responsibility for Saturday's loss. Chen left Taiwan on Sunday on a visit to diplomatic allies Guatemala and Saint Lucia. The newly elected parliament has been cut to half the size of its predecessor, which had 225 seats, in an effort to reduce corruption and boost efficiency. As is standard, the cabinet led by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will resign en masse on Jan. 28 before the new legislature convenes at the beginning of February. Taiwan's political separation from the Chinese mainland dates back to the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 when Mao Zedong's Communist armies swept to victory and the defeated Kuomintang set up their rival government on the island
