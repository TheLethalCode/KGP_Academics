 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paceman Dale Steyn bowled South Africa to a series victory over West Indies in the third test on Saturday. Steyn claimed 6-72 as South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs with two days to spare to wrap up a 2-1 series win. West Indies, who needed 417 to make South Africa bat again, were dismissed for 317 with Marlon Samuels on 105 as their top scorer. West Indies, who resumed on 23 without loss, lost their first wicket in the fourth over of the day when Steyn trapped debutant Brenton Parchment in front for 20. Daren Ganga's patient 11, which he scored off 58 balls, was ended when he steered a delivery from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini into the hands of Jacques Kallis at second slip. Runako Morton hit seven fours in his 37 before shouldering arms to a delivery from medium pacer Shaun Pollock to be dismissed leg-before. Samuels and Dwayne Bravo halted the slide with a stand that reached 144 before Bravo was trapped in front by Steyn for 75 in the first over after tea. Steyn ripped through the tail with the second new ball, taking the last three wickets to fall while just 12 runs were added to the total. Steyn caught and bowled Darren Sammy for 17 before clean-bowling Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards, both for ducks. The match ended with the fall of West Indies' ninth wicket because Shivnarine Chanderpaul did not bat due to the effects of influenza. West Indies won the first test by 128 runs in Port Elizabeth. South Africa levelled the series with a seven-wicket win in Cape Town
