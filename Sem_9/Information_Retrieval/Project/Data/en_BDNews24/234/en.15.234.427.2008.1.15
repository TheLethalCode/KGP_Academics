 Taipei, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Panama-registered freighter sank off the west coast of Taiwan after being struck by a wave, killing eight crew and leaving four missing, the coastguard said on Tuesday. The ship, which set out from Hong Kong with a crew from China and loaded with gravel, sank about 20 nautical miles off Taiwan early on Monday, said Taiwan coastguard spokesman Hsieh Ching-ching. Winds west of Taiwan are normally strong in January. "When the wave hit, water rushed into the ship and it immediately sank," Hsieh said. A coastguard search team of five vessels and six helicopters had found 13 survivors. A Panama-registered freighter sank off the Taiwan coast in November, killing all but one of the 28 crew.
