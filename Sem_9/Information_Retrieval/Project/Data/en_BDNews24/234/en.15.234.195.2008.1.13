<TITLE> Britain could be in Afghanistan for decades: Browne </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defence Secretary Des Browne has warned that Britain could be engaged in Afghanistan for decades. Asked when British soldiers would be withdrawn from Afghanistan, he told Sunday's The People newspaper: "We cannot risk it again becoming an ungoverned training haven for terrorists who threaten the UK." He said: "It is a commitment which could last decades, although it will reduce over time." "But there is only so much our forces can achieve. The job can only be completed by the international community working with the Afghan government and its army," he added. Britain, which has about 7,800 troops operating in Afghanistan in a 40,000-strong NATO stabilisation force, is expected to increase that number as it draws down in Iraq. A Defence Ministry spokeswoman stressed that Britain's role in Afghanistan would evolve over time. "The British government's commitment to Afghanistan is long term and it's not just a military commitment," she told Reuters. "Previously it was a failed state and it's going to be a long-term commitment to make sure it's a stable country."
