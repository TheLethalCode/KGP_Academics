 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday defended the government's record on the economy in the face of widespread criticism that it failed to address ongoing problems. The advisor, however, acknowledged that his administration had not been successful in tackling soaring inflation, which reached 11.21 percent on a point-to-point basis in November. "All economic indicators, except inflation are doing well," Azizul told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase at the planning ministry. He also quoted the chief adviser, who highlighted some improvements in the economy in his latest televised speech Saturday. Economists and other experts claim the economy has become stagnant under the present regime, leading to widespread suffering across the country. Bangladesh's development partners, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund have all forecast a lower economic growth rate of around 5.5 percent for the current fiscal year. The government, however, projected economic growth at 7 percent in this year's budget. Azizul claimed the government's policy of improved disbursement of industrial term-loans and agriculture loans, along with increased exports and raw material imports have benefited the economy. Referring to these improvements the adviser said: "Where are these going if the economy has become stagnant or gone down?" "I disagree with the critics who say the economy has lost its growth pace or become stagnant," he said. Azizul conceded that the import of capital machinery had declined, which he said may be due to entrepreneurs using domestically made machines. The purchase committee has approved shipping charges worth Tk 48.36 crore for the import of one lakh tonnes urea, 50,000 tonnes each from Qatar Fertiliser Company and Ruiz Fertiliser Company. The committee also approved purchase of 60,000 tonnes granular urea from Kafco Bangladesh, at Tk 112.86 crore. A tender proposal for construction of roads in three Upazilas in Sunamganj District was also approved at 39.94 crore. The project is being jointly funded by the government and the International Development Association. The committee also approved the tender of the lowest bidder for supply and installation of power system metering equipment at about Tk 26 crore. Advisers and committee members Anwarul Iqbal, AF Hasan Ariff and Golam Quadir were present at the meeting. bd
