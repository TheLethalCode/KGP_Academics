 WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will send an additional force of about 3,200 Marines to Afghanistan to help NATO forces combat Taliban militants and to train Afghan security forces, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. The US troop expansion, which increases the number of US forces deployed to Afghanistan by more than 10 percent, follows months of US effort to persuade NATO allies to provide extra combat forces. Violence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.
