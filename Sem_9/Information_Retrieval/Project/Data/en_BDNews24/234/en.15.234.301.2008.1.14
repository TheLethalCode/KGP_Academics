<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand wrapped up their two-test series against Bangladesh when they bowled the visitors out for 113 just before lunch on the third day of the second test at the Basin Reserve on Monday. New Zealand won the match by an innings and 137 runs, and wrapped up the test inside for three days for the second time. They won the first test in Dunedin by nine wickets. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said he could fault his team for how quickly they won the match but said they would have preferred a tougher workout before the upcoming home series against England. "I suppose it's always a concern of ours that we might not play enough first class cricket or test cricket," he told a news conference. "But we do get a chance to come up against England in the one-dayers and Twenty20, so we get a real good feel for what we're up against." All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was dropped by Matthew Bell in the slips early in the day top-scored for the visitors with a defiant 41 not out. Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal did not bat in the second innings after he broke his thumb while fielding on Sunday. Resuming on 51 for five and with little hope of saving the test, Bangladesh lost batting mainstay Habibul Bashar in the first over of the day when he only made a half stride forward and was trapped in front by Chris Martin for 25. Shahadat Hossain was the next to fall when he poked his bat at a swinging delivery from Iain O'Brien before Sajidul Islam was run out for three after a mix-up with Shakib. Shakib and Mushrafe Mortaza then combined for the most productive partnership of the Bangladesh innings by adding 30 runs for the ninth wicket before Mortaza was the last wicket to fall when he was caught by Kyle Mills off Jacob Oram for six. All four of New Zealand's front line pace bowlers took two wickets each with Chris Martin, who took five in the first innings, named man of the match. Bangladesh's Australian coach Jamie Siddons said the results showed how far his team were behind the traditional cricket playing nations but remains confident they can bridge the gap. "We've got a massive amount of work to do. This series expresses the difference in experience between the two sides," Siddons said. "These guys just didn't have the experience to mix it with a New Zealand side on a Wellington wicket that did a bit. "We've made progress, not in scores on the board, but in terms of hope -- or potential. "The potential of our two opening bowlers (Mashrafe Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain) is enormous and I see good things in the potential of our openers (Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique). "Down the track in two years time those guys are going to be pretty hard to dismiss. I see Mohammad Ashraful, with an average of 25, averaging 45. "There's some good things there -- we just have to fill a few holes.
