 Wana, Pakistan, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Militants in northwest Pakistan attacked a paramilitary camp and up to 30 soldiers were missing, security officials said on Wednesday. The militants attacked the camp in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border late on Tuesday, the officials said. A military official said there had been fighting in the area but he did not have details. "About 700 militants attacked the fort at Sara Rogha at about 9:30 p.m. (1630 GMT on Tuesday) and communication with the fort was cut at around 2 a.m.," a security official said. "There were about 37 paramilitary troops in the fort and seven of them were able to escape while the rest of them are missing and feared dead," said the official, who declined to be identified. Security forces have been battling al Qaeda-linked militants in South Waziristan for several years. Separately, a bomb exploded as a military patrol was passing along a road in the Swat valley in North West Frontier Province on Wednesday but there was no immediate word on casualties, police said.
