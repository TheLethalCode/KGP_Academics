<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser MA Matin Tuesday said he was not thinking of resignation, contrary to a newspaper report that he was quitting office. Matin, however, added that he would resign his office nevertheless if the government so wished. "I don't intend to quit at the moment. I wouldn't be attending office if I contemplated resignation," said the land, shipping and liberation war affairs adviser to reporters at his office. He dismissed the report published in a daily as "ill-motivated". "The news that I'm resigning office was published at the instigation of a certain group of people." "I deny it. Although I will resign if the government wants me to go." Replying to a question, the former communications and civil aviation adviser said, "Change of portfolios for a minister or an adviser is a routine business." "Besides, my newest charge, the land ministry, should be considered crucial and important, to my mind." Asked if his failure to manage the communications and civil aviation ministries led to the reshuffle in his portfolios, Matin said he did not think so. The government will begin dialogues with the political parties when the time was right, he said replying to another query. bdnews24.com
