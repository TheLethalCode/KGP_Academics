<TEXT>
 Brussels, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will propose allowing the poorest new central European member states to increase greeenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 percent by 2020 over 2005 levels under a major energy and climate change plan to be unveiled next week, EU sources said on Monday. The sources said the 15 old member states would bear the brunt of cuts required to meet the 27-nation European Union's goal of an overall reduction of 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels, with national targets set according to GDP per capita. Under the proposals, which could still be changed before the Jan. 23 announcement, the richest old member states will have to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas blamed for global warming, by up to 20 percent from 2005 levels.
