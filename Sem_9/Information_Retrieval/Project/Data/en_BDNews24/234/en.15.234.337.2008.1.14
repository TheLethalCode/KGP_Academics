<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful Kenyan cabinet minister rejected on Monday mediation by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying there was no problem to solve because President Mwai Kibaki won last month's election. "If Kofi Annan is coming, he's not coming at our invitation," Roads and Public Works Minister John Michuki told reporters. "As far as we are concerned, we won an election we don't have a problem to be solved here," said Kibaki's ally, who is known to be a hardliner. Annan is due in Kenya on Tuesday to try to kickstart dialogue between Kibaki and his opposition rival Raila Odinga over the disputed Dec. 27 vote which triggered violence that has killed more than 600 people.
