<TEXT>
 Moscow, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The man leading the fight against organised crime and Islamic militants in the southern Russian Kabardino-Balkaria region was shot dead by unidentified assailants, Itar-Tass news agency reported on Sunday. Officials said the attack, in which a fellow police officer was also killed and another wounded when their vehicle was fired upon, had been planned in advance, but gave no indication of who might have been behind it. They opened a criminal rather than a "terrorist" investigation -- invoked when militant involvement is suspected. Radical Islamist groups have been banned by the local Moscow-backed government in Kabardino-Balkaria, where crime is widespread and dissatisfaction with unemployment runs high. But attacks on officials are rare, unlike nearby Caucasus regions riven by a spillover of a long-running separatist insurgency in neighbouring Chechnya. "In the course of an exchange of fire, in which the officers were heavily outgunned by the assailants, the head of UBOP (department in charge of tackling organised crime) Anatoly Kyarov and chief detective Albert Rakhayev were killed," Tass quoted a local police spokesman as saying. "Junior detective Tatuyev was also wounded and rushed to hospital," the spokesman added. A Chechen rebel internet site (www.kavkazcenter.com), posted a statement saying rebels had planned the attack originally against the head of the FSB federal security service Nikolai Patrushev, who was expected to be in town on that day. It said Kyarov was not viewed as a target. No other sources reported this claim and the FSB could not be immediately reached for comment. In October 2005, more than 100 rebels linked to Chechen separatists raided Nalchik trying to seize key official buildings in the town. Forty-four police and civilians and 90 militants were killed in a one-day battle. News agencies said investigation had been launched under criminal code articles dealing with "attack on officials". A different article dealing with "terrorism" is normally invoked in cases when separatist attack is suspected.
