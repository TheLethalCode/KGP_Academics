 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday expressed discontent over poor ADP implementation. Azizul said that the ADP implementation was 16 percent during the first five monthsuntil November of the current fiscal yearagainst 20 percent for the same period in fiscal 2006-07 and 19 percent in fiscal 2005-06. "I'm not satisfied at the progress," he told reporters after reviewing the ADP (annual development programme) of the LGRD ministry at his planning ministry office. Until November, LGRD ministry's ADP implementation was 24 percent, which the adviser said was lower than the performance in the previous two years. The size of the ADP for the current fiscal year is Tk 26,500 crore. "ADP will have to undergo major improvements in the second half of the fiscal year to ensure implementation," he said. The adviser hoped the situation would improve by the end of January. Azizul said: "Money will be transferred to more important projects from the less important ones." Replying to a query on the budget deficit, the finance adviser said that it (money) would not be a problem if the revenue growth continued to maintain its pace and donors disbursed pledged money. The National Board of Revenue achieved more than 22 percent revenue collection growth in the first half of the current fiscal year ending in December. The revenue collections rose to Tk 19,502 crore compared to Tk 15,890 crore of the corresponding period last fiscal. The annual budget has set collecting Tk 43,850 crore from the NBR during the current fiscal year. The income tax department of the NBR showed the highest growth of 41.90 percent, Tk 4,125 crore as against Tk 2,907 crore during the corresponding period of last year. bd
