<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A smiling Lindsay Davenport made a triumphant return to grand slam tennis on Monday, beating Italian Sara Errani 6-2 3-6 7-5 in the first round of the Australian Open. The American, who returned to the tour in September after a year out in which she became a mother for the first time, recovered from 4-2 down in the final set to set up an intriguing clash with Russian fifth seed Maria Sharapova. Former world number one Davenport admitted she never thought she would be back playing at a grand slam event. "All these places I felt like I would never play again," Davenport said. "And just to play a grand slam again, I never thought I would be in this arena again in my career. "It's been a lot of fun. There were definitely a lot more nerves than I thought there would be. And it was tough to get through it, but I'm happy I did. It's exciting to get back on the biggest stage we have in tennis." Since returning to the circuit, Davenport has been in superb form, winning three titles in four events. Errani forced her to dig deep for victory, though, and the crowd were even treated to the unusual sight of Davenport berating the umpire, late in the third set. "It was definitely the most challenging match I've had since coming back," she said. "I was so excited about coming back here and a lot of anticipation. Ironically, I probably played the worst that I've played since I've been back." "But at the end of the day, I got through it. I'm happy to have won and toughed it out there at the end." Davenport's match with fifth seed Sharapova has all the makings of the highlight of the tournament's first week. And the American said she was looking forward to the challenge. "It will be interesting," she said. "It will be the first grand slam winner I've played since being back. "And she's a great player. She's one of the few players I don't have a winning record against probably in the draw. We play very similar styles. She's outplayed me the last couple times we played. "I'm going to have to hit the ball well, be more aggressive than I was today, just basically do everything a lot cleaner.
