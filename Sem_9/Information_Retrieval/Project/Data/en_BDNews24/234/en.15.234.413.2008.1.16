 Mexico City, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexican Interior Minister Francisco Ramirez Acuna is resigning, a source close to the government told Reuters on Tuesday, without being able to providefurther details. The interior ministry was not immediately available to comment on the resignation, also reported on the Web site of the Mexican daily El Universal. Heading the interior ministry is one of Mexico's toughest posts as the government fights a year-old battle with powerful drug cartels whose daily gangland-style killings left more than 2,500 people dead across the country last year. President Felipe Calderon is expected to give details of the move, and another change to his cabinet, at a press briefing on Wednesday morning. Earlier on Tuesday Calderon named former deputy finance minister Ernesto Cordero as his new social development minister, replacing Beatriz Zavala who stepped down on Monday. Ramirez Acuna is a former governor of the western state of Jalisco and a long-time ally of Calderon, a conservative.
