<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Liberal Democratic Party Monday demanded elections in June if possible. LDP president Oli Ahmed demanded a clear schedule for the Jatiya Sangsad elections, putting forward a 21-point recommendation to the government. Speaking at a press conference at the party's central office in Mogh Bazar, Oli said: "Doubt has been created in the public mind about the election. A specific date for the polls should be announced to remove the doubt." He also demanded permission for indoor politics as soon as possible and withdrawal of the state of emergency in phases. Oli's 21-point recommendation includes steps to contain commodities prices, privatisation of Bangladesh Betar, disqualifying war criminals, corrupt and black money holders from contesting elections, appointment of an ombudsman and refraining from fresh demarcation of Jatiya Sangsad constituencies. He charged that the government had still not promulgated any ordinance to make the Election Commission independent. "It had created doubt in the minds of people over a fair election." Giving the rationale for his demand for a quick election, he said: "Elections were held in June and September in the past. It is possible to hold elections quickly if there is a will." Evaluating one year of the caretaker government, Oli said: "They have done many praiseworthy works which people will remember in future." He thanked the government for separation of the judiciary and strengthening the Public Service Commission and Anticorruption Commission. Replying to a question, the LDP president said: "Two advisers who quit the governmentbarrister Mainul Hosein and Tapan Chowdhuryhave done much harm to the country." "They have frequently misused power to brighten their own image. Law should take its own course in taking action against them," Oli said. bdnew
