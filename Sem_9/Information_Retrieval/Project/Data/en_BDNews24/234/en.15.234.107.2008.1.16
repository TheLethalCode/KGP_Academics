<TITLE> Kenya faces nationwide opposition protests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Katie Nguyen NAIROBI, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan youths erected roadblocks and traders nailed metal sheets across shop windows while the opposition vowed to go ahead with three days of banned protests from Wednesday over President Mwai Kibaki's re-election. Although Kibaki has been quick to entrench himself since the Dec. 27 vote by naming a core cabinet and convening parliament, the opposition led by Raila Odinga received a boost when their candidate won the post of speaker in the assembly on Tuesday. Opposition members cheered when Kenneth Marende was named the winner after a close vote in the first sitting of the house since Kibaki's disputed win unleashed a wave of bloodshed that has killed more than 600 people. In the western opposition stronghold of Kisumu, Odinga supporters in crowded bars raised a toast to the parliamentary victory as they watched televised proceedings that spilled into the early hours of Wednesday. "We are very happy," said David Otieno, who rides a bicycle taxi. "We are drinking and eating meat and getting ready to pour into town for a massive peace rally." Reflecting the opposition's bitterness over last month's presidential vote, one of their legislators swore allegiance to "President Odinga" before being ordered to retake the oath. Kenya's political crisis has jeopardised its democratic credentials, angered donors, driven tourists away and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies. Western powers and Kenya's east African neighbours have complained of irregularities in the presidential vote count, which Odinga says was rigged. Thirteen donors, including the European Union and the United States, threatened in a statement on Tuesday to withdraw direct aid to the government if its commitment to "good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens". In a blow to prospects for ending the political deadlock, former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who was expected in Nairobi on Tuesday, delayed his mission for several days due to illness. The opposition pledged to continue its anti-Kibaki struggle through international mediation, parliament where it holds a majority, and peaceful mass action. But many Kenyans fear the threat of nationwide opposition rallies would trigger more clashes between police and protesters. Some flocked to supermarkets for supplies of milk and bread before rushing home. There were early signs of trouble. In a Nairobi slum, opposition supporters taunted police patrolling the area, while in Kisumu a taxi driver said his car window was smashed by youths manning a makeshift roadblock.
