 ABU DHABI, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush said on Sunday that Iran was threatening security around the world by backing `extremists' and urged its Gulf Arab allies to "confront this danger before it is too late". Speaking in Abu Dhabi, the third stop of his tour of Arab allies, Bush said that Shi'ite Muslim Iran was the world's number one sponsor of terrorism and accused it of undermining peace by supporting the Hezbollah guerrilla group in Lebanon, Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Shi'ite militants in Iraq. "Iran's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the Gulf and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late," he said in his keynote speech. "Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home," he said. Returning to familiar themes that have been at the core of Bush's approach during seven years in the White House, the president praised democratisation efforts in the Arab world and urged his allies to embrace open politics and open economies. Earlier in the day, Bush visited the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain amid new tensions with Iran over an incident in which Washington says its ships were harassed in the Strait of Hormuz. The United States says Iranian boats threatened its warships on Jan. 6 along the vital route for crude oil shipments from the world's biggest producing region. Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, commander of the Fifth Fleet, made it clear to Bush his forces took the incident "deadly seriously," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. "All of the people in the military remember what's happened in the past such as the USS Cole," she said, referring to the attack on the US warship in Yemen in 2000 using a boat packed with explosives. During a stop in Israel at the start of Bush's Middle East trip last week, he warned Iran of "serious consequences" if it attacked U.S. ships and said all options were on the table. Tehran has dismissed the incident as routine and accused the United States of exaggerating it for propaganda purposes. "We exercised restraint and we very calmly announced that this was a routine procedure but they tried to ... raise this issue at the same time when Mr Bush was travelling to the region in order to paint Iran in a negative light," Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told reporters. PUSH TO ISOLATE IRAN On the visit to Bahrain, Bush entered a US naval mess hall to loud applause and shouted "good morning" to the military personnel before joining them for breakfast. In Abu Dhabi, Bush was greeted in light drizzle by United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan and Vice President and ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, before heading to the palace for talks and lunch. He will visit some sights in Abu Dhabi and Gulf trade hub Dubai on Monday before heading to Saudi Arabia and Egypt in a bid to drum up backing for Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Bush, who last year said that a nuclear-armed Iran could mean "World War Three", also hopes to boost US efforts to isolate Tehran. The Bush administration has kept up a campaign of rhetoric despite a US intelligence report in December that concluded that Iran had halted its nuclear arms programme in 2003. Tehran says it wants nuclear technology for civilian reasons and agreed on Sunday to clarify the remaining questions about nuclear work in the next month, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Bush insists that Iran remains a threat. Washington's Arab allies say they share US concerns about Tehran's growing regional influence but want containment without resort to military force. Iran's Hosseini said US efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic had failed as Gulf Arabs had been actively engaging it. "What we have witnessed was a very good and clever and alert response of countries in the region towards this, let's say, bad policy of the United States and this has not been given any credit, these policies," he said at a weekly news conference. "Along with the use of such policies by the Americans we witness a surge in convergence between countries of the region and the Islamic Republic of Iran." Kuwait has repeatedly said it will not allow the United States to use its territory for any strike against Iran. Saudi Arabia said ahead of Bush's arrival in the Gulf that it would listen to the president but that it had direct contacts with its neighbour and could directly talk through any proble
