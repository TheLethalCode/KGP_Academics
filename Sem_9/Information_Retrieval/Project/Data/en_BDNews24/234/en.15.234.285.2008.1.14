 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English champions Manchester United thrashed Newcastle United 6-0 to take the Premier League lead in a high-scoring weekend across the big European leagues. French champions Olympique Lyon moved six points clear at the top of Ligue 1 with a 3-2 win over Toulouse and Ajax beat AZ Alkmaar 6-1 to take second place from fierce rivals Feyenoord in the Netherlands. AC Milan and Paris St Germain both broke a season-long habit of failing to win at home in league play, with the Italians defeating Napoli 5-2 in Serie A. ENGLAND Manchester United took over top spot in the Premier League with a 6-0 hammering of managerless Newcastle United after Arsenal could only draw 1-1 at home with Birmingham City.
