 COLOMBO, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Tamil Tigers killed three people with a roadside bomb in northern Sri Lanka on Monday while government planes bombed a rebel base, the military said, as a Japanese envoy sought to revive a collapsed peace process. The blast in the northern district of Vavuniya killed two soldiers and a civilian, and wounded four other people, the army said, the latest in a spree of attacks as a 25-year civil war escalates.

The truce technically expires on Jan. 16, by which time Nordic truce monitors have also been asked to leave the country. Analysts, diplomats and civilians alike are bracing for violence that has killed well over 5,000 people since 2006 to intensify. Leading donors Norway, Japan, the United States and the European Union on Saturday called on the foes to protect civilians and allow humanitarian agencies access to affected populations. The government has vowed to wipe out the Tigers militarily, setting the stage for what many fear will be a bloody battle for the north as a death toll of around 70,000 people since the war erupted in 1983 climbs dai
