 MELBOURNE, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped opening batsman Chris Rogers has been added to Australia's squad for the third test against India in Perth as cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Sunday. Hayden is nursing a hamstring injury he sustained in the second test and Rogers has been brought in to the squad in case he does not recover in time for the first day's play on Jan. 16. "Matthew has taken part in training today," Australia team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said in a CA statement on Sunday. "We will continue with the programme on his hamstring and make a decision about Matthew's fitness and availability much closer to game time." Western Australia's Rogers will train with the squad from Monday
