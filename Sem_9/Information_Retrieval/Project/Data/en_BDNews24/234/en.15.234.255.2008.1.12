 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Gulshan police Saturday recorded a complaint against former adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, and husband Nazim Kamran Choudhury for allegedly threatening a house owner in the city. The complaint was the second in two days against the couple. Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque said Farhana Islam filed a general diary alleging that Geeteara and her husband had illegally entered her property Saturday and made threats against her. Farhana's property houses commercial offices run by the couple. In her complaint Farhana said that the tenants had entered the property by breaking locks. Farhana had filed a previous general diary Friday against Geeteara and Nazim. The two were accused of not vacating the propertywhich houses the offices of their companies Adcomm, Megavision and Signagedespite the expiry of a rental agreement. Group 4 Securicor, which is in charge of the security of the building, was also accused in the case. On Jan 10, the complainant filed cases against the four companies including Group 4 Securicor on charges of "illegal occupation" of land. Nazim Kamran brushed aside the allegations, terming them false. "The allegations are false. She (Farhana) can be the owner of the house but I have my offices there." He turned the tables on Farhana, saying: "She can't enter my offices even if she is the owner of the building." "We have rented the property and are staying legally. The court has allowed us to stay here. We can stay here until the court says otherwise," Kamran told bdnews24.com by phone late Saturday. Kamran claimed that he has the right to use the building under the Premises Rent Control Act. bdnews
