 BARCELONA, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona knocked holders Sevilla out of the King's Cup on the away goals rule on Tuesday after a battling 0-0 draw at the Nou Camp. Frank Rijkaard's side, who drew 1-1 in last week's first leg, were put under heavy pressure by Sevilla but held their nerve to book their place in the quarter-finals. Barca will now meet the winners of Wednesday's tie between Recreativo Huelva and Villarreal. "It was a titanic effort from both teams," said Barcelona president Joan Laporta. "In the end we had the luck to go through, but Sevilla are a great team and we saw two of the best sides in Europe competing out there." Sevilla coach Manolo Jimenez said the tie had turned on Thierry Henry's away goal in the first leg. "It was a very evenly balanced tie, but a great piece of skill from Henry proved to be decisive and that was what allowed his team to get through." The game got off to a high tempo start with Sevilla keeping Barca on the rack in the opening minutes as they went in search of an early goal. Striker Ernesto Chevanton had a great opportunity with seconds on the clock, just failing to connect when Daniel Alves curled a cross behind the Barca back four. Barca refused to wilt under the pressure, however, and had several chances of their own with Andres Iniesta lashing over the bar after a jinking run into the area and Henry and Eidur Gudjohnsen both going close with shots from distance. Alves almost broke the deadlock with a fierce dipping shot late on in the second half, while winger Jesus Navas had the ball in the net minutes later only to see the goal ruled out for offside. Barca's arch-rivals Real Madrid will need to overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit when they host Real Mallorca at the Bernabeu on Wednesday if they are to join the Catalans in the last eight
