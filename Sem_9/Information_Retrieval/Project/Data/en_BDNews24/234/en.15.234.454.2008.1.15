<TITLE> World leaders queasy over record oil prices </TITLE>

 LONDON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World leaders are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with oil near $100, saying prices at these heights pose a threat to their already vulnerable economies. Many analysts say oil prices are likely to stay near current levels, which when adjusted for inflation sparked a deep recession in the 1970s. In Riyadh, US President George W Bush complained on Tuesday about "very high" oil prices and promised to raise his concerns with his Saudi host King Abdullah. French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday said the real price of oil should be around $70 a barrel, blaming speculators for the extra $30. Even Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is normally a price hawk, said he hoped the price of crude oil wouldn't go beyond $100 a barrel but admitted it probably would. Leaders are worried that high oil prices will push the world economy, already shaken by a credit crisis and a battered dollar, into a recession. But economists and market experts say the world has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. "High oil prices will not tip the world into a recession. The economy is more resilient than it was in the 1970s," said Kevin Norrish, analyst at Barclays Capital. "The industry's dependence on oil is much less now. And oil demand is growing very fast where incomes are also growing quickly as well," he added. NO SURPRISE Analysts predicted oil prices will stay near current levels this year as global supplies remain tight and demand continues to grow. Oil rallied to a lifetime peak of $100.09 on Jan. 3 as U.S. crude stockpiles dwindled, tensions in Nigeria and the Middle East escalated, and the dollar weakened. "If (speculators) are going long, it is because there is an underlying factor of tight fundamentals or at least the perception that things may soon get tight," said Mike Wittner, global head of oil research at Societe Generale. A Reuters poll of 36 analysts last month put the consensus forecast for U.S. crude futures this year at a record average of $77.62 a barrel, up from $72.30 in 2007. Analysts believe that the market is accurately representing a short-term outlook for tighter global supplies and increasing demand from China, India and the Middle East. French President Sarkozy, along with most OPEC ministers, also blame speculators for record high prices. "$20-$30 is the outside influence on the price of oil," influential Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Tuesday. "If you look at who is in the market, you'll find a lot of financial institutions, players who are speculating, using the market as a hedge." Analysts acknowledge that an influx of new fund money has quickened the market's rally. But they say this has only emphasized the widely held belief that oil will continue to rise in the short-term due to tight fundamentals. "Somebody is putting real money into oil at $94 a barrel and I think that President Sarkozy should short some oil ... if he really believes that its all speculators," said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Ba
