<TITLE> Kenya crisis death toll seen at around 600 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll in Kenya has risen to about 600 from more than two weeks of unrest since President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election, aid agencies said on Monday. "It could go higher, particularly if there is more trouble, but 600 is the most accurate picture we have at the moment," said Ken Maclean, country representative of Catholic Relief Service. The local Red Cross said it had verified 575 deaths by Friday, but expected that to rise and would give a new toll later on Monday. Previous estimates had put the toll at around 500. Most of the deaths have come from fighting between rival ethnic communities, clashes between police and protesters, plus looting and mob violence, witnesses say. The worst trouble was in the immediate aftermath of Kibaki's declaration as winner three days after the Dec. 27 vote, which the opposition says was rigged. More than 250,000 Kenyans have also been displaced by the violence. Former U.N. head Kofi Annan is due to fly into Kenya on Tuesday to try and help mediate a crisis which has dented the east African nation's democratic credentials and previously booming economy.
