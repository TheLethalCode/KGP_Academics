 BEIRUT, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb targeted a US diplomatic vehicle in Beirut on Wednesday, killing at least three people, but the US State Department said no Americans were hurt in the blast. "There were no American diplomats or American citizens in the car at the time. There were four Beirut residents who do not work for the embassy who were killed in the blast," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. Security sources in Beirut had put the toll at three dead and 16 wounded, including an American passenger, in the explosion which hit the armoured US four-by-four vehicle in a Christian neighbourhood in the north of the capital. The blast, which the Lebanese security sources said had targeted the US diplomatic vehicle, occurred as President George W. Bush visited Saudi Arabia as part of a week-long Middle East tour. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene. A column of smoke rose into the sky and was visible across the city. Television pictures showed blackened cars and twisted metal alongside fallen masonry from nearby buildings. Rescue workers covered a corpse with plastic sheeting. Lebanese and U.S. security officials were at the scene. Two passengers of a car behind the US vehicle were killed. The third victim had been walking nearby. Lebanon has seen more than 30 explosions in the past three years, many targeting anti-Syrian politicians and journalists. Last week a roadside bomb wounded two U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. The United States is a strong backer of the Beirut government, which has been locked in a power struggle with the Hezbollah-led opposition for more than a year. Hezbollah is backed by Syria and Iran. Listed by Washington as a terrorist group, Hezbollah last week described Bush's visit as a "black day" for the region. Bush has not visited Lebanon during his tour.
