<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)  The recently launched Kalyan Party Tuesday demanded the holding of Jatiya Sangsad elections immediately after the completion of voter ID cards. Party chairman Syed Muhammad Ibrahim made the demand from a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium, where he also urged the caretaker government to start lifting the indoor politics ban in all districts by the end of January. "National elections can no longer be held in the country without ID cards. If the work can be completed quickly there is no problem in holding elections in even June," said the retired major general. "The country can in no way be allowed to slide back to the pre-January 11 situation; it will not be allowed," Ibrahim said at his first press conference after launching the Kalyan Party on Dec 4. He also asked the government to immediately start the process of identifying war criminals for trial. Ibrahim proposed that the government withdraw the state of emergency in phases, allowing indoor politics in all districts from January in the first phase. "The government has to take the step to make political activities easier in phases." The Kalyan Party chairman said his party is working towards running for the next election. "A huge number of politically active people are involving themselves in our campaign throughout the country." On the promulgation of the state of emergency, he said: "We consider the post-January 11 period as a symbol of reconstruction, upholding rule of law, reform and the constitution." "It saved the country from confrontational politics." He also thanked the political parties and the governments from 1991 to 2006 for the country's growth, development and raising Bangladesh's profile abroad. However, he regretted that criminalisation and commercialisation of politics, the rise of dynastic politics and political vendettas had become institutionalised during the period. Ibrahim hoped that the steps taking by the caretaker government and the assistance extended to the government by the armed forces would return democratic stability to the country. "The armed forces deserve a share of thanks that is due to the present government for its various successes," he said. bdnews
