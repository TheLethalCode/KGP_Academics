<TITLE> Thousands attend anti-king unity rally in Nepal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Nepal's seven-party ruling alliance, including Maoist former rebels, marched through Kathmandu on Monday in a rare display of unity in the fractious coalition against the Hindu monarchy. The rally, held in a dust-choked playground in the heart of the capital, less than 500 metres (yards) from King Gyanendra's sprawling palace, came three days after the government set national elections for April 10. At least five people were wounded in a bomb blast near the venue after the rally ended and police said they were investigating. The polls are meant to elect a constituent assembly to map the nation's political future and formalise a recent parliament decision to abolish the monarchy after the vote. Originally, the assembly was meant to decide the fate of the monarchy -- a question now settled in a political deal with the former rebels who wanted its immediate abolition. That body will also replace the interim parliament. "This rally is to demonstrate our commitment not to postpone the elections again," said Sunil Prajapati, leader of the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party, a junior partner. The vote was last set for Nov. 22 but was delayed because of a deadlock with the Maoists who wanted the king to be booted out before the polls. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 83, who was earlier expected to address the meeting, kept away because of fever and symptoms of chest and throat infection, organisers said. Prachanda, chief of the once-feared Maoists, told the estimated 30,000 crowd that similar meetings would be held across the country's restive southern plains before the polls. "The rally is a commitment and a declaration for a new Nepal and for a federal republican Nepal after the polls," Prachanda told the crowd, which waved white, blue, and red hammer and sickle flags. Analysts say ethnic tensions in the southern Terai plains are a challenge. Scores of people were killed last year in ethnic violence and in clashes or local disputes between dozens of rebel as well as marginalised groups seeking regional autonomy and more inclusive elections. The turmoil cast a shadow over a 2006 peace deal with the Maoists that ended their decade-long civil war which killed more than 13,000 people. Ian Martin, chief of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), which is monitoring the peace process and the polls, urged the government to engage marginalised and other groups that have not committed to the elections yet.
