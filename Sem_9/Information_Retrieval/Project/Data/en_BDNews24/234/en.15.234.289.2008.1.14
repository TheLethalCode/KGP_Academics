<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Serena Williams admitted to a rare bout of nerves after making a stuttering start to her Australian Open title defence with a 6-3 6-3 win over Jarmila Gajdosova in the first round on Monday. The American seventh seed, chasing her ninth grand slam crown, had to work hard against the Australian world number 145 before coming through to set up a clash with Yuan Meng of China. "I think I was a wee bit nervous out there," Williams told reporters. "(But) I just thought about last year, my last match on that court, I was able to win it. I didn't think about holding up the trophy. I just got right back into the swing of things and thought, 'I have to stay focused'." Sporting a white dress on top of pink cycling shorts, Williams dropped just four points on her way to a 3-0 lead but Gajdosova hit back to level at 3-3 as her opponent became unusually sluggish. Once Williams had broken in the eighth game, however, she was always in control and eased through the second set to clinch victory in 62 minutes. Williams, three-times champion at Melbourne Park, said she had taken time to find her rhythm. "I think everyone could probably tell I was a little scratchy," Williams said. "But it's the first round. (I am) just moving forward. I am happy to be back here." Gajdosova was playing under the Australian flag having switched her allegiance from Slovakia before the event and Williams said she had been impressed by her opponent. "I thought she played well," she said. "I thought she definitely has a lot of power and she has a really good serve. Actually, I think she has a really, really good return.
