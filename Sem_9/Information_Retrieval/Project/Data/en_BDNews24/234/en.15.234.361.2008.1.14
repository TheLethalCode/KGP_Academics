 MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixth seed Andy Roddick blew Czech qualifier Lukas Dlouhy off the court 6-3 6-4 7-5 to reach the Australian Open second round on Monday. The American was occasionally troubled by Dlouhy, including one game in the second set when he was up three break points, but the former world number one simply stepped up a gear on his huge first serve. "I don't know if there was much rhythm to be had with the way he went about the match," Roddick told reporters. "It's weird to kind of feel like you got a lot out of it when some guy's taking the first ball and just charging." Roddick broke Dlouhy early in the first set and although the Czech responded with his own break, the American powered through with his second break of the set. He broke Dlouhy in the first game of the second set and after getting into trouble in the fourth at 0-40 down on his serve he simply blasted his way out of trouble to hold and took the set with three aces in a row. While doubles specialist Dlouhy never looked like winning, he was far from disgraced and delayed the inevitable by breaking Roddick when he served for the match in the 10th game of the third set. The 25-year-old American broke back immediately, however, and made no mistake when serving for the match the second time. "I think those are the type of matches where if you're not match tough can get a little tricky," Roddick added. "I just kind of tried to stay the course and get through his kind of peaks and valleys. Roddick, who won his third successive Kooyong title last week, had no problems with the new Plexicushion court. "It's a slow hard court. On a hot day, it speeds up a lot. I think a lot of it is weather dependent. Top-spin gets up, slice stays down so it's pretty fair." Roddick will play Germany's Michael Berrer in the second round
