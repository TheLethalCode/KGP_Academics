<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's former president Suharto, who suffered multiple organ failure on Friday and is on a ventilator, was visited by his friend and contemporary, Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, on Sunday morning. Suharto, who ruled the country for more than three decades, was either sleeping or unconscious when Lee entered his room, according to former state secretary Moerdiono, who was also at Suharto's bedside. Moerdiono told reporters afterward that Lee, accompanied by Suharto's three daughters, went up to the 86-year-old former general to touch him. Lee, 84, flew in from Singapore especially to see the Suharto, but left the hospital without talking to reporters. He is due to give a news conference later on Sunday. While relations between neighbouring Singapore and Indonesia have often been difficult over the years, Lee Kuan Yew and Suharto maintained close relations. In his autobiography, Lee described Suharto, who was forced to step down in 1998 in the face of a student-led uprising, as "a quiet man, courteous and punctilious on form and protocol". "He is not an intellectual, but he has the ability to select able economists and administrators to be his ministers" Lee wrote in his autobiography. Lee appears to be the first foreign dignitary to visit Suharto in hospital. Family members have gathered there as Suharto's health deteriorated during the week, while a "who's who" of Indonesian society, including relatives, various government ministers, businessmen, religious leaders and military men, have flocked to his bedside to pay their respects. Suharto was taken to Pertamina hospital on Jan. 4 suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems. His health worsened on Friday and he was put on a ventilator. Suharto came to power after an abortive coup on Sept. 30, 1965 that was officially blamed on the communist party. Up to 500,000 people were killed in anti-communist purges in the months that followed. After Suharto quit office, he was charged with embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars of state funds, but the government later dropped the case due to his poor health. He and his family deny any wrongdoing
