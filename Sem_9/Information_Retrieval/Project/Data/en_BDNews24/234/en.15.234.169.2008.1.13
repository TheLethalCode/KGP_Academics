 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) - The chief adviser's special assistant Prof M Tamim Sunday said a comprehensive energy network must be established in the country in conjunction with a long-term energy plan to secure the future of Bangladesh's energy needs. The BUET teacher, who has been put in charge of energy and mineral resources, briefed reporters Sunday on his first day in office. "We have some short-term problems. Of them notable is supplying gas to Chittagong. There is a shortfall in the gas supply to some power plants there." Tamim pointed to falling production in the Sangu Plant, saying that this was one of the problems that would be addressed in detail. The special assistant said gas exploration had to be as a part of a long term energy plan: "I think we have the possibility of finding gas within our territory," he said. "Bangladesh is in a better position than many other countries. It should be linked with the energy network." "The ongoing third round of oil-gas exploration must be expedited," said Tamim, former chairman of BUET's Petroleum and Mineral Resources Engineering Department. The chief adviser's special aide added that formulating an energy roadmap on the basis of a comprehensive energy policy is now essential. Tamim said the national energy policy has to look at least 25 years into the future. Tamim was appointed as a special assistant to the chief adviser Thursday and given charge of the energy and mineral resources division Saturday. He said that fuel subsidies would put further pressure on the government, which has to pay Tk 7,000 crore in subsidy next year. "Economic activity and fuel oils are interlinked," Tamim said, adding: "We will take a decision assessing the overall situation and we have to cut subsidies on fuel prices in phases. bdnews24.
