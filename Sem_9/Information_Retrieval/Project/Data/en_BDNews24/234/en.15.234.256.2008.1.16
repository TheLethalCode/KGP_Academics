<TITLE> Uganda returns favour by taking Kenya`s refugees </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Malba, Uganda, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Two weeks after violence erupted in Kenya over a disputed election, refugees are still trickling over the border into Uganda to reverse a tide of thousands that have fled bloodshed in the other direction. Looking tired and fearful as they crossed the grassy, invisible frontier between the two nations, the Kenyans joined those waiting for food aid in makeshift camps near the hilly town of Malaba. Officials say around 6,000 refugees have so far crossed into Uganda, from where tens of thousands fled civil war and brutal dictatorship in the 1970s and 80s into Kenya, once regarded as a beacon of stability in the region. "For years, I have seen Ugandans coming to us for safety every time there was a crisis. I can't believe it's me now seeking refuge in Uganda," said Danson Kariuki, 48, who escaped after his milk business was burned by an angry mob. Some 250,000 Kenyans were forced out of their homes by riots, looting and ethnically motivated attacks after President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election in a Dec. 27 poll that opposition challenger Raila Odinga says was rigged. The turmoil has killed more than 600 people. Some were victims of mobs targeting Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe in the Rift Valley, others were killed by police opening fire on protesters. Aid agencies say tens of thousands have now returned home. Some have anything left to go back to after gangs torched their homes and businesses. "I had a milk business, a house and a vehicle. Now I have nothing," said Kariuki. In the worst attack, a gang of youths trapped around 30 people hiding in a church and burned them alive. Others they hacked with machetes or shot down with poison arrows as they tried to flee. "I watched my husband running with an arrow in his back, he fell down and three men chopped him in pieces. I covered my children's eyes," said Lucy Wangui. The refugees' tales echoed atrocities committed by security agents under the rule of bloodthirsty Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who killed 300,000 and forced many more to flee into Kenya, Sudan and Congo. Ethnic rivalries continue to simmer in the camps. Local officials reported Kalenjin tribesmen, mostly loyal to Odinga, had tried to mix poison into the food of some Kikuyus. District commissioner Mpimbaza Hashaka said he had decided to separate refugees into different tribes to prevent reprisals.
