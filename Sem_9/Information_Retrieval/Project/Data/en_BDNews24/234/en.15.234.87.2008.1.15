 Washington, Jan 15 (Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates has recommended additional troops be sent to Afghanistan to augment NATO forces, but no final decision has been made on the deployment, defense officials said on Monday. The Pentagon chief will consult with President George W. Bush soon on a proposal to send 3,200 Marines to the South Asian nation, where there has been a surge in violence over the past two years, officials said. One senior official said a decision could be imminent. Gates has forwarded a recommendation on additional troops to the White House ahead of his discussion with Bush. But officials said the defense secretary would not order a deployment without first speaking to the president, who is visiting the Middle East until Wednesday. "A recommendation has been forwarded for discussion. But at this point, no decision has been made. We're still waiting," Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Mark Wright told Reuters. Wright declined to discuss details of the recommendation. The senior official said the proposal reviewed by Gates called for a substantial deployment of Marines. "That's what we're talking about," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no final decision had been reached. The White House said Bush looked forward to hearing from Gates. "President Bush is committed to helping the Afghan people deal with the Taliban and other extremists who continue to take innocent life and attempt to derail Afghanistan's progress," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. Violence in Afghanistan has been on the rise, with the hard-line Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country. The United States has about 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- the most since leading the 2001 invasion. About half serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led force, while the rest conduct missions ranging from counterterrorism to training Afghan troops. For months, Gates pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But after meeting allies in Scotland last month, he signaled a shift away from pushing them to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops. A senior Pentagon official said the United States was expected to proceed with the deployment of some 3,000 Marines to make up for the NATO shortfall. "It is widely anticipated that the secretary will soon approve a deployment of additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan to fulfill unmet NATO requirements," said a second senior defense official. CNN reported on Monday that 3,200 Marines had been notified about an impending deployment to Afghanistan. The Marine Corps had no comment.
