<TITLE> Smiling again, Henin relishes Australia trip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Relaxed, happy and smiling again, Justine Henin says she has nothing to prove as she heads into next week's Australian Open. This time last year, the Belgian was going through divorce and stayed away from Melbourne to deal with personal matters. Since then she has reunited with her formerly estranged family and has rediscovered the form that makes her world number one. After her absence in 2007, Henin is thrilled to be back. "I missed it a lot," she told reporters at Melbourne Park on Sunday. "I love Australia. I love to play here. It's a tournament that brought me a lot of joy in the past. So it's great. I'm feeling healthy. I'm feeling happy. It's just a great feeling to be here again." Henin arrives in Melbourne with form as hot as the Melbourne temperatures -- 28 match victories dating back to Wimbledon 2007. "It's great, you know. But numbers are not the most important thing. I'm here to give my best. You all have to start again in every match. You need to be at your best. I always say little details make a big difference. "A grand slam is tough. It's long. So I don't know what's going to happen for me in the next two weeks. I can tell you it's great what's happening to me. "I don't want to take it as an extra pressure. I have enough like this. So I just try to enjoy my tennis, that's the key for me.
