 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks closed higher Sunday with investors mainly betting on banks, power and mutual funds scrips. The general index crossed the 3000 mark Sunday for the first time since Dec 30. The market saw some increased transactions in anticipation of state-run Meghna Petroleum's debut on the capital market, slated for Monday. "This time retail investors are not holding their cash, or selling off to trade on the state run entity, which happened ahead of Jamuna's debut. It seems that investors have learned a lesson, albeit the hard way," said market analyst Yaweer Sayeed. "This helped retail investors make sound decisions on investments, which will surely enhance the market," added Sayeed, also CEO and managing director of AIMS of Bangladesh. Asked whether institutional investors would bid for Meghna, Sayeed said that they would likely hold back if the price level remains similar to that of Jamuna. Salahuddin Ahmed, CEO of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, expressed hope for retail investors to act rationally, and match company fundamentals before putting money on any issue. "Hypes like Jamuna create overheating in the market, which is definitely not good," he said.
