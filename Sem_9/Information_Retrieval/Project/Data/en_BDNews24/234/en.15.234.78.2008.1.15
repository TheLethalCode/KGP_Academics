 MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venus Williams survived a strong rearguard action from Yan Zi of China before advancing to the Australian Open second round with a 6-2 7-5 win on Tuesday. The Wimbledon champion led 5-2 in the second set only for world number 61 Yan to level at 5-5, but the American recovered her poise to clinch victory in 74 minutes. "I felt good out there and had a lot of fun," Williams told reporters. "I hit a lot of shots which was good. She really stayed in there, definitely made me play some balls that I wasn't expecting to come back." Eighth seed Williams, seeking her first Australian Open title, cruised through the first set, taking it on Yan's second double fault. The Chinese player broke for a 2-0 lead in the second before Williams hit back to win five successive games. A series of unforced errors from Williams allowed Yan back into the match but the six-times grand slam champion, who missed last year's Australian Open through injury, broke in the 12th game to clinch victory. "I'm definitely physically here this year so I'm looking to improve on my results. I've come close to winning. I'd like to try again.
