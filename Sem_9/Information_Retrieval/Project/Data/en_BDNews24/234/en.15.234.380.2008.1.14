 Steve Gorman BEVERLY HILLS, California, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave its top Golden Globes for television on Sunday to the new advertising-themed drama "Mad Men" on cable network AMC and HBO's recently canceled Hollywood satire "Extras." The triumph for "Mad Men," the first original drama series developed for cable TV's AMC, which started out specializing in reruns of old movies, continued the HFPA's tradition of recognizing newer, critically acclaimed TV shows. The Primetime Emmy Awards, U.S. television's top honors, have tended to show greater preference for returning favorites and big network hits. In addition to the prize for best drama series, "Mad Men" earned its star, Jon Hamm, a lead-acting award for his role as a 1960s ad executive with a major Madison Avenue firm. "Extras," starring British actor Ricky Gervais as a minor TV performer and "background artiste," won the award for best television comedy. But Gervais, who won the Emmy in September for that role, walked away empty handed. Instead, former "X-Files" star David Duchovny was named TV's best comic actor for playing an oversexed single dad and novelist struggling with writer's block in the new Showtime series "Californication." The Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy went to former "Saturday Night Live" star Tina Fey playing a beleaguered writer of a TV variety show on NBC's critically acclaimed but ratings-challenged TV network spoof "30 Rock." In fact, Fey's victory marked the only Golden Globe award this year for NBC. Another new and relatively little-seen cable show, the FX courtroom drama "Damages," scored a best actress Golden Globe for its star, five-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close, who plays a ruthless, high-stakes trial lawyer on the series. But HBO led the network tally with a total of six of the 11 Globes given out for television, three of them for the pay-cable channel's TV movie "Longford." "Longford" won the race for best miniseries or made-for-TV movie, while Jim Broadbent was named best actor in that category for his role as the late Earl of Longford, the controversial English politician famed for championing unpopular causes. Two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton grabbed an acting Golden Globe for playing a convicted killer whom Longford seeks parole.
