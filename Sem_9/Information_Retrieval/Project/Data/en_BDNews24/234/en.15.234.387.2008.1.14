<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Monday rejected a writ petition filed for Sheikh Rehana challenging a court decision to show her as a fugitive in the trial of an extortion case. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Abdul Awal issued the order. The decision came after Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque on Nov 18 ruled that Rehana was a fugitive and the trial should continue. During the hearing, Rehana's counsel Ajmalul Hossain QC claimed the legal process of issuing a summons or arrest warrant to the accused before trying her as a fugitive has not been followed in the case. Hossain added that the police report identified Rehana's residence in London, although no summons had been sent to the address. The court framed charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim in the extortion case on Jan 13. The case centers on allegations by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who accused the three of extorting Tk 2.99 crore. bdnews24
