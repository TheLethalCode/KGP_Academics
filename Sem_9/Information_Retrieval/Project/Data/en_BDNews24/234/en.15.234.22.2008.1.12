 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)Students of Dhaka College and Eden College protested for a second day Saturday against the postponement of the National University's second-year honours English examination. Traffic movement on Mirpur Road was hampered due to the agitation by the students of both colleges. National University authorities in an announcement Friday suspended the examinations scheduled for Saturday and Sunday on allegations that question papers had been leaked. About 300 Dhaka College students began a procession in protest at about 9:30pm Friday night, blocking Mirpur Road. The examination was also cancelled on Nov 11 last year on the same allegation. The university syndicate has formed an enquiry committee to probe into the possible leakage of question papers. A notice released Saturday by NU's public relations department said that the examinations would be held on Jan 29 and 30. The same notice said that the university syndicate had formed a three-member enquiry committee led by a syndicate member. bdnews
