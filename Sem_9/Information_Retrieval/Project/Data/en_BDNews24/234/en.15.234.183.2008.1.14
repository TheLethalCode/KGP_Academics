 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday halted the proceedings of the corruption case against Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil. The court also asked the Anticorruption Commission chairman and four others to explain in six weeks why the proceedings of the case would not be declared illegal. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Naim Mominur Rahman and Justice Shahidul Islam passed the order on a writ petition by Jalil. ACC deputy director Enamul Haque Chowdhury on Dec 18 last year filed the case against Jalil with Ramna Police Station, accusing the AL leader of earning Tk 65.29 lakh illegal wealth and concealing wealth worth Tk 63.82 lakh. Jalil's lawyer Azmalul Hossain said during the hearing the High Court on Dec 13 declared Jalil's detention order illegal, clearing the way for his release since there was no case against him. When the court order was on way to the office concerned, the case was filed so that Jalil did not get released. He was shown arrested in this case on Jan 1. The joint forces arrested Jalil on May 28 and the government issued detention order against him under the Special Powers Act on June 5 last year. Barrister ABM Siddiqur Rahman assisted Azmalul Hossain in the hearing. The government was represented by deputy attorney general Syeda Afsar Jahan. bdne
