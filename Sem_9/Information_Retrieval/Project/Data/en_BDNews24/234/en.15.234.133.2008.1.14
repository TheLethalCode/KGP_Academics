 PERTH, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to clear spinners Harbhajan Singh and Brad Hogg to play in this week's third test between Australia and India has presented both teams with a selection issue. Harbhajan has been allowed to continue playing while he awaits his appeal against a three-match ban for racially abusing Andrew Symonds. Harbhajan has denied the claims and lodged an appeal, while Hogg's availability was assured when India withdrew a charge of abuse against him. The Indian board (BCCI) has also withdrawn its threat to abandon the rest of the tour. With the WACA's reputation for suiting fast bowlers, neither player is guaranteed a starting place. India already have one spinner in their captain Anil Kumble and the Australians are toying with the idea of calling up express paceman Shaun Tait. "I guess history says that two spinners is unlikely at the WACA but Harbhajan is one of the strengths of the Indian team so we might look to play him," India coach Gary Kirsten told a news conference. "I think it probably is a tough dilemma because he's obviously been very much involved in this last week." Hogg could miss out to Tait, who is arguably the world's fastest bowler. "If (Tait) did play he's be a really useful weapon," Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said. "He feels comfortable bowling in these conditions and he looks fit and he's striving to make an impact at test level." Both teams are also facing the possibility of changing their batting lineups. Chris Rogers has joined the squad on standby in case Australia opener Matthew Hayden is forced to miss the match because of a hamstring problem while Virender Sehwag pushed his claims for selection with a century in the tour match in Canberra at the weekend. If Sehwag is selected as opener, that would allow Rahul Dravid to drop back to his normal batting position of number three, with Yuvraj Singh the most likely to lose his place in the side. "I'm not involved in the selection process but I'm sure they're going to ask my opinion," said Kirsten, who has joined the team as an advisor before he takes on the role of head coach in March. "From my own personal point of view, specialists in test match cricket are very important. "Sehwag got a big hundred in the last game and has the respect of the Australians for the way he plays. "That will definitely become a factor with the decision making and Rahul is probably more suited and more comfortable batting at three so that's something that I'm certainly sure will be discussed." Australia lead the series 2-0. The third test starts on Wednesday
