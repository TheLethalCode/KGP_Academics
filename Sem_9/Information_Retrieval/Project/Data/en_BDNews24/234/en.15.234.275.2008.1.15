 MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer made a smooth start to his bid for a 13th grand slam title with a 6-0 6-3 6-0 win over Diego Hartfield in the Australian Open first round on Tuesday.

"I didn't have any lapses mentally and played pretty tough. I served especially well and that is always important for me." Federer, seeking his fourth Australian Open title and third in a row, was playing his first match of the year and fell break point down in his opening service game.
