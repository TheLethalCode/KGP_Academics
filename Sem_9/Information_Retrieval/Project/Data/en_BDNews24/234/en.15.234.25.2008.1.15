<TITLE> Aziz stresses an end to SoE subsidy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday advocated eliminating subsidies on state-owned enterprises. "Subsidies can't go for an indefinite period," Azizul told a seminar on "Capacity building programme for the state-owned enterprises" at Bangladesh Enterprise Institute. "SoEs have become a financial burden on the government. It is their moral obligation to operate on a commercial basis," he said. Azizul said the SoEs should run commercially not only for the government but also for shareholders. The adviser emphasised hiring experts for the SoEs and reducing the number of government officials on the boards. BEI president Farooq Sobhan chaired the seminar. The government has to inject thousands of crores of taka into the SoEs every year. This year, the government has to subsidise the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation with about Tk 6,000 crore because of rising oil prices on the international market. Hiring experts could reduce the financial losses of the SoEs, Azizul said. "I've started the process with the SoEs under the finance ministry," he said. "Four professional chartered accountants have already been appointed to nationalised commercial banks (now public limited companies)," he said. He said the finance secretary has been asked to make a panel to select experts for SoEs, especially under the finance ministry. "Other ministries have to come up with new ideas," he added. The adviser said deputation of the government officials at SoEs creates a 'conflict of interests', which he said is not healthy for any organisation. bd
