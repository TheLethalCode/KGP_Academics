<TITLE> Barbados PM loses bid for fourth term in election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bridgetown, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barbadians voted overwhelmingly for change in an election on Tuesday, according to partial results, denying the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) an unprecedented fourth term and giving the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) the nod to form the next government. Outgoing Prime Minister Owen Arthur conceded defeat shortly after midnight, after the DLP led by David Thompson took a commanding lead in the vote in the former British colony. "The desire for change was powerful," said Arthur, speaking from his constituency. "I gave my very best in this campaign (and) don't know that I could have done anything differently." The incumbent party had largely campaigned on its record. An island of 280,000 that won independence in 1966, Barbados has overcome the decline of its once powerful sugar industry and grown relatively wealthy through high-end tourism and offshore financial services.
