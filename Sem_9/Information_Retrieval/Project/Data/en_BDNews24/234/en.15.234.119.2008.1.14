 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Primary and mass education adviser Rasheda K Choudhury Monday said there should be no doubt about the staging of the national elections in time. "There is no doubt about it," Rasheda told reporters at her office. Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday demanded elections by March-April at the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises. Asked about Hasina's statement, Rasheda said, "She has delivered her statement. She might differ with the government. But there should not be any doubt after the statement of the chief adviser about the time of election." "We are doing our job accordingly. The government and the Election Commission have already declared the roadmap. The election will take place in time." On when the government would hold dialogues with the political parties, the newly-installed adviser said, "The government has decided to hold dialogue with the political parties. It is not decided when, where and in which condition [will the talks take place]." The date will be fixed through a broader agreement, she said. "It is certain that we will sit with the political parties," the adviser added. bdnews24
