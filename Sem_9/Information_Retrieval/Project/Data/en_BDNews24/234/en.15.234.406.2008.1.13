 MADRID, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Samuel Eto'o scored two late goals for Barcelona in a 4-0 romp at home to promoted Real Murcia in the Primera Liga on Saturday. The Cameroon striker made the most of his last game before joining up with his national squad for the African Nations Cup, adding to earlier goals from Eidur Gudjohnsen and Bojan Krkic. But it was France striker Thierry Henry who drew special praise from coach Frank Rijkaard for his two assists. "Henry has nearly always played with injuries or problems since he arrived but now he is feeling well," said the Dutchman. "Now he is demonstrating his class and his talent. Today he was the principal figure on the pitch." Barca, with 40 points, closed to within four of leaders Real Madrid who visit basement club Levante on Sunday. Third-placed Espanyol, on 36, travel south to Almeria. Barca lacked spark in a low-key first half but took the lead when Gianluca Zambrotta's cross from the right was volleyed inside the far post by Iceland striker Gudjohnsen in the 27th minute. With Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi out injured and Andres Iniesta starting on the bench, the Catalans dominated early on without exciting a restless Nou Camp. Victor Valdes denied Fernando Baiano in a one-on-one just after the break before Barca increased the tempo. The ball was soon down the other end with Henry cutting to the line and crossing low for Krkic to net from close range in the 52nd. Henry was in top form and in the 77th he crossed for Eto'o to finish on a flowing break. Zambrotta struck a post in the closing stages before substitute Giovani dos Santos set up Eto'o for his second with three minutes remaining. In the late game, Athletic Bilbao claimed only their second home win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Sevilla, thanks to goals in each half from Fran Yeste and Markel Susaeta. Sevilla were up against it after defender Julien Escude was sent off just after the break. Bilbao leap from 17th to ninth, four points behind their eighth placed visitors
