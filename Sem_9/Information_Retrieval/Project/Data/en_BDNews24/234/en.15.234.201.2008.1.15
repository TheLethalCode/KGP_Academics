 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com)  The widespread use of locally manufactured low-quality CNG cylinders for vehicles has put commuters at risk, with many blaming it on lax supervision by governmental agencies. A pick-up van owner died in the capital last week when a cylinder exploded during refilling. Several other cylinders blew up in recent weeks although no other fatalities have been reported. "A committee has been formed to review the current situation," energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com recently. "We plan to have a representative from Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Ltd there when the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority issues fitness certificate to CNG vehicles." The committee will also try to find out reasons for long queues at gas stations. Joint secretary Md Alauddin, who will head the committee, said: "There is a lack of rigor in the law. The committee will investigate the entire issue and look for solutions." Ministry officials say CNG-run vehicles in Bangladesh use NGV (natural gas vehicle) cylinders. Approved by authorities in Brazil, Italy and South Korea, these cylinders are 8.5 millimetres thick. They are built to withstand pressures of 4500 pounds per cubic inch, although they can hold up pressure of up to 8000 pounds. Locally manufactured cylinders, however, commonly resist as little as 1000 pounds per cubic inch and are often made from oxygen cylinders, or even crude pipes. "These accidents happened because of improper cylinders. The government must immediately take action," vice president Monoranjan Vokto of CNG Filling Station and Conversion Owners' Association said. "We have reported the matter to the government, but there has been no progress." "The energy ministry and the home ministry have been informed; they say no law to deal with such case exists." An energy ministry official, who wished not to be named, said, "The highest punishment for this sort of violation is a fine." "In addition to this, there is currently a manpower shortage at the Department of Explosives." Department of Explosives supervisor Amir Hossain Sarkar said: "The cylinders that we authorise do not explode. The current problems are due to the use of unauthorised cylinders." "Post-explosion investigations show that all exploded cylinders were unauthorised. They were either oxygen or acetylene cylinders," added Sarkar. Employees in the Gabtoli CNG workshops said it costs between Tk 50,000 and Tk 70,000 to convert a vehicle to CNG using authenticated cylinders, whereas local ones cost around Tk 10,000 to Tk 20,000. A Department of Explosives officer, who wished not to be named, said: "A quarter is involved in the unauthorised sale of NGV cylinders." "Usually, drivers of CNG-run cars sell their NGV cylinders for up to Tk 50,000 and install cheaper, unauthorised cylinders. Often the owner knows nothing about it." "These cylinders are made in Dholaikhal, Boliyapur in Savar, Fatullah in Naraynaganj and Gabtoli," said the official. Some 100,000 CNG-run vehicles are currently on the road, mostly in Dhaka, according to RPGCL. There are 95 CNG filling stations, and nearly 100 CNG conversion workshops in the capital. bdnews24.c
