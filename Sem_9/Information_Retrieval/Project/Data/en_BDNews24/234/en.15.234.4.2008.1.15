 ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani political leaders face a looming threat of attack and must get serious about their security and avoid unnecessary exposure in the run-up to a February general election, the government said on Tuesday. Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack as she left an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Dec. 27.

President Pervez Musharraf has asked British police to help with the investigation but he has ruled out a UN inquiry.
