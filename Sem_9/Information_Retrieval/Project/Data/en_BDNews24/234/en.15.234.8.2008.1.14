 MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second seed Rafael Nadal survived an early test of his Australian Open credentials, battling to a 7-6 7-5 6-1 win over Viktor Troicki, a Serbian qualifier in his first grand slam appearance. Showing no signs of nerves, world number 126 Troicki forced a set point at 6-5 in the first set and led 4-2 in the second before Nadal finally wore him down to clinch victory in two hours, 35 minutes. "He played very, very aggressively," Nadal said in a courtside interview. "Today I was struggling at some times in the match. I couldn't get the rhythm in the beginning but in the third set I think I played a bit better." In the cool evening conditions, Nadal missed the chance to serve out for the first set at 5-4 and then had to save a set point in the 12th game, before winning the tiebreak 7-3. Troicki then broke in the third game of the second set on his way to a 4-2 lead but Nadal levelled at 4-4 and after pinching the set, he eased through the third to win a match that finished in the early hours of Tuesday
