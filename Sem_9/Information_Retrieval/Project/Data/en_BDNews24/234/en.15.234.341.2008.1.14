 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)--The communications ministry Monday provisionally approved the Strategic Transport Plan, which is expected to improve the transportation network in the capital and its outskirts and install an underground railway system. "In the next seven days, the STP will be sent to the council of advisers for final approval. Once approved, the government will take an initiative to implement the plan," communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters after a meeting in his office. "The STP will need two years to be implemented and will cost five billion dollars," he said. The World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency and other organisations have agreed to finance the project, the adviser said. Quader also said a decision has been taken to create 50 new roads through the capital and a circular road around the city and to introduce a uniform ticket system for public transport. The adviser said that to install a subway rail system between Dhaka and its outskirts, about 17,000 sq km of railway has to be laid, which will take about 12 years. Once the implementation is underway many roads may be closed due to construction. "This will cause traffic jamsbut the plan includes measures to address this. In some places flyovers will be built to ease the gridlock." Quader also said that the STP includes steps to clear the traffic jams created due to rail crossings within the city. Additional executive director of the Dhaka Transportation Coordination Board SM Salahuddin, who attended the meeting, said: "The current transport system of the city is in a North-South orientation." "That's why plans have been taken to build 50 more roads in an East-West direction." He believes that the realisation of the Strategic Transport Plan will transform Dhaka into a modern city. bdnews24.com
