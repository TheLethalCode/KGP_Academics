 KARACHI, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) wants the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ensure member countries fulfil their commitments to play the team under the Future Tours Program. ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka told reporters on Saturday in Pakistan, where Zimbabwe will play five one-day internationals, that the ICC had to make sure the FTP remained sacrosanct. "Zimbabwe is looking to play more against other member nations as opposed to excuses not to play against each other," he said . British media reports have suggested Zimbabwe's tour of England in 2009 may not go ahead as planned in protest at the policies of President Robert Mugabe. The ICC has indicated that any directive from the British government to scrap Zimbabwe's visit may force it to move the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup from England. Chingoka said it was important all ICC member nations looked after each other so that cricket grew bigger and stronger. "If this does not happen than cricket is not moving towards true globalisation," he said. England pulled out of a World Cup one-day match in 2003 in Zimbabwe citing security concerns. The Australian government ordered the national team to cancel their tour of the African country in 2007. Zimbabwe, who have had their test status suspended, play Pakistan in the first one-day international on Jan. 21 in Karachi
