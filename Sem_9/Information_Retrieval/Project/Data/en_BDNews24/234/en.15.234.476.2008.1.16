 Kuwait, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Kuwait have arrested an American of Yemeni origin suspected of smashing the windows of Sunni Islamic bookshops. "The perpetrator of these crimes is under interrogation, but there is no religious or sectarian reason behind these crimes," Interior Minister Sheikh Jaber Khaled al-Sabah told the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) late on Tuesday. The suspect had also attacked car showrooms and a furniture outlet, said Sheikh Jaber. On Sunday, Sheikh Jaber said the attacks sought to "undermine security and provoke strife" in the Gulf state with a large Shi'ite minority. The unidentified suspect was on a visit visa to Kuwait, a Sunni-led, U.S.-allied country of about 3 million people. Newspapers have said up to 20 bookshops that sell Sunni Muslim books had been attacked or defaced at the weekend. The Shi'ite minority is represented in both the government and parliament.
