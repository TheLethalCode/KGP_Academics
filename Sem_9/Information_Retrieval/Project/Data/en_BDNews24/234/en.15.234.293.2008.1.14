 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool's American owners met former Germany manager Juergen Klinsmann in November to discuss the possibility of him replacing Rafael Benitez, chairman Tom Hicks said on Monday. Hicks admitted they had sounded out Klinsmann, who has since been appointed as Bayern Munich boss from next season, but said they had now given Benitez their full backing after a meeting with the Spaniard.

Benitez was publicly critical of the owners during that period, particularly over their plans for the January transfer window, and speculation mounted that the manager's days were numbered. PRODUCTIVE MEETING However, after a meeting in December the tension eased. "After George and I had our long and productive meeting with Rafa following the Man United match, we put all of our issues behind us and received Rafa's commitment that he wanted to stay with Liverpool," Hicks said. "We never reached agreement on an option with Juergen and we are both pleased for him that he has a great opportunity to return to Germany and coach a great club team. "Rafa has both of our support, and our communication has greatly improved," added Hicks, who said that Benitez now has weekly meetings with chief executive Rick Parry and Foster Gillett, son of George
