<TEXT>
 MILAN, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New AC Milan striker Pato benefited from Ronaldo's sparkling display in Sunday's 5-2 win over Napoli, according to coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ronaldo, making only his second appearance of the season, scored his first two goals of the campaign before fellow Brazilian Pato netted on his debut in Milan's first home league win this term. Pato, 18, joined the European champions from Internacional in August but was ineligible until now. He made a nervous start in a packed San Siro but Ancelotti was still thrilled with the front pair. "The performance of Ronaldo was the most surprising thing because he trained for very few days. He demonstrated his natural class and Pato took advantage of it," Ancelotti told radio Rai on Monday. "Pato is a very mature boy for his age who is very cool and carefree. He really wanted to play because being unable to for six months weighed on him a little. "He waited with patience, he had time to get to know his new team mates but before the match he said absolutely nothing," added Ancelotti, under pressure with Milan occupying a lowly 12th place in Serie A. Fellow Brazilian Kaka also scored, leading Italian media to name the forward line KA-PA-RO on Monday. Swedes Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm made up the famous GRE-NO-LI trio for Milan in the 1950s
