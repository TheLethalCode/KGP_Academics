 WELLINGTON, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniel Vettori and Stephen Fleming both fell agonisingly short of making hundreds after putting New Zealand in total command of the second test against Bangladesh on Sunday. Vettori scored 94 and Fleming 87 as the Kiwis posted a big first innings total of 393 on the second day the Basin Reserve.

Sinclair and Oram both departed before lunch in identical fashion, caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off the bowling of Shadadat Hossain. Sinclair had added 38 to his overnight score of nine while Oram, who made a century in Dunedin and was named man of the match, was unlucky with television replays showing he had not made contact with the ball.
