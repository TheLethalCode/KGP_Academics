<TITLE> US urges China to open up on defence build-up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of US Pacific Command pushed China on Tuesday to be more transparent about its defence build-up and suggested its growing military might was aimed at Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its territory. Admiral Timothy Keating, on his second visit since taking the helm of the Pacific Command last year, said he was concerned about China's development of new military hardware, including long-range cruise missiles and anti-satellite technology. But he said Chinese officials insisted their military development was not aimed at any third country. "The Chinese military officials with whom I had discussions emphasised their desire to protect those things that they think are theirs and nothing more," Keating told a news conference. Beijing and Taiwan have faced off since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, and China has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule, by force if necessary. "They (the Chinese) specifically have no hegemonic intentions, they do not have any expansion strategy, they advocate a peaceful rise," Keating said. But he added that he was not entirely satisfied by China's explanations and wanted further exchanges to better understand the reasons for its military growth. "Increased transparency can lead to greater trust that reduces the potential for misunderstanding. Misunderstanding can lead to conflict or crisis and that is very much not in our interest," the U.S. admiral said. Keating said he had also emphasised in his talks with Chinese officials Washington's adherence to the "one-China" policy. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to mainland China in 1979, recognising the one-China principle. But it remains Taiwan's biggest arms supplier and Beijing recently expressed irritation over U.S. plans to help the island upgrade its missile system. PORT VISITS Keating's trip follows a dip in relations over China's refusal to allow the USS Kitty Hawk and its accompanying strike group to make a long-planned port visit to Hong Kong during November's Thanksgiving holiday. Beijing later changed its mind and said the ships could dock, but by then the aircraft carrier and its flotilla were heading back to its home port in Japan, via the Taiwan Strait. Keating said he had discussed the issue with officials at the Defence and Foreign Ministries, defending the ships' decision to transit through the Strait to avoid typhoons in the South China Sea. "We don't need China's permission to go through the Taiwan Straits in international waters," he said. "We will exercise our full rights of passage to go where we chose." Chinese officials offered him no explanation for the Kitty Hawk incident. China also denied two other U.S. port visits earlier in November, but Keating said officials had given positive signals on another ship request to visit Hong Kong shortly. "Hong Kong, for American servicemen, is a crown jewel, and we are very anxious to ensure our ability to continue to visit to Hong Kong." Despite the irritant in ties, Keating said he was otherwise developing a good relationship with People's Liberation Army general Guo Boxiong, who is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission. "General Guo, he's going to be a pal," he said. "We've got differences, but we're working through t
