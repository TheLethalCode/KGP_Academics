 Wellington, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Tamim Iqbal Sunday injured his left thumb during the fielding on the second day of the second and final Test against New Zealand at Basin Reserve in Wellington. The left-handed opener suffered the injury when he tried to take a shoulder-high edge of New Zealand batsman Mathew Sinclair off Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. He only managed to get his finger on the edge, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Tamim left the field and did not turn up for the rest of the play.

He is unlikely to bat Monday with Bangladesh 51 for five in the second innings, needing 199 runs to avert an innings defeat against the Black Caps. bd
