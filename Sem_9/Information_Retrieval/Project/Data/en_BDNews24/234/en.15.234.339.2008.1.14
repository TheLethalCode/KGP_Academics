<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka stocks closed lower Monday amid poor market response to shares of state-run Meghna Petroleum that debuted in the morning. Unlike its predecessor Jamuna Oil that triggered a hype among the investors, Meghna failed to raise much capital from the market on its maiden trading day. Only 15,700 Meghna shares were sold on the Dhaka Stock Exchange, and 11,200 shares on the Chittagong Stock Exchange. It opened at Tk 350 but fell to Tk 300 at the end of trading on the DSE. On the CSE, it rose to Tk 327.60 before closing at Tk 300. Both state-run oil entities ended among the major losers on the DSE. The day's trading was dominated by shares in mutual funds, power and banks. "It seems that investors are rebalancing their portfolios, which is reflected on the turnover board. Investors favoured a good number of issues in mutual funds, pharmaceuticals and power on Monday," said market analyst Yaweer Sayeed. "Usually banks top the investors' priority list, which is a good sign indicating maturity of the market," he added. Profit-taking drove most bank shares down. "Investors were selling off bank shares to cash in as the index crossed the 3000 mark the previous day, assuming the market is performing at its peak," said Sayeed, chief executive and managing director of AIMS of Bangladesh. The market opened with a steep fall on the general index. It remained steady after the first hour but started to decline again in the midday session to end downbeat. The benchmark DGEN or general index slumped 75.76 points or 2.51 percent to close at 2939.22. The DSI or all share price index ended at 2484.25, down 56.78 points or 2.23 percent. The bourse's blue chip, DSE-20 also fell 16.21 points 0.66 percent to 2431.02. Turnover stood at Tk 1.74 billion from trading of 13,820,928 shares. Losers beat gainers 125 to 99 while 15 issues held steady. Grameen Mutual Fund One appeared at the peak of the turnover board, closing 3.48 percent higher at Tk 86. AB Bank eroded its gains on Sunday and declined 2.53 percent to end at Tk 2835. IFIC Bank also fell to Tk 2830.25, down 2.27 percent.
