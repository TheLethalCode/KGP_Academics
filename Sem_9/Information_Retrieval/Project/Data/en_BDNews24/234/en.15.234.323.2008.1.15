 GOMA, Congo, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congolese President Joseph Kabila joined efforts to end conflict in the country's east on Tuesday, flying to a town where warring rebels and militias are attending a peace conference. "I am coming in order to personally involve myself in the search for a solution," Kabila told Reuters before flying from Kinshasa to Goma, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's violence-torn eastern North Kivu province. Renegade General Laurent Nkunda, whose Tutsi rebels have been involved in the fighting that the Goma conference is trying to end, said he would also be willing to attend and meet Kabila face-to-face if he was directly invited. "If I am invited, I'll go. I haven't received a personal invitation," he told Reuters, speaking by telephone from his mountain stronghold in eastern Congo. "A meeting with the head of state would be a good thing ... When people talk to each other from a distance, they distrust each other. When they talk up close they tell each other things," he added. The statements were the most encouraging signs yet that the Goma conference, which opened more than a week ago but has been plagued by delays and threatened boycotts, could make some progress towards ending the fighting in eastern Congo. Congo's broader 1998-2003 war officially ended with a national peace settlement, but government soldiers, Nkunda's Tutsi insurgents, local Mai Mai militia, and Rwandan Hutu rebels have continued to fight each other in North Kivu. The new head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo, Alan Doss, told delegates on Tuesday that the fighting must end if Congo's east is to once and for all draw a line under a conflict that killed an estimated 4 million people. "The violence in the Kivus has not stopped, whereas the rest of Congo benefits from a consolidation of the peace and is beginning the enormous work of reconstruction," he said. Doss flew to Goma on Tuesday, along with senior U.N. officials and military commanders. The United Nations maintains around 17,000 peacekeepers in Congo. "It is high time that you sit down around a table to discuss with frankness and serenity all these problems and together seek ideal and lasting solutions," he said. TURBULENT EAST Kabila, who has vowed to pacify Congo's turbulent east after winning elections last year in the former Belgian colony, convened the Goma peace conference after a government military offensive against Nkunda's fighters crumbled last month. Delegates representing the insurgent general at the Goma meeting also welcomed Kabila's presence. "We think Kabila's participation will give new impetus to the talks, a new vision. His participation is absolutely necessary," said Kambasu Ngeve, head of Nkunda's delegation. Nkunda's representatives had called on Sunday for direct talks with the government and the return of all Congolese living in exile, including Kabila's arch-rival and defeated presidential contender Jean-Pierre Bemba. Nkunda led around 4,000 fighters into the bush in a 2004 revolt and says his insurgency is trying to protect eastern Congo's Tutsi ethnic minority against attacks from Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the east. Kabila's government signed a deal with Rwanda in November to expel the Hutu rebels, involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughte
