 Beijing, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A landslide at a quarry in north China buried 11 people, with explosives believed trapped in the rubble, hampering rescue work, state media said. The accident happened on Sunday at a quarry in Jixian county of Tianjin Municipality and those trapped were believed to be buried deep under the rocks, Xinhua news agency said. "There might be more than 10 kg (22 lb) of explosives under the rubble, which made the rescue operation even more difficult and dangerous," Xinhua said. On the same day, a minibus in northern Liaoning province fell into a frozen river, killing seven people. China's roads are the deadliest in the world, with accidents killing about 100,000 people a year.
