<TITLE> Citigroup loss, US sales fall worry investor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Massive losses at Citigroup and a surprise fall in US retail sales, fuelling worries about the state of the global economy, knocked equities back on Tuesday and hit the dollar. Wall Street looked set for a poor start and European stocks were in the red after Citi, the largest US bank, reported earnings-per-share losses that were nearly twice what was expected and cut its dividend. But it also said it had fewer write-downs from the credit crisis than markets had expected, although they amounted to a colossal $18.1 billion. Financial services company State Street Corp reported lower fourth quarter net income after it set aside millions for legal costs tied to mortgage securities losses while US Bancorp, the sixth-largest US bank, suffered a 21 percent fall in fourth-quarter profit. Investors have focused on banks to see how hard the credit crunch has hit them and gauge the overall state of the industry. Wall Street did get a boost on Monday when IBM came out with better-than-expected results, suggesting that the gloom about financials may not necessarily have spread. Investors on Tuesday, however, were rattled by the global economic outlook. Sales at US retailers fell 0.4 percent in December and were less vigorous in November than previously thought, according to a government report that implied costlier energy and slumping housing prices were taking a toll on consumers. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.3 percent, weakened among other things by Britain's largest retailer Tesco, which missed sales forecasts. Germany's ZEW also reported that German investor sentiment declined more than expected. "The outlook for markets is all linked to whether we are in a mid-cycle slowdown or global recession and the problem is that the two of them look very, very similar at the start, but have different market consequences," said Andrew Lynch, European fund manager at Schroders. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei ended below 14,000 for the first time in 26 months. It closed down 1 percent at 13,972.63 and the broader TOPIX index lost 2 percent to 1,350.20. GOLD, DOLLAR, BONDS The dollar matched Monday's seven-week lows against the yen on expectations that US economic data and banking results could boost the case for aggressive, growth-boosting interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Futures markets are now reflecting a roughly 50-50 chance of the Fed slashing interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.50 percent by the end of the month. The dollar fell 1.25 percent to 106.87, a 2-1/2 year low. The euro rose a quarter of a percent to $1.4904, not far below November's record high of $1.4966. Spot gold fell back from Monday's all-time high of $914 an ounce. It was trading around $908, held high by economic worries and the weak dollar. Euro zone government bond prices rose on demand. The interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was at 3.668 percent and the 10-year Bund yield was at 4.029 perce
