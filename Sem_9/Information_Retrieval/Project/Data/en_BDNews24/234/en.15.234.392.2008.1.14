 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The BTRC has accepted Tk 150 crore in compensation from mobile telephone operator Citycell for lost governmental revenue because of the vendor's involvement in illegal VoIP business. Citycell, a venture of SingTel and Pacific Motors Ltd, earlier made a partial payment of the fine, and the balance will be deposited to the exchequer shortly, said Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said in a statement Monday. Manzurul Alam, chairman of the regulator, said: "We hope that no telecommunication operator will facilitate any illegal VoIP ventures." "The operators are expected to cooperate with the government to prevent such activities in the future." "No one will be spared if found involved, in any capacity, in the illegal call termination business," warned the BTRC chief. International call termination to Bangladesh is a licensed service and is currently reserved only for the state-owned telephone operator Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. Law-enforcing agencies and the BTRC launched a crackdown on illegal VoIP operators after the caretaker administration took office in last Jan. Citycell was also fined last Dec for involvement in illegal call termination. bdnews
