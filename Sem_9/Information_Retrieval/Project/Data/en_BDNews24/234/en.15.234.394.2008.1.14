 Abdur Rahim Harmasi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Corrected. Read 5 percentage points instead of 5 percent in the intro and para-6. Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Inflation surged by more than 5 percentage points over one year, from Dec 2006 to Nov 2007, a recent Bangladesh Bank economic situation report said. The rate of inflation rose to 11.21 percent by Nov 2007 from 6.13 percent in Dec 2006, said the BB report that was sent to the chief adviser on Jan 9. Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, however, said that inflation will fall in the coming months thanks to policies adopted by the government and Bangladesh Bank. The central bank reported that the crucial economic index has spiralled over the past year chiefly due to global inflation in fuel and consumer prices and recurrent floods and the devastating Cyclone Sidr last year in the country. The rate of inflation, measured point-to-point, which was 6.13 percent in Dec 2006, increased to 9.20 percent in June 2007, 10.02 in July and 10.12 in August, the report said. It dropped to 9.60 percent in September, then again rose to 10.06 in October and in November reached 11.21 percentan increase of 5.08 percentage points above the December 2006 figure. The country's top banker holds that the inflation rate will slowly come down trend in the coming months. "The new monetary policy aims at systematically stabilising the current spiralling inflation," Ahmed said. "We expect the policies adopted by the central bank and the government will help stymie the upward trend," said the governor recently while officially declaring the Jan-Jun 2008 monetary policy. Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan disagrees. "It will not be possible to curb the inflation rate unless production at the local level is greatly enhanced," he told bdnews24.com. "Agricultural production must be boosted. All efforts should be directed towards facilitating the current boro seasonal cultivation activities," according to the former caretaker government adviser. "A bumper boro harvest may be able to cover some of the losses due to the 2007 floods and the November cyclone." Economic analyst Atiur Rahman also sees no alternative to increasing agricultural yields "since the government envisages handling economic inflation by ensuring enhanced food security for the nation." "Farmers have to be provided with adequate credit and farm input. Once the production goes up, there'll be a cut in imports. Then the inflation rate will fall." bdnews24.com/
