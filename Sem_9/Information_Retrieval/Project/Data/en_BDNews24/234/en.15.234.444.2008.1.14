 MADRID, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The statistics look good but by the season's halfway point Real Madrid have been unable to live up to their coach's pledge to set the Primera Liga alight with attacking football. Bernd Schuster's side are the runaway leaders, with a seven-point cushion over second-placed Barcelona. Champions Real have won all nine home matches, suffered only two league defeats and beat arch-rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp for only the second time in 24 years. Real's tally of 47 points is the highest for a 20-team league since the introduction of three points for a win and the lead is the biggest they have held at this stage of the season in the last three decades. "The results are excellent but they cannot disguise the crisis at the leaders who are playing vulgar football," respected writer Santiago Segurola told Monday's Marca. Schuster's predecessor Fabio Capello was shown the door at the end of last season because his team failed to provide sufficient entertainment despite winning their first league title in four years. PRACTICAL STYLE The German coach promised things would be different under him. Although he has delivered on the results front, the team have continued to rely on the practical style favoured by Capello. "I'm happy with the win but not with the way we played," said Schuster after Sunday's 2-0 victory at Levante. "It was difficult to motivate the team in a game against the bottom club." The good news for Real is that Barcelona have failed to fire on all cylinders, winning only three away games. Leading scorer Lionel Messi is out injured, Ronaldinho has suffered an alarming loss of form, Samuel Eto'o will be missing for a month at the African Nations Cup and Thierry Henry has only just returned after a recurrence of his back problems. "There should be no doubts about this team, people have to believe in them a bit more," said coach Frank Rijkaard after Saturday's 4-0 home win over Real Murcia. "With good players and a good attitude we can still beat anyone.
