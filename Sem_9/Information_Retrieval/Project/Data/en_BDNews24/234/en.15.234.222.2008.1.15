<TITLE> US presidential candidates' ideas on economy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Worries that a recession may be looming have prompted several of the candidates in the US presidential race to unveil plans to give the economy a lift. Here are their ideas: The New York Democrat has proposed a $70 billion package to stave off a possible recession, including $40 billion in spending for heating assistance, an extension of unemployment insurance and investments in energy efficiency. The other $30 billion would go toward helping low-income families hit by the mortgage crisis. A second, $40 billion phase of the package would be triggered if the economy failed to respond. That would pay for tax rebates for low- and middle-income workers. The Illinois Democrat's $75 billion plan includes an immediate $250 tax cut for workers that would double if the economy worsens. Older Americans would receive a one-time $250 bonus in their Social Security checks. Obama also would offer assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure and aid to states hit by reduced tax revenues. He would also extend unemployment insurance for laid-off workers. REPUBLICAN MITT ROMNEY The former Massachusetts governor has described the economy as fragile and said, "We should take action to keep the economy from falling into a recession." On the campaign trail, Romney has urged eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest income for families earning less than $200,000 a year. "That's one idea and there may well be others," said Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. The Arizona senator has said immediate intervention the economy is "an option that has to be exercised from time to time but the last one, not the first one." But McCain is touting his plan to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, a levy that was originally intended to apply to the wealthy but increasingly hits middle-income people. Asked if McCain would propose additional measures to lift the economy, his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said,"We are monitoring the situation and if we think more is needed, we'll propose it." The former New York City mayor, has said it's not clear yet if the economy is headed for a recession but he has outlined a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut he said would boost growth. He would slash the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent and reduce the capital gains tax to 10 percent from 15 percent. Giuliani also proposed overhauling income tax rates to give taxpayers the option of choosing a simplified tax form with a maximum bracket of 30 percent. bdnews24.com/lq/1905
