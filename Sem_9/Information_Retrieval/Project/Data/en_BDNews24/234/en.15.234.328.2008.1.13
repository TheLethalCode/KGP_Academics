 MELBOURNE, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Women's champion Serena Williams, world number one Justine Henin and men's number two Rafael Nadal will headline the action on day one of the Australian Open on Monday. Williams, seeded seventh, will open proceedings on Rod Laver Arena against Australian wildcard Jarmila Gajdosova, a curtain-raiser before tournament favourite Henin meets Aiko Nakamura of Japan. "My preparation's been really good," Williams told reporters. "I've been training every day and just getting out there on the court every day. So it's been really good and really positive. I like my preparation this year." Britain's ninth seed Andy Murray ends the day session on Rod Laver Arena when he plays France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, while Nadal plays under the lights when he faces Serbian qualifier Viktor Troicki. Last year's beaten finalist Maria Sharapova and world number six Andy Roddick will be centre of attention on the Vodafone Arena. Russian fifth seed Sharapova takes on Croatia's Jelena Kostanic Tosic, while Roddick is up against Czech qualifier Lukas Dlouhy. Women's number three Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and men's number eight Richard Gasquet of France will also play their first-round matches on the second show court. Jankovic, who enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2007, plays Austrian Tamira Paszek, while Gasquet meets local wildcard Nick Lindahl, who is making his debut in the main draw
