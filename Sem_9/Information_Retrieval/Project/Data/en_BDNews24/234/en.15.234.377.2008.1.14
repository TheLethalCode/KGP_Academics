 BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission urged Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Monday to resolve a dispute over a protected fishing zone in the Adriatic early in his new term, saying it was key for the country's EU entry. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso congratulated Sanader on his reappointment as prime minister but said Croatia faced important challenges in its EU accession bid, including "open issues with neighbouring countries". "I hope that your government will take the measures necessary early in its mandate to address these and other issues of importance in the EU accession process," Barroso said in a statement referring to the fishing dispute and Croatia's EU reform process. Croatia's protected fishing zone in the Adriatic, which entered into force on Jan. 1, has drawn opposition from the EU, particularly Adriatic neighbours Slovenia and Italy, who said Zagreb had agreed in 2004 to exempt EU states. EU officials have warned Zagreb that a failure to reach a deal on the zone would derail its plans to complete accession talks by mid-2009. Sanader has said he will launch fresh talks with Italy and Slovenia on the issue. A spokeswoman for Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the new government should address the issue "as a matter of urgency". Croatia created the zone, which extends its jurisdiction beyond territorial waters to the middle of the Adriatic, because it said it needed to preserve fish stocks and limit pollution. Its fishermen say Italy's better equipped fleet could deplete fish stocks on the Croatian side of the Adriatic after doing so on its side. They say Italian trawlers often fish illegally in Croatia's territorial waters. Barroso also stressed the need for Croatia to make progress in reform of the judiciary and public administration, the fight against corruption, refugee returns and economic restructuring. Sanader won parliament's backing on Saturday for a proposed centre-right coalition cabinet after an inconclusive Nov. 25 election, but analysts say it faces the uphill task of speeding up EU membership talks. Analysts have been unimpressed with the cabinet's make-up, saying it hardly heralded a renewed commitment to reforms, many of which will be costly and painful for Croatia's 4.4 million people.
