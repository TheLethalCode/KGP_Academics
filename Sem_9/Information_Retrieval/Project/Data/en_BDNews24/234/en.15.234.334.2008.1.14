<TITLE> North Sudan troops not fully withdrawn: south official </TITLE>

 JUBA, Sudan, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some northern Sudanese troops remain in Sudan's semi-autonomous south and others are too close to the border on the northern side despite an agreement to withdraw, a southern official said on Monday. Sudan said last week it had pulled all its troops out of the south but James Hoth, acting spokesman for the former rebel southern army, said the troops were violating the agreement by remaining in the south or near the border. "There are less than 500 now (northern soldiers in the south)," Hoth said. "But they are not far from the border, all of them that have moved." Hoth said a joint north-south board had agreed the northern soldiers should redeploy to about 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 miles) beyond the north-south line, but they had so far not done so. The redeployment of thousands of northern troops is part of a 2005 peace deal that ended more than two decades of north-south Sudanese civil war, which is separate from the ongoing conflict in the western Darfur region. Two million people died and about 4 million were displaced in the north-south conflict, fought over ethnicity and ideology and fuelled by oil. Northern troops had initially been slated to leave the south by July 9, 2007, and hand control of southern oil fields to joint patrols, but Khartoum missed that deadline. In October southern ministers walked out of a national coalition government saying Khartoum was failing to implement measures of the peace deal. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir said late last year that 17,000 northern troops remained in south Sudan, mostly in Unity state. Northern officials put the number at 3,600. Sudan said last week it had pulled its troops out of the south by Jan. 9, in time for the latest deadline, although Hoth said at the time 1,000 remained due to transport problems. Southern officials have accused northern forces of remaining in southern oil areas to retain control of Sudan's main export. Dozens of people were killed in late December in fighting in the border area between armed northern nomads and the south's former rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Southern officials said the fighting could damage the north-south peace. In a speech marking southern celebrations of the peace deal in the town of Wau, Kiir said the proper withdrawal of troops was important to the fragile relationship between Khartoum and the former rebels. "I urge the people of SAF (the armed forces controlled by Khartoum) and the SPLA to fully implement to decisions of the (board) and not to reschedule again the date agreed upon for the redeployment of forces," Kiir said.
