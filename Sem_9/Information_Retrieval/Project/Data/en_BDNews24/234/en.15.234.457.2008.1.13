<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Princess Diana's former lover, heart specialist Hasnat Khan, has broken his silence a decade after they broke up and confessed that her death still haunts him. "Sometimes I feel like screaming. There have been very bad times. I have moved on but it keeps coming back," he said. Diana described Khan as "Mr Wonderful" and friends giving evidence into her death at a London inquest said she was still pining for him during a summer romance with Dodi al-Fayed.

I'm like that." Khan hoped the inquest would provide closure after a decade of remorseless speculation. "I hope the inquest clarifies everything. I hope people will move on," he said. The couple went to great pains to conceal their relationship with reports that Khan had even been smuggled into Diana's Kensington Palace residence in London in the boot of her butler Paul Burrell's car. Burrell is flying in from Florida to testify on Monday at the inquest. Lord Justice Scott Baker, overseeing an inquest that could take up to six months and cost up to 10 million pounds ($20 million), hopes Burrell can cast new light on Diana's last days as he had unrivalled access to h
