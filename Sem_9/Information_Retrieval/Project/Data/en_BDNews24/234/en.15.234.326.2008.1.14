 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Monday the European Union must take immediate steps to ensure economic stability in the face of global turbulence. He also called on other world leaders and institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to put in place reforms to protect countries from liquidity crises and to stop problems from happening. "All countries in the European Union must now work together both to take the immediate measures that are necessary and to lead the long-term strengthening of the capacity internationally to ensure greater financial stability," Brown told business leaders. Brown has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to discuss financial market turbulence later this month. The meeting is expected to take place on Jan. 29. The prime minister said the EU could lead the way in putting in place reforms that are needed at a wider level. Brown said he was seeking to build consensus on: - Tightening up procedures for dealing with solvency and liquidity issues - Returning confidence and therefore liquidity to the markets through transparent and accurate valuation to write offs and losses - Assessing the role of credit rating agencies where the growing complexity of instruments had led to greater reliance on rating. Investors themselves need to challenge their own reliance on ratings, he said. - Greater transparency in the system for investors, markets and regulators through improved valuation standards, better risk management, and more public information from institutions about complex products such as structured investment vehicles. A spokesman for Brown said the above list comments reflected his goals at a broader international level -- rather than an agenda for the talks between EU leaders -- but some of the points would be discussed at the meeting. Brown reiterated his call for the Financial Stability Forum and the IMF to look at the international steps that could be taken to ensure stability, including putting in place a better early warning system for financial crises.
