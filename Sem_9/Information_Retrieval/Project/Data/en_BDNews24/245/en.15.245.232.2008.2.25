 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court has set Wednesday to hear two writ petitions challenging the Election Commission's invitation to BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed for electoral reforms dialogue. The HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamunur Rahman gave the date Monday, as Dr Kamal Hossain appeared in court on behalf of the EC, while advocate TH Khan and AJ Mohammad Ali appeared for BNP. The hearing was originally scheduled for Feb 12. The EC originally invited Hafizuddin, the secretary general of the Saifur Rahman led faction of the BNP, to dialogues for Nov 22. On Nov 18 last year, the HC stayed the EC's letter of invitation to Hafizuddin after Khaleda filed a writ petition challenging the invite. The court asked the EC, six members of the BNP standing committee, and Hafizuddin to explain why the invitation should not be declared illegal. They were also asked by the court to clarify why the Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the secretary general appointed by the BNP chairperson, should not be invited to the electoral reform talks. Former Chhatra Dal leader Nasiruddin Ahmed filed the second petition challenging the EC's invitation. bdnews24.com
