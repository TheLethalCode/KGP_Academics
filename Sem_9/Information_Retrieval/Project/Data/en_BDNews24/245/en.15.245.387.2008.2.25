 Washington, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are five facts about filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who won a joint Oscar on Sunday for their work directing "No Country For Old Men." -- The Coens -- Joel, 53, and Ethan, 50 -- were born and raised in Minnesota, where both their parents were college professors. -- While the brothers worked as a team behind the camera on all their movies, Joel Coen alone was credited as director for their work until the 2004 release of "The Ladykillers," for which they were granted a Directors Guild of America waiver crediting them both as co-directors from then on. -- The Coens jointly edit their own films under the pseudonym of Roderick Jaynes. -- "No Country For Old Men" marks their 12th feature film written and directed together, and their first based entirely on someone else's novel, Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name. -- Joel Coen and his wife, actress Frances McDormand, met while working on the brothers' 1984 debut feature, "Blood Simple." The couple married in 1994, and she appeared in several more of their films, including "Fargo," which earned McDormand an Oscar
