<TEXT>
 Abuja, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian tribunal upheld the 2007 election of President Umaru Yar'Adua on Tuesday, rejecting challenges from rivals who wanted the vote annulled because of massive rigging. Here are some analysts' and officials' views on the decision: STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT UMARU YAR'ADUA "The President is gratified that the Tribunal unanimously confirmed his often stated belief that the acknowledged imperfections notwithstanding, he was the clear winner of the presidential elections which were conducted in substantial compliance with all relevant laws. "The President urges his two valiant opponents in the elections who petitioned against its outcome to accept the verdict of the tribunal in good faith. "His invitation for them to cooperate with him in moving Nigeria forward remains and he calls on them to accept it now in the greater interest of the country." LAI MOHAMMED, SPOKESMAN FOR OPPOSITION ACTION CONGRESS PARTY "We are not surprised with the judgment, we have always known that the matter will be resolved by the Supreme Court. But we are shocked that in spite of the weight of evidence we presented, the tribunal dismissed all the issues we raised... "We assure Nigerians that the last has not been heard of this matter." INNOCENT CHUKWUMA, CHAIRMAN OF TRANSITION MONITORING GROUP, MAIN LOCAL OBSERVERS DURING THE APRIL ELECTION "It is a very disappointing judgment. We had expected the tribunal to go beyond mere technicalities and look at the issues raised in the petitions and address the yearnings of Nigerians for fair and credible elections. "But the tribunal has taken us two or three decades back to the era when electoral disputes were decided on technicalities rather than substance. I believe the petitioners will appeal and the Supreme Court will look at the real issues they raised. BISMARCK REWANE, LAGOS-BASED FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES CO. "The ruling has two possible consequences: One, it could help validate the president's mandate, make him feel more confident. In this case, the policy environment would be more stable because if he is confident about his tenure, he will be more assertive in taking decisions. "On the other hand, if the world believes that the judgment placed emphasis on political stability rather than law, then there is the fear that it may be overturned by the Supreme Court. So the uncertainty will continue until the Supreme Court makes a final decision. In this case the pace will not change and the waiting will continue. "But the bottom line is that the president had two hurdles and now he has crossed one, so you can now bet that he is more likely to cross the second one." PATRICK SMITH, EDITOR OF AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL "The judges in Nigeria have in the last two or three years gained a huge amount of respect because of willingness to show independence from the executive ... There might be some concerns that, on this one, the new-found independence of the judges has been tested and some Nigerians, obviously the opposition Nigerians, will say it has been found wanting ... "On the other hand, despite coming to power in these contested circumstances almost a year ago now, Yar'Adua has gained hugely in stature and his style of ruling the country ... he has carved out a support base. "If this thing is now put behind them ... and the view is Yar'Adua survived this, I think we may well see a kind of 'Yar'Adua phase two', which will be a tougher president ... "There was a real danger of a power vacuum at the top so, in the stability stakes, Nigeria is a stronger place after this announcement." GRAHAM STOCK, AFRICA STRATEGIST, JP MORGAN IN LONDON "It's been at the back of investors' minds as a potential source of instability. It's a relief that that risk has been eliminated. "The key is whether the greater political certainty translates into more effective government. There is not a lot the government can point to after nine months in power. "Now there are no excuses, we will be looking for a robust defence of the government's original budget plans, greater clarity on the regulatory framework for private/public partnerships and investment plans for the state-owned oil company." RAZIA KHAN, AFRICAN ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED "From a political stability perspective, this is likely to be positive. "Yes, we have seen a strengthening of Nigerian institutions with the courts able to overturn a lot of the results of the state elections and call for re-runs in certain states. "At the presidential level, however, what mattered most to markets was policy continuity and a reduction in uncertainty. "As such, we expect the decision to be positive for the performance of Nigerian markets."
