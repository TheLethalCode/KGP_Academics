 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)The three Dhaka University teachers convicted for their involvement in the August 2007 campus unrest, and subsequently pardoned by presidential clemency, filed appeals Monday challenging their convictions. Updates with details on hearing date The teachers say they want to prove in court that they are not guilty of the charges on which they were convicted. Lawyer Mannan Khan said they would argue that such appeals could be filed even after presidential pardon. Dr Anwar Hossain, Prof Sadrul Amin and Prof Harun-or-Rashid filed the appeals at the court of Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque in the morning. Judge Md Azizul Haque accepted the appeals and set April 2 for a hearing. Sadrul Amin's lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukdar said at the hearing, despite the presidential pardon, the verdict establishing the accused as guilty remains on record. "This appeal has been filed against that very verdict." Shafiul Bashar Bhandari, Harun-or-Rashid's lawyer, said: "The conviction order, unless quashed by the court, will affect the pardoned teachers' lives and careers." On Jan 22, additional chief metropolitan and speedy trial tribunal judge Md Golam Rabbani handed down the verdict, sentencing the three to two years each. The three were released from jail the same day after President Iajuddin Ahmed pardoned them. In August last year, chaos spread on Dhaka University campus after a fight broke out between students and army personnel during a football match. DU students began protesting against the incident and demanded immediate withdrawal of all army personnel based at an army camp on the campus. The protests turned violent and spilled over onto the streets of Dhaka and spread to other campuses in the country. The interim government was forced to impose days of curfew to ease tensions. Authorities later charged a number of teachers with making provocative statements and fuelling the violence. The case in which the DU teachers were convicted was filed on August 23 with Shahbagh police. No one was specifically accused by name when the police sergeant filed the case, but the charge-sheet submitted subsequently named four teachers and 15 students. Dr Anwar Hossain is dean of the faculty of Biological Sciences, Prof Sadrul Amin is dean of the Arts faculty and Prof Harun-or-Rashid is dean of the Social Sciences faculty. bdnews24.com
