 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) --The first phase of construction for the new International Mother Language Institute in Segun Bagicha is expected to be completed by December, said an adviser Wednesday. Following a tour of the site, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters that three-stories of the building would be completed by December, with the second phase scheduled to start shortly after. "Decisions on the centre's role will be discussed while the construction is ongoing," said Zillur. The institute will ultimately occupy five floors of the twelve-story building, with the other floors comprised of galleries and office space, he said. In recognition of Bangladesh's struggle to preserve its mother tongue, UNESCO declared February 21 International Mother Language Day in 1999. UN secretary-general Kofi Annan laid the foundation stone for the Institute in 2001, but the project faltered and remained dormant for almost six years. In Nov 2006, a steering committee chaired by education secretary Momtazul Islam decided to revive the project. The revised budged for the new language institute has been set at Tk 21.28 crore. bdnews24.com
