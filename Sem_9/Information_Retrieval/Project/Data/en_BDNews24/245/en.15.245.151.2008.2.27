<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  Iran's ambassador to Bangladesh, Hassan Faranzadeh Wednesday demanded that the United States and its allies apologise for, what he termed, wrongly portraying Iran's peaceful nuclear programmes to the United Nations Security Council. He also said that the western powers should compensate Iran for what he called their wrong actions against his country, as "the International Atomic Energy Agency report on Iran had failed to find any military use of nuclear technology". "Despite repeated assertions from Iran of its using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, some western countries took the issue to the UN Security Council," the ambassador said at a press conference at his Gulshan residence. "Mohammad El-Baradei's report could not find military use of nuclear technology in Iran," Faranzadeh said. "The western countries should apologise for their actions. They should compensate too," he added. Mohammad El-Baradei, the director general of the UN's nuclear watchdog IAEA, submitted a report last week to the UN Security Council; the report did not suppport the US claim that Iran was secretly producing nuclear weapons, the ambassador said. The US, France, Germany and other western countries have tabled a Security Council proposal for imposing tougher sanctions on Iran for its "nuclear ambitions". The IAEA has investigated the US allegations against Iran, but could not prove them. Stressing the Iranian nuclear programme's peaceful use of nuclear technology, the ambassador said: "Iran wants to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel and produce nuclear energy, a clean source". "Every country, including Bangladesh, should have clean nuclear energy". He said that no country could tell others not to advance their science and technology. Faranzadeh said that Iran fully cooperated with the IAEA and allowed the UN agency to visit all nuclear facilities in Iran. "The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the main victims of the use of WMDs," the ambassador said, adding that Iran was the first country to propose making the Middle-East free of nuclear weapons, and reiterates its position in this respect. bd
