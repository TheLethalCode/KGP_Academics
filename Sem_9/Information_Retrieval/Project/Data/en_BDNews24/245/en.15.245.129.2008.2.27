 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Co-habiting couples could soon be subject to formal financial rights upon separation, if the government accepts proposals set out by the Law Commission. It unveiled recommendations last summer to give unmarried couples rights in the event of a break-up, including allowing partners to claim cash lump sums, the right to live in the shared home and a possible split of their ex's pension. The proposals, which have been laid before ministers, aim to introduce a "new scheme of financial remedies" for the 2.2 million co-habiting couples in England and Wales. A spokeswoman for the Law Commission told Reuters that it expects to receive an interim response from the government "imminently". The proposed scheme would only apply to couples who have had a child together or have lived together for a recommended minimum of between two and five years. Couples could opt out of the scheme by written agreement. Unlike cases of divorce, cohabitants would not be expected to meet each other's future needs by way of maintenance payments and there would be no principle that the parties should share their assets equally. Unveiling the plans, Stuart Bridge, the Commissioner leading the project, said: "More and more families involve couples who are living together, but who have not married. "The law that currently applies to resolve property disputes between such couples on separation is unclear and complicated, and it can produce unfair outcomes. "This causes serious hardship, not only to cohabitants themselves, but also to their children." Suzanne Todd, a partner in the family team at legal firm Withers, said the proposals, if implemented, would result in "greater fairness for thousands of cohabiting couples upon separation", but conceded there were practical difficulties. "The proposals could create an interesting scenario for those who are married but separated, and are now living with a new partner," she said. "Such individuals could find themselves facing two claims concurrently, both on divorce and on breakdown of the cohabitation. "The report also introduces some new legal concepts and appears to cherry-pick ideas from different areas of law," she added. "This could create difficulty in application and we're likely to see a period of uncertainty until some test cases have been decided." In the meantime, unmarried couples can enter into so-called "cohabitation contracts", which work in a similar way to pre-nuptials, when they move in together. Like pre-nups, there is no guarantee that these contracts will be accepted by courts -- but the suggestion that co-habiting couples could opt out of the proposed new scheme suggests that couples, whether married or co-habiting, could be given the same right to regulate their affairs through automatically binding pre-nuptial agreements. Setting out who owns what, as well as what contributions you plan to make towards the rent or mortgage repayments, should help co-habitants divide their possessions should the relationship founder. Consider owning property as tenants in common, rather than joint tenants, if you want to leave your share to someone other than your partner. Other sensible steps include writing a will if you own a home together, making sure both your names are on tenancy agreements if you move into a rented property, and nominating your cohabitee as your pension beneficiary if you want him or her to receive the payout after your
