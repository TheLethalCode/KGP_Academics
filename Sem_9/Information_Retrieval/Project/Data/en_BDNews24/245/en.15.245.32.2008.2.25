 SYDNEY, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia were fined for a slow over-rate during their 18-run victory over India in the tri-series match at Sydney on Sunday. The Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who was named man of the match after scoring 124, was docked 20 percent of his match fee while his team mates were slapped with a 10 percent deduction after they fell two overs behind. The Australians were also fined for a slow-over rate during the third test against India in Perth last month and International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Jeff Crowe said they had been warned to speed things up. "Prior to the (first tri-series) match in Melbourne, I had talks with the Australia team management in which I had again reminded them of their responsibilities regarding over-rates," Crowe said in a statement released on Monday.

"In such circumstances, getting through their overs in the early stages would assist them to have enough time available to work with the bowlers and set fielding placing when the match enters the last 10 overs or crucial stages
