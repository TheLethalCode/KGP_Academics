 Kathmandu, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A protester and a police officer were killed on Monday during violent anti-government protests in Nepal's south as candidates filed nominations for this year's election, a government official said. A 35-year-old man died as police and protesters demanding greater regional autonomy shot at each other in Rajbiraj town in the Terai plains bordering India, said Modraj Dotel, an interior ministry spokesman. In neighbouring Sunsari district, a policeman was "captured and killed" by protesters, said Dotel, without giving further details. "The trouble started after the protesters tried to stop candidates from filing the nomination papers," Dotel said. Elections are due on April 10, but many are questioning if they can go ahead if violent protests continue. The protesters are demanding greater autonomy for the Terai, an area dominated by ethnic Madheshi people with closer linguistic and cultural ties with northern Indians across the border than the hillfolk of Nepal. Monday's violence brings the death toll to four since Madheshi groups called a general strike and blocked roads between India and Kathmandu, restricting essential supplies to the capital. Similar protests last year claimed at least 45 lives. Media reports said dozens were injured in clashes between the protesters and police elsewhere in the region on Monday. The government and Madheshi groups are talking, but have not reached an agreement. The government says it does not plan to delay the elections.
