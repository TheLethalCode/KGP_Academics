 BELGRADE, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's likely next president, Dmitry Medvedev, told Serbian leaders on Monday there would be no shift in Moscow's support for Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo. Medvedev, the Kremlin-backed frontrunner for president, met pro-Western President Boris Tadic and nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who has long leaned on Moscow for help against the secession of Serbia's southern province. "The point of my brief visit was to express support to Serbia" at a time when it faces Kosovo's secession, Medvedev said. "We assume Serbia is a single state whose jurisdiction covers all of its territory. We will stick to this position."

"This agreement shows that apart from the political aspect, the cooperation between Serbia and Russia is ongoing on all levels," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, a nationalist who favours cooling ties with the West over its support for Kosovo's independence. He has ordered the withdrawal of Serb ambassadors from the countries that have recognised Kosovo and was the main force between the agreement on South Stream in January over the objections of his liberal coalition partners. "There cannot be a normalisation of relations with states that have recognised Kosovo's independence until they annul their decision," Kostunica said. Belgrade lost control of Kosovo in 1999, when NATO expelled Serb forces accused of ethnic cleansing while fighting a guerrilla war.
