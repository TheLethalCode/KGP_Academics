<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cuba picked a new government on Sunday, installing Raul Castro as president after his ailing brother Fidel Castro retired following 49 years in power. In a sign that change is unlikely to be deep or abrupt, hard-line communist party ideologue Jose Ramon Machado Ventura was named first vice president, or Cuba's No. 2. Here are some quotes on the new government: -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Cuba's main foreign benefactor: "A hug for Comrade Fidel, you will continue being the commander. Long live Fidel, long live Raul and long live Cuba. Stand up and applaud Cuba and Raul the new president." -- Raul Castro on Chavez's television show: "None of my speeches last more than an hour and that's because Fidel and the president of Venezuela are more intelligent than me and have more things to say, not for any other reason." -- US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice: "At this significant moment in Cuba's history, we reaffirm our belief that the Cuban people have an inalienable right to participate in an open and comprehensive dialogue about their country's future, free of fear and repression, and to choose their leaders in democratic elections." -- Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-born south Florida Republican: "To the long oppressed Cuban people it does not matter one bit who the communist Castro brothers choose as the next face of their oppressive, tyrannical regime. What the Cuban people want is freedom to express their dissent from the oppressive regime and enjoy the liberty and freedom that other nations around the globe have." -- Andro Nodarse-Leon, a director of the Miami-based and anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation: "It's unfortunately more of the same coming out of Cuba and no real sign that there is an openness to a changing of the guard or a broader opening to real transition toward having a free and democratic country, which is what Cubans want." -- Julia Sweig, senior fellow and expert on Cuba at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations: "It's a mistake to think there's an enormous amount of light between any of these people (in the new Cuban government). They're all basically headed in the same direction, with some nuances." -- Ninoska Perez, a popular Spanish-language radio commentator in Miami and member of the Cuban Liberty Council, an anti-Castro exile group: "For those who entertain any ideas that there could be changes with Raul Castro I think this should give them a very good answer." -- Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a group that espouses non-violent opposition to Fidel Castro: "There is no such thing as elections in Cuba ... There is actually no change in Cuba taking place." -- Eduardo Migueltorena, a Miami real estate agent who came to Florida in the 1980 Mariel boatlift: "Castro is still going to have the power. Cuba is going to be the same and nobody is going to have freedom in Cuba." -- Jaime de Hombre, a Miami-based exile who fled Cuba in 1959: "Since day one I have waited for this day, looked forward to this day ... It's disappointing, it's disappointing. I would like to see him (Fidel Castro) suffer." -- Roberto Casanova, a state-employed worker out buying bananas at a Havana street market after the new government was elected: "This is a tough task for Raul. The first thing that has to stop is corruption. A lot of problems have built up in the country.
