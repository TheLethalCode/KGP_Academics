 LONDON, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, as upbeat results from Britain's Standard Chartered supported banks, while reassurance over the creditworthiness of the two largest US bond insurers boosted insurance stocks. Shares in Standard Chartered jumped 6.3 percent, making it one of the biggest gainers on the index, after the Asia-focused bank beat expectations with a 27 percent rise in annual profit and said it is confident of a strong 2008. Spanish construction and infrastructure company Ferrovial was the biggest percentage gainer, jumping 7.9 percent, even after the company's quarterly results fell short of expectations. The stock has fallen by 13 percent in the last two months and has been lingering around three-year lows. At 1005 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.2 percent to 1,358.07 points -- close to the day's high. The index rose 1.7 percent on Monday but is still down 10 percent so far this year. "There's still a general lack of direction. The buying of the last two days I think is a result of the previous two days where we sold off before the weekend," said Jimmy Yates, dealer at CMC Markers. "It's good news from the banks in the same way that we had some bad news from the banks last week." FINANCIALS BUOYED The DJ Stoxx index of European banks rose 2.1 percent. HSBC was up 3.1 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland gained 3.8 percent and Credit Agricole was up 4.4 percent. French President Nicolas Sarkozy stepped up pressure on the head of Societe Generale to quit over the bank's record trading scandal, but France's top business lobby warned him not to interfere. The stock was up 2.1 percent. Elsewhere in the financial sector, French insurer Axa rose 3.8 percent and Germany's Allianz also rose 3.5 percent, despite price target cuts from JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers and UBS. Standard & Poor's removed its threat to downgrade MBIA Inc's "AAA" rating, while rival Ambac Financial Group was said to be near a deal to shore up its financial position. Investors have punished shares in both companies as concern has grown that their exposure to the subprime lending crisis threatens their top credit ratings. Siemens rallied 2.5 percent after it said it would cut 6,800 jobs at its corporate telecoms unit -- two-fifths of the unit's workforce -- to reshape the business into a software provider as it seeks to divest the division. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.2 percent, Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 1.1 percent. Later in the day, investors will look out for US wholesale inflation figures for January at 1330, as well as results from major retailers Home Depot and Target Co
