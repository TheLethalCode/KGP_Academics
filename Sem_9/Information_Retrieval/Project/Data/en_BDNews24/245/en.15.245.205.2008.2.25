<TITLE> New Cyprus leader under pressure to end division </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newly elected Cyprus President Demetris Christofias came under immediate pressure on Monday to make promised efforts to reunite the divided Mediterranean island. Christofias, 62, has already agreed to meet the leader of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north. Both the European Union and the Cypriot press urged him to waste no time to end partition. A communist party leader who says he will not tamper with the island's market economy, Christofias rode a wave of discontent with his predecessor's hardline policies towards Turkish Cypriots to win Sunday's runoff election. Analysts said both sides are aware this may be the last window of opportunity for Cyprus, whose division hinders Turkey's bid to join the European Union and is a source of tension between NATO allies Turkey and Greece. "I would strongly encourage you to grasp this chance and without delay start negotiations under United Nations auspices with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community on a comprehensive settlement," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement to Christofias. The Cypriot press hailed the day as historic, both because Christofias becomes the island's first communist president and the only one in the 27-member EU, but also as an opportunity finally to end the island's stalemate. "After five wasted years ... he has a moral obligation to try to make up for lost ground," wrote the Cyprus Mail daily. The island has been split along ethnic lines since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Reunification efforts broke down in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. plan and a divided Cyprus joined the EU soon after. Ankara's EU entry negotiations have been partly suspended because of the deadlock over Cyprus. The EU recognises the Greek-Cypriot government in the south, where voting took place on Sunday, while only Turkey recognises the breakaway north. HARDLINER OUSTED The surprise elimination of incumbent President Tassos Papadopoulos in the first round on Feb. 17 raised hopes the Greek Cypriots might be ready for a deal. Papadopoulos had led the opposition to the U.N. plan in 2004. "Now there are no more excuses ... no one is left on the stage to block a solution," said Sener Levent, editor of the Turkish Cypriot Afrika newspaper in a column. Christofias and Turkish-Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat spoke immediately after his election victory and agreed to meet "at the earliest possible date". Diplomats in Nicosia said this was crucial to improving the climate between the two sides but what was really needed was for Greek Cypriots to come up with proposals on a solution model. "I extend a hand of friendship to my compatriots the Turkish Cypriots and their political leadership, I call on them to work together for our common cause, a country of peace," Christofias, told a stadium full of jubilant supporters late on Sunday. The 2004 plan, which had been approved by Turkish Cypriots, called for a loose federation of separate states. A UN team was expected on the island by early April to assess the potential for a settlement, diplomats said. "Mediators want to see Talat and Christofias talking, that is the first crucial step," said a Western diplomat in Nicosia. "Mediators will facilitate but the initiatives and proposals must come from the Cypriots." "You have two presidents whose parties have worked hard to re-unite Cyprus for 34 years. If they don't do it, who will?" said Mete Hatay, a researcher for the PRIO peace institute in Nicos
