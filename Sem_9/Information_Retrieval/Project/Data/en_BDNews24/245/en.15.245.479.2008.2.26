<TITLE> Thai poll body disqualifies top ruling politician </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Election Commission ruled on Tuesday a top politician of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) was guilty of vote-buying in a December poll, which could possibly lead to a dissolution of the party. The five-member commission ruled three to two that there were "sufficient grounds to believe" PPP deputy leader and Parliament President Yongyut Tiyapairat had violated election laws, Commissioner Somchai Jungprasert told reporters. However, the ruling, based on evidence Yongyut had mobilised village chiefs to buy votes, would have to be endorsed by the Supreme Court before the commission could hold hearings into whether the party itself was behind the violation, he said. If that were the case, the PPP could face disbandment -- as former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) was after the September 2006 coup which ousted him. Yongyut, a former minister and close confidante of Thaksin, said he would step down as house speaker temporarily while he fought the charges. "This is a systematic political attempt to sabotage the People Power Party and deprive me of justice," he told reporters. The EC decision pushed the stock index down 1.7 percent as investors feared it could reignite two years of political turmoil the December election was meant to end. It recovered to end the day down 0.5 percent as investors realised the end game could take months, traders said. Giles Ungphakorn of Chulalongkorn University said disbanding the PPP "would cause a serious political crisis". "It would be very, very dangerous for them to do that because it's quite clear the PPP, and Thai Rak Thai before that, has the backing of the majority of the electorate," he said. Election Commission chief Suthiphon Thaveechaiyagarn said it would take two weeks to forward the decision on Yongyut to the Supreme Court. Legal analysts said the court could take a couple of months to deliver its ruling. If the court confirmed Yongyut was guilty, the commission would then investigate whether the party itself was involved and pass its findings to the Constitutional Court, which could take at least a year to make a ruling, analysts said. Another top PPP leader distanced the party from Yongyut immediately after the EC ruling, saying he acted alone. "The party was never involved in any personal matter because we have already informed our party members of all regulations and laws they have to follow," PPP secretary-general Surapong Suebwonglee told reporte
