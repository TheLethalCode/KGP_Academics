In a position backed by the West, Israel has ruled out dealings with Hamas until it recognises the Jewish state, renounces violence and accepts existing peace accords. Hamas says it would consider a ceasefire if Israel lifted its blockade and ceased military operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
