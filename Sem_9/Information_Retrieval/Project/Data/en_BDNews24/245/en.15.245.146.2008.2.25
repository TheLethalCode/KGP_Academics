 Washington, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is Cuba's new leadership team headed by President Raul Castro, who formally became his ailing brother Fidel Castro's successor on Sunday. Raul Castro, 76, is the world's longest-serving defense minister, commanding the Cuban armed forces since the 1959 revolution led by his brother. He has been acting president since July 2006 when his brother was sidelined by illness. Fidel Castro announced his retirement on Tuesday. Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 77, a hardline communist ideologue and old guard revolutionary, was named Cuba's new deputy leader, the first vice president of the executive Council of State. The balding apparatchik, who fought as a doctor with Raul Castro in the guerrilla uprising that brought the Castros to power in 1959, is in charge of organization in the ruling Communist Party, and is a prominent member of the its central committee and political bureau. He gave the eulogy at the funeral of Raul Castro's wife Wilma. Gen. Julio Casas Regueiro, 72, was named Defense Minister in place of Raul Castro, and became one of the five second-tier vice presidents on the governing council. As deputy defense minister, Casas Regueiro oversaw the growth of the army's successful business ventures, ranging from hotels and stores to an airline and a car rental company. Other generals appointed to the 31-member Council of State include army chief of staff Alvaro Lopez Mieres, western army chief Leopoldo Cintra Frias and Guillermo Garcia, 82, one of the three historic guerrilla commanders, other than Fidel and Raul Castro, still alive. Garcia was a peasant who helped the Castros reach the Sierra Maestra mountains after their disastrous landing aboard the yacht Granma in 1956. One notable absence was Otto Rivero, a former Communist Youth leader, who was dropped from the Council of State. Rivero was a Fidel Castro protege who led programs in the former leader's campaign to strengthen socialism called the "Battle of Ideas.
