 Brussels, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union hopes to launch talks on closer political and economic ties with Libya this year as part of a drive to boost ties with key energy suppliers, an EU official said on Monday. The European Commission is expected on Wednesday to propose a mandate for it to conduct negotiations on behalf of the bloc in areas covering trade, economic cooperation and migration. The mandate has to be approved by the EU's 27 member states. "We want a substantial agreement covering the political, trade and cooperation," an EU official said, adding that the hope was to launch the talks this year. EU ties with Libya were stalled for years over charges that the Libyan government supported terrorism. But Brussels announced in July it would boost ties after Tripoli freed Bulgarian medics accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV. In the deal struck to secure the liberation of the medics, the EU held out the prospect of increased market access for Libya in fisheries and agricultural products, as well as cooperation on migration and tourism. Europe imports the bulk of Libya's oil exports and European firms are keen to expand energy investment there. The EU also wants Libya to help in sea patrols aimed at stemming a flood of illegal migrants from Africa. The EU official said it was not clear whether the EU talks would take place under the auspices of the EU's so-called Barcelona process, which Libya has appeared reluctant to embrace given requirements for political and economic liberalisation. The return of the medics to Bulgaria ended what critics called a human rights scandal and allowed the long-isolated Libya to complete a process of normalising ties with the West.
