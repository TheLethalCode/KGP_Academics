 Yerevan, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The authorities in the Armenian capital on Monday told crowds protesting against the result of last week's presidential election for the sixth successive day to end their rallies. Up to 25,000 people have gathered in Yerevan's main square every day since the Feb. 19 election demanding a re-run of the poll, which they say was rigged in favour of Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan. Sarksyan officially won 53 percent of the vote against 21.5 percent for his nearest rival, former president Levan Ter-Petrosyan. "Organisers have to stop arranging these unsanctioned demonstrations," Yerevan's city administration said in a statement. "The city transport system cannot work and the rallies are infringing people's right to travel and move freely." Hundreds of police watched the crowd, which remained peaceful. Ex-Soviet Armenia lies on the western fringes of the Caucasus, which carries a pipeline that pumps oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. Western monitors said the election process could be improved but was broadly in line with Armenia's international commitments. Earlier in the day the foreign ministry confirmed that it had fired seven diplomats for siding with the protesters, and said it was unethical for the diplomats to involve themselves with politics. Last week the deputy prosecutor-general joined the protests.
