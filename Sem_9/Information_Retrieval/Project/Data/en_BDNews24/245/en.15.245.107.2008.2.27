<TITLE> Egypt detains 22 Muslim Brotherhood members </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cairo, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police detained at least 22 members of the Muslim Brotherhood on Wednesday in an expanding crackdown on Egypt's most powerful opposition group ahead of local elections due in April, the Brotherhood said. Most of the men, including one in his 80s, were detained in dawn house raids in eight provinces. Five detainees are top Brotherhood officials in their provinces, according to Brotherhood official Gamal Nassar. Brotherhood sources said the police detained two former members of parliament, Saber Sadiq and Mohamed el-Ezzabawy, but released Ezzabawy shortly thereafter. A security source said the men were detained on suspicion of belonging to an illegal organisation -- charges the government uses regularly to justify holding Brotherhood members. He said 25 were held. The Brotherhood put the number at 22. On Tuesday, an Egyptian military court delayed a verdict for 40 members of the Brotherhood charged with belonging to a banned group, while police detained at least 17 Brotherhood members in house raids. Around 560 members of the Brotherhood are currently being held by police, the group has said. The authorities routinely detain Muslim Brotherhood members before elections to complicate their campaigning plans. Brotherhood leader Mohamed Mahdi Akef said last week the Brotherhood campaign would continue despite the detentions. Egypt postponed local council elections for two years in 2006 after the Brotherhood performed better than expected in the parliamentary election of 2005. The non-violent Muslim Brotherhood, which holds a fifth of the seats in the lower house of parliament through members who ran as independents, seeks an Islamic state through democratic means and operates openly despite a decade-old ban.
