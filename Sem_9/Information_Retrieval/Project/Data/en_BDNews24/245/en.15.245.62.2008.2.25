 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose sharply early on Monday, with banks gaining on acquisition talk and the broad market buoyed by hopes for a rescue package for a US bond insurer that would limit damage from a credit crisis. At 0917 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.6 percent at 1,341.11 points, with banks contributing more than a quarter of the index's gains. Newspaper reports of Qatari interest in building a stake in Royal Bank of Scotland sent the stock 6.6 percent higher, and Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley gained more than 6 percent on talk that Lloyds TSB could be weighing a bid for one of the groups. Lloyds TSB declined to comment. Other banks also gained, with HSBC rising 2.3 percent, ING 3.4 percent, Barclays 2.9 percent and UBS 2.9 percent. The sector was also lifted by comments from Qatar's prime minister, who heads the country's $60 billion sovereign wealth fund, that he favoured investing in European over US lenders. On Friday, a source familiar with the matter said a rescue for bond insurer Ambac Financial Group could be announced early this week. Talks with the banks including Citigroup, UBS and Wachovia were advancing, the source said. "It's going to be a good start to the week, with news on the bond insurers, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund and that Qatar might be buying into RBS," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. "But none of the underlying worries about the economy have gone away. More people are looking at bank shares, which are heavily discounted, but there's more bad news to come: a weakening economy, less lending and a market that's shrunk overall." He added that this could lead to mergers and acquisitions in the sector. "There's going to be more blood on the carpet, and we'll see consolidation of some of the smaller players." Across the region, Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.7 percent, Germany's DAX rose 1.1 percent, and France's CAC rose 1.6 percent. A MUCH BETTER MONTH The FTSEurofirst 300 has gained 0.7 percent in February, while it tumbled nearly 12 percent last month. The gains in February have been largely the result of two US rate cuts late in January, and broadly strong corporate results for Europe's top companies. Swiss drugmaker Roche jumped 3.8 percent after the unexpected US approval of its key Avastin drug for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, a positive surprise after an earlier negative drug opinion. Oil stocks rose as crude prices inched back towards $100 a barrel, with BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total all up about 2 percent. Among other notable gainers, British property firm Hammerson Plc jumped 7 percent after releasing strong 2007 resul
