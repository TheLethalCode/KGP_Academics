 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's hopes of reaching the ICC under-19 World Cup semi-finals were dashed Sunday after conceding a humiliating 201-run defeat to South Africa at the Bayuemas Oval in Kuala Lumpur. The junior Tigers folded at 41 all-out after only 11.5 overs, well short of their opponent's 242 for eight in 50 overs. Facing up to a strong Proteas squad simply proved too much for the young Bangladesh team in the second quarterfinal of the tournament. Proteas skipper Wayne Parnell dominated the play, banishing his opponents in style after claiming six wickets for eight in five overs, following a knock of 57. Five Bangladeshi batsman were out for a duck, following a fierce onslaught from Parnell. Only middle-order Nasir Hossain crossed double digits, making 17 before becoming the on-form Parnell's fifth victim. Shubashish Roy ended as the second highest scorer with just eight. Left-handed pacer Parnell rattled through Bangladesh's top and middle-order, removing both openers in the first over. Abraham Pienaar, another fast left-hander, cleaned up the tail-end with two-for-eight. Dollar Mahmud retired injured on one in the 12th over off Matthew Arnold, which left the field without their last batsman. Bangladesh were eventually all-out without securing their half century. Sent in to bat first, Bangladesh got off to a fine start with pacer Shubashish Roy ripping through the South African top order, but they failed to sustain their early momentum. Vandiar and Yaseen Vallie defied the Bangladesh attack, putting on 66 runs for the fifth wicket after South Africa were reduced to 69 for four in 17.4 overs. Vandiar (45 off 47 balls) and Vallie (28 off 41 balls) returned to the dressing room in two successive overs, before the dominant Parnell took to the field. The Proteas skipper went on to hammer eight fours in his 60-ball knock. Shubashish and Rubel managed two wickets each for 31 and 41 respectively. Bangladesh will now play a place-deciding match against the losers of the Pakistan and Australia fixture on Feb 28. The Pakistan-Australia quarterfinal match takes place Monday at the Kinrara Cricket Academy ground in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, India became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals, beating England by seven wickets in the first quarterfinals at the KCA ground. India raced to 149 for three in 39.1 overs, in reply to England's 143 all out in 46 overs. bd
