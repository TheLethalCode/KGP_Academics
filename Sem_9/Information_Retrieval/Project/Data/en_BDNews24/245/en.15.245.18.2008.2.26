 Kathmandu, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police shot dead a protester in southern Nepal on Tuesday as protest leaders met the government to try and end the violence that has clouded forthcoming national elections, officials said. The man was killed in Nawalparasi town in the Terai plains, the fifth death since blockades began this month by groups demanding greater autonomy for their region. The government has so far rejected this demand. "Police were forced to open fire on protesters who surrounded our post and attacked us with stones," said Bheshraj Sharma, a police official. The protesters belong to the Madheshi ethnic group, which has more in common culturally and linguistically with northern Indians across the border than Nepalis living in the mountainous bulk of the country. Leaders from three Madheshi groups involved in the protests went into the latest round of talks with the government on Tuesday evening. Before the meeting at the house of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, negotiators from both sides said they thought it was likely they would reach an agreement this time. On Apr. 10, Nepalis are due to elect a special assembly which will map out Nepal's political future and declare a formal end to nearly 240 years of monarchy. International observers are worried that the elections might not be possible unless the violence is ended. Blockades have hindered the supply of fuel and other essential goods into the capital, Kathmandu, and surrounding areas. At least 45 people were killed in similar violence last year in the Terai, a fertile region home to nearly half of Nepal's 26 million people.
