 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British government's tax agency said on Monday it had paid for information on secret Liechtenstein bank accounts held by British citizens, joining a German crackdown on tax evaders. "Payment has been made," a spokeswoman for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said, refusing to confirm the sum involved. Media reports said Britain could collect 100 million pounds ($196.5 million) in unpaid taxes after paying a whistleblower 100,000 pounds for details of Liechtenstein accounts held by about 100 wealthy Britons. "HMRC is authorised to make such payments and would ensure that the information was well based before making any payment," the spokeswoman said. The Financial Times reported that Britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after Germany's intelligence service paid 4.2 million euros ($6.22 million) for similar information on German citizens.

The whistleblower is believed to be a former employee of LGT, a private bank owned by Liechtenstein's royal family, the Financial Times and other newspapers said. The agency is working closely with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to tackle banking secrecy laws being used to deny member countries tax revenues, officials said. Any Briton found to have evaded tax by putting money in a Liechtenstein account faces fines of up to 100 percent of the tax owed, and in some cases, up to seven years in prison. A major German investigation into tax dodging centring on Liechtenstein and its secretive banks has sparked a backlash in Germany against the tiny Alpine country, which relies on discreet banking services to attract foreign cash. The German probe has focused on suspicions that hundreds of rich Germans evaded taxes by parking money in Liechtenstein's banks. It has cost Deutsche Post's chief executive his job and threatens to claim other high-profile victims. Liechtenstein accused Germany of illegally acquiring the data after Germany confirmed it paid for information. Liechtenstein is one of three countries on the OECD's tax-haven black-list, alongside Andorra and Monaco. Germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries like Switzerland, Luxembourg and Austria. A senior US lawmaker said last week he would launch an investigation into US citizens who hid assets at L
