<TITLE> Nikkei ends at 6-wk closing high on China fund report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average rose more than 3 percent on Monday, posting a six-week closing high as market sentiment improved after a newspaper reported that China's sovereign wealth fund planned to buy as much as $10 billion in Japanese stocks. Another big boost came from financial shares including top insurer Millea Holdings and banks as talk of a US bond insurer rescue plan eased concern about the subprime loan crisis. Inpex Holdings Inc and property firms advanced as Britain's Times newspaper said the $200 billion China Investment Corporation (CIC) could consider purchasing a large stake in the oil and gas developer and eventually move towards direct investments, such as in real estate. "For Japanese stocks, the biggest positive driver for today is the China sovereign wealth fund news," said Fujio Ando, senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management. The Nikkei average rose 3.1 percent or 414.11 points to end at 13,914.57, its highest close since Jan. 15. "The next target will be whether the Nikkei is able to touch 14,000, but that will still depend on the outlooks for economic health and next year's earnings," Ando said. In the United States this week, the market is awaiting the release of several price indexes and growth indicators, which will help determine whether the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates as it seeks to stimulate the economy. Yusuke Sakai, manager of equities trading at Mizuho Securities, said if some sovereign wealth funds were to start buying Japanese stocks, that would help solidify the downside, though they might not be able to significantly boost the market. The broader TOPIX index was up 2.6 percent or 34.17 points at 1,355.54, its highest finish since Feb. 4. Market participants said that while stocks had touched bottom and the level was gradually rising, it was hard to see sustained gains keeping the Nikkei average above 13,800, which was a selling point during a rally earlier this month. Still, Christopher Wood, an equity strategist at CLSA, said Japanese stocks are already cheap enough to attract the world's value investors. U.S. stocks staged a late rally on Friday on news that banks were near a deal to bail out bond insurer Ambac Financial and that a rescue could come this week, but a source told Reuters while progress had been made the deal might still fall through. INPEX, PROPERTY FIRMS UP, FINANCIALS GAIN Shares of Inpex were up 7.9 percent at 1.23 million yen, while property firms Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd jumped 6 percent to 2,580 yen and Sumitomo Realty & Development Co Ltd advanced 4.4 percent to 1,900 yen. The Chinese fund will first concentrate on Tokyo stocks and eventually move towards direct investments, such as real estate, the British paper said, citing sources close to Japanese Financial Services Minister Yoshimi Watanabe. Insurers surged on the Ambac rescue talk, with insurance IINSU.becoming the greatest gainer among the subindices, rising 8.1 percent. The banking subindex IBNKS.rose 4.1 percent, also on positive sentiment over a possible Ambac rescue. Shares of Millea, Japan's top non-life insurance company, shot up 8.9 percent to 4,030 yen, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co Ltd climbed 10.2 percent to 1,107 yen, Sompo Japan Insurance jumped 9 percent to 974 yen. Aioi Insurance Co surged 14.3 percent to 513 yen even after saying it now expected to fall into the red this year with losses on subprime-related investments expected to balloon to about $857 million. Traders bought on the view that the worst news for Aioi may be out for now. "Investors like the gains in US financials, buoyed by a monoline (bond insurer) rescue plan expected sometime this week," said Takahiko Murai, a general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. "Still, it (the subprime problem) is deep-rooted. The most troublesome part is that we don't know how much the related losses will amount to." Elsewhere, Sharp Corp jumped 5.2 percent to 2,100 yen after a source said Sony Corp was planning to start buying TV-use liquid crystal display (LCD) panels from Sharp. Sony currently runs an LCD panel joint venture with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Procurement from Sharp would help it secure panels to meet fast-growing demand for LCD TVs without heavy capital investment. Sony rose 2.4 percent to 5,140 yen. Trade was moderate on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 2.2 billion shares changing hands, in line with last week's daily average.
