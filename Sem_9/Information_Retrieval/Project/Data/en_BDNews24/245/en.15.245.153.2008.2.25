 HONG KONG, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Monday, sending the Nikkei to a six-week closing high, after talk of a rescue for a US bond insurer eased worries about credit-related losses in the global financial sector. But US recession fears remained in place, pressuring the dollar against other currencies, while geopolitical concerns in Iran and Turkey lifted oil prices above $99 a barrel. European shares were seen opening 1.2-1.5 percent higher, tracking Asian markets as a rescue plan for Ambac Financial could allow the US bond insurer to keep its top credit ratings and avert sell-downs of the debt it has guaranteed. "People recognise some of the problems that would occur if we saw the bond insurers downgraded and that's certainly been weighing on the minds of investors in the last few weeks," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie. "The fact that there's a rescue plan is definitely a positive and it mitigates one of the risks for the banks." The MSCI's index of Asian stocks excluding Japan rose 1.1 percent as of 0610 GMT, led by financial firms such as Australia's Macquarie Group and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group. Still, analysts warned stocks in Asia could remain under pressure given uncertainty of what else lies in store for markets that have seen double digit declines this year on the back of crumbling credit markets and writedowns at global lenders. "It's impossible to call an end to it," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. "First, it was subprime and then different investment banks and now it's insurers. It has to go all the way through the food chain probably." CHINA STOCKS SLIDE Chinese stocks lost 3 percent amid worries of new share supply, with China Railway Construction aiming for a $5.4 billion Shanghai and Hong Kong listing, and Sinopec sliding on its $4.2 billion convertible bond offer. Stocks in South Korea gained 1.3 percent, helped by the inauguration of former businessman Lee Myung-bak, while Taiwan's stocks rose 2.2 percent on hopes over improved business ties with China. Australian stocks gained 1.1 percent, while markets in Hong Kong and Singapore up less than 1 percent each. The Nikkei surged 3.1 percent to its highest close since Jan. 15 thanks to gain in insurers such as Millea Holdings Shares were also bolstered on a media report that China's sovereign wealth fund planned to buy as much as $10 billion in Japanese stocks as well as a stake in oil and gas developer Inpex Holdings Although Asian financial firms have so far avoided the extent of credit- and subprime-related writedowns at U.S. and European lenders, markets as a whole have still suffered from a lack of investor confidence that has spread worldwide. The prospects of a U.S. recession have also hurt, with the MSCI index of Asian equities excluding Japan down 11 percent this year as of Friday. US RECESSION WORRIES The dollar stuck near a three-week low against the euro of $1.4815 on market expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates to avert a sharp slowdown in the world's largest economy. The Japanese yen was steady against the greenback but Japanese government bond figures slipped towards a two-month low as investors added riskier assets to their portfolios. March 10-year futures fell 0.34 point to 137.15. US crude futures rose 75 cents to $99.56 a barrel following Iran's warning on Sunday that more UN sanctions would be "costly" to Western powers, sparking talk the world's fourth-largest oil exporter would cut crude exports. The gains were also powered after Turkish troops fought Kurdish PKK rebels in northern Iraq on Sunday. Spot platinum slipped to $2,158/2,155 an ounce on Monday on continued profit-taking, though spot gold bounced back to $947.90/$948.70 on expectations for lower US interest ra
