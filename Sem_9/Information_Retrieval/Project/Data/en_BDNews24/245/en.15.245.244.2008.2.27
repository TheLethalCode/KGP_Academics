<TITLE> Novartis premium threatened by sparse new drugs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, Switzerland, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A premium on Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's stock is under threat as a thin portfolio of new drugs provides scant confidence in its hopes for a second-half recovery. Novartis shares lost 12 percent of their value in 2007, knocked by delays to key products and the withdrawal of bowel drug Zelnorm from US shelves, and have fallen a further 10 percent so far this year, despite job cuts and an improved dividend. The stock now trades at 12 times forecast 2008 earnings, according to Reuters data, but is still at a premium to other European drug majors, which are also struggling to develop new drugs. "The question is, how confident can you be about the re-acceleration given that their product portfolio is maturing?" said Luis Correia, a healthcare fund manager at private bank Clariden Leu. GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Europe's largest drugmaker, trades at 11 times forecast 2008 earnings and Sanofi-Aventis SA and AstraZeneca Plc both have a multiple of 9. But Basel-based Novartis lags local rival Roche Holding AG, which with a multiple of 15 has so far been immune to many of the problems facing the industry -- such as increasing competition from cheaper copycat medicines and a tougher approval process for new drugs -- and the gap may widen. Morgan Stanley analyst Paul Mann expects no major new drug launches from Novartis before 2009, and soon after that patents on top-selling drugs like high blood pressure treatments Diovan and Exforge are due to expire. "It is inevitable that Novartis will enter a period of declining revenues and earnings in 2011, in our view," said Mann, "We expect this to be reflected in a contracting multiple." SLOWING GROWTH Most analysts believe Roche, also based in Basel, justifies its premium to the sector due to its limited patent exposure and promising new drugs, like Avastin for treating cancer. The other European large-cap drugmakers -- including Novartis -- have similar earnings profiles, with solid growth over the next few years followed by a slowdown or even contraction as lower-cost competition kicks in from 2011, said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. Novartis revenue is seen growing at just 2 percent in 2008, according to Reuters data. Sales are then seen rising by 7 percent growth for 2009-2011 but falling from 2012. Sales at both Roche and Glaxo are expected to rise 5 percent in 2012. Sanofi's revenue is seen growing 1 percent, and Astra's falling 9 percent, Reuters data showed. Drug companies' increased spending on research is yielding fewer new medicines due to a combination of poor productivity, a tighter regulatory environment and rising patent risks, which allows more competition from cheaper copies known as generics. That puts pressure on Novartis's research programme after its recent setbacks -- including delays to diabetes treatment Galvus and a slow launch of blood pressure drug Tekturna. It lacks any obvious billion-dollar seller candidates with the possible exception of FTY720 for multiple sclerosis. Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Vasella expressed confidence in the firm's pipeline this week, saying it was generating enough "golden eggs" for the future, though he did not go into details. LEADERSHIP QUESTIONS Questions remain over Vasella's leadership, a medical doctor who took charge of Novartis after the $41-billion merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy in 1996, with the share price now similar to 1997 levels. Novartis has no clear successor lined up and Vasella said last year he sees himself remaining as both chairman and chief executive for the foreseeable future. The choice of Joe Jimenez as the new head of the drugmaker's pharmaceuticals unit has also been criticised by analysts as he has a background in consumer goods rather than health. "So in case Vasella should one day go, it seems they are not really training anyone to be the CEO of the company because this should be the person who is CEO of pharma," said Clariden Leu's Correia. "To me it's wrong from the cultural point of view of the company to treat the pharma business like it is a consumer goods compan
