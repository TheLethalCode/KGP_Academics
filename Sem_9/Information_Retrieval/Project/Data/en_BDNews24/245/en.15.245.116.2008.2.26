 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)The tenure of elected local government representatives in 102 municipalities expires in June, an adviser said Tuesday. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said the Local Government Division had sent a letter to the Election Commission for polls in the municipalities and handover of power to new representatives in time. Earlier, the adviser presided over a meeting of different organisations and corporations, under the Local Government Division. Later in a news briefing, Iqbal said: "The EC will conduct polls. We have sent the EC a list, now it is the commission which will decide election dates. The government will not intervene in the EC's work." On whether the national and local polls would be held simultaneously, he said: "The EC will decide." "The government has a draft law to run all the city corporations together. The law would include eligibility of contestants in elections," he added. "To make sure that there are no shortcomings, the government would discuss with the commission before finalising the law." "There's a possibility that the educational qualifications of the candidates would not be mentioned as in the case of lawmakers. It might be in conflict with constitution if we want to do anything in this regard," he added. bdnews
