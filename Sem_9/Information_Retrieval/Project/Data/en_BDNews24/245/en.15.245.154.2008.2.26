<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)The organisation of bank owners, Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), and bank executives' organisation, Association of Bankers Bangladesh (ABB), Tuesday failed to reach a final decision over interest rate cuts. The final decision will be taken at a meeting set for Sunday. The proposal will be submitted to Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed at a Monday meeting, Syed Manzur Elahi, the chief of the committee on lowering interest rates on bank loans, told bdnews24.com. After a meeting at the BAB office on Kemal Ataturk Avenue in Banani, the FBCCI administrator said: "Earlier the bank owners and executives had agreed in principle to lower the interest rates." "Today's (Tuesday) meeting also discussed the matter further. We will sit again on March 2 and finalise our proposal. After that it will be given to the central bank governor." The managing director of a bank who was present at Tuesday's meeting told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity: "A sub-committee has been formed with ABB chairman Kazi Mahmud Sattar as its head." "The committee will present a draft proposal on lowering the rates of interest on bank loans at Sunday's meeting. The proposal will be reviewed and finalised." Bangladesh Bank has long been urging retail banks to narrow the spread between the rates of interest on loans and deposits to less than 5 percent. Businessmen said high interest rates hurt investments in the private sector. bdnews
