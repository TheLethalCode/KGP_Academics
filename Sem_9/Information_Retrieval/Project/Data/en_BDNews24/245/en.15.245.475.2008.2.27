 HONG KONG, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong's wine industry toasted a government decision to abolish duties on wine and beer on Wednesday, saying the cosmopolitan city could now grow into a global wine and auction hub rivalling London and New York. Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang announced in his annual budget that the city would abolish duties for beer, wine and all alcoholic drinks except spirits. "Our total business volume in trading, storage and auction of table wine may increase by as much as HK$4 billion," said Tsang, who added Asia's total spending on table wine ex-Japan now stood at around HK$55 billion ($7 billion). Industry representatives said the slashing of Hong Kong's 40 percent duty on wine now gave it an edge over rivals such as Singapore and Tokyo, with wine prices likely to fall 15 to 20 percent. "It essentially sends out a very loud and clear message to the global market that Hong Kong is determined to develop into a major fine wine hub outside New York and London," said Boris de Vroomen, a co-chairman of the Hong Kong Wine & Spirits Industry Coalition. The expected flood into Hong Kong of high-end vintages lurking in cellars in Europe and Asia has sparked talk global auction giants Christie's and Sotheby's could hold vintage wine auctions in Hong Kong after a long lull. "For a bottle of Chateau Lafite 82' selling for HK$20,000, the duty could be HK$8,000, so you save quite a lot of money," said Tommy Cheung, a legislator with the catering industry. Auction house Bonhams said it would hold an inaugural wine auction in the former British colony in April which it hoped would put the city back on the "international wine auction map". Kevin Ching, Sotheby's Asia chairman, said he was undecided but "open-minded" about relaunching a wine auction in Hong Kong after a hiatus of 10 years. But possible headaches such as the transport and storage of rare, delicate vintages in Hong Kong's delicate vintages in Hong Kong's sub-tropical heat were factors that needed further consideration. London, the world's biggest fine wine hub, now sells around 40 percent of its top wines to buyers in greater China including Hong Kong, said de Vroomen, making the cosmopolitan and gourmet city a natural Asian base for wine trading. "Even though Singapore and Tokyo don't have a lot of duty, Hong Kong has an excellent geographic position and its proximity to mainland China will, over time, be more and more important as a fine wine market," said de Vroomen, who's also a director of Moet Hennessy Diageo in Hong Ko
