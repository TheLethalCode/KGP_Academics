<TEXT>
 KIEV, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said on Wednesday that all issues concerning payment for 2007 gas imports from Russia had been resolved, a day after Russian giant Gazprom had issued a new threat to cut supplies. In Moscow, Gazprom said payment had been received for last year's supplies, but described the state of supplies for 2008 as "acute" as no contract had yet been signed. Yushchenko said payment of arrears totalling 2.2 billion hryvnias ($435 million) had been made late on Tuesday and he had made clear Ukraine's position in a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "At the point when our conversation took place, the main problem with payments for 2007 has been eliminated," Yushchenko said in a statement appearing on the presidential Internet site. The president issued fresh criticism of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's government for operating in "emergency mode" -- a reference to delays in paying off arrears. Gazprom on Tuesday said it believed 1.9 billion cubic metres of gas had gone missing and were now considered Ukrainian debt. It said supplies would be reduced by 25 percent from March 3 unless arrears were paid off, its second such threat in a month. On Wednesday, it acknowledged payment. But Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said settling the arrears was "not an exploit. There is nothing to be proud of". "Meanwhile the problems with gas supplies in 2008 are becoming more acute," he said in a statement. "No contracts have been signed so far for deliveries of Russian and Central Asian gas, which means Ukraine is increasing consumption of non-contracted gas." EUROPE WARY OF DISRUPTION Gazprom has often threatened to cut gas supplies during disputes over price with former Soviet neighbours Ukraine and Belarus, but has never made good on the threats except in 2006. That disruption cut supplies to Gazprom's west European customers, making them wary of any hint of any new row. A quarter of Europe's gas needs pass through Ukraine. Ukraine's Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Prodan had earlier on Wednesday said a new payment of 2.4 billion hryvnias ($475 million) had been made for gas consumed last year. He said any more issues over payment for 2007 "must be considered a closed matter". First Deputy Prime Minister Oleksander Turchynov then told a cabinet meeting there could be no further discussion of arrears. A spokesman for Ukrgazenergo confirmed payments were being processed. The company is one of the intermediaries that secures gas from Gazprom through another go-between called RosUkrEnergo. Turchynov had earlier presented a detailed report on gas supplies to the president in place of the ailing Tymoshenko. The presidents of the two ex-Soviet states earlier this month had clinched an agreement to pay off arrears estimated then by Gazprom at $1.5 billion. Agreement was also reached to eliminate, over time, the use of intermediaries to supply gas to Ukraine and to distribute it to Ukrainian consumers. During the row with Ukraine earlier this month, Gazprom said that its gas exports to Europe would not be affect
