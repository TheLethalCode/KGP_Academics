<TITLE> Italy challenges French food over UN heritage move </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rome, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy challenged France's aim of being the first country to have its cuisine put on a UN World Heritage List, with Italian farmers saying on Sunday they produced more speciality foods than the French. Italian farmers said their pasta and cheese could easily see off a challenge posed by President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Paris farm show on Saturday to get French food an unprecedented place on the UNESCO list, which so far applies to places. "Italy can respond to their foie gras, armagnac, soupe a l'oignon and escargots (duck or goose liver, brandy, onion soup and snails) with dishes that conquered the world and are much appreciated by the French themselves, like pasta and pizza," said Italian farmers' association Coldiretti. "With 166 food specialities recognised by the European Union, Italy clearly beats France, in second place with 156," said Coldiretti, adding that Italy could also "beat the French on their own ground, with parmesan in the area of cheeses and many wines". The U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's list of world treasures, created in 1972, so far applies to sites or areas deemed as having "outstanding universal value" rather than to cultural crafts such as cooking. Its 851 current sites range from Egypt's pyramids to the Great Wall of China and include many of Italy's monuments and beauty spots, while France's many entries include wine-producing regions like Saint-Emilion and the Loire Valley.
