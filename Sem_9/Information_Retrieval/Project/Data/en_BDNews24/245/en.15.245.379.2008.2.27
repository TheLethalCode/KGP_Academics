<TITLE> Egypt must seal border with Gaza: Israel's US envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt must seal its border with Gaza to stop weapons and insurgents moving into the Palestinian territory, or Israel will have to act, Israel's ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday. Sallai Meridor said the militant group Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in June, has been importing money, explosives, anti-tank equipment, mines and longer-range rockets into Gaza. Also entering Gaza were insurgents who he said had been trained by Iran or the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah, which Iran backs. "The more reasonable way to deal with it would be if the Egyptians could bring about a situation where the border is sealed," Meridor told a group of defense journalists in Washington. "We hope it will get to the point where they (the Egyptians) create a new regime that would prevent terror from flowing into Gaza. If this doesn't happen, Israel will have to act," Meridor said. The ambassador refused to say what more Israel -- which has already launched frequent air strikes and ground raids into Gaza in an attempt to halt militant rocket fire -- could do. But, he said, "people are thinking about the options." On the same day Meridor spoke in Washington, officials in Israel said Egypt has quietly boosted its troop levels along the border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, beyond those set in a 30-year-old peace accord. They said the reinforcements started arriving after Hamas Islamists in Gaza blasted open the Egyptian border at Rafah in January in defiance of an Israeli-led blockade of the coastal territory. "The closing of the border is the Egyptian responsibility. It is not something we can help them with," Meridor said. "They are trying to an extent, we believe it is critical that they do more." He compared the growing threat to Israel in Gaza to the situation in southern Lebanon, where Israel fought a war in 2006. "Bottom line, we are facing another -- related to Iran -- terror base on our southern border," the ambassador said. It was "unrealistic" to think that the Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas could change things on the ground in Gaza, he said. "They have very limited capacity so far in the West Bank."
