 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)The editor of Bangla-language daily Sangbad, Bazlur Rahman, died of a heart attack at the age of 68 shortly before Tuesday midnight, his colleagues said. Rahman, husband of Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury, was taken to BIRDEM hospital from Dhaka Club, where he suffered a heart attack. The body will be taken home to Eastern Apartment at Moghbazar at 11:00am Wednesday from hospital and then to the office of Sangbad an hour later for colleagues to pay their last respects. At 1:00pm Wednesday, the body will be taken to the National Press Club for a namaz-e-janaza. The body will be kept at the Central Shaheed Minar for two hours from 2pm for public view, Rahman's colleagues said in a press briefing. Besides contributing to different areas of journalism, Rahman gained popularity by writing regular articles on the economy which one of his readers said were easy to understand. Later he got too involved with the management of the newspaper to continue as a regular economic writer. In a TV programme, Samokal deputy editor Mozammel Hossain Manzu, who had worked with Rahman for quite some time, said Rahman was a "man with a great sense of humour". "Bazlur Rahman had never deviated from his professionalism as a journalist," he said. Rahman had always tried to ensure a transparent editorial policy, Mozammel Hossain said. "We have lost a guardian," Manzurul Ahsan Bulbul, executive editor of Sangbad, told reporters at BIRDEM. bdn
