 BEIJING, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China issued draft regulations on Tuesday on the behaviour of security guards, a broad category of workers who rights groups say are commonly employed to put down unrest or enforce local government orders. The regulations, issued by China's State Council months before Beijing holds the Summer Olympics, concede that due to a lack of training and oversight of security personnel, "conflicts have been incited, even to the point of creating lawsuits or leading to criminal cases". Security guards "should not violate the public interest of society and the lawful rights and interests of the people", according to the draft, which was published on the central government's Web site (www.gov.cn). The draft has been released to solicit opinion before it is put into effect. Security guards in China are often used by local authorities to enforce eviction orders, protect the interests of property developers, or curb protests that spring up despite the ruling Communist Party's intolerance of social unrest. Ill-trained guards have also been a trigger for unrest, as in a case in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou last year when hundreds of students clashed with police after street inspectors beat up a female student as they cleared her unlicensed stall. "There is widespread evidence that these kinds of security teams are used to coerce and enforce and intimidate people illegally in a criminal fashion," said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. The regulations are also aimed at boosting the welfare of security guards who engage in law enforcement activities without the protection or training offered to police, and without the same recourse to compensation if they are killed or injured on the job. The draft says security guards, who fall under the supervision of China's powerful Ministry of Public Security, should raise their level of education and training, their "professional moral standards and the quality of their service". Guards are forbidden to restrict the freedom of others, search them unlawfully or use violence and threats to resolve disputes. Their ranks should also be restricted to those who do not have a criminal record and have not gone through compulsory drug rehabilitation or re-education through labour, a system under which citizens can be detained for petty crimes without trial. All guards should wear uniforms with standard badges to distinguish them from police or army personnel, the draft says. "It's probably not a coincidence that this happens just as Beijing municipality is making a massive recourse to security guards for the preparation of the Olympics," Bequelin said. "They will play a major role in all sorts of security-related issues." Ahead of the Games, which open on Aug. 8, Beijing authorities have already launched a campaign to check identities and addresses of migrant workers and have pledged to clear beggars and peddlers from the city's stree
