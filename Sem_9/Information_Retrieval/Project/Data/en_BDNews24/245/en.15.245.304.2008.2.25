<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan slipped up at Sampdoria on Sunday, a 1-1 draw allowing AS Roma to cut their lead in Serie A to nine points. Getafe blew open the Primera Liga title race in Spain by upsetting Real Madrid 1-0 at the Bernabeu after Barcelona had thumped bottom club Levante 5-1 earlier on Sunday. SPAIN Getafe showed great composure after Arjen Robben's effort for Real Madrid was ruled offside midway through the second half and, while Real's players were distracted, broke away to score the game's only goal through Ikechukwu Uche. The defeat ended Real's perfect home record in the league and gave Barcelona renewed hope in their pursuit of the leaders. Barca were too much for Levante at the Nou Camp with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o netting a hat-trick after Xavi and Lionel Messi had opened the way. Levante had levelled from the penalty spot. Real have 56 points, Barca 54 and third-placed Villarreal 46 after they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 away with goals from Guillermo Franco and Joan Capdevila. ENGLAND Tottenham Hotspur lifted the first major trophy of the season and their first since 1999 with a 2-1 win over holders Chelsea in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday, England defender Jonathan Woodgate heading the winner in extra time. Premier League action on Saturday was overshadowed by the broken leg suffered by Arsenal's Eduardo, who underwent surgery on Sunday and is expected to miss the Euro 2008 finals with Croatia in June. Two goals by Scotland forward James McFadden, the second deep into stoppage time, denied leaders Arsenal all the points in a 2-2 draw at Birmingham City. Teenager Theo Walcott scored both Arsenal goals. Manchester United took advantage to cut Arsenal's lead to three points with a 5-1 rout of Newcastle United at St James' Park with two goals each from Wayne Rooney and Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo. ITALY Hernan Crespo's diving header gave leaders Inter Milan a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria but AS Roma's 1-0 win over Fiorentina cut the gap at the top to nine points. Juventus in third suffered their third defeat of the season when they went down 2-1 at struggling Reggina. Nicola Amoruso's controversial late penalty against his former club had Juve up in arms, especially after they had three strong penalty appeals turned down. AC Milan's patchy home form looked set to continue before substitute Filippo Inzaghi headed in his first league goal of the season in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 win over Palermo. The victory sent the European champions into fourth above Fiorentina. GERMANY Bayern Munich extended their lead to four points but they will kick themselves for not making it six, after poor finishing cost them what should have been a comfortable win at home to Hamburg SV. Bayern, who had Mark van Bommel sent off in added time, fell behind to an Ivica Olic strike after an hour of Sunday's big game and needed a Ze Roberto goal six minutes later to snatch a point. That gave them 44 points from 21 games, four ahead of Werder Bremen after their surprise 1-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen were the weekend's big winners, climbing to third on 38 points thanks to a 1-0 victory at home to Schalke 04 on Saturday, when Manuel Friedrich's 35-metre strike proved decisive. Hamburg trail them on goal difference, while Schalke are fifth on 35. NETHERLANDS PSV Eindhoven came back from a goal down at home against Graafschap Doetinchem to win 4-1 with Danko Lazovic twice on target to stay nine points clear at the top. Dutch international Johnny Heitinga headed home an 82nd-minute winner to earn second-placed Ajax Amsterdam a 3-2 victory at NAC Breda, who had won their seven previous matches. Third-placed Feyenoord were held to a surprise 3-3 draw at Heracles Almelo, while Heerenveen slipped to sixth after giving away a two-goal lead against NEC Nijmegen, who scored three goals in the final half hour to win 3-2. FRANCE Fred scored a double to give Olympique Lyon a three-point lead in a 2-0 victory over bottom club Metz. The Brazilian striker, who had only started three league matches this season, netted in the ninth and 68th minutes. Six-times champions Lyon have 52 points from 26 matches while Girondins Bordeaux, who were held to a 0-0 home draw by Lille, have 49. Third-placed Nancy made amends for a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of St Etienne last weekend by beating RC Lens 2-
