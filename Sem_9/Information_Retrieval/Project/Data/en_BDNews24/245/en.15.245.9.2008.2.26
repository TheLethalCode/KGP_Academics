 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday sued former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 15 others for their alleged links to Barapukuria coalmine graft. The accused include M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Matiur Rahman Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, MK Anwar, Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Barrister Aminul Haque and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury. According to details in the case filed with Shahbagh Police Station, the accused had roles in Barapukuria coalmine graft that cost the state coffers Tk 158 crore. ACC assistant director Shamsul Alam filed the case. According to the case details, three companies took part in the bidding, but none of them qualified. Petrobangla decided to seek fresh international bids, but the government recommended a deal with CMC (Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation), ignoring a Petrobangla proposal for fresh bidding. A deal was signed with the Chinese company on June 4, 2005. Hosaf Group worked as a local agent for the coalmine project's Chinese developer CMC. Hosaf chairman Moazzem Hossain, who is believed to have close links to BNP high-ups, is one of the accused. Barapukuria Coal Mining Company owned by Petrobangla operates the coal mine constructed in Barapukuria in the district of Dinajpur. CMC established its foothold in Bangladesh through a 1994 deal with Petrobangla to develop Barapukuria coalmine. Later, CMC signed a management, production and maintenance services contract with Petrobangla in 2005 thanks to Hosaf's "strong leverage" over the BNP. The Executive Committee of National Economic Council approved the Barapukuria project in 1992. bdnew
