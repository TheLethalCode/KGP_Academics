 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday ordered an investigating officer to submit a report in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 15 others for having links to Barapukuria Coalmine graft. Third additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka Md Golam Rabbani accepted the first information report and ordered the investigating officer to report back to court on March 30. ACC assistant director Shamsul Alam filed the case with Shahbagh Police Station Tuesday against the 16 peoplemostly members of the cabinet committee on public purchase in the past coalition government. The accused include M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Matiur Rahman Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, MK Anwar, Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Barrister Aminul Haque and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury. According to details in the case, the accused had roles in the controversial Barapukuria coalmine project in Dinajpur, which cost the government more than Tk 158 crore. The deal with the project's Chinese developer CMC (Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation) is at the centre of the scam. The Khaleda administration signed the deal with CMC on June 4, 2005 for Tk 493.79 crore although it was the highest bidder among three. The deal breaches the public procurement rules, according to case details. CMC started its operations in Bangladesh through a 1994 deal with Petrobangla to develop the Dinajpur coalmine. Later, CMC signed a management, production and maintenance services contract with Petrobangla in 2005 thanks to local agent Hosaf Group chairman Moazzem Hossain's "strong leverage" over the BNP. bdnew
