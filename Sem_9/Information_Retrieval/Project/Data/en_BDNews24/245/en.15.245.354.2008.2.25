<TITLE> Japan PM support sinks below 30 pct in Tokyo poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's public support rating has fallen below 30 percent for the first time, a TV poll of Tokyo voters showed, reflecting new questions about his leadership as he battles gridlock in parliament. Fukuda's support has been falling since he took office in September and the latest slide is likely to make him even warier of calling an early election for parliament's lower house. Criticism of authorities' handling of a collision between a Japanese naval destroyer and a fishing boat last week as well as questions about Fukuda's commitment to reform appeared to be behind the slide in support below a level political analysts say is crucial to any hopes of winning an election. Fukuda, 71, is struggling to enact laws because opposition parties control parliament's upper house and can delay bills, as well as block key appointments such as for a successor to Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui, whose term expires on Mar. 19. "Seen from foreign countries, it looks as if Japan's parliament cannot decide anything ... and one wonders if they will trust Japan," Fukuda told reporters late on Sunday in Seoul, where he was to attend the inauguration of South Korea's new president. "It is necessary for everyone to think seriously about how to break through this (situation)." No election is required for the lower house until 2009 but the Democratic Party, the main opposition group, wants an earlier poll in hopes of ousting the coalition led by Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of the past half-century. Nearly two-thirds of those responding to Fuji TV's survey of 500 voters in the capital said they did not support Fukuda's cabinet, a rise of nearly six points from a survey the previous week. Only 27.8 percent said they backed the cabinet. Seventy-seven percent said Fukuda was not aggressive about reform, while 87 percent saw problems with the defence ministry's response to the collision between the destroyer Atago and the fishing boat, which left two men missing. Opposition parties have called for Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seen as one of Fukuda's most competent ministers, to resign over the collision. The deadlock in parliament, where opposition controls the upper house, has kept alive talk that Fukuda might try again to forge a grand coalition with the Democrats to end the stalemate -- a possibility the prime minister declined to rule out. "It's up to them. It depends on how the other side thinks," Fukuda said. Fukuda and Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa discussed a possible coalition in talks late last year but Democratic Party executives scuppered the proposal
