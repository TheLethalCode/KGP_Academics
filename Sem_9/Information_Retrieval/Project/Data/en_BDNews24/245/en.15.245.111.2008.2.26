<TITLE> Siemens to cut 6,800 jobs at SEN telecoms unit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT, Feb 26 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Siemens will cut 6,800 jobs at its corporate telecoms unit -- two-fifths of the unit's workforce -- to reshape the business into a software provider as it seeks to divest the division, it said on Tuesday. The German industrial conglomerate said in a statement it planned to cut 3,800 jobs worldwide, including 2,000 in Germany. It expects to reduce staff by another 3,000, including 1,200 in Germany, through outsourcing and partnerships. Siemens said rapid change in telecommunications made restructuring "absolutely essential and supports Siemens' ongoing efforts to find a suitable partner" for the loss-making unit, which it has been trying to sell for years. Sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters that Siemens is negotiating with competitors Alcatel-Lucent and Nortel as well as financial investor Cerberus about a possible sale or merger of SEN. Siemens said the job cuts are intended to accelerate the company's transformation from a hardware supplier to a software and solutions provider to fit changed market conditions. SEN, which specializes in communications systems for large corporations, has suffered from the rise of Internet telephony. SEN's results are reported under "discontinued operations" in the group's financial statements. Siemens valued the unit at 567 million euros ($840 million) at the end of its last financial year at end-September.
