 NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani film about Muslims in a post 9/11 world is slated to open in India next month, a rare event considering political rivalry has limited cultural interaction between the two nuclear-armed rivals. "Khuda Kay Liye" (In The Name of God) deals with the rift between radical and liberal Islam, an issue that confronts India's 140 million Muslims as well while they fight charges that the community provides recruits for militant groups.

The film also features Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah in a cameo as a Muslim scholar clarifying the tenets of Islam during a court case. Pakistan's film industry has been starved of a natural audience in India due to political differences and the dominance of Bollywood.

"After many years, 'Khuda Kay Liye' saw packed theatres in Pakistan," said filmmaker Mehreen Jabbar, whose film "Ramchand Pakistani" was screened at the Berlin Film Festival this month.
