<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 25 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina should be released to participate in the second round electoral dialogues, Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman demanded Monday. "The top national leaders are being deprived of the EC electoral dialogue experience." "I demand that Sheikh Hasina be released immediately so that she can take part in the talks," said the AL acting president at the outset of the second round of talks with the Election Commission. In his opening statement at the EC Secretariat, Zillur called upon the government to lift the emergency to usher in an enabling political environment. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda also said subsequently: "Holding national elections under emergency rule is not on." "Indoor politics should be allowed all over the country; it doesn't suffice to allow indoor politics within the capital alone," Huda said. Zillur also pressed authorities to declare a tentative time-table for holding the national elections, and said there was no need to redefine electoral constituencies. Zillur Rahman led the AL delegation of presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofael Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser, Kazi Zafarullah and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. On the proposed Public Representatives Ordinance, 2008, the AL suggested that the 1972 legislation should not be annulled, but it may be amended for ensuring chronological continuity. bdnews24.com/s
