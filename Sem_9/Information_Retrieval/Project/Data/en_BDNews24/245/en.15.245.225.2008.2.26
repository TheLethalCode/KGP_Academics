 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)- The Jamaat-e-Islami Tuesday urged the Election Commission not to ban religion-based political parties as such parties were present in democratic countries worldwide. Emerging after the second round of dialogue on electoral reforms with the EC at its office Tuesday afternoon, Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid told reporters: "We have asked the Election Commission to hold polls quickly." "The commission has informed us that the draft voter list will be published soon." "Besides, we have asked the Election Commission to hold a meaningful dialogue with the BNP," Mujahid said. On the issue of religion-based parties, he said: "There are religion-based political parties in all democratic countries. There are such parties in India, Europe, America and other countries." "So we urge the Election Commission not to stop the democratic process by banning religion- based politics." Asked for his reaction to demands by other political parties to disqualify 'war criminals' from elections, he did not reply but quickly left the EC Secretariat. A ten-member delegation of Jamaat led by Mujahid participated in the second round electoral reforms talks. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and other election officials were present. In his opening statement of Tuesday's talks, Mujahid said: "In past dialogues some political parties have made anti-people and anti-constitutional demands such as not registering Islamic political parties, hurting the people's faith and values." The Jamaat leader also said: "The cancelled January 22 election was constitutional. Some political parties, instead of participating in it, created terrorism throughout the country." Jamaat's proposals included immediate opening of indoor politics, using steel ballot boxes in the election, cancellation of 'no' votes and not holding local body elections before the parliamentery election. Jamaat leader barrister Abdur Razzak wanted to know during the dialogue why the two factions of BNP were not invited as bracketed factions. Huda replied: "Who are we to bracket two factions of BNP by inviting them separately? This is now under consideration of the court. We will follow court verdict." The CEC said that talks were going on to procure transparent ballot boxes from the Canadian government. If they were not available, steel ballot boxes were ready. The commission was considering transparent ballot boxes to avoid allegations of election rigging, he added. Earlier, an 11- member team of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal led by its president Hasanul Haq Inu and a nine-member delegation of National Awami Party (Mozaffar) led by its general seretary Advocate Enamul Haque held their second round dialogues with the EC. Hasanul Haq Inu demanded that parties backed by 'war criminals' be disqualified from contesting the elections, and the parties themselves be banned. "We urge the Election Commission to recommend this move to the government," Inu said. JSD placed a number of proposals to the EC, including: relaxing registration conditions for parties, allowing scope for minor loan defaulters to participate in elections and not delimitating constituencies. The party said it was happy with the proposed capping of campaign expenses at Tk 5 lakh per candidate,. Chief election commissioner, Shamsul Huda said Tuesday: "The Election Commission will publish the substance of the second round dialogues with the political parties in one volume." The commission will place a number of recommendations to the government after the dialogues are over, finalising them at a later date, Huda said. The EC began the second round of electoral reform dialogues on Feb 24. bdnews2
