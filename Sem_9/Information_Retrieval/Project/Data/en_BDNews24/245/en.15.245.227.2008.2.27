 BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it reserved the right to take action over the Czech Republic's signing of a bilateral pact with the United States on security arrangements for transatlantic flights.

The sensitive issue will be discussed by the 27-nation bloc's justice and home affairs ministers at a regular meeting on Thursday in Brussels. According to the deal, ahead of travelling to the United States, Czechs will have to fill in a form on the Web, including with personal information. A Czech interior ministry spokesman said the text referred to a deal already in place that allows US air marshals to be present on US planes and Czech marshals on Czech planes.
