<TITLE> Oil hovers near $99 with eyes on OPEC, cold weather </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil hovered near $99 a barrel on Tuesday, drawing support from cold weather in Europe and the United States as well as the OPEC president's view that the group will not raise output at its meeting next week. U.S. crude was down 16 cents at $99.06 a barrel by 1441 GMT, off highs of $99.45. London Brent crude was also down 8 cents at $97.61 as the market tracked prices of gas oil -- a heating fuel -- which fell after rising sharply in the previous session. Weather-sensitive London gas oil futures hit a record high on Monday, while U.S. natural gas briefly touched a two-year high and U.S. heating oil gained close to 1 percent and settled at a new high of $2.7853 a gallon. "We have had some cold weather influence since Friday, which seems to have caught people's imagination," said Tony Machacek of Bache Commodities. Below-normal temperatures are forecast for parts of the northeastern United States later this week, while cooler temperatures are expected over the next few days in northwest Europe, boosting demand for heating. "Stocks (equities) are holding up relatively well and the U.S. dollar is weakening again, which is normally seen as supportive for oil," Machacek said. The oil market is also trying to gauge what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries might do when it reviews oil output at its meeting in Vienna on March 5. "The recovery in (crude oil) stocks, the downward revisions to demand and an upcoming seasonal drop in world demand for the second quarter have not escaped OPEC's detection," Tim Evans, an analyst at Citi, said in a research note. OPEC President Chakib Khelil pointed to a slowdown in top energy consumer the United States as a reason why he believed the producer group would not increase output. "I can tell you they are not going to increase production because there are plenty of stocks," he told Reuters in Abuja, Nigeria. Some oil market analysts believe a seasonal drop in demand will lead OPEC to curb oil shipments unofficially. In the United States, crude oil supplies are forecast to have risen last week by 2.5 million barrels, the seventh increase in a row, as refineries undergoing maintenance have built up stocks. A preliminary Reuters poll of industry analysts predicted U.S. distillates stocks, including heating oil and diesel, were expected to maintain their seasonal decline due to cold temperatures and a dip in production and imports. The U.S. government data is due on Wednesday.
