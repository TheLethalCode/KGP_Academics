 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) - West Bengal's swimmer Monalisa Mondol and Bangladesh's swimmer Rubel Rana were named best sportswoman and sportsman in 2nd Indo-Bangladesh Bangladesh Games that concluded Tuesday. The Bangladesh Sports Writers Association and the Bangladesh Sports Journalist Community in association with hosts Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) awarded both swimmers at National Sports Council conference room Tuesday. Monalisa bagged nine gold medals including two golds from team events while Rubel won five golds including one medal from the team event. Bangladesh from the beginning dominated over West Bengal and put them behind to finish on top with 45 gold, 29 sliver and 18 bronze medals while West Bengal, who finished on top at the inaugural meet in Kolkata, managed 24 gold, 40 sliver and 27 bronze medals. BOA acting secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed thanked all athletes and officials of the both sides including the persons connected with the meet for the successful conclusion. Ahmed said the Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games was a dress rehearsal for Bangladesh athletes for the upcoming South Asian (SA) Games and hoped that the home side's success would also be reflected in the regional mega event in 2009. "What sign we got from the meet is that an intensive training can bring good outcome and we will continue the training for the athletes until the 11th SA Games in Bangladesh," said Ahmed. Ahmed said that it was possible to bag more golds than the expectation due to the BOA's supervision and the willingness of the respective federations. The BOA acting secretary general also said that they had already decided to take the Indo-Bangladesh Bangladesh Games outside Dhaka when they would host the fourth edition one year later. "The successes of Monalisa and Rubel will certainly inspire other athletes to do better in future," said Ahmed. Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu, BOA deputy secretary and chairman of the training committee, also reiterated that they would carry on the training from now on for the upcoming SA Games in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's divisional cricket team whitewashed the Cricket Association of Bengal team 3-0 as they handed a 21-run defeat to the visitors in the day's lone fixture at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. The West Bengal contingent leaves Dhaka for Kolkata Wednesday morning.
