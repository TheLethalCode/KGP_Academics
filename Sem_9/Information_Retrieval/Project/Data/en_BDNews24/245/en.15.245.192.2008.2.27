 TOKYO, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Wednesday she had useful talks with Chinese officials on how to end North Korea's nuclear ambitions, and left a senior aide in Beijing to continue the discussions. North Korea committed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programmes in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits under a 2005 multilateral deal. But the accord between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States has become bogged down by Pyongyang's failure to produce a declaration of its nuclear programmes by the end of last year. Speaking after she arrived in Tokyo, her last stop on a four-day tour of Northeast Asia largely focused on North Korea, Rice said she and Chinese President Hu Jintao had a good discussion of the matter on Tuesday. "The talks were useful and they were constructive and I would like to have continued them myself," Rice said. "Chris will continue those discussions and I think that's a useful thing to do at this point," she added, referring to Chris Hill, the top U.S. negotiator with North Korea. Hill scrapped plans to accompany Rice to Tokyo and will spend one extra day in Beijing. He leaves on Thursday morning and is expected to make scheduled visits to Bangkok, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The State Department said he had no plans to meet North Korean officials in Beijing or to visit Pyongyang. Rice was vague about how she hoped to revive the effort to denuclearise North Korea, which has shut down and begun to disable its atomic reactor at Yongbyon but balked at providing a declaration of all its nuclear programmes. Under the second phase of the denuclearisation agreement, North Korea was to disable key facilities in Yongbyon and produce the declaration in exchange for 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil and the termination of certain U.S. sanctions. Under the third, and final phase, the United States expects North Korea to dismantle the Yongbyon reactor, account for the fissile material it has accumulated and decide what to do with it. NOT DISTURBED "While I am not at all disturbed by delays in the second phase -- because it's hard -- I do think that the second phase is going to have to end in a way that inspires confidence that the third phase is going to make progress given the difficulties," Rice said. "That's the sort of thing that we are really talking through with the Chinese, how ... you do that." According to U.S. officials and analysts, the declaration's sticking point has been Pyongyang's reluctance to discuss any transfers of nuclear technology to other nations, notably Syria, or its suspected pursuit of uranium enrichment. North Korea has produced plutonium, which can be used to make atomic bombs, at Yongbyon. Uranium enrichment would give it a second pathway to fissile material for nuclear weapons. The United States has questions about any possible North Korean role in a suspected Syrian covert nuclear site bombed by Israel in September. Syria has denied having a nuclear programme but the case remains murky. "Whenever you have a nuclear program that is as advanced as the North Korean nuclear program in a country that is as opaque and has had very little contact with the outside world, you need to worry about proliferation as a near-term and a long-term concern," Rice said. "There are a lot of concern
