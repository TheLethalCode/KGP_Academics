<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Representatives of Japanese recruitment firms are expected to visit the country to explore means of importing manpower from Bangladesh, the foreign ministry said Monday. Japan International Training Cooperation Organisation (JITCO) has agreed to arrange the visits by recruiting agencies. JITCO president Toshio Takano gave the assurance to foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in Tokyo Monday, according to a statement by the foreign ministry. "JITCO will organise visits by Japanese recruiting firms to Bangladesh and work with the ministry of expatriates' welfare and overseas employment," the foreign ministry said. "In the past, only 12 trainees from Bangladesh have come to Japan. This is not satisfactory," the ministry quoted the adviser as saying. "Bangladesh now has a huge potential to satisfy demand for workers in Japan," Iftekhar told the JITCO president, according. "JITCO can provide language training in centres already set up in Bangladesh," he added. The foreign adviser left for Tokyo Sunday on a four-day visit at the invitation of Japanese foreign minister Masahiko Koumura. Iftekhar is scheduled to return home Feb 28. bdn
