<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniel Day-Lewis won the second Oscar of his career on Sunday for his role as a homicidal oilman in the drama "There Will Be Blood," as foreigners completed a rare sweep of all four acting awards. London-born Day-Lewis, 50, was considered the favorite for the award after winning honors at various pre-Oscar events. He previously took the Oscar for the 1989 movie "My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown." As he took the stage to accept his latest award, he kissed George Clooney, who was nominated for "Michael Clayton." "Deepest thanks to members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town," said Day-Lewis, gazing at the golden statuette and recalling his screen character Daniel Plainview. The film, which received eight nominations, won just one other category, for cinematography. Tall, dark and thoughtful, Day-Lewis is known for his intense preparation for his roles. He took four years working on his character with "There Will Be Blood" director Paul Thomas Anderson and has said he could spend 10 years making a movie if a part really interested him. "I hope that all those to whom I owe and feel the deepest gratitude will forgive me if I say just simply, thank you all," Day-Lewis said on Sunday. He said he was accepting the Oscar in memory of his grandfather Michael Balcon, his father British poet Cecil Day-Lewis and his "three fine boys." Day-Lewis has three sons, one with French actress Isabelle Adjani and two boys with Rebecca Miller, the daughter of the late US playwright Arthur Miller. France's Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her lead role in "La Vie en Rose," while the supporting honors went to Spain's Javier Bardem for "No Country for Old Men" and Britain's Tilda Swinton for "Michael Clayton". The last such foreign sweep occurred in 1964
