<TEXT>
 Dubai, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iraqi militant group posted a video on the Internet on Monday showing the killings of 12 Nepalese men who it said worked for a Nepalese company with a US contract. A militant beheaded one of the men with a knife. The rest were shot in the back while laying face down in a sandy lot, the video, posted by an Islamist group called the Army of Ansar al-Sunna, showed. In 2004, an Iraqi militant group killed 12 Nepali hostages who had gone to Iraq to work as cooks and cleaners for a Jordanian firm. It showed pictures of one being beheaded and the others with bullet wounds to the head and back. At the time, some 200,000 Nepalis worked as labourers, drivers, guards, cleaners and cooks in Iraq, even though poor Nepal did not allow its nationals to travel or work in there because of security concerns. The killing of foreign contractors by militants in Iraq has declined, matching overall falls in violence
