<TITLE> Curbing banking over-enthusiasm </TITLE>

 Fazal M. Kamal Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) -- It certainly is an overused---in fact, to the extent of being ragged---maxim which states it is better late than never. In the most recent instance of the country's central bank taking some meaningful (hopefully!) steps relating to the commercial banks, this axiomatic truth is most apt even if a tad perplexing. Till the time the Bangladesh Bank apparently shook itself up many bank customers were wondering if there was anything, anyone, any institution that was supposed to supervise the charges and rates for services (and they can be called that only by being overly generous) which the banks were clawing out at will. Fortunately for bank users, after a series of hot-under-the-collar meetings with the Bangladesh Bank chief bank owners and their officers have, finally and seemingly, agreed to review their gouging and are expected to send their proposals to the central bank by the end of this month. After the necessary scrutiny by the Bangladesh Bank, the rates and charges are projected to diminish by some lucky date in March. Till that actually happens, obviously, we will have to continue to be subjected to the Shylocky enthusiasm of the banks. As anyone who uses what are passed off as services of most banks knows all too well that often, in point of fact, more often than not what are cranked up in advertisements aren't exactly what you would be getting at the bank itself. And the charges for those "services"well, let's put it this way: they're out of this world, if not downright extortionist. These compounded with a lack of customer-handling training---or whatever; maybe it's merely an attitudinal problem---of the purported officers of the banks are more than enough to make you ponder achingly if there wasn't another way out of your quandary. Judged against that painful and bleak backdrop the latest scurrying about of bankers and their oversight honchos is definitely a welcome decision even if you've to wonder what took the Bangladesh Bank so long to come to its senses and believe, ultimately, that it really had to do something about the runaway avidity rampant in the banking world of Bangladesh. But, oh brother, this move hasn't come one moment too soon! (Of course, we can't be very sure how it'll all work out in the end till we see the results take concrete shape.) In this context a query implying if "the central bank is putting pressure on reducing the interest rates drifting away from the free-market economy policy" by one of our peers, without any doubt, adds humor to the whole excruciating---to watch, that is---exercise. It's probable that the question emanated from an absence of comprehension about such matters as free market; the role of regulators; the investments the banks are supposed to make in training, in industrial and economic progress; responsibility to society (and not only to the pockets of shareholders and employees and neither does that include the exhibitionism that goes by the name of corporate social responsibility); et al. It may not also be irrelevant to have some oversight of where bank branches and ATMs are located. Only recently, as has also been reported widely, one bank's lockers were looted---and that wasn't a ginormous surprise given that the branch (and in some cases ATMs) was positioned in a location where substance abusers abound. One look at the location should have been more than sufficient to suggest it wasn't a hot idea. Any action or decision which has the potential of endangering the customers or their money and possessions ought to come under the purview of some kind of authority with the mandate to discourage manifestly outrageous and irrational decisions. While praise should be proffered to the central bank and its chief for making the right moves even if they've come after an agonizingly long time, in a free market milieu one has to suppose that nothing can be done about the nonchalant attitude, teetering on the offensive, of some bank employees---especially of two foreign banking institutions which have proven to be honest successors to the long gone but certainly not lamented "company" that came from the Sceptred Isle and which for some quaint reason take pride in charging absolutely bizarre fees---other than asking yourself whether it's worth sprinkling salt on your wounds. At the end the most that we, the customers, can do is derive some degree of solace from the words of Bangladesh Bank Governor Salehuddin Ahmed who declared, "We won't sit idle if we get complaints about the services and efficiency of the banks," in spite of the reality that they've taken an awfully long time, far too long a time to come. After all, a free market is expected to continually improve services and provide better products to the customers at an efficient rate in a competitive spirit. It's not primarily meant to enrich a handful at the expense of the rest, though unfortunately that's what's been happening in more countries than you'd like to count.
