<TITLE> Shah pushes England test claims with 96 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Owais Shah enhanced his claims for a place in the England team for next month's test series against New Zealand with 96 in the tour match against Otago on Monday. Shah fell agonisingly short of a century but still provided the selectors with a reminder of his ability when England piled on 396 for nine on the opening day at Dunedin's University Oval. Opener Alastair Cook continued his impressive form with 85 and Ian Bell made an unbeaten 75 after initially retiring on 59. While most of the batting positions are virtually decided, Shah and former captain Andrew Strauss are both vying for a spot in the side. Strauss missed his chance to make a big score on Monday when he was out hit wicket to Mark Gillespie, striking his stumps while trying to deflect the ball away. While Strauss was ruing his misfortune, Shah survived a confident appeal for caught behind on 29 then was dropped on 38. "It's obviously good to impress the selectors and put some runs on the board," Shah told the New Zealand Press Association. "It's still early days but hopefully I've put some pressure on." England are likely to declare overnight and give their bowlers a chance to impress in the two-day match. England will play Otago in another three-day match starting on Thursday to finish off their preparations for the first test starting March
