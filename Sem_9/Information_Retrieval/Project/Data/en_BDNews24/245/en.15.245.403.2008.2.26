<TITLE> Nigerian tribunal to rule on presidential election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abuja, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian tribunal will uphold or annul the 2007 election of President Umaru Yar'Adua in a ruling on Tuesday that could either legitimise a deeply flawed poll or push Africa's most populous nation into political limbo. Yar'Adua and his People's Democratic Party won a crushing victory in last April's general elections but local and international observers accused the ruling party of massive fraud. EU monitors judged the polls "not credible". Yar'Adua's two nearest rivals, former army ruler Muhammadu Buhari and then Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, challenged the result before a special tribunal of five judges which is due to start delivering its ruling at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT). The elections were widely denounced in Nigeria as a hollow parody of democracy, but unlike in Kenya where the disputed Dec. 27 poll led to violence on the streets, Nigeria's aggrieved candidates have taken their protests to the courts. Lower tribunals, at state level, have already annulled the elections of seven out of 36 state governors, the Senate president and dozens of federal and state legislators. A few months ago, most Nigerians would have considered it unthinkable for a court to overturn a presidential election, but the multiple annulments have changed that perception. Whatever the decision on Tuesday, however, the losing party is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the judgment went against Yar'Adua and he appealed, he would remain president until the Supreme Court delivers its verdict. However, he would be weakened and government business would likely grind to a halt until the final ruling. The tribunal faces a dilemma. It can legitimise an election that was labelled "a charade" by the main Nigerian observer group, or risk destabilising a major oil exporter that emerged just nine years ago from decades of coups and army rule. "The right thing here is that if the elections were rigged and did not meet the standard of democracy, they should be annulled, pure and simple," wrote prominent political columnist Sam Nda-Isaiah in Leadership newspaper. But many in the political class fear annulment would lead to a long period of political gridlock followed by an equally flawed re-run under the same electoral body.
