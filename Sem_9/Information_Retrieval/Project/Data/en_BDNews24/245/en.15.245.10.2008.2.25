 Seoul, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Myung-bak spent much of his inauguration speech on Monday discussing economic concerns, reflecting his campaign pledge to lift the world's 13th-largest economy. Following are excerpts of the official English translation of Lee's prepared inauguration speech. ECONOMY AND BUSINESS "Developing countries are fast catching up. Our nation's competitiveness has fallen, and instability in the resource and financial markets threatens our economy." "Although it is going to be difficult and painful, we must change much more and much faster. If some things are unreasonable or found outmoded, they must be discarded, without hesitation." "Economic revival is our most urgent task." "The jobs that are not meant for the government shall be privatised. We shall also enhance competition in the public sector. We must lower taxes as well." "The number of public servants will be incrementally reduced and unnecessary regulations will be either cast away or reformed as early as possible." "Corporations are the source of national wealth and the prime creator of jobs." "We must end the era of strife and open an era of companionship. Management as well as labour must make a compromise and take a step towards each other." FOREIGN INVESTMENT "Opening of the market to the foreign sector is an unavoidable mega-trend. Such an economy as ours, which depends so much on exports, should increase our national wealth through free trade regimes." EDUCATION AND WELFARE "Welfare that is nothing but a free hand-out is not the solution. Nor is welfare that compensates post factum an answer." "Our education system must be reformed." "We must accept global standards and instill a spirit of self-discipline and a fresh breath of creativity into the classrooms. Schools must be diversified and teachers must be armed with real skills and competitiveness." FOREIGN RELATIONS "We will work to develop and further strengthen traditional friendly relations with the United States into a future-oriented partnership. Based on the deep mutual trust that exists between the two peoples, we will also strengthen our strategic alliance with the United States." "We will attach importance to our policy towards Asia. In particular, we will seek peace and mutual prosperity with our close neighbours, including Japan, China and Russia, and promote further exchange and cooperation with them." "Korea will actively participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations as well as enlarge its official development assistance (ODA)." NORTH KOREA "Inter-Korean relations must become more productive than they are now. Our attitude will be pragmatic, not ideological." "As already stipulated in my "Denuclearization and Opening up North Korea to Achieve US$3,000 in Per Capita Income", once North Korea abandons its nuclear programme and chooses the path to openness, we can expect to see a new horizon in inter-Korean cooperation. Along with the international community, we will provide assistance so that we can raise the per capita income of North Korea to US$3,000 within 10 years." "Together, the leaders of the two Koreas must contemplate what they can do to make the lives of all 70 million Koreans happy and how each side can respect each other and open the door to unification. If it is to discuss these issues, then I believe the two leaders should meet whenever necessary and talk openly, with an open mind." "Politics, unfortunately, is not satisfying the people's expectations. Without changing politics, we will not be able to become an advanced nation. Politicians must discuss the future direction of our nation, where it must proceed and then present serious policy options. Politics must ease the pain of the people and instill in them hope for the future." "I will open wide the door to dialogue not only to the ruling party but also to the opposition party.
