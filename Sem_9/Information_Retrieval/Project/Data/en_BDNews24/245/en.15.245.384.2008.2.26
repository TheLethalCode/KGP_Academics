 SYDNEY, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India thrashed Sri Lanka by seven wickets at Hobart on Tuesday to book their place in the tri-series finals against Australia. India wrapped up a comprehensive victory with more than 17 overs to spare when they bowled Sri Lanka out for 179 before reaching their target for the loss of just three wickets. Praveen Kumar and Ishant Sharma captured four wickets apiece with the ball while Gautam Gambhir (63 not out) and Sachin Tendulkar (63) scored the bulk of the runs. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his team were starting to peak at the right time with the finals starting on Sunday. "Still we are not at our best. We can be a better side overall when it comes to batting, bowling and fielding," Dhoni told a news conference. "You can expect a bit more from the side but it depends on lots of other things." Sri Lanka needed to win their last two matches to leapfrog India in the standings and make the best-of-three finals but came unstuck at the first leg. They now have nothing to play for in their last match against Australia in Melbourne on Friday. "We don't deserve to be in the finals because we haven't been consistent in this tournament, simple as that," Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said. "I think our bowling has been pretty decent, the concern has been our batting. "You need to put runs on the board and chase totals down. "We haven't done that the whole series so that's something we really have to get right." Kumar took 4-31 and Ashant 4-41 as the Indian bowlers polished off the Sri Lankan innings in 47.1 overs, despite a spirited performance from lower-order batsmen Chamara Kapugedera. Sri Lanka were in danger of settling for a much smaller total when they slumped to 93-7 in the 26th over before Kapugedara rescued the innings with 57. After making a strong start at the Bellerive Oval when opener Sanath Jayasriya and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara took the score along to 72-1 by the 15th over, the wickets suddenly started to tumble. Sangakkara went for 33 then Jayasuriya followed for 34 as Kumar and Sharma ripped through the middle-order, picking up six wickets for 21 runs in 11 overs. Kapugedara, who was recalled to the side for Farveez Maharoof, gave the Sri Lankans a glimmer of hope when he struck four boundaries in his 86-ball knock before he was the last man out, but the total was never going to be enough. India lost Robin Uthappa (11) cheaply but Tendulkar and Gambhir steered them towards victory with a second-wicket partnership of 1
