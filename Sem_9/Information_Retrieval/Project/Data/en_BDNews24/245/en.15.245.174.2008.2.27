 CARACAS, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Venezuelan helicopters flew into Colombia on Wednesday to pick up four lawmakers held hostage for years in jungle camps by Marxist rebels, in a diplomatic victory for Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez. The white helicopters painted with the symbol of the Red Cross left a military base close to the border and flew into neighboring Colombia, where the rebels are holding the three men and one woman. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, last month released two politicians in a deal brokered by the leftist Chavez, who has spent months in talks with the leaders of Latin America's oldest guerrilla insurgency.

The rebels, who say they are fighting for social justice, want to swap their hostages for fellow fighters imprisoned by the Colombian government. The recent releases have been unilateral and are described by the fighters as a gesture of goodwill to Chavez, who hopes to broker a wider peace deal, although analysts say that is unlike
