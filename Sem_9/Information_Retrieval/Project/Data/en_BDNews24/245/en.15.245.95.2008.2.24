 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka magistrate Sunday allowed investigators to put two suspected militants on remand for three days for questioning about the Aug 21 grenade attack an Awami League rally. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ehsanul Haque for Dhaka made the order for quizzing Hossain Ahmed Tamim, 19, and Abul Kalam Azad Bulbul, 36. The suspects are allegedly tied to militant group Harkatul Jihad. The investigators said the group perpetrated the grenade attack in 2004 on an Awami League rally in front of the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. Some two dozen party members were killed and hundreds of others wounded while party chief Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the grisly attack. In recent weeks, investigators refocused on the case and arrested some suspects mostly tied to Harkatul Jihad. Tamim and Bulbul would face their senior party colleague mufti Mainuddin, popularly known as Abu Jandal, during the interrogation. Jandal is known to be a close aide to Harkatul Jihad chief mufti Abdul Hannan, now behind bars. Jandal allegedly gave important disclosure about the involvement of Tamim and Bulbul in the attack after he was taken on a seven-day remand on Feb 19, according to the remand petition. Earlier, both Tamim and Bulbul were separately remanded for details on the attack. Depending on their information, security agents later arrested Jandal. Tamim is a resident of Shyamnagar, Jessore, while Azad is from Shailkufa, Jhenaidah. bdnew
