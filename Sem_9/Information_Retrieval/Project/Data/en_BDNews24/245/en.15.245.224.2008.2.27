 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five people went on trial on Wednesday charged with helping an al Qaeda-inspired gang to carry out attempted suicide attacks in London in July 2005. Shadi Abdelgadir, Omar Almagboul, Esyas Girma, Yeshiemebet Girma and Muluemebet Girma appeared at London's Old Bailey central criminal court charged with assisting an offender and possessing information about acts of terrorism. Four men -- Muktah Said Ibrahim, Yassin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Hussein Osman -- tried to detonate hydrogen peroxide-based bombs in London on July 21, 2005, but their homemade devices failed to explode and no one was killed. The attempted attacks came two weeks after four British Islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people on three underground trains and a bus in London. Prosecuting lawyer Max Hill told the jury: "The crown's case is that the five defendants ... lent active assistance to one of the bombers, Hussein Osman ... and they failed to report what they individually knew to police as required by law." Hill said Yeshiemebet Girma, who is Osman's wife, also had prior knowledge of the bombers' intentions. "Armed with that prior knowledge of what was going to happen, the defendant Yeshi Girma could have attempted to prevent the attacks," he said. Hill said that if the bombs had exploded properly "there would have been carnage and mass murder". The 21/7 bombers were jailed for a minimum of 40 years each. Ghanaian Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, who was supposed to be carrying a fifth bomb on the day but ended up dumping it in a park, was jailed for 33 years after admitting a charge of conspiracy to cause explosions. Ethiopian-born Adel Yahya pleaded guilty to a lesser offence of collecting information useful for militants and was jailed for seven years. Omar fled to Birmingham after the bombings wearing his mother-in-law's burqa and carrying a handbag. Osman fled Britain by train using someone else's passport and was finally arrested in Ita
