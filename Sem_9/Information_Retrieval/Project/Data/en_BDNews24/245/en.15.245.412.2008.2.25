 BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Palestinians formed a human chain in the Gaza Strip on Monday in a peaceful protest against an Israeli blockade that has deepened hardship in the Hamas-controlled territory. Israel had put troops on alert along the frontier and threatened to open fire if protesters tried to surge across the border. But the event, organised by Hamas Islamists and allied activists, ended without incident some two hours after it began. Organisers had forecast some 40,000 to 50,000 participants. They attributed the low turnout of about 4,500 to bad weather and said larger events would be held to force Israel to end what they called its imprisonment of Gaza's 1.5 million residents. Gaza's isolation intensified when Hamas took control of the area in June after street fighting in which it routed Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has embarked on peace talks with Israel. Last month, Israel tightened the blockade on the territory, limiting supplies of fuel and other goods in what it described as a response to cross-border rocket fire by militants. As the Gaza protest was ending, a cross-border rocket attack wounded a child in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, medical officials said. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, said the human chain was a message to Israel "and many other parties that Gaza has become a ticking bomb that could explode at any time if the siege is not lifted". Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said Israel wanted to avoid any humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which Israeli troops and settlers quit in 2005, and was working with the United Nations and other organisations to prevent one. ROCKET FIRE Egypt has also blocked its border with Gaza but Hamas blew open the frontier wall last month, allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to cross into Egypt and stock up with food and other goods in short supply. Jamal al-Khudary, chairman of the Popular Anti-Siege Committee, a co-organiser of the Monday's protest, said participants had been under instructions to stay at least 1 km (1/2 mile) from the Israeli border. Militants say they carry out rocket attacks in response to Israeli raids and would stop if Israel lifted the Gaza blockade. Hamas is shunned by Israel and the West for refusing to give up its stated goal of seeing the Jewish state eliminated. It has, however, offered a sceptical Israel a conditional, long-term ceasefire. "Peace and dialogue are not an option for them (Hamas)," Mekel said, calling for the group's continued international isolati
