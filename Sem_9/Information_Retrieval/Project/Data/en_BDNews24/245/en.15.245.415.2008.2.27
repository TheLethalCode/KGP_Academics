 BAGHDAD, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey will not set a timetable for the withdrawal of troops fighting Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq, a Turkish envoy said on Wednesday after crisis talks in Baghdad, despite US pressure for a quick resolution. Turkey's military General Staff said another 77 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels had been killed in heavy fighting since Tuesday night, taking the death toll among the rebels to 230 since the operation began a week ago. "Our objective is clear, our mission is clear and there is no timetable until ... those terrorist bases are eliminated," senior Turkish envoy Ahmet Davutoglu said after talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari. Thousands of Turkish troops crossed the border last Thursday to root out PKK fighters who have used mountainous northern Iraq as a base for their fight for self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast of Turkey since the 1990s. Acting Iraqi Prime Minister Barham Saleh warned that a prolonged offensive would lead to "dire" consequences for the region and repeated Baghdad's demand that the incursion end. "The consequences are dire. This is a very dangerous, precarious situation," Saleh, a Kurd, told Reuters. He said the operation had "not been conducive to Iraq-Turkey relations". The Turkish General Staff said five more Turkish soldiers had been killed since late Tuesday, taking their losses to 24. Davutoglu, chief foreign policy adviser to Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, was meeting Iraqi President Jalal Talabani as well as Zebari, both Kurds, during a one-day visit. Iraq on Tuesday condemned the incursion as a violation of its sovereignty and, in its strongest comments so far, called for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops. Ankara says it is engaged in a legitimate fight against what it and Washington describe as a terrorist organisation. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who is due to meet Turkish officials in Ankara on Thursday, said Turkey must limit its operations to days rather than months. "It's very important that the Turks make this operation as short as possible and then leave, and to be mindful of Iraqi sovereignty," Gates told reporters in New Delhi before leaving for a previously scheduled trip to Ankara. "I measure quick in terms of days, a week or two, something like that. Not months," he said. The Turkish general staff released photographs on Wednesday of its troops in northern Iraq, sitting and traipsing through snow as well as reconnoitring the terrain. Warplanes, attack helicopters and artillery are supporting ground troops. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began its armed struggle for self-rule in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in 19
