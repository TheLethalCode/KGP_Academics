<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government has decided to offload parts of its shares in different companies on to the capital market by June, an adviser said Tuesday. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the government would sell a 25 percent stake in each of the four companiesOsmania Glass Sheet Factory, Atlas Bangladesh, National Tubes and Eastern Cables, where the government has at least a 51 percent stake. Also, the government will sell 49 percent out of its 100 percent shares in different companies. The announcement came as a follow-up on the government plan to boost share supply to the capital market, where demand outstripped supply. The stock markets now run short of funds in the wake of restrictions on margin loans from merchant banks. But stocks closed higher Tuesday after investors bought heavily into banks, mutual funds and oil companies. The caretaker administration is trying to convince multinational companies such as Unilever to sell parts of their shares, the adviser said after a meeting at the finance ministry. Headed by Mahbub Jamil, the chief adviser's special assistant on industries, a committee will oversee the issue. Azizul said Unilever had proposed to buy government shares in it, but the government did not agree. Instead, the government is negotiating with the company to offload an equal 5 percent stake each from the government holdings and the foreign investor's holdings. The adviser added that the government does not hold a lot of shares in multinational companies. Azizul said the government expects the multinational companies to hold board meetings and decide on the issue shortly. The adviser said the government-owned shares would be released to the capital market by June 30. The announcement came as market players blamed the Securities and Exchange Commission for creating a liquidity crisis in the market by slapping restrictions on margin loans and taking away a huge amount of money out of the market by Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum, recently listed on the stock market. Mahbub Jamil, secretaries from different ministries and representatives from both state-run and multinational companies were present at the meeting. bdnews
