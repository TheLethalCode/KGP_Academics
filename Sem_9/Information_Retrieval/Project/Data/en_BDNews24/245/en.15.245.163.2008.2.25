<TEXT>
 Brussels, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eight elder statesmen reached a deal on Monday that could end eight months of political deadlock in Belgium and lead to the formation of a new government within a month. The deal on giving more power to the regions marked an important step in ending squabbling after a parliamentary election in June. The dispute had prompted speculation that the linguistically-divided country might break apart. The "wise men" council, including interim Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and his predecessor Jean-Luc Dehaene, had tried to bridge a gulf between Flemish parties that demanded more power for the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and French-speaking parties that had resisted any change. Under the deal, the interim five-party government would try to transfer a series of minor powers to the regions and pursue measures to strengthen cooperation between the regions, paving the way for more powers to be transferred under a new administration. "It's an important agreement. We are back to making deals," Finance Minister Didier Reynders said after talks ended in the early hours of Monday, adding he was also confident key cabinet members would settle a 2008 budget in the coming hours. Belgian leaders are expected to agree on a balanced budget for this year, possibly with money from Electrabel, the Belgian arm of French utility Suez , in return for extending the life of the country's nuclear power stations. "It will be difficult, but there is a will to succeed," said French-speaking socialist Health Minister Laurette Onkelinx on arriving for budget talks. Both devolution and budget issues need to be settled by March 20 when Verhofstadt, reappointed premier in December, plans to step down and make way for a permanent administration led by Christian Democrat and former Flemish premier Yves Leterme. The successor government would then seek to enact a second, more significant, package before parliament's summer recess at the end of July. This would include partial control of labour market, health and family policy. Critics argued the "wise men" had merely postponed negotiations on the most controversial issues.
