<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission Monday reinstated 114 out of 263 employees of the defunct Bureau of Anti-Corruption (BAC), officials said. Of those reinstated, nine are deputy directors, 19 assistant directors, 25 inspectors and 22 assistant inspectors. Those who were left behind resented the ACC decision. One of the employees, Syed Liaquat Hossain, told bdnews24.com: "The commission has taken the decision with no legal basis. As a result, many competent employees have been deprived of services." "Many of those who have been reinstated have definite charges of corruption," he alleged. "How is it possible for ACC to conduct the campaign against corruption with their help?" Repudiating the charge of irregularities, ACC director general (administration), Col Hanif Iqbal told bdnews24.com: "Those who are not reinstated have been interviewed, besides their records being examined. There was no irregularity here." "Besides, it is natural that if one group gets an opportunity, another group will be unhappy." Another commission official said that the employees of the defunct bureau had been without work since October 2005. After the commission was formed on November 21, 2004, 1,006 people of the former bureau were declared "excess manpower". Of them, in September 2005, 743 were retained in the commission and the remaining 263 had been left out in an order. The aggrieved persons filed writ petitions with the High Court in October the same year. The High Court, in the majority of the 16 writ petitions, stayed the withdrawal order and the reinstatement programme. Later, following a move by the government, the High Court orders were put off by the Appellate Division. bdnew
