 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rallied on Monday, as talk of stake-building in the banking sector buoyed financials, while the possibility of a rescue package for Ambac Financial eased worries about bond insurers. At 1203 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.5 percent at 1,339.64 points, with banks contributing more than a third of the index's gains. Royal Bank of Scotland jumped more than 7 percent on hopes that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund could take a stake in the bank and on expectations RBS will lift its dividend and post strong results this week. Also underpinning the wider sector, Britain's Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley each surged 8 percent on hopes of consolidation in the UK banking sector. Lloyds TSB CEO Eric Daniels said on Friday uncertain markets could increase acquisition opportunities, sparking talk of interest in A&L and in Bradford & Bingley. "I think there's no reason for the market to be discounting what it's been discounting, i.e. a disaster-type economic scenario, so I feel the results will hopefully convince the market that it's been too negative on the outlook," said Michael Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities. The Sunday Telegraph reported at the weekend that the Qatar Investment Authority may buy a stake in RBS, citing people familiar with QIA's plans. Qatar, the wealthiest state per capita in the Gulf, has bought about two percent in Swiss bank Credit Suisse and is looking to spend between $10 billion and $15 billion in stake-building over the next two years, the country's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani told Reuters. Elsewhere in the sector, Credit Agricole was up by 6.7 percent, Dutch financial group ING Groep gained 4 percent and HBOS was also up around 4 percent. Investors also found comfort on the possibility that monoline bond insurer Ambac Financial Group will be the subject of a rescue plan. A person familiar with the deal said an announcement could be made Monday or Tuesday. If a bailout announcement happens, it could provide some relief to investors who are concerned about such bond insurers losing their high-tier credit ratings, prompting subsequent downgrades on the fixed-income assets they cover. STRONG FEBRUARY The FTSEurofirst 300 has gained 0.7 percent in February, while it tumbled nearly 12 percent last month, largely on the back of two US interest rate cuts late in January and broadly strong corporate growth in top European companies. Swiss drugs company Roche jumped 3.9 percent after the unexpected US approval of its key Avastin drug for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, a positive surprise after an earlier negative drug opinion. Oil and gas producers were the second-biggest gainers on the FTSEurofirst 300 index, with BP, British Gas and Total added 1.5 to 2.1 percent. Generally lofty oil prices have benefited energy stocks in recent weeks but have also fuelled fears about inflation -- generally perceived as negative for stocks. Meanwhile, Association of British Foods, which owns discount store Primark and Silver Spoon sugar, was among the top losers on the FTSEurofirst 300, dropping almost 3 percent despite the company announcing a strong trading upda
