 KARLSRUHE, Germany, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's domestic security services can monitor the computers of suspected criminals and terrorists but only if they have evidence showing they are dangerous, the country's top court ruled on Wednesday. The decision by the Constitutional Court opens the door to a new federal law, long advocated by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), to allow online surveillance under strict conditions. Cyberspying is a sensitive issue in Germany where experiences of the Nazi Gestapo and East Germany's Stasi secret police have made many mistrust state intrusion. The ruling, which concerned a law in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is a compromise between those who say secret online searches are a vital tool to combat terrorism and critics who argue they infringe civil liberties. "The basic right that guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of Information Technology systems is not without limits," said court president Hans-Juergen Papier. He said clandestine online surveillance was only allowed if there was a concrete threat to human life or to the state. Searches would be subject to an order from a judge and intimate data should be protected or quickly deleted, he said. Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a member of Merkel's CDU, said the ruling enabled the government to introduce federal laws to better equip security services to fight terrorists. "I expect the ruling, which is deemed necessary by experts and police workers, can be converted into a federal law as quickly as possible," said Schaeuble. TIGHT LIMITS Leading Social Democrats, who share power with the CDU in an uneasy coalition and have opposed online searches in the past, welcomed the tight limits the court set and said they expected ministers to start drawing up a national law soon. "The balance between freedom and security remains protected. The exaggerated ideas of security and political hardliners were rebuffed," SPD Chairman Kurt Beck said in a statement. Several European countries have struggled since 2001 to beef up police and intelligence agency powers to help prevent terrorist attacks and at the same time to protect civil rights. German security has been in the spotlight since authorities arrested three men last year they said were planning to carry out bomb attacks against US installations in Germany. Media have reported that German police availed themselves of US intelligence services to monitor the suspects on the Internet because they had no power to do so themselves. The controversial technique involves sending out e-mails that plant so-called Trojan software on a suspect's computer and enable authorities to scan the hard drive. The GdP police union welcomed the ruling and said they had no problem with having strict conditions but also warned that further measures might be needed in future to fight terrorists. "Even after the ruling, answers have to be found to the fact that more and more crime is planned, agreed, prepared or carried out on the Internet," said GdP chairman Konrad Freibe
