 Tokyo, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called on Monday for new UN sanctions to be imposed on Iran, after the UN nuclear watchdog said Tehran had failed to provide satisfactory answers to reports showing work linked to atomic bombs. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Friday it had confronted Iran with Western intelligence reports and Tehran had not so far explained documents pointing to undeclared efforts to "weaponise" nuclear materials by linking uranium processing with explosives and designing a missile warhead. Olmert arrived in Tokyo on Monday on his first visit to Japan as prime minister. He will meet US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the Japanese capital on Thursday. The IAEA report showed Iran was continuing with a nuclear weapons programme and the UN Security Council should impose more sanctions, the Israeli prime minister said. "If we had formulated the report, we would have made it sharper," Olmert told reporters on the flight to Tokyo, where he will stay until Thursday. "The basic fact doesn't change. There is a plan to create non-conventional weapons. It must be stopped." The IAEA findings, which also said Iran had failed to clear up all outstanding questions by an agreed February deadline, may spur the Security Council to adopt a third round of sanctions against the Islamic Republic as early as this week. The United States, which has accused Iran of having a secret programme to build nuclear weapons, said the IAEA's report had produced a good reason to impose new sanctions. Iran, which says its nuclear programme is only for power generation to meet the growing demands of its economy, hailed the IAEA's comments as a victory because it said the watchdog had found Tehran was pursuing peaceful activities. Israel, which is widely assumed to possess the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, fears for its existence if Iran gets nuclear weapons. Senior diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, the United States, China and Russia would meet in Washington on Monday to discuss the next steps over Iran, Western officials said. Olmert said he was visiting Japan to strengthen political and economic ties. "Japan is an important trade partner that could be much more important," he said
