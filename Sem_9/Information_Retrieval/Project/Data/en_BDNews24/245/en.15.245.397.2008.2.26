 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) - A three-day student programme of boycotting classes began at Dhaka University Tuesday as part of a protest plan demanding removal of the quota system in BCS examinations. A few classes were held in the morning, but all classes were halted after noon. All examinations will continue as scheduled. Hundreds of students oppossing the quota system brought out a procession in the morning, calling for a three-day class boycott at higher education institutions throughout the country. A 55 percent quota is currently reserved for indegenous people, women and freedom fighters in BCS examinations. K S Salim, leader of the movement, announced the protest plan Monday, including a class boycott from Feb 26-28, for removal of all quotas. Many students within the university have voiced the opinion that Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, has had a hand in organising or infiltrating the protest under the cover of opposing BCS quotas. Surja Sen Hall resident Najmul Alam Nobin told bdnews24.com: "Shibir is capitalising on the protest against quota, and trying to destabilise the situation within the campus." "From the very beginning of the protest, known Shibir workers of Surja Sen Hall have been involved in it," Najmul claimed. He said that due to the severity of the August campus unrest and consequent events, students agreed on a protest but did not call a 'strike'. bdnews24.co
