 PARIS, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he should have resisted the temptation to swear at a critical bystander at a trade fair at the weekend but stopped short of apologising in a newspaper interview on Tuesday.

"My vision of the role of the president is not to cultivate friendship, to be the friend that you would dream of having." His aim was rather to act on all fronts to shake up France and get results, he said. "It is my duty to be hyperactive to wake up a country which was dozing," Sarkozy said.
