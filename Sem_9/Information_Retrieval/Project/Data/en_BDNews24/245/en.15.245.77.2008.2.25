 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks ended down Monday amid investor sell-offs to lock in profits. Market analysts said investor confidence in the market was gradually slipping. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed said that although several companies declared their stock and cash dividends Monday, the prices of those shares had fallen. Prime Bank, Mercantile Bank and Jamuna Oil, who declared their dividends Monday, closed down. "This indicates the weakness of the market, as investor confidence dips," Salahuddin said. A top brokerage house official told bdnews24.com that a shortage of funds combined with a lack of upcoming IPOs and confusion over frequent regulatory moves had all caused confidence in the market to fall. "Investors are puzzled, and losing confidence in the capital market. This is very alarming," said the official. Meanwhile, an ongoing reluctance from merchant banks to issue loans added to the gloomy outlook. A merchant bank official, requesting anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "Whatever the regulators say, we will not issue loans at more than a 1 to 0.5 ratio." The Securities and Exchange Commission reset the margin loan ratio at 1:1in an attempt to reinvigorate the market by facilitating access to funds. The SEC will sit with leading merchant bankers Tuesday in a bid to resolve the issue, the regulator's executive director Farhad Ahmed told bdnews24.com Monday. "We want to know whether merchant bankers have any confusion about the margin loan ratio we fixed," said Farhad. The merchant bank official said the volatile mood of market also influenced their decision to tighten loan disbursements. "We can't just rely on the fluctuating price of shares. The share prices of the issues that declared dividends all fell today," he said. Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange rose to Tk 1.74 billion from 12,426,689 traded shares, up from Monday's Tk 1.16 billion.
