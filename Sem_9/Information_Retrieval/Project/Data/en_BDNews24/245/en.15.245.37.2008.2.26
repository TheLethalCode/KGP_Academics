<TITLE> Sarkozy plans Chad visit on way to South Africa </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy will stop over in Chad briefly on Wednesday on his way to South Africa, a government source said on Tuesday. Sarkozy, who will be accompanied by Defence Minister Herve Morin, will meet Chadian President Idriss Deby, the source said. France propped up the Chadian army earlier this month with logistics and reconnaissance support that helped repel a rebel attack on the capital N'Djamena that at one point reached the presidential palace. Morin visited Chad a few days later to show support for France's former colony, where it has over 1,000 troops stationed, and where it is due to send the bulk of a 3,700 strong EU security force for the region. After meeting Morin, Deby said he would consider pardoning six French aid workers who were jailed after trying to fly 103 African children to Europe without permission.
