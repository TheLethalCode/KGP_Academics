<TITLE> Winter, eradication could curb Afghan drug crop </TITLE>

 KABUL, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A particularly harsh winter that killed poppy seedlings and efforts underway to eradicate the plants as they sprout could curb Afghanistan's record-breaking opium crop, the acting anti-drugs minister said on Tuesday. Last year, Afghanistan produced 93 percent of the world's opium and in 2008 the crop will at best be only slightly lower, the United Nations predicted this month, funding Taliban insurgents and further destabilising a country struggling to emerge from nearly 30 years of war. But a campaign to dissuade farmers from planting poppy this year has shown some success and security forces have begun to destroy poppy fields in the warmer south where the flowers appear first, said acting Counter Narcotics Minister General Khodaidad. "I'm optimistic this year. The pre-planting campaign has gone very well. Now we are in the first two weeks of eradication ... we are doing better than last year and will have more poppy-free provinces this year," Khodaidad told Reuters in an interview. In the southern province of Helmand, which alone produced nearly half the world's opium last year, police had destroyed 1,015 hectares of poppy fields in the last two weeks, he said. While small compared to the 102,000 hectares grown in Helmand last year, only 77 hectares had been eradicated in the province by the end of February, 2007, according to U.N. figures. To have any real effect though, the effort needs to be maintained. WINTER HITS OPIUM CROP The worst winter in living memory has killed more than 900 people in Afghanistan, but also wiped out seedlings in parts of the south where farmers plant sooner than the colder north. "The farmers had already planted and the cold weather came and eliminated the crop. Now, in some parts of those provinces, the farmers are looking to legal crops," said the former army general who is expected to be confirmed as counter narcotics minister in parliament on Wednesday. In the six years since U.S.-led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban, Afghanistan's opium crop has mushroomed, especially in the south where the Islamist insurgency to oust foreign troops and the pro-Western Afghan government is most virulent. "I kept saying for the last six or seven years, but the international community never used to listen to us: narcotics is stronger than terrorism, stronger than al Qaeda because it is fuelling the drug traffickers, the Taliban and terrorism," Khodaidad said. The opium crop was worth $4 billion to the Afghan economy last year, the UN estimates. The crop funds the insurgency and fuels official corruption, both of which weaken state control over parts of the country and allow more drugs to be produced. "When there is a good governor, a good police chief and law and order, there is no poppy and where there is violence, the drug dealers are operating and there is corruption," Khodaidad said. Despite sustained pressure from the international community, the Afghan government has been slow to tackle high-level officials involved in the drugs trade, diplomats say, but Khodaidad said law enforcement agencies were working on collecting evidence to launch prosecutions. He also denied media reports that a cut of subsidies for salaries at the ministry by the British government had led to a brain drain among senior officials. "It does not have any effect on our ministry. It's a free market. If someone finds a job in another place with good money, he will go there," he said. "We lost some people, but still we have good people and good people keep on comin
