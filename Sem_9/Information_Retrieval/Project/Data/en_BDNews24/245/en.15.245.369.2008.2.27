 Dhaka, February 27 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil's health has become critical, his physician Dr Matiur Rahman said Wednesday. Dr Rahman, LabAid Hospital's chief cardiologist, told bdnews24.com that the detained AL leader was suffering from a number of ailments including a severe kidney condition. "We may have to go for dialysis or a transplant operation soon," the doctor said. "Abdul Jalil's health has been failing seriously. His blood pressure has been fluctuating and the patient has oedema of the hands and face." "We will convene a medical board Sunday if his condition does not improve," the doctor said. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that he had visited the hospitalised party leader Monday night. "LabAid doctors told me that they are treating the patient's heart, kidneys and eyes and the AL leader is receiving the best medical care available," the DIG said. "It's not possible to send Mr Jalil abroad as the jail code doesn't permit it," Siddiqui added. bdnews
