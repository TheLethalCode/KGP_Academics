 Los Angeles, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eddie Murphy and Lindsay Lohan were crowned the worst actors of 2007 at the Golden Raspberry Awards on Saturday and, perhaps not surprisingly, neither star showed up to accept the spoof Oscars. For their lack of acting prowess, the veteran comic and the young actress with the hard-living reputation each won three gold spray-painted Razzie trophies worth $4.89 each. The annual honors were announced by the Golden Raspberry Foundation at a presentation that pokes fun at the Academy Awards ceremony that is to be held on Sunday. In a camp opening number, Dan Campbell and Paula Einstein donned '50s dresses and black "beehive" hairdos and sang: "The worst of last year are trembling with fear," and throughout the show clips were shown of the biggest Hollywood howlers of 2007. Murphy, who starred in the critically savaged comedy "Norbit," set a record by winning three of the four worst acting categories. Despite bad reviews, moviegoers had turned out for the film, which took in $158 million at worldwide box offices based mostly on Murphy's popularity. Lohan won two worst actress awards for playing twins in "I Know Who Killed Me," a film that was named worst of the year. She also won worst screen couple for a scene in which she appears opposite herself in the tale about psychically linked siblings stalked by a serial killer. "I Know Who Killed Me," a major box office flop with a $9 million take worldwide, won eight of nine Raspberries for which it was nominated, breaking a record of seven wins previously held by "Showgirls" and "Battlefield Earth." Lohan was in and out of rehabilitation programs last year and acknowledged last month that she had fallen off the wagon at a New Year's Eve party. In November, she served 84 minutes in jail for drunken driving and cocaine possession charges. Murphy won the worst actor award for playing the hapless hero of "Norbit." He had several parts in the movie and also won worst supporting actor and actress Raspberries for roles as a Chinese man and Norbit's screaming overweight wife. Murphy had earned an Oscar nomination for his dramatic turn as a troubled soul singer in 2006 musical "Dreamgirls" and some critics said the widespread distaste for "Norbit" -- which hit theaters only weeks before the Oscar ceremony -- cost him support for those prestigious awards. Like Lohan, Murphy's personal life also made headlines last year when he acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock with Spice Girls singer Melanie Brown. In January of this year, Murphy and his new wife, Tracey Edmonds, split just two weeks after getting married in French Polynesia. Few Razzies "winners" show up to the awards, which are open to the public, although actress Halle Berry did make an appearance in 2005 and sent herself up with a tearful acceptance speech when named worst actress for "Catwoman." Following is a list of this year's Razzie winners: Worst Picture: "I Know Who Killed Me" Worst Actor: Murphy in "Norbit" Worst Actress (tie): Lohan as twin sisters Aubrey and Dakota in "I Know Who Killed Me" Worst Supporting Actress: Murphy in "Norbit" Worst Supporting Actor: Murphy in "Norbit" Worst Screen Couple: Lohan & Lohan in "I Know Who Killed Me" Worst Remake or Rip-off: "I Know Who Killed Me," based on several films Worst Prequel or Sequel: "Daddy Day Camp" Worst Director: Chris Siverston for "I Know Who Killed Me" Worst Screenplay: Jeffrey Hammond for "I Know Who Killed Me" Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie (New Category): "I Know Who Killed Me.
