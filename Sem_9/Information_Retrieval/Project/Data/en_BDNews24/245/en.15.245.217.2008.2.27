 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's consumer inflation jumped unexpectedly in January, raising the risk of further monetary tightening despite worries over slowing economic growth. Statistics South Africa said on Wednesday that targeted CPIX stood at 8.8 percent year-on-year in January compared to 8.6 percent in December, while the all-items consumer price index (CPI) rose by 9.3 percent, compared to 9.0 percent in December. The CPIX number beat forecasts of an 8.4 percent rise and was widely expected to rise further in the first quarter of 2008, adding to pressure on the central bank to lift rates again. "This confirms that inflation remains a very big problem. It is putting serious pressure on the Reserve Bank," said Efficient Group economist Fanie Joubert. "We know they left the rates unchanged in January, but given these levels and the rate at which inflation is rising I don't know what the Reserve Bank is going to do. (It needs to) tell people why they are not raising (rates) if they are not going to hike again," he said. The central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) left its key repo rate unchanged at 11 percent in January, after 400 basis points worth of hikes since June 2006, amid concerns that monetary tightening was becoming overdone and weighing on economic expansion. The CPIX gauge, which strips out mortgage costs, broke above the upper end of the central bank's 3-6 percent band in April 2007 -- for the first time since August 2003 -- and has since remained outside the band. RATE HIKE POSSIBLE "There is an increasing chance of a 50 basis point hike at the April MPC meeting as inflation continues to climb faster than expected and the period in which it is expected to be back within target is pushed further out," said Investec economist Annabel Bishop. The central bank has in the past partly blamed rising inflation on high consumer spending, which has pushed household debt to a record 77.5 percent of disposable income, although there is evidence this slowed in response to higher rates. Rising food and fuel prices remain a concern, though, with domestic fuel costs seen surging to new record high. Preliminary figures from the minerals and energy department show the petrol price might go up by as much as 7.5 percent in March, after rising by 2.3 percent in February. "The 'normal' trajectory for inflation, still strong food and fuel pressures, recent rand weakness, and the prospect of larger electricity tariff increases are all going to contribute to higher inflation in the months ahead," said London-based Standard Chartered economist Razia Khan. The rand is sharply weaker so far this year, despite rebounding from lows touched last week, pointing to pressure on imported inflation. The currency initially weakened on inflation before rebounding, but government bonds slipped, but were also off earlier lows. The yield on the benchmark R157 bond due 2015 was last up two basis points at 8.875 percent from before the numbers were released, while the 2010 was up 3.5 basis points at 9.44 perce
