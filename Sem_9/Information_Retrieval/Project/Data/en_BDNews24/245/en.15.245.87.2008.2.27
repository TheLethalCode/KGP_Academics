 KABUL, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's interior minister survived a rocket and small arms ambush by suspected Taliban insurgents to the east of the capital Kabul on Wednesday, a ministry official said. Interior Minister Zarar Ahmad Moqbel was travelling through the Tangi Abrishim area of Laghman province when the attackers opened fire on his convoy with a single rocket, then followed up with a volley of small arms fire, the official said. The minister's guards returned fire, but there was no news of any casualties in the exchange and it was not clear if the attackers knew he was in the convoy, said the official, who declined to be named. More than 10,000 people have been killed since the Taliban relaunched their fight to oust the pro-Western Afghan government and eject foreign forces from the country two years ago. While NATO and Afghan troops routinely beat Taliban forces in battle, the insurgency shows few signs of abating with daily clashes across the country and a suicide bomb campaign undermining public faith in security. NATO-led forces have been conducting a wide-ranging offensive in volatile southern Afghanistan this week to disrupt the Taliban ahead of spring which each year heralds an upsurge in violence as snows melt and fighters emerge from mountain hideouts. British, US, Canadian and Dutch troops in southern Afghanistan have borne the brunt of fighting the Taliban, but political leaders from those countries have so far been unable to persuade other NATO nations to send soldiers south to help. A Taliban rocket killed five Afghan civilians near the Kajaki dam in the southern province of Helmand on Monday, US-led coalition forces said. Afghan army and coalition forces "eliminated several enemy fighters during the operation" around Kajaki, a coalition statement said on Wednesda
