 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Security measures at the Supreme Court were beefed up Monday as it began hearing the government's leave to appeal against the High Court's dismissal of an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina. A six-member full bench of the Appellate Division headed by the Chief Justice Md Ruhul Amin started proceedings at 9.30 am. A number of AL supporters were seen thronging the area outside the main entrance to the court premises, but they were not allowed inside. The court had earlier deferred the hearing scheduled for Feb 19, till Monday. The government filed the leave to appeal against the cancellation of the case on Feb 18. Hasina's lawyers immediately petitioned the court to postpone any hearing on the leave to appeal. On Feb 6, the HC dismissed the extortion case filed by Azam J Chowdhury against Hasina, after ruling illegal its inclusion under EPR. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed, acting for the government, said in court Monday: "The government approved inclusion of the case filed against Sheikh Hasina under emergency powers rules, considering its merit as a case of public importance." "The High Court's verdict quashing the case contradicts the spirit of the appellant's submission." "The emergency powers rules were promulgated to curb corruption and punish the corrupt." "The graft cases detected and filed during the emergency should be tried now, as trial of such cases will not be possible once the emergency is lifted," he said. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Selim with Gulshan police on June 13, 2007. The case details said the accused received a total of Tk 2.99 crore from the litigant in 2001 in exchange for illegally awarding a contract to build Siddhirganj Power Station. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007. She was shown arrested in the case later the same day after inclusion of the case proceedings under EPR. Charges were framed against the accused, including Sheikh Hasina's sister, Rehana, on Jan 13. bdnews24.
