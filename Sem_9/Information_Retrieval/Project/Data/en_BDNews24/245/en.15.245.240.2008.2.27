 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Bangladesh was fully committed to needs of the disabled as he inaugurated a three-day international conference on disability Wednesday. Representatives from 27 countries have come to Dhaka to participate in the third general assembly of the Asia Pacific Disability Forum, which this year has chosen to focus on "practical strategies" to address the needs of those living with disabilities in developing countries. The chief adviser said the global estimate for people living with some sort of disability currently stood at around 600 million. "It may be pointed out that two-thirds of the global population having disabilities lives in the Asia-Pacific region," he added. Fakhruddin said that Bangladesh was firmly committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities despite resource constraints. He said his administration had signed and ratified the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities shortly after assuming power. "I believe it demonstrated our sincerity in promoting services for and protecting the rights of disabled persons in Bangladesh." Government-NGO collaborations on disability issues had made great strides over recent years, Fakhruddin said, but there was still a lot of work to be done. He added that the government rules of business for catering to the needs of disabled persons needed urgent revision, while another area of concern was an overdue amendment to the Disability Welfare Act. "As is well known, poverty is the major cause and consequence of disability, particularly in developing countries," Fakhruddin said. "National development plans should therefore address special needs of disabled persons in different schemes." The chief adviser said the caretaker government had approved the restructuring of the National Foundation for Development of Disabled Persons as a quasi-government autonomous institution. "This foundation has already started its operation with financial support from our government as well as the World Bank," Fakhruddin said. "I am confident that the foundation will create an enabling environment for persons with disabilities to live with dignity and honour," he said. The national forum of organisations working with the disabled is hosting the conference at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre with support from the caretaker government and financial assistance from the World Bank and other sponsors.
