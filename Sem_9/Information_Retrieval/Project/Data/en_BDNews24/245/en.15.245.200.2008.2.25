 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Awami League has proposed that the government provide each party a grant of Tk 95 crore to meet all election expenses. The party put forward the proposal Monday during the second phase of electoral reform dialogues with the Election Commission. AL said that the government should give Tk 50 crore to a party for the party's central campaign expenses and Tk 15 lakh to each of 300 candidates for their election. It also demanded the disqualification of 'war criminals' from contesting the elections, saying that in the first round of dialogues with the EC, all parties except Jamaat-e-Islami had agreed on the matter. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and election commissioners Sohul Hussain and Sakhawat Hossain sat with AL at the EC Secretariat Monday. The Awami League delegation, led by acting president Zillur Rahman, included presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury among others. Abdur Razzak said during the dialogue: "Jamaat-e-Islami does not believe in the country's independence or the Liberation War. How can it contest elections?" Razzak also demanded that religion-based and communal parties not be allowed to register. Tofail Ahmed presented different amendment proposals to the election laws on behalf of the party. The AL reform proposals included: amending the 1972 Representation of the People Order instead of scrapping it; disqualifying war criminals and religion-based political parties from contesting elections, capping election expenses per candidate at Tk 15 lakh with a Tk 50 crore grant from the government to each party and Tk 15 lakh grant to each of 300 candidates, keeping intact the foreign branches of political parties, allowing those convicted of corruption the opportunity to contest elections three years after completion of their sentence. bdnews24
