<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Jail authorities Sunday transferred former state minister Amanullah Aman to Narayanganj jail from Dhaka Central Jail as a punishment, a prisons official said. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Aman would also be deprived of the right to meet relatives for one month. Haider said the action came since Aman held a meeting Saturday with party activists after taking treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. He said Aman had talked with the activists in a hospital canteen for two hours, violating jail code. The authorities, meanwhile, temporarily suspended jail guard Amir Hossain for his failure to carry out his duties. Haider said they also informed the police high-ups about three policemen who were in charge of Aman's security. The police officials are sub inspector Jamal Uddin of Shahbagh Police Station, Nayek Rafiqul Islam of Lalbagh zone and constable Subrata. "It's unexpected that it happened in front of the police officials," he said. He said they were discussing if Aman would be charged. The authorities had earlier punished barrister Nazmul Huda, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, Sigma Huda, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Sabera Aman for possessing cellular phones. They had been transferred to jails in Narayanganj and Kashimpur. Their right to see relatives has also been seized for violating jail code. If they have any plan to shift them to jails far from the capital, the DIG said: "Most of them are facing more than one case. So they regularly need to attend court proceedings. That's why it's not possible to shift them to other jails too, far from Dhaka." bdnew
