 London,Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure is building for tax havens to lift the veil on tax dodgers. Germany launched a tax-dodging probe earlier this month centred on Liechtenstein, which like Monaco and Andorra is on an OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) blacklist of tax havens. International pressure on Liechtenstein to remove banking secrecy has intensified. Monaco's Prince Albert II was to hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, and Berlin said the focus would be trade and cooperation. The European Union's savings directive, introduced in 2005, dealt a first blow to tax havens by forcing European wealth management centres to apply a withholding tax on savings from undeclared EU income. Under this directive Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and some non-EU countries are allowed for a transitional period to apply a withholding tax instead of providing information about account holders, at a rate of 15 percent for the first three years, 20 percent for the next three years and 35 percent thereafter. Here is a list of European countries with strict laws protecting bank privacy: LIECHTENSTEIN -- Liechtenstein, Andorra and Monaco are on an OECD blacklist of tax havens. -- Liechtenstein allows foreigners to open trusts anonymously by registering them through a local attorney or trustee. The government says this is in line with international law. German officials say these trusts can be used to evade tax. -- Until recently, the Alpine principality's banking laws permitted banks to issue numbered accounts, but new regulations require them to know who all account holders are. LUXEMBOURG -- Luxembourg's banking secrecy law says that those who work in financial institutions cannot reveal information to the outside world except in money-laundering cases. -- Tax evasion is not a crime in Luxembourg, but it says it does not have anonymous accounts or a foundation system that could be exploited by tax dodgers. -- Under the 2005 EU Savings Directive, Luxembourg allows some account holders to keep their identities secret from their countries of residence by paying withholding tax instead. SWITZERLAND -- Switzerland's protection of banking secrecy goes back to 1934 when it passed a law imposing heavy penalties, even prison sentences, for breach of banking secrecy. -- The Swiss waive secrecy in criminal investigations. Banks supply information requested by foreign governments pursuing criminal investigations of individuals, but this does not extend to tax evasion, which is not a criminal offence in Switzerland. -- Switzerland allows EU account holders to keep bank secrecy by paying withholding tax instead. But Switzerland has signed bilateral agreements with dozens of states over the past decade under which it will give them access to Swiss bank accounts in the worst cases of tax evasion. AUSTRIA: -- Austria's 1947 law, written into the constitution, allows strict banking secrecy though Austrian banks require the identification of anyone depositing over $50,000. Access to information on accounts is provided on request to a government producing evidence that the account holder is involved in a criminal investigation. - In July 2006, the Supreme Court upheld a bank's decision to withhold information requested by Germany under a bilateral treaty on the grounds that the subject, a German taxpayer, had not been formally notified of the initiation of criminal tax proceedings. - Austria allows account holders to keep bank secrecy by paying withholding tax. BELGIUM: -- Bank secrets may be revealed as evidence when an account holder is under investigation. Belgium has amended its criminal code to make receiving, concealing and managing criminal funds a crime. -- Belgium has opted to keep bank secrecy and to charge foreign account holders withholding tax under the 2005 EU Savings Directive. It plans to switch to exchange of information before the withholding tax rate reaches 35 percent in 2011. SAN MARINO: -- Landlocked inside Italy, San Marino is a stronghold of bank secrecy and allows anyone to open an anonymous account with few questions asked. -- The OECD removed it from its blacklist of tax havens in 2003 after San Marino took action to toughen its anti-money laundering rules, crack down on bearer accounts and make it harder for foreigners, mostly Italians from nearby provinces, to evade value added tax. -- San Marino has agreed to allow account holders to keep bank secrecy by paying withholding tax.
