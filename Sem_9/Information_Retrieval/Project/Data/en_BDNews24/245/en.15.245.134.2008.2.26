<TITLE> Chakvetadze still haunted by robbery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Anna Chakvetadze is still haunted by the robbery at her Moscow house late last year during which she was tied up with her parents and injured. "I never thought something like that would happen to me," she told reporters on Tuesday, her voice still trembling at the memory. "It was like something I had seen in the movies." Her father, Djambuli, a wealthy businessman, was targeted, and the world number six was so shaken by the experience that she cancelled the pre-season training she had arranged. The family now have bodyguards living in the house. Chakvetadze's form suffered afterwards and she lost her opening match at the Sydney International before going out in the third round at the Australian Open but she got back on track this month by winning the Paris indoor event. "I just couldn't sleep the first three nights in my room," said Chakvetadze, who beat Pole Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2 2-6 6-4 to reach the second round of the Dubai Championships on Tuesday. "Then it was okay but I wanted to live in another place in Moscow, to change location, but my parents didn't really want to. So now we have bodyguards in the house and alarms, everything you can do. "I don't think it's strange to live with bodyguards, because sometimes you live in the house and you think that you are safe, but you are not so you have to do something." Although she was not in the right mental state in January to play, Chakvetadze insists she did the right thing by travelling to Australia. "It was difficult because I didn't have any preparation for the season because I was supposed to go to Asia to practise outdoors with my hitting partner and my fitness coach," she said. "But I was happy I was in Australia playing the tournaments because I wanted to play very badly. I like it there and I also think a Grand Slam tournament is very important." Sixth-seeded Chakvetadze faces compatriot Dinara Safina in the second round in Dubai
