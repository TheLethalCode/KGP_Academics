 BAGHDAD, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military said on Tuesday it had detained a senior journalist at one of Iraq's biggest television stations because he may have information about "Iranian-sponsored criminal activity". The US military accuses Iran of financing, arming and training rogue Shi'ite militia groups that attack US and Iraqi forces, a charge Tehran denies.
