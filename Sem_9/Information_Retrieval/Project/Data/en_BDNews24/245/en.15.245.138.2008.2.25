 HONG KONG, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong blue chips fell 0.2 percent and China plays dropped 1 percent on Monday, as tumbling mainland stock markets unnerved investors, prompting them to sell Chinese large caps in the financial and commodity sectors. Turnover marked its lowest level this year, and bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) was punished for it, falling for a fourth straight session. "It doesn't look too bright for HKEx in the near term," said Peter Pak, vice president at BOCI Securities. "Confidence is weak. We have clients who want to wait until after the earnings results before deciding to do anything." But global bank HSBC Holdings plc was a bright spot, as shares rose on news that banks were near an agreement to bail out bond insurer Ambac Financial in a deal that could stem further losses in credit markets. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 35.90 points at 23,269.14. The China Enterprises index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, fell 1 percent, or 133.91 points, to 13,202.98. Mainboard turnover was at its lowest since Dec 31, registering a meagre HK$63.7 billion (US$8.2 billion) compared to Friday's HK$73.9 billion. China's main stock index sank more than 4 percent as investors sold shares in companies that are raising funds from the market on fears over the market's ability to absorb a huge supply of new stock due to hit the market. "Recently there's been a lot of negative news about the new supply of shares," Pak said. "Liquidity looks bad there, and people are worried about (the impact) on the H shares." HSBC finished up 1.7 percent at HK$116.5, logging a third-straight gaining session. Hong Kong Exchanges, the day's most active stock after HSBC, slid a further 4.1 percent to HK$140.90. Among Chinese financial shares, Ping An Insurance slid 2 percent to HK$55.55 and China Construction Bank declined 1.3 percent to HK$5.51. China Unicom, the country's No.2 cellular operator, finished at HK$17.4, down 4.7 percent, tracking its Shanghai-listed affiliate, which fell on speculation that it was considering a huge new share offer. Among resource plays, China Shenhua, the country's top coal miner, fell 2 percent to HK$39.6 and oil refiner Sinopec Corp dropped 1.3 percent to HK$8.35. But steel plays jumped after Baoshan Iron and Steel Co said on Monday it would hike major steel product prices by 17 to 20 percent in the second quarter. Angang Steel surged 5.8 percent to HK$19.98 and Maanshan Iron & Steel leapt 4.5 percent to HK$4.88. (US$1=HK$7
