A Dhaka court Tuesday deferred hearing on charge framing against the AL president Sheikh Hasina in the graft case involving setting up barge mounted power stations till March 3. The court also rejected Hasina's bail prayer submitted in connection with this case. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 gave the orders. Earlier, Hasina was taken to the court at 9:40 am. Following the court orders, Hasina was allowed half an hour to speak to her relatives present there. Hasina's lawyers sought bail for the former prime minister in the case proceedings on Feb 13. Hasina did not appear in court on the day due to illness. The judge set Feb 19 for ruling on the bail petition. During the hearing on the bail plea, Hasina's lawyers referred to the High Court's dismissal of Azam J Chowdhury's extortion case against, arguing that it was also invalid to try the barge-mounted power plant case under the Special Powers Act. The Anticorrupion Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon police against eight people including Sheikh Hasina. The case claims that the accused took bribes amounting to Tk 3 crore in exchange for awarding contracts for the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. The money was allegedly used to buy land in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. Hasina was shown arrested in the case on Sept 19. Sheikh Hasina filed a writ petition on Oct 28 with the High Court challenging the validity of trying the case under emergency powers rules and seeking bail. The High Court granted bail to Hasina on Nov 4 and suspended all proceedings of the case. The Appellate Division stayed the High Court bail order on Nov 26, allowing trial of the case to proceed. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnews24.com/pc/ff/gna
