<TITLE> US phone firms go silent in wiretap debate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US telecommunications firms are rarely shy about lobbying the government -- but when it comes to a political fight over wiretapping terrorism suspects, they are keeping the lowest of profiles. "No comment," Verizon Corp spokesman Peter Thonis said this week when asked about his company's reluctance to publicly assist the Bush administration's push for telecom immunity from wiretap lawsuits. Companies including Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc face dozens of suits accusing them of improper participation in a warrantless wiretap program launched by U.S. President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks. The administration wants the Democratic-led Congress to retroactively shield phone companies from such suits, and says immunity is needed to win future wiretap cooperation. Some Democrats and civil liberties advocates say the companies should be held accountable for participating in a program critics say was illegal. But the phone companies, hamstrung by secrecy laws and eager to avoid accusations of violating their customers' privacy, have mostly let the administration and supporters in Congress make the case for them. "The basic feeling is they don't want to be caught between a rock and a hard place," by conducting a public campaign, said Paul Glenchur, telecommunications analyst for the Stanford Group's Washington office. "There's the government demand on one hand, and customer privacy on the other, and you want to take both very seriously," he said. AT&T described its dilemma in a letter to Congress last October: "Our company essentially finds itself caught in the middle of an oversight dispute between the Congress and the executive relating to government surveillance activities." LIABILITY FEARS The issue flared again this month when Congress failed to resolve a stalemate over immunity in updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and temporary wiretap legislation expired Feb. 16. U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell wrote to Congress last week saying the United States had missed out on intelligence since the expiration. They said some phone companies were worried about their liability and were unwilling to wiretap new targets, but a day later the officials reported they had overcome the reluctance and resumed collecting intelligence. A Wall Street Journal editorial last week quoted an executive as expressing a widespread industry reluctance to voluntarily grant a government wiretapping request. "I'm not doing it. If I don't have compulsion, I can't get out of court (over wiretap lawsuits). I'm not going to do something voluntarily," he said. In their responses to lawsuits and state inquiries into the terrorism wiretapping, the companies say they are forbidden by secrecy laws from saying whether they cooperated. But when Congress asked phone companies last October a number of questions about their participation in wiretapping, they made their case for immunity. If it were subject to potential legal liability for following a government order, Verizon responded, it would need the government to answer extensive questions to justify every wiretap request, and then would need legal advice on whether the justification is sufficient. "Each of these steps would delay the government's receipt of assistance it might need to save lives," Verizon said. Analysts said they saw little prospect that lawsuits against the phone companies will succeed, and Glenchur said investors have shown little interest in the issue. But McConnell and other government officials say the companies will be reluctant to place terrorism wiretaps without durable assurance they can avoid drawn-out suits when they cooperate in good faith with a government request. Said AT&T in its October letter, "If the courts do not swiftly dismiss such cases ... then carriers who are alleged to have cooperated with intelligence activities are faced with years of litigation, at great financial and reputational cost."
