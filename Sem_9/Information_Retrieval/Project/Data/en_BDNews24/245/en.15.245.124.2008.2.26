 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com)  In its second round electoral dialogue, the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) asked the Election Commission Tuesday to recommend that the government ban political parties backed by 'war criminals'. "We demand that the parties supported by war criminals should be declared unfit for polls and they should be banned," JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu said at the EC Secretariat. "We ask the Election Commission to recommend the move to the government." JSD placed a number of proposals to the EC, including: relaxing registration conditions for parties, allowing scope for minor loan defaulters to participate in elections and not delimitating constituencies. The party said it was happy with the proposed capping of campaign expenses at Tk 5 lakh per candidate. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said, "The Election Commission will publish the substance of the second round dialogues with the political parties in one volume." The commission will place a number of recommendations to the government after the dialogues are over, finalising them at a later date, Huda said. A total of 11 JSD delegates took part in the talks, with election commissioners M Sakhawat Hossain and Muhammed Sohul Hossain also attending. The EC began the second round of electoral reform dialogues on Feb 24. bdnews24
