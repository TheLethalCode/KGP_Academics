<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)The body of a six-year-old girl, Preeti Rani Sarker, was recovered Wednesday morning from a shed near her house at Pallabi in the city, about 18 hours after she had gone missing from home. When the body was recovered Wednesday morning, five caps of the kind normally worn by army personnel, were found near the body, police said. Preeti, daughter of tailor Prodip Chandra Sarker of Chakuli village, Pallabi, had been missing since Tuesday noon. A resident of Chakuli, also known as a 'Hindu locality', Preeti was a student of class two at Cantonment Primary School. Her father Prodip filed a GD with Pallabi police around 1 am Wednesday, after a day-long search for his daughter proved fruitless. Pallabi police officer-in-charge Md Abdul Momen told bdnews24.com: "After the little girl went missing, her family informed the police around midnight and a GD was filed." "At about 7 am Wednesday, her family informed police that the body had been found. Police then went and recovered the body." Momen also said that five caps normally used by army personnel were found beside the body. "Investigation is going on," he added. Pallabi police sub-inspector Hemayet Uddin told bdnews24.com that investigation was also going on as to whether the caps had purposely been placed near the body by the perpetrators to throw police off the track, as it appeared unlikely that all five caps would have been left at the scene of the crime. Hemayet said he had recovered Preeti's body from a cowshed near the girl's home. The girl was half-dressed, and her body bore bruises around the eyes, chest, legs, back and pubic area, the police officer said. Hemayet said the five caps were found about four to five feet away from the body. One of them bore a name and two others had numbers, he said. Army personnel were informed about the caps and an army major came and spoke to Pallabi police, Hemayat told bdews24.com. Though there was no proof that the little girl had been raped, there might have been attempts at rape, and she may have been strangled, the sub-inspector said. The girl's father filed a case with Pallabi police after the body was retrieved. bdnew
