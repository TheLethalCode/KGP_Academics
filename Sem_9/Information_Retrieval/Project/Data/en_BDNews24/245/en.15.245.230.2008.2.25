 MUMBAI, India, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect due to an illegal action, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday. An independent analysis of Samuels' action by Mark King, a member of the cricket body's panel of human movement specialists, in London revealed that his off-break and fast deliveries exceeded the permitted 15 degrees level of tolerance, the ICC said in a statement. The Jamaican, an occasional off-spinner, was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action during the third test match between South Africa and West Indies in Durban from Jan. 12-14. Although only his fast deliveries were reported as suspect, the ICC's procedure requires a bowler's complete action to be scrutinised. "The analysis showed that Samuels' average elbow flexion/extension angle for an off-break delivery was 27 degrees while the elbow flexion/extension angle for his faster delivery was 35 degrees," the statement said. Samuels can apply for re-assessment after he has modified his bowling action, the ICC said. He also has the right to appeal against King's conclusions to the Bowling Review Grou
