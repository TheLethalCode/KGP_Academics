 ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies and Pakistan will play a three-match one-day series in November in Abu Dhabi, a local official said on Monday. Dilawar Mani, chief executive of the Abu Dhabi Cricket Club told Reuters: "This is not connected to the ICC's schedule - it is a separately-arranged tour. "We looked at the FTP (Future Tours Programme) and found a window of opportunity and we went for it. The series has been sanctioned and funded by the Abu Dhabi government and Sheikh Nayan." The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi has hosted a handful of one-day internationals since it opened in 2004 but is seeking to build its reputation as an offshore host. Another UAE venue Sharjah became the leading neutral international venue throughout the 1980's and 1990's. Mani also said he was hoping the venue would be considered as a host for the Indian Premier League when the tournament is fully developed, and added he had spoken with officials from the rival Indian Cricket League and rejected the chance to host their games. "We have hesitation," said Mani. "ICL has been talking to us but we are an accredited ICC member so we certainly don't wish to antagonise the major Test-playing nations. It is not our ambition to do that." "In future we would have to consider our opportunities but at this time we won't be fitting ICL matches into our schedule." The Abu Dhabi stadium was hosting the UK-based celebrity team Lashings on Monday in a floodlit Twenty20 match. Former Test players such as New Zealand's Chris Cairns and England's Graeme Hick were in action
