<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Oscars became a foreign affair at their midpoint on Sunday as France's Marion Cotillard won best film actress, Britain's Daniel Day-Lewis won best actor and Tilda Swinton took supporting actress, with Spain's Javier Bardem grabbing supporting actor. Cotillard earned her best actress Academy Award portraying singer Edith Piaf in "La Vie en Rose" and became the first French actress to win the Oscar in that category since 1960. The 32-year-old stunned audiences and critics at home and abroad in the film that traces the life of Piaf, who achieved fame after being raised by her grandmother in a brothel but saw her life cut short by drug and alcohol abuse. "I'm speechless now," Cotillard said on stage, visibly surprised and overjoyed. "Thank you life, thank you love. It is true there (are) some angels in this city." Swinton earned her supporting actress Oscar playing an ethically challenged corporate lawyer in thriller "Michael Clayton," and Bardem was given his award for playing a sadistic killer in the bleak drama "No Country For Old Men." Bardem, who hails from a family of performers, took the occasion to thank his family in Spanish, apologizing in advance to the Hollywood audience. "Mama, this is for you. This is for your grandparents and your parents," said Bardem. "This is for the comedians of Spain who like you have brought dignity and pride to our profession. This is for Spain and this is for all of you." The Austrian Holocaust-era drama "The Counterfeiters" won the Oscar for best foreign language film. Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, it was the first win for Austria in the category. THE COENS' BIG NIGHT? The Oscars are the world's top film honors and are given out by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But this year, they were almost canceled or drastically changed from a traditional award ceremony due to the three-month screenwriters strike that ended only about 10 days ago. After months of fretting over whether this year's Oscars would happen, the curtain finally rose and the first major award for best animated film went to audience favorite "Ratatouille," which tells of a friendly rat who becomes head chef in a Parisian kitchen. Another key trophy was awarded to brothers Joel and Ethan Coen for their adapted screenplay for "No Country for Old Men," which is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy. The brothers are also nominated for best director and best film, awards to come later in the evening. "No Country" entered the Oscars as a front-runner for top film but faces competition from "There Will Be Blood" a gritty drama looking at the life of a sadistic oil prospector played by Daniel Day-Lewis, and legal thriller "Michael Clayton." In the best actor category, Day-Lewis will battle George Clooney, who plays a "fixer" in a law firm in "Clayton." Political satirist Jon Stewart returned as Oscar host and, in his opening monologue, made light of the pessimistic tone of the film nominees that include war-time romance "Atonement" with a story that centers on family betrayal. "Does this town need a hug? What happened?" Stewart said. "All I can say is, thank God for teen pregnancy." "Juno," the fifth best film nominee, is a comedy about a 16-year-old girl who becomes pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption, ultimately offering a message of hope. Stewart was hosting in the midst of a US presidential campaign and he poked fun at Republicans and Democrats. "Oscar is 80 this year, which makes it now automatically the front-runner for the Republican nomination," Stewart said in a nod to that party's presumed candidate, John McCain, 71
