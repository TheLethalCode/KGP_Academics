<TITLE> Plan to put pounds in pocket before tax-year end </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON (bdnews24.com/Reuters), Feb 27 - A little foresight before the end of the tax year can help keep precious pounds out of the taxman's coffers, boost your investments and pave the way for a rosier financial future. And with time running out until the end of the current tax year on April 5, you should start planning now. "Everyone should sort out their finances at least once a year and the run-up to the end of the tax year is an ideal time to do so," says Andy Gadd, head of research at independent financial adviser Lighthouse Group. "Although tax planning is important, especially as the end of the tax year approaches, it is always vital to remember the old adage that tax planning should not dictate investment decisions, but rather the other way round." Examining your savings, ensuring you are making full use of tax allowances, boosting your pension pot and looking at the new capital gains tax and inheritance tax rules, due to come into force on April 6, can pay dividends. Use our "top tips" guide to give yourself an end-of-tax-year financial boost: Pensions Contributions to personal pensions currently benefit from tax relief at 22 percent (the basic rate of income tax). In fact, they are paid into most arrangements net of tax, then the sum is grossed up by the tax relief. But the government plans to alter the basic rate of tax relief to 20 percent in the next tax year and this will reduce the amount by which payments are "grossed up", so think about making one-off pension contributions before April 6 to benefit. Up to 3,600 pounds per annum can be put in pensions for children, grandchildren or non-working spouses. Full tax relief is, again, available on contributions. Those with cash to spare and large earnings should consider making full use of the annual contribution allowance of up to 100 percent of qualifying earnings (up to 225,000 pounds) less any contributions already paid by yourself or your employer. "Under certain circumstances, you can combine this year's and next year's maximum payments to achieve a massive tax saving, all within the current tax year," says Simon Pimblett, head of research and development at Route Group. Investments Maximise the use of your individual savings account (ISA) allowance and other tax-efficient allowances, such as those for venture capital trusts (VCTs) and the enterprise investment scheme (EIS), which cannot be carried forward. The annual ISA allowance is a maximum 7,000 pounds, which can be paid into a stocks and shares ISA, or split between a stocks and shares and cash ISA (4,000 and 3,000 pounds each). ISAs are tax-free vehicles: no tax is charged on investment returns other than tax withheld on dividend payments (10 percent on UK dividends) which cannot be reclaimed. Paul Wilcox, chairman and technical director for specialist investment management group WAY Group, however, sounds a note of caution: "Whilst I am very much in favour of younger investors fully utilising their annual ISA allowances, I am much more circumspect about older, wealthier investors doing so. "Older investors with large accumulated ISA holdings should do their sums very carefully to make sure that they are wise to leave such assets unprotected from inheritance tax." Those wanting to invest tax-efficiently, but without tying funds up in pensions could invest in a VCT (which attracts 30 percent tax relief) or an EIS (which gives 20 percent relief). Up to 200,000 pounds can be invested in VCTs and investments must be held for five years -- or longer, as such trusts can prove tricky to exit. Up to 400,000 pounds can be invested in an EIS per year, and the investment must be held for three years for the tax breaks. EISs qualify for inheritance tax (IHT) relief after two years and realised capital gains can be rolled over into the scheme if they have been made in the previous three years or the initial year of investment. In both VCTs and EISs, you cannot receive more tax relief than you pay in tax over the tax year. The tax breaks might be attractive, but Steve Potter, head of technical services at Tilney Private Wealth Management, warns: "(These) are generally categorised as higher risk, as they involve investment in the shares of smaller companies. But there are some on the market which offer a lower risk approach and some capital protection." Up to 1,200 pounds per year can also be saved on behalf of children into child trust funds. Capital gains tax The annual individual exemption for the 2007/08 tax year is 9,200 pounds -- and it is a "use it or lose it" allowance, so consider realising profits up to this level. Losses can be used to reduce gains, so think about "taking the hit" on loss-making investments to reduce gains elsewhere. From the 2008/09 tax year, the capital gains tax (CGT) rate will, for many, be charged at a flat 18 percent. Chancellor Alistair Darling announced the move in his pre-Budget report last October, scrapping taper relief which had allowed a 10 percent rate for business assets held for at least two years. But he said last month that entrepreneurs selling business interests where they hold 5 percent or more of the share capital, will be charged just 10 percent on the first million pounds of taxable gains. That, however, has done nothing to help small investors, such as those in "save as you earn" schemes and others who have been encouraged to buy into the companies they work for via share option schemes. Investors should consider selling assets that will attract CGT at a rate lower than 18 percent in the current tax year -- and defer the sale of those that will have a lower liability post-April 5. Even if you do not want to dispose of an asset, it could be possible to sell and repurchase it in the new tax year to wash out gains that attract less CGT. Consider the risk of fluctuating values, though. Also think about assigning assets to a lower tax-paying spouse or civil partner before realising capital gains. Inheritance tax This is charged at a penal flat-rate of 40 percent by people on their dead relatives' estates, so taking steps to mitigate your liability makes sense. Everyone has an annual IHT capital gift allowance of 3,000 pounds, which can be carried over by one year. A couple who have not used their 2006/7 or 2007/8 gift allowances, could gift a total 12,000 pounds before the end of this tax year. On top of this, you can make unlimited gifts of 250 pounds per recipient and unlimited regular gifts of any size, as long as you can demonstrate that these come from normal income and do not affect your standard of living or capital base. Gifts to charities and political parties are also free of tax for IHT purposes. "Whilst gifts to political parties are not considered 'gifts to charities', they have the effect of removing the donation from the value of the donor's estate, whether that gift is made during life or on death," says Route Group's Pimblett. "If you are going to gift to a political party, however, you should always remember to make any such donations in your own name, and not send them in anonymously via any unrelated third-parties." Make sure you keep good records of all gifts. Also consider revising your will, says Ronnie Ludwig, a partner in the private wealth group of chartered accountant Saffery Champness. The government will raise the IHT threshold to 600,000 pounds from the current 300,000 pounds in the next tax year -- but the change only applies to married couples and civil partners, who can already use a joint IHT allowance of 600,000 pounds through tax planning measures. But Ludwig adds: "This new relief brought with it an unlimited carry back, so if your spouse has died and had not used the full amount of their nil rate band, this will now be available on second deat
