<TITLE> Lawyers try to halt Rwanda genocide tribunal </TITLE>

 Nairobi, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council should halt trials by a tribunal prosecuting the masterminds of Rwanda's 1994 genocide because it is biased, defence lawyers said on Wednesday. Some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by troops and extremist Hutu militias during 100 days of carnage. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is trying government officials and military officers in power at the time. Defence lawyers say the court in northern Tanzania is ignoring serious allegations against Rwanda's leader Paul Kagame whose Tutsi rebels invaded and were credited with halting the bloodshed. "All convictions should be suspended, which means all trials should be suspended, and there should be an independent investigation of the manipulation of the prosecutor's office," said Peter Erlinder, head of the defence lawyers' association. "The tribunal itself should cease operations during a complete investigation by the U.N. Security Council." Judges in France and Spain have called for Kagame and some associates to be prosecuted for killings and other crimes. Kigali cut ties with Paris in November 2006 after an anti-terrorist judge issued a summons for Kagame to stand trial for the killing of his predecessor Juvenal Habyarimana, an event that unleashed the genocide. Kagame denies any wrongdoing. Earlier this month, Spain's High Court accused 40 members of Kagame's rebels of organising the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians, including nine Spaniards, in the 1990s. The court said in a statement judge Fernando Andreu believed Kagame ordered killings and personally massacred civilians, based on testimony by a protected witness, but he could not prosecute him because he had immunity as a head of state. "I believe the warrants from Spain have the same shortcomings as the ones from France in that there may be immunity for a sitting president," Erlinder told Reuters by telephone from the ICTR in the Tanzanian town of Arusha. "But I think that the Spanish warrants make it clear that complicity extends to President Kagame, and of course there is no immunity at the ICTR." Rwandan government spokesmen and ICTR officials were not immediately available to comment.
