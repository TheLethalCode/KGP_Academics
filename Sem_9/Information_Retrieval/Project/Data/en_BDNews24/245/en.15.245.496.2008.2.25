 MANILA, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines' security forces pledged support to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Monday as thousands called for her resignation in rallies in Manila and other cities over a corruption scandal. The heads of the military and police locked arms in a "unity march" with several thousand police officers to end coup rumours, circulating in the capital via mobile phone text message. "We are here to say that these reports and text messages are untrue, that they are completely false, since we in the police and the military are solid, united behind the government," police chief Avelino Razon said. Allegations of $130 million worth of kickbacks in a $329 million government telecoms deal with China's ZTE Corp. have revived calls for Arroyo, who has already survived three impeachment bids and at least three coup plots, to step down. The former economist has vowed to see out her final term, which ends in 2010, and political analysts say she will likely do so because the powerful Catholic Church has not come out directly against her and she enjoys the support of the military and the lower house of Congress. But the administration is jumpy. A powerful council of bishops will meet tomorrow to discuss the political situation and Razon imposed a weeklong ban on carrying guns in public as a "preventive measure". Thousands of people demonstrated in different areas of Manila on Monday, which was the anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a "people power" revolt in 1986. Police said around 4,500 people attended rallies in the capital while organisers put the figure at up to 6,000. Protestors broke through a police cordon along the main highway in Manila, forcing officers to jump on public buses and fire engines to catch up with them. Coils of barbed wire blocked the road leading to the presidential palace and tanks, armoured vehicles and thousands of troops were on standby. FINANCIAL MARKETS The protests, which also included smaller demonstrations in other cities, were peaceful, lifting a potential cloud over local financial markets, which will reopen on Tuesday. "Today was peaceful so the markets may go up because Asian markets recovered today. We might see a rebound tomorrow," said Fitzgerald Aclan, assistant vice president at Banco de Oro Unibank. "But we will be priced at a discount to the other markets because of the ongoing political uncertainty." After blazing a trail last year with gains of 19 percent against the dollar, the peso is lagging many regional peers with a rise of just 1.67 percent this year. The stock market is down nearly 15 percent, the second-worst performance in Southeast Asia after Vietnam's main index. Former president Joseph Estrada added his voice on Monday to the calls for Arroyo to resign. "I hope she will be enlightened that it is time for her to go to avoid bloodshed and violence," Estrada said in an interview with Al Jazeera television. Estrada was ousted in a military-backed revolt over corruption in 2001 that propelled Arroyo, his then vice-president, to power. He was convicted of plunder last year but Arroyo pardoned him a month later. Earlier this month, around 10,000 people demonstrated against Arroyo in Manila's financial district, the biggest crowd since tens of thousands rallied in 2005 at the height of a scandal over alleged vote fraud. But middle class Filipinos remain reluctant to take to the streets due to cynicism about what a third "people power" revolt would achieve and anti-government rallies have not attracted the hundreds of thousands of people seen in 1986 and 20
