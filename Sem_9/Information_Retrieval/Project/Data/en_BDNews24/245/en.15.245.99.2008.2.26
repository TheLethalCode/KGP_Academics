 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) -- The caretaker administration is set to form a three member local government commission following finalisation of a draft law, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Tuesday. The draft of the local government commission law will be presented to the advisory council for approval in a few days, the adviser told reporters at his office. "The government wants a strong local government system. Making local government bodies independent is not enough, their own source of income and jurisdiction has to be fixed," Anwarul said. In order to facilitate this, the adviser said, local government bodies are being brought under three specific laws. One law will deal with the city corporations. Municipalities will be regulated under a separate law, while district, upazila and union parishad bodies will come under a third law. The government has already finalised the draft of a law that will see the six city corporations brought under the same legislation, Anwarul said. "However, to make these laws effective a local government commission will be required." "Therefore, along with a draft law for the city corporations, a draft of the local government commission law has also been finalised," the adviser said. Both laws will be sent to the council of advisers for final approval prior to their enactment, Anwarul said. The adviser said the exact make up of the local government commission was yet to be finalised, but search committees would be formed to recommend names. "The committee will appoint a three member panel, and later the president will appoint the commission members," he said. bdnews24.
