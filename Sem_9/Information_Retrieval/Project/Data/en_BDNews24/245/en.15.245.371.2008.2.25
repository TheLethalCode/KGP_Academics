 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative leader David Cameron has supported a cut in the legal time limit on abortions ahead of a possible vote on the issue in coming weeks. But Gordon Brown's spokesman said on Monday the prime minister, on the basis of medical advice, did not support a change in the abortion law.

A majority of MPs on the Commons' Science and Technology Committee rejected lowering the limit in a report last year. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill is currently making its way through parliament and is expected to return to the House of Commons in the coming wee
