 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)Three Dhaka University teachers will appeal court verdicts that jailed them for two years each for their alleged involvement in the August campus rioting, lawyers said Sunday. The teachersnow free on presidential clemencywant to fight a court battle to prove that they are not guilty of the charges they were convicted on. The appeals will be filed with Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court Monday, said lawyer Abdul Mannan Khan who represents Dr Anwar Hossain, one of the three teachers. The lawyer said two other teachers would also follow suit. On Jan 22, additional chief metropolitan and speedy trial tribunal judge Md Golam Rabbani handed down the verdict, sentencing the three to two years in jail. The three were released from jail the same day after President Iajuddin Ahmed pardoned them using his special powers. The two other teachers are dean of the Arts Faculty Prof Dr Sadrul Amin and dean of the Social Sciences Faculty Prof Harun-or-Rashid. Lawyer Mannan Khan said they would place arguments in documents that such appeals could be filed even after presidential mercy. In August last year, chaos unfolded on the Dhaka University campus after some troops beat a student during a football match. The students immediately protested the troops' action and demanded withdrawal of army personnel from a camp at DU. The protests turned violent and spilled over onto the streets of Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. The interim government had to impose days of curfew to ease tensions. Authorities later charged the teachers with making provocative statements and fuelling the violence. The teachers rejected the charges. bdnews24
