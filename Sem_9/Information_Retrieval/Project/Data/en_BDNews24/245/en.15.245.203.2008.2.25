<TITLE> Brown seeks compromise in meeting with unions </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown held talks with union officials on Monday to try to reach a compromise over the rights of temporary and agency workers. The meeting failed to produce an agreement on the makeup of any commission but Brown's spokesman described the talks as "constructive" and said the government was listening. The talks followed a parliamentary vote last Friday on a bill to give agency workers similar benefits to permanent staff. The bill passed by 147 votes to 11, an embarrassment for Brown since it was tabled by a Labour parliamentarian and supported by other members of the party even though the government does not support it. Given the government's lack of support it is unlikely to become law. Brown instead proposes a commission of unions, employers and government officials to look at the issue. "We do recognise the concerns that have been raised. We are also talking to employers' organisations about this and we continue to believe that a commission which reflects the views of all sides, with an independent chairman, would be the right way forward," Brown's spokesman told reporters after the talks. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said Brown had reassured unions. "The prime minister recognised the importance of the issue and the problems that many agency workers face," he said. "We need to consider very carefully the best mechanism to achieve this (progress)." Many of the estimated 1.4 million temporary and agency workers in Britain are migrants. They do not receive the same benefits, for example on sick and holiday pay, as permanent staff. Business groups have called the bill "ridiculous over-prescription" that would risk 250,000 jobs and would jeopardise labour market flexibility. A similar piece of EU legislation to level the playing field between agency and permanent workers has reached a stalemate in Brusse
