<TITLE> Asia stocks gain; AMBAC rescue talk helps </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian financial shares rallied on Monday, pushing up stocks and denting bonds across the region, with Tokyo's Nikkei up more than 2 percent, after talk of a rescue plan for a US bond insurer eased worries about the outlook of global credit markets. But US recession fears lingered, continuing to pressure the dollar against other major currencies, while geopolitical concerns in Iran and Turkey lifted oil prices towards $99 a barrel. Some analysts said the fate of bond insurers, and the implications on global credit markets, could keep stock gains in Asia short-lived after suffering double digit losses this year. "It's impossible to call an end to it," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. "First, it was subprime and then different investment banks and now it's insurers. It has to go all the way through the food chain probably." Financial firms such as South Korea's Woori Financial Group and Japan's Millea Holdings gained after news on Friday of a rescue plan for Ambac Financial sparked hopes the bond insurer will maintain its top credit ratings, averting sell-downs of the debt it has guaranteed. Lenders including Citigroup and UBS may announce a rescue for Ambac by Monday or Tuesday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The MSCI's index of Asian stocks excluding Japan rose 1.2 percent as of 0150 GMT, with stocks in Korea and Australia up around 1 percent each. Taiwanese shares gained over 2 percent. Japan's Nikkei rose more than 2 percent, with shares getting an additional boost on a British media report that China's sovereign wealth fund planned to buy as much as $10 billion in Japanese stocks and may also purchase a large stake in oil and gas developer Inpex Holdings Although Asian financial firms have so far avoided the extent of credit- and subprime-related writedowns at other U.S. and European lenders, markets as a whole have suffered from a lack of investor confidence that has spread worldwide. The prospects of a US recession have also hurt many stock markets in Asia, with the MSCI index of Asian equities excluding Japan down 11 percent this year as of last week. Australian asset manager Allco Finance Group Ltd slumped 61 percent on its return to trade following a two-week suspension when talk had swirled that the group was in sale talks and it had twice postponed its earnings announcement. Allco on Monday said it planned to sell non-core assets following a business restructure as it seeks to cut its debt to avoid high funding costs. It posted a 14 percent drop in first-half profit. US RECESSION WORRIES Bonds fell, with Japanese government bond figures slipping towards a two-month low as investors appeared more willing to add riskier assets to their portfolios. March 10-year futures fell 0.26 point to 137.23. But concerns linger, with the dollar remaining pressed against the euro, dogged by market expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates to avert a sharp slowdown in the world's largest economy. The euro stood at around $1.4826 to the dollar, down from a near three-week high of $1.4863 struck on Friday, while the Japanese yen was steady against the greenback. Oil prices rose nearly a dollar following Iran's warning on Sunday that more UN sanctions against it would be "costly" to Western powers, sparking talk the world's fourth-largest oil exporter would cut crude exports. The gains were also powered after Turkish troops engaged Kurdish PKK rebels in close combat on Sunday that left scores dead in a major ground offensive in northern Iraq. US crude futures were up 67 cents at $99.48 a barrel
