The earthquake, which struck at 1446 GMT, was 96 miles (154 km) southwest of Padang, Sumatra, and was centred at a depth of 21.7 miles (35 km), the USGS said. Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency said that authorities have issued no local tsunami warning. Indonesia suffers from frequent earthquakes. The archipelago lies on an area of intense seismic activity where a number of tectonic plates collide.
