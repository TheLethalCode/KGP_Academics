 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares eased on Wednesday, after results from British mortgage lender HBOS rekindled concern over funding for banks, while a rally in commodity prices helped energy and mining shares. HBOS, Britain's largest mortgage lender, was the largest-weighted drag on the broader market, falling by nearly 8 percent after posting a 3 percent rise in annual underlying profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. A rally in commodity prices on the back of the dollar's fall to record lows against the euro helped push up shares in BP and Total, as well as those of miners Rio Tinto and Anglo American By 0910 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,350.82 points. Shares in Asia and on Wall Street rallied overnight after IBM announced a share buyback plan and investors were reassured over the outlook for the top US bond insurers. "We have been in a bear market rally since January and this bear market rally should continue but we're under pressure from surrounding factors such as the falling dollar and oil at new all-time highs, that is limiting the upside momentum," said Commerzbank analyst Achim Matzke in Frankfurt. Banks were the worst performers on the index, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and BNP Paribas down between 1.7 and 3 percent. CONSTRUCTION DOWN The construction and materials sector also came under pressure after France's Bouygues, the telecoms and construction group, posted a 32 percent rise in full-year recurring net profit, but earnings fell shy of estimates. "The earnings were a bit below forecasts," said one Paris-based trader. Spain's Grupo Ferrovial fell 2.1 percent, paring some of Tuesday's 8.6 percent gain after its results, while France's Lafarge and Swiss group Holcim fell 1.5 to 1.8 percent. Holcim, the world's second-largest cement maker, posted an 84 percent rise in 2007 net profit, but some elements of the results disappointed investors. The rally in the oil price above $100 a barrel added to concern over price pressures a day after U.S. data showed an unwelcome pickup in wholesale inflation at a time when consumer confidence hit its lowest in five years. The FTSEurofirst 300 has fallen by 10 percent this year, largely because of the drop in financial shares as losses from last year's credit crunch have now run into billions of dollars and uncertainty grows over the outlook for the U.S. economy. "Yesterday saw another bad batch of US economic data with house prices and consumer confidence plunging while inflationary pressures, as indicated by the PPI report, continue to rise," said ING analysts in a note. "While financial markets largely shrugged off these developments, we suspect that the macroeconomic weakness will spread and are particularly worried about next week's ISM manufacturing index and predict another monthly fall in employment, which markets may have more difficulty to digest." Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks at 1500 GMT to testify on the central bank's semiannual monetary policy report before the House Financial Services Committee. Many expect Bernanke to echo comments from Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn on Tuesday who said the danger of the U.S. economy weakening further was of greater concern than higher inflation. Among the few gainers within the financial sector was British insurer Royal & Sun Alliance, which rallied about 1 percent after beating forecasts with its results. Other gainers included StatoilHydro, the Norwegian energy group, which missed expectations with its fourth-quarter results but benefited from the rally in oil prices. Its shares were up 3.5 percent, ranking it among the top gainers on the European mark
