 HONG KONG, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged China on Monday to honour its promise to allow direct elections in Hong Kong by 2017, while reiterating London's disappointment that universal suffrage could not come sooner. Speaking during a visit to the former British colony on the first leg of a six-day visit to China, Miliband said the goal of universal suffrage was an important one and would reinforce the business environment in the financial hub.
