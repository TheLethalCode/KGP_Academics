<TITLE> Kosovo PM warns Serbia off new state </TITLE>

 Pristina, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci warned Serbia on Tuesday to forget any notions of controlling parts of the new country. "We understand and respect peaceful reactions, guaranteed by the law, but we will not allow the territorial integrity of Kosovo to be compromised," Thaci, a former guerrilla commander, said. Kosovo's Albanian majority declared independence from Serbia with Western backing on Feb. 17. Serbs in the north reject the secession, fuelling fears the country is destined for partition. "I am constantly in contact with NATO to prevent anyone from touching even one inch of Kosovo's territory," Thaci told reporters in Racak. Serbs massacred Albanians in the village in 1999 before NATO went to war to drive out Serb forces. Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has pledged Serbia would continue to rule parts of Kosovo where "loyal citizens" looked to Belgrade for government. "Serbia will do everything to implement its jurisdiction and state prerogatives for all loyal citizens in Kosovo -- Serbs and non-Albanians," Kostunica said after meeting Russia's likely next president Dmitry Medvedev on Monday. Belgrade has promised to keep providing jobs, schooling and infrastructure for Serb areas of Kosovo. On Monday, dozens of Serb army reservists lobbed rocks and bottles at Kosovo police on Kosovo's eastern border, injuring 18 officers. DAILY PROTESTS Serbian Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic said Belgrade should stop servicing Kosovo's foreign debt following independence. "Under the circumstances, Serbian taxpayers' money will go to Albanians ... That's insane," he told a news conference at his party's headquarters. Since 1999 Serbia has continued to service Kosovo's debt at a cost of some $150 million a year as part of efforts to maintain its claim on the territory. The United States and major European Union powers have recognised Kosovo, nine years after going to war to save its 90-percent Albanian majority from ethnic cleansing by Serb forces trying to crush a guerrilla insurgency. Russia backs Serbia in its rejection of the secession and a deal to bring Serbia into Russia's South Stream gas pipeline project was a show of support for Belgrade, Medvedev said. Medvedev travelled to Belgrade on Monday to agree on a schedule for construction of the pipeline. The gas deal was intended to show "our support, moral, material and economic, for a state which is in a very difficult position, a state which unfortunately, by the will of a number of other states, has had its territorial integrity put in doubt," Medvedev said. Around 120,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, just under half in the north in a slice of land that runs adjacent to Serbia and where Serbs seem intent on cutting remaining ties with Pristina. NATO's 16,000-strong peace force has stepped up security in the region, particularly the flashpoint town of Mitrovica, where Serbs and Albanians are divided by the River Ibar. The force last week took control of two northern border crossings after they were burned down by Serb mobs. The EU, which is deploying a 2,000-strong police and justice mission to Kosovo, has withdrawn its small team from the Serb stronghold of north Mitrovica due to security concerns.
