<TITLE> First job as PM to clear Naples garbage:Berlusconi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi's first task if returned to power in April's election will be to clear piles of rubbish from the streets of Naples, the former Italian prime minister said on Wednesday. Berlusconi has blamed the centre left for allowing refuse to rot in Naples and says television pictures of the garbage have hurt Italy's image and business abroad. Opinion polls suggest the 71-year-old media tycoon, who lost to the centre-left in 2006, is poised to replace Romano Prodi, whose government collapsed last month. But Walter Veltroni of the centre left has cut Berlusconi's lead to about 7 percentage points from up to 12 a few weeks ago. Like Veltroni, Berlusconi promises to reduce the tax burden on ordinary Italians and put more police on the streets to fight crime. "But the top problem is the rubbish emergency in Naples: I am staying up at night working out how to solve it," the centre-right politician said in a radio interview. Worsened by political rows, mafia involvement and protests over new tips, the refuse problem dates back 14 years, much of which was covered by Berlusconi's time in office. Prodi's decisions to send in troops and name a "trash czar" failed and locals have burnt rubbish and built barricades to express their frustration. Naples fire services extinguished 20 rubbish fires overnight in city suburbs and near Mount Vesuvius. "NO POINT CAMPAIGNING" Naples's rubbish was not mentioned in Veltroni's policy platform presented on Monday, which focused on how to revitalise the economy, cut crime and reform the high-spending parliament. Berlusconi is due to announce his election platform this weekend but says Prodi's downfall made campaigning redundant. "After the failure of the Prodi government, it's pointless to campaign and I don't see how Italians could still have any faith in the left. But if they do let the left and Veltroni win, they will get what they deserve," Berlusconi told local radio. He wavers between saying he is "sure of a huge majority" and speculating about a "grand coalition" with Veltroni if he gets the kind of tiny margin that made Prodi's tenure so difficult. With polls showing Veltroni's Democratic Party (PD) gaining on Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL), talk is growing of a post-electoral pact. A poll by Demoskopea on Wednesday had the PDL's share slipping to 44 percent from 44.5, against 36.5 percent for the PD, a two-point gain. It now looks more like a four-way race on April 13-14 rather than a battle between two big, loose coalitions as in 2006. Both main parties have formed smaller and tighter new groupings, leaving their spurned partners to regroup in the centre and the left. "The truth is that only two political forces have a chance of winning and governing on their own: one is the People of Freedom, the other's the PD," said Berlusco
