<TITLE> Canada tells troops not to post Facebook info: CBC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ottawa, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canadian military chiefs have told soldiers not to post personal information on social networking sites such as Facebook because it could prompt attacks by groups such as Al Qaeda, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said on Tuesday. Canada currently has 2,500 troops stationed in southern Afghanistan, an area where the Taliban is strong. "Al Qaeda operatives are monitoring Facebook and other social networking sites," the CBC quoted an internal military memo saying. "This may seem over dramatic ... (but) the information can be used to target members for further exploitation. It also opens the door for your families and friends to become potential targets as well," it said. The memo advised soldiers not to appear in uniform online and not to reveal any military connections. A defense ministry spokeswoman could not immediately confirm the story.
