<TITLE> Funds firm Henderson profit up, sees tough 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British funds group Henderson posted a 30 percent rise in underlying 2007 operating profit, helped by increased fee income from inflows into higher margin products, which caused its shares to jump. The firm said on Wednesday operating profit from continuing operations, before tax and one-off items, was 106.7 million pounds ($209.7 million) last year, at the top end of its forecast. It was helped by net inflows of 1 billion pounds into higher-margin products, such as US wholesale funds, which helped push up its management fee income by 17 percent to 258 million pounds. Henderson Chief Executive Roger Yates told journalists the result was a vindication of its strategy of concentrating on products such as mutual funds, property and hedge funds, which carry more lucrative management fees. Yates said he expected markets to be tougher in 2008, but said the group is aiming to meet or beat the 2007 operating profit before tax of its main operating unit Henderson Global Investors (HGI), which made 109.6 million pounds. Henderson shares rose as much as 13.4 percent on the results news, boosted by a more generous dividend than the market was expecting and reassurance on its 2008 earnings, and were up 10.1 percent at 106 pence at 0905 GMT. "We had downgraded estimates in the wake of January's weak markets, and the new target is considerably better than our reduced expectations," Cazenove analysts said in a research note. EARNINGS FORECAST REASSURES The company said that while tougher markets this year meant it expected transaction and net performance fees of around 30 million pounds -- compared to 68 million pounds in 2007 -- it had earmarked cost savings of up to 30 million pounds to soften the blow. It set a final dividend of 6.1 pence, nearly double 2006's payout of 3.2 pence, and 17 percent ahead of analyst expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. It returned 250 million in cash to investors through a special dividend in October. The firm's cost-to-income ratio was 67.5 percent, ahead of the company's target of 70 percent, and the company forecasts it will fall below 65 percent this year. Assets under management fell to 59.2 billion pounds from 61.9 billion in 2006, largely as a result of the withdrawal of funds by closed-book life insurer Pearl. But it said its property funds were in good shape, despite a slump in confidence in the real estate sector. Of the 9.8 billion pounds it has invested in property, only 800 million is in open-ended funds. Of that figure, it has had redemption requests totalling 22 million pounds, Yates said. It has pipeline commitments of 2.3 billion pounds to invest further in property this year, Yates sa
