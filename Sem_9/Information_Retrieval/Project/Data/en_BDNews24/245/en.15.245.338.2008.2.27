 BEIJING, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China announced an invitation to Taiwan doctors and new economic sweeteners on Wednesday ahead of next month's presidential elections on the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since their split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has threatened to bring it back to fold, by force if necessary.

Chinese banks lent more than 230 billion yuan ($32.14 billion) in loans to Taiwan-invested firms on the mainland in 2007, said Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office.
