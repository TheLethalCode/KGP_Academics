<TITLE> World stocks off 3-week high after US PPI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks inched lower from an earlier three-week peak on Tuesday while government bond prices fell after US data showed January producer prices rose faster than expected, fuelling inflation concerns. U.S. producer prices jumped 1 percent in January, posting the biggest 12-month gain in more than 26 years, due to rising energy costs. Inflation concerns could slow the pace of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks keen to limit the effects of the credit crunch on the real economy. Interest rate futures have trimmed the chance for a March U.S. rate cut to 82 percent. "It is a bit troubling because this release indicates clear pipeline inflation pressures. That could limit the Fed easing to counteract the credit tightening," said Matthew Moore, economic strategist at Bank of America Securities in New York. U.S. stock futures erased earlier losses to stand down 0.4 percent, indicating a weaker open on Wall Street later. The FTSEurofirst 300 index eroded early gains to stand up 0.6 percent while the MSCI main world equity index was up 0.4 percent, after hitting its highest level since early February earlier in the day. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury prices fell 3/32 in price to yield 3.92 percent, compared with 3.90 percent shortly before the data. Euro zone government bond prices also fell, with the March Bund future hitting session lows. OPTIMISM Earlier stocks were bolstered by upbeat results from Standard Chartered and optimism on U.S. bond insurers which brightened investor morale. Asia-focused bank Stanchart reported a 27 percent rise in annual profit and said wholesale banking had a record January, easing concerns about the health of the banking sector hit by the six-month-old credit crisis. Also helping sentiment, Standard & Poor's removed on Monday its threat to downgrade insurer MBIA. A rescue plan for rival Ambac Financial is set to be announced soon. Investors have been spooked by the threat of credit downgrades of these "monoline" insurers due to their exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages. Downgrades of the monolines, which provide cover against defaults in securitised debt, could trigger a wave of forced selling in bonds and lead to more losses by banks. Stanchart shares were 7 percent higher. The iTraxx Crossover index, most-widely watched indicator of European credit market sentiment, tightened to 535 basis points. The index widened to record levels last week due to concerns about forced debt selling. The euro rose to a three-week high of $1.4888 after the German Ifo corporate sentiment survey headline index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, unexpectedly rose in February. Interest rate futures trimmed expectations for a euro zone rate cut by end-June to 1-in-4 from 1-in-3 before the data. INFLATION CONCERNS U.S. light crude fell 0.4 percent to $98.07 a barrel as expectations rose for higher crude stocks. Gold fell to $937.40 an ounce after the U.S. Treasury said it would support gold sales by the International Monetary Fund, which holds more than 3,000 tonnes of bullion. Platinum also tracked gold lower. A recent surge in commodity prices has fanned inflation concerns. A February survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed retailers expect to ramp up prices at the sharpest rate in more than a decade. "Inflation expectations remain critical and any significant deterioration on that front would be a trigger for financial market volatility," UBS said in a note to clients. "With market sentiment highly dependent on further Fed easing, upward inflation pressure would certainly put the Fed on the defensive." Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 2 basis points while emerging stocks rose 0.6 percent.
