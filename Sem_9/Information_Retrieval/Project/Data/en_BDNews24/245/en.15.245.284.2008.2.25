<TITLE> India's Ishant Sharma fined for verbal row with Symonds </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma has been fined over an incident with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds, prompting fears of another fallout between the feuding teams. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has again called on both sides to bury their differences and focus on playing the game after Sharma pleaded guilty to breaching the sport's code of conduct. The lanky paceman was fined 15 percent of his match fee from Sunday's tri-series one-day international in Sydney after he celebrated Symonds' dismissal by crudely pointing the batsmen to the dressing room in a heated exchange. Sharma was reported by the on-field officials Daryl Harper and Tony Hill as well as the third umpire Bruce Oxenford and charged with a level one offence. ICC match referee Jeff Crowe said Sharma's offence was a low-level breach but he wanted to remind both teams about their behaviour to prevent a repeat of their bitter row earlier in the Australian summer. LOWER END "The gesture was a direct breach of the ICC Code of Conduct," Crowe said in a statement. "I took into account the fact that Sharma may have been provoked and that this was his first offence and hence the penalty was at the lower end of the scale." Sharma was the fourth Indian player charged with breaching the code of conduct during the team's troubled tour of Australia despite repeated warnings from the ICC for both teams to improve their behaviour. Batsman Rohit Sharma was fined 10 percent of his match fee for dissent during his side's washed out tri-series match against Sri Lanka in Brisbane less than three weeks ago. Yuvraj Singh was also charged with dissent during the first test in Melbourne in December but escaped a penalty after the match referee accepted his explanation that he was "in shock", a ruling that was later criticised by the ICC. The most serious incident occurred in the second test in Sydney when spinner Harbhajan Singh was initially given a three-match ban for racially abusing Symonds. The penalty was later changed to a fine after the charges were downgraded to a lesser offence on appeal although the presiding judge said Harbhajan was lucky to escape a ban because the ICC had failed to inform him about all his previous offences
