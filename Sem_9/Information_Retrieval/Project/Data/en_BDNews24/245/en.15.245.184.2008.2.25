 New Delhi, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, now in New Delhi on a week-long visit, has received six horses as a friendly gesture from India. Moeen's visit is meant to revive bilateral defence and political ties and boost security cooperation between the two countries. Moeen was received by his Indian counterpart General Deepak Kapoor amid the traditional guard of honour Monday. "This will definitely enhance the relationship between the two offices in particular and in general of course between Bangladesh and India," Moeen said. General Kapoor presented Moeen two stallions and four mares. "We have very strong friendship ties with Bangladesh ever since its formation, so it's only a token and a gesture of friendship between our countries," Kapoor said. News agency ANI quoting official sources said Moeen and his Indian counterpart would discuss steps to combat corruption and terrorism, and the possibility of joint operations against insurgent groups.
