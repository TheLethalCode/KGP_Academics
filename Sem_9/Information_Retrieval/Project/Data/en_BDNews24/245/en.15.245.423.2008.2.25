 PARIS, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Political allies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy rushed to his defence on Monday after he came under fierce attack for insulting a critical bystander at the annual Paris agriculture fair. Sarkozy, who is in freefall in the opinion polls, triggered the umpteenth uproar of his nine-month presidency at the weekend when he snapped at a man in the crowd who had refused to shake his hand. "You soil me when you touch me," the anonymous man says on a video of the clash that spread quickly on the internet. "Then get lost, pauvre con," Sarkozy replies, using a strong insult which roughly translates as "pathetic arsehole" and literally refers to female genitalia -- the sort of language that could spark a bar room brawl in certain neighbourhoods. Opposition politicians and the French media joined forces on Monday to denounce Sarkozy, saying that as head of state he should be setting a better example to the nation. But ministers said the insult should not be blown out of proportion. "He spoke man to man, that's all. You shouldn't be surprised about this," Agriculture Minister Michel Barnier told Europe 1 radio. "The president is a spontaneous man, direct and quite modern in his behaviour." Higher Education Minister Valerie Pecresse said it was a fleeting moment that should not be taken out of context. "It was an act of irritation in a crush of people and should not fuel any controversy," she told Canal Plus television. "VULGAR" But commentators said the insult sat uneasily with calls by Sarkozy for greater civility in French society. "The head of state is presenting an image of himself as irritable and vulgar, light years from the 'dignity' and 'respect' that he calls for," regional daily Le Republicain Lorrain wrote in an editorial on Monday. Sarkozy has much to be irritable about, following a series of disastrous polls that have seen his popularity plunge to a low of 36 percent in February, down 19 points in just 3 months. For months he has been dogged by a string of scandals and rows over his personal life, foreign policy issues, religious affairs, and tough law and order measures, among others. The worrying thing for the president is that there has not been any major political crisis during this period, just a rapid disenchantment over his style of government and a feeling that he has not delivered on his electoral promises. Even more remarkably, his slide has coincided with a period of disarray in the opposition Socialist camp, which has failed to digest its twin presidential and parliamentary ballot defeats last year and has no obvious leader. Allies have urged Sarkozy lower his profile and try to avoid the controversies that have lately dogged his every move. "It is no longer necessary ... to create a happening every day," Sarkozy's political mentor and former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wrote in Le Monde daily last week. "He will know how to modify his style," he added. But Sarkozy has shown no sign of a change of heart, packing his diary with meetings, and not shying from confrontation. "Sarkozy settles into unpopularity," Le Monde said on its front page headline on Mond
