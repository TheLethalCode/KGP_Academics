 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Monday that they did not want the elections to take place in a haphazard way. "We don't want the election schedule to cross December in order to formulate the most perfect voter list, but we don't want to bring the schedule two or three months ahead either," Huda said at the EC Secretariat. "We are working in line with the roadmap," he said during the EC's second round of talks with the Communist Party of Bangladesh.. The commission will publish the draft voter list by June and it is determined to keep its vow to hold elections by December, the chief commissioner said. "We want to reinforce the election schedule. We were supposed to conclude the reforms of electoral laws by March. We are certainly sincere about it, but it is being postponed for various reasons." CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim raised a number of proposals on electoral reforms including disallowing registration of parties backed by anti-liberation forces, keeping campaign expenses within Tk 3 lakh, increasing reserved seats for women and holding direct elections for these seats, relaxing the registration conditions of political parties and preparing voter lists according to the CHT accord. Selim said: "Jamaat-e-Islami surrendered to the freedom fighters as an allied group of the Pakistan army. Considering their history they should be declared unfit for contesting in the polls." He also demanded resumption of indoor politics and lifting of the ban on politics. "The caretaker government should reinstate people's civil and democratic rights." Election commissioners M Sakhawat Hossain and Muhammad Sohul Hussain were also present during the dialogue. The commission is also sitting with Awami League and Jatiya Party (Ershad) on Monday. The second round of electoral reforms dialogues began on Feb 24. bdnews24.co
