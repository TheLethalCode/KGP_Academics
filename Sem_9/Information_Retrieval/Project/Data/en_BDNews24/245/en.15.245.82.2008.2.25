 Islamabad, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed the Pakistani army's top medical officer and seven others in the city of Rawalpindi on Monday in the first bomb attack outside the violence-plagued northwest since last week's elections. The chief of the army's medical corps, Lieutenant-General Mushtaq Ahmed Baig, was the most senior military officer killed by militants to date. He died with two of his staff and five passers-by a week after largely peaceful parliamentary elections raised hopes that a civilian government might be able to stem a rising tide of militant violence. "The general was on his way home and his car was stopped at a traffic light. The bomber was on foot and blew himself up there," said Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema. He said the bomber was about 16 years old and also killed five civilians and wounded 12 others. The Pakistan military headquarters is in Rawalpindi, adjacent to the capital, Islamabad, and several major attacks on the military and security agencies have taken place there since the middle of last year. Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and more than 20 of her supporters were killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack as she left a rally in the city on Dec. 27. Monday's blast was outside an office of the government's national data registration agency, on a main road crowded with mid-afternoon traffic. "I can see pieces of flesh littering the road and four damaged vehicles," a witness said, adding police and troops cordoned off the site of the attack. AID AGENCY ATTACKED Pakistan has been hit by a wave of bomb and suicide attacks since troops stormed a radical mosque complex in the capital, Islamabad, last July. Former army chief, President Pervez Musharraf, has blamed the attacks on al Qaeda-linked militants based in remote mountains on the Afghan border and says they are intent on destabilising the country. Musharraf has stressed the importance of keeping up the fight against the militants and the United States and other Western allies are trying to help the Pakistani military in its battle. But many Pakistanis, while opposed to militant violence, do not agree with Washington's links and hope a new civilian government will reassess Pakistan's alliance with the United States. A spokesman for the militants on Sunday warned any incoming civilian government that they would strike even more viciously if they continued Musharraf's campaign in tribal areas on the Afghan border. In a separate incident, unidentified attackers fired shots and threw a grenade into an office of a foreign aid agency, Plan International, in the northwest town of Mansehra, killing four people and wounding nine in the attack and a blaze that resulted, officials said. "We received four dead bodies, out of which three were totally burnt," Niaz Mohammad, a senior medical officer at main district hospital. The dead and injured were all Pakistanis, he said.
