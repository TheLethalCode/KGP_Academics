<TITLE> Inventory surge portends sharp slowdown in UK growth </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Consumer spending faltered at the end of last year and inventories surged, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting Britain's economy will slow sharply this year. The Office for National Statistics confirmed Britain's economy grew by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, leaving the annual rate at 2.9 percent. But a breakdown of the data cast the figures in a less favourable light. Household spending growth ground to a virtual standstill and inventories shot up at the fastest rate in 20 years. "The second estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product revealed that the strength of the economy towards the end of last year was built on some shaky foundations," said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. "It is unlikely to be long before it becomes clear that the UK has entered its weakest period of growth since it left the Exchange Rate Mechanism 15 years ago." Most economists expect Britain's economy to grow by just 1.8 percent this year as the global credit crunch takes its toll on consumers and businesses. The last time the economy grew by less than this was in 1992 when Britain was emerging from a painful recession. The Bank of England has cut interest rates twice since December to shore up the economy and is expected to cut them again by the middle of the year. However, it has signalled aggressive rate cuts are not on the cards as inflation is still a worry. CONSUMER CONCERNS Analysts said the slowdown in consumer spending, the powerhouse of the economy in recent years, was particularly worrying. Household spending growth slowed to 0.2 percent, its weakest rate in over a year and less than a quarter of its rate in the preceding three months. Service sector growth was also revised down with December's performance particularly disappointing. "This report offers further evidence that the domestic economy is weakening markedly," said James Knightley at ING. "We suspect this process will continue through the year as falling house prices, the credit crunch and a weaker global backdrop weigh on sentiment and activity." The rise in inventory levels may also raise fears of a drag in growth this year. Inventory levels jumped by 3.1 billion pounds on the quarter, the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 1988, contributing about 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth. Inventories for 2007 as a whole were up by their biggest amount since 1973. "The scale of the rise in inventories poses a downside risk to growth in 2008 because stockbuilding is unlikely to increase even further," said Michael Saunders, an economist at Citigroup. "Swings in inventories -- a late cycle involuntary rise and then a crunch in the economy as inventories are cut back -- are a classic part of business cycle downturn
