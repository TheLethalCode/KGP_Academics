 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)The advisory council approved a new proposal Sunday for launching the direct passenger train services between Dhaka and Kolkata. Bangladesh hopes the new proposal, which will be sent to India for approval, can resolve the previous disagreement over fencing along the borders of the two countries. "With the approval of the new clause (in the agreement), we hope that the disagreement over the fencing issue will be resolved and the train services can be launched soon," Syed Fahim Munaim, the chief adviser's press secretary, told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, chaired by Fakhruddin Ahmed. According to the new proposal, both Bangladesh and India "may construct box-type temporary fencing from zero point along the rail tracks of their respective territories" to ensure the security of passengers and the train services. The design of the box-type fencing will be approved "on mutually agreed drawing" by both countries, according to the new proposal. The new clause, however, guarantees that such fencing will "not be used or quoted as reference for any other situation of similar matters or other purposes including strategic or defence". During bilateral talks in Dhaka on July 9 last year, India proposed the construction of fencing along the borders to protect passengers and the train service from terrorist attacks. India said the trains should pass through a box-type fence while crossing the border. But Bangladesh opposed the proposal saying it was against the border agreement between the two countries. At a second bilateral meeting on July 30 in Kolkata, Bangladesh and India could not overcome the difference of opinion over fencing. The Bangladesh delegation said if such fencing was allowed, India would construct fencing along its borders with Bangladesh flouting the agreement. bdnews2
