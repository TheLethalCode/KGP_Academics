 Nairobi, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's finance minister maintained the government's 7 percent GDP growth projection for 2008 and said on Tuesday that any drop would not be significant, despite post-election violence that has hit some key sectors. "We are still looking at the figures that are coming up and even if we were to revise the projected growth, it will not be as much as some people would want," Finance Minister Amos Kimunya told reporters. "I am still very hopeful that once we get through these current issues that we have, we should be able to maintain our 7 percent (for 2008), 8 percent for next year and 10 percent for 2012," he said, adding that tax collections were still strong. Some analysts have said growth in 2008 would be only about half the estimated 6.9 percent the economy expanded by last year, due to the devastating effects of rioting and ethnic clashes that followed a disputed Dec. 27 presidential election. Key sectors such as tourism, agriculture and transportation were hit hardest. Kimunya said the shilling was strengthening because the market realised the fundamentals were in the unit's favour. "The shilling is getting back its strength ... I think the speculators realised they can't gain on speculation. It has stabilised, all the fundamentals are right." The unit has clawed back losses from near a three-year low in January, but dealers say the market is watching mediation talks aimed at ending the political stalemate between President Mwai Kibaki and his opponent Raila Odinga. Kibaki was announced winner of the poll, triggering riots and ethnic clashes that killed at least 1,000 people. Kimunya said the stock market, whose price index had dropped by more than 10 percent, was also recovering. The bourse's chairman Jimnah Mbaru said on Monday that the stock exchange's performance was recovering after mediation talks seemed to be headed towards a resolution. "Our stock exchange has stabilised and it is fine. We are not going to collapse," Kimunya said. The talks headed by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan however appeared to hit a stalemate on Monday.
