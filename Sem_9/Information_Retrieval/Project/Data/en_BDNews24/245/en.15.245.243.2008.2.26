<TITLE> Europe shares pare gains after US inflation data </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares pared some of their gains on Tuesday after US wholesale inflation picked up by more than expected in January, tempering expectations for more aggressive rate cuts at a time of slowing economic growth. By 1333 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.8 percent at 1,352.38 points, compared with 1,355.96 points just before the data. The U.S. government said core producer prices, which exclude energy and food costs, rose by 0.4 percent, above expectations for a 0.2 percent rise. In Europe, financial stocks were still the main gainers, after results from Standard Chartered and receding concern about the creditworthiness of the top two U.S. bond insurers. U.S. stock futures were down around 0.4 percent, having been roughly flat on the day before the data.
