<TITLE> Energy protectionists question M Tamim's leadership </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)A group of economists has doubted the chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim's leadership in energy affairs and alleged that his past activities in the sector were controversial. The so-called "Citizen's Commission for Gas-Oil-Coal" of the Bangladesh Economic Association released a written statement on the situation of coal from a press conference Wednesday. Part of the statement brands Tamim as one of the past advocates for exporting gas from the country's proven reserves. "Now Dr M Tamim talks about a gas crisis, which leaves question marks on his leadership," the statement says. The statement alleges that the probe committee on the Chhatak gasfield disaster, headed by Tamim, had 'undervalued' the losses. The press conference was meant to reveal some details of the latest draft of a coal policy submitted to the government by a committee led by former BUET VC Professor Abdul Matin Patwary. The "citizen's commission" asked the government to make the draft of the policy public as it involves national interests and "people have the right to know". "We think the undated draft copy is the latest and our observations are based on it," said BEA president Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, long opponent of the idea of gas exports. His outfit critisised the draft's suggestion to use 'open pit mining', which the campaigners said was not suitable for a densely populated country such as Bangladesh. They appreciated the draft's proposal not to export coal and backed a plan to set up a holding company for coal. BEA recommended effective infrastructure, adequate powers and human resources for the company named "Coalbangla" and for the Geological Survey of Bangladesh so that the twin organisations could perform effectively. The outfit of the economistssome of them popularwarned that "Coalbangla" must not be formed in collaboration with foreign organisations as it would fail to protect national interests. BEA said public opinion was needed prior to formulating the government's Model Production Sharing Contract 2008, which guided international tenders for offshore oil-gas explorations. Asked how local investors can be brought into the energy sector, the BEA president said that if the organisations such as Petrobangla and proposed Coalbangla can perform well it would encourage local investors. "They (local investors) need a platform to come into the sector which can be only possible if the government agencies do well in the industry," he said. Among the other members of the "commission", Dr Abul Barakat, Professor Syed Abdul Hai was also present at the press conference. bdn
