 Dhaka, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday praised the role of the scout movement in moulding the nations youth while distributing the Shapla Cub Award to 81 deserving cub scouts at his office. "The role of the scout movement is very important in making children and young adults honest, confident and ideal citizens," he said after awarding the highest accolade in cub scouting. Fakhruddin said emphasis had to be placed on educating the youth in modern information and communication technology, as well as learning international languages. "We need cosmopolitan citizens who are ideal, righteous and generous," the chief adviser said adding that the world scout movement could play a role in this regard. "The cub scout movement can also play a significant role in building a good nation, for that we have extended our assistance to reinforce the movement, and we will continue our support in the future." He said the education ministry's cub scout extension project had created cub groups in most government and private schools across the country." There are about one lakh scouts throughout Bangladesh at present. "We will now ask all primary schools to form these groups to help children become self sufficient," he said. "Youngsters are at risk from cyber-crime, drug addiction and many other serious crimes that negatively impact them. It is essential to rid ourselves of these elements," Fakhruddin said. Congratulating the young award-winners, Fakhruddin said: "I am happy with your great success. The award is the result of hard labour, determination and rigorous exercise." "I hope this achievement will help you succeed in working life and you will spread your learning to others," he told the youngsters. He lauded the scout movement for their relentless efforts during natural disasters of the country, referring to their most recent activities during last year's floods and cyclone. Fakhruddin called on the country's scout leaders to extend the activities so that the scouting movement can be transformed into a social movement for a prosperous Bangladesh. bdnews24.c
