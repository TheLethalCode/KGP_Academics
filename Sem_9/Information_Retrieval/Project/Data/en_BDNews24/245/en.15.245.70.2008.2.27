<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Russia ambassador to Bangladesh said Wednesday that his country was interested in investing in a subway system for Dhaka. Ambassador Gennady Trotsenko told communications adviser Ghulam Quader that Russia would also like to provide technical assistance in the construction of the subway for the capital city. Trotsenko told reporters after the meeting that he had met the communications adviser at his office to discuss bilateral issues. He said Russia had extensive experience in manufacturing and operating subway systems in its own cities, and wanted to assist Bangladesh in the proposed mass transit project for Dhaka. The envoy said Russia was also interested in investing in a number of other sectors including modernising the transport system throughout the country and building and running power plants. "Power plants in Bangladesh face diverse difficulties that cause power disruptions much of the time, but there is no such problem in Russia," the ambassador said. The communications adviser said many countries and donor agencies had shown an interest in providing financial and technical assistance to the capital's subway project. Donor agencies are satisfied with Bangladesh because it repays its loans on time, Ghulam Quader said. "We have also received proposals from non-resident Bangladeshis," he said. "We have prepared project proposals and are now looking for consultants," the adviser added. bdnews24
