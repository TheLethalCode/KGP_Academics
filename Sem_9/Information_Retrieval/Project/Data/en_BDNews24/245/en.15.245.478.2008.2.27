<TITLE> Khmer Rouge chief torturer weeps for 14,000 victims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Phnom Penh, Feb 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief Khmer Rouge torturer on Wednesday led judges who will try him for crimes against humanity around the jail where about 14,000 presumed opponents of the ruthless revolutionaries were killed under his supervision. Reporters were kept well away from the Tuol Sleng high school which became the Khmer Rouge "S-21" jail, but the judges and other officials of the UN-backed tribunal due to try Pol Pot's chief henchmen probably blanched at the sight. Now a museum, photographs of terrified prisoners taken on their arrival cover walls. Concrete floored rooms contain only a bare iron bedstead and torture equipment. Some still have dried blood on the floor. Men, women, children and even a few foreigners accused of being CIA spies went into the jail. They were tortured and forced to write confession after confession -- most still carefully catalogued -- until jailers were satisfied. Nearly all were then killed. Only a handful survived until an invading Vietnamese army took the city in January 1979, ending the Khmer Rouge "Year Zero" revolution to produce an agrarian utopia. An estimated 1.7 million people were killed or died through overwork, starvation and disease during their four years in power and the tour of the jail was meant to give tribunal officials a sense of what went on there. A film crew working for the tribunal, due to start actual trials in July, filmed Kaing Guek Eav, 66, known as Duch, as he told the story of the jail he ran for the Khmer Rouge regime, keeping meticulous records, witnesses said. "He cried again as he walked into his old office. It seems he has remorse for his past life," a police officer who accompanied Duch said. On Tuesday, Duch wept and prayed for the victims as led the tribunal staff to some of the 129 mass graves of people killed by the Khmer Rouge just outside Phnom Penh. "I saw Duch kneel in front of the trees where Khmer Rouge soldiers smashed children to death," said a policeman who watched. "He cried and apologized to the victims." Duch, detained in 1999 and now a Christian, is expected to be a key witness in the trials. His lawyers say he was only following orders. The others arrested and charged with crimes against humanity are "Brother Number Two" Nuon Chea, right hand man to Pol Pot who died in 1998, Khieu Samphan, president under the regime, Ieng Sary, its foreign minister, and his wife. All face life in jail. Many Cambodians want to hear what Duch will have to say in court. "I still do not understand why Duch jailed me, killed my wife and our baby," said Chum Manh, 78, one of the few survivors of Tuol Sle
