<TITLE> Wicket behavior rules post-Test briefing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)  The mood of the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium wicket was the main discussion point at the post-match briefing Monday after Bangladesh went five wickets down to South Africa in the morning of the fourth day at Mirpur. Both skippers criticised the nature of the wicket that produced an uneven bounce and the match eventually finished in the first hour of the fourth day. South Africa skipper Graeme Smith said they worked hard to get used to the wicket that was a little different compared to the subcontinent wickets. "I think probably the nature of the wicket was a little bit tougher than the other subcontinent wickets and the lack of bounces and pace, something we took some time to get used to," said Smith at the briefing. "It is good to see the way the guys played in the second innings... especially after coming out to chase more than 200 runs," said the Proteas skipper. On the other hand, Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful seemed a bit unhappy for not having got the expected wicket. "Frankly, we didn't get the wicket that we wanted in the home ground as it behaved totally differently in the first two days," said Ashraful. Bangladesh's intention was to restrict the visitors on the slow and low wicket, always a Proteas problem in the subcontinent and it was believed that the wicket for the first test was made keeping those things in mind. The fact is that the pacers from both sides claimed 27 wickets out of the 35 that fell in four innings. Smith warned that Bangladesh would face a tough challenge from the major cricket teams outside the subcontinent if they continue to play on such a wicket at home. "I think the challenge for the Bangladesh team is they are going to play on wickets around the world. "Their batsmen have to keep improving. For their benefit, they have to play on a wicket that is conducive to what we get pretty much around the world. "That is very different from what we got in Pakistan, we got South Africa, Australia, even India. I think they have to get a look at this fact of the game." Smith also did not hesitate to praise the Bangladesh boys for the way they played on the first two days. "Bangladesh played really good cricket in the first two days. To be fair, I think the fast bowlers bowled really well. Shahadat used the conditions well with getting the reverse swing, which made it tough. I also think Rafique really did a good job in the first innings containing one end that made it difficult for us to score." Bangladesh's skipper Mohammad Ashraful believes the result could have been different had they put on 100 more runs on the board in the first innings. Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said, "That's exactly the same wicket we were trying to get for weeks. Unfortunately, it did not spin as much we would have liked. It would have been nice if we had got a chance to bowl here on the fifth day. Siddons, however, thinks the boys have to toil hard to get the opponents' wickets in the second test in Chittagong. "I think South African batsmen adjusted in the second innings very well and we have to work hard in Chittagong to get their wicket; it will be a lot harder than what we did in this Test."
