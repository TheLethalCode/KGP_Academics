 Mymensingh, Feb 25 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Monday that the caretaker administration is ready to hold the national polls by December, in line with the Election Commission's roadmap. "There should not be any doubt or worries about that," Fakhruddin told a discussion meeting in Mymensingh. The chief adviser said it was necessary to be aware that commodity prices are increasing internationally, and how that affects domestic costs. Fakhruddin said the effect of price hikes was felt most acutely by the poorer segments of society, but the caretaker government was taking a number of measures to alleviate the problem. The chief adviser said his administration had taken up initiatives such as open market sales for essentials, fair price shops run by the Bangladesh Rifles and allocations for Vulnerable Group Feeding programmes. "Around 58 lakh marginalised people have so far been given access to VGF benefits," Fakhruddin said. The CA said the caretaker government had attached importance to the agricultural sector, which would "help ease commodity price spirals in the short and long-run". Fakhruddin added that the administration was heavily subsidising fertiliser production and sales to ensure a record boro harvest in 2008. bdnews24.c
