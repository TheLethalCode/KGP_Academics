<TITLE> Russia rebuffs US over Georgia mediation: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia will reject moves by the United States to play a bigger role in defusing a standoff with Georgia, Interfax news agency quoted a Russian diplomatic source as saying on Friday. "We don't see any reason for anyone's mediation in settling relations," the agency quoted the unidentified diplomatic source as saying. "We have direct dialogue with Georgia and contacts are continuing," the source said. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on a visit to US ally Georgia on Thursday, called for a more intensive international effort to resolve a conflict over Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia both broke away from Tbilisi's rule in wars in the 1990s. They have become the focus of escalating tension between Tbilisi and Moscow and some Western diplomats say they fear more violence in the regions. Georgia, a former Soviet republic which wants to join NATO, says Russia is trying to annex the regions. Russia says Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili wants to use force to bring the regions -- which are supported by Moscow -- back under Tbilisi's rule. Tbilisi recalled its ambassador from Moscow on Thursday after Russia said it had sent fighter jets into Georgia's airspace to prevent Georgian troops attacking South Ossetia, a tiny sliver of land in the Caucasus mountains. Rice said the informal "Friends of the Secretary-General on Georgia group," which includes Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, should meet at foreign ministry political director level or higher to find a solution. U.S. officials traveling with Rice said such a meeting could be held within a month and said they wanted senior Georgian and Abkhaz officials to take part. The officials, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said a ministerial meeting, again including Georgians and Abkhaz representatives, could be held in New York later this year around the time of the UN General Assembly. "We need to elevate the issue," Rice said. "This is a serious situation." Rice also said Russia should help ease tensions over the separatist regions, not contribute to it. Washington says Moscow's decision in April to establish semi-official ties with the separatists had stoked tensions. "Russia will not cancel its decision on Abkhazia and South Ossetia," Interfax quoted the Moscow diplomatic source as saying. European Union diplomats have urged calm in the rebel regions but say the EU does not want a showdown with Moscow over Georgia, whose image was tarnished last year when Saakshvili sent in riot police to crush an opposition rally
