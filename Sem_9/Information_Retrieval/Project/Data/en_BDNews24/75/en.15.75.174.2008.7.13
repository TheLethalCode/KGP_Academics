<TITLE> Olmert accuses Israeli police of probe leak </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Avida Landau and Dan Williams LOD, Israel, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert accused Israeli police on Saturday of leaking parts of a newly-revealed investigation into whether he committed fraud by submitting duplicate travel expense claims. "The reports and the leaks that emerged a short time after the questioning constitute a grave breach of acceptable norms," Olmert told reporters on board a plane as he was about to embark for a Mediterranean Union summit in Paris. "I was amazed by those distorted statements coming from members of law enforcement apparatus ... This could only harm the public's trust," Olmert said. He also condemned police for "the attempt to connect my family in any way," to the case. On Friday, police said they suspected Olmert's travel agent sent invoices to various public bodies to cover Olmert's trips when he was mayor of Jerusalem and then trade minister. The result was a duplication of incoming funds, with the surplus being placed in an account used to fund Olmert and his family's private travel. Olmert's attorney Navot Tel-Zur denied his client used public money to cover his family's travel expenses and said Olmert rejected the allegations "with both hands". Earlier, a long-time Olmert aide who managed his travel, defended him against the accusation. "The prime minister is not a thief and not a cheat," Rachel Risby-Raz said in a written statement a day after Olmert was quizzed by police -- his third interrogation since being accused of corruption in May.
