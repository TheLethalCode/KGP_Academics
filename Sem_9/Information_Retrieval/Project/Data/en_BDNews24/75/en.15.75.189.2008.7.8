 MUMBAI, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leading India batsman Sachin Tendulkar will return from injury in the three-test series against Sri Lanka, while wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will sit out the first part of the tour due to fatigue. Selectors named a 16-member test squad on Tuesday that was missing limited-overs skipper and test vice-captain Dhoni, who indicated he would like to take a break from the sport after India's loss to Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final in Pakistan. The 27-year-old is expected to return for the five one-dayers that follow the test series starting in Colombo on July 23. Tendulkar, who has suffered a number of niggling injuries in recent years, has been out of international cricket since he suffered a groin problem in the first home test against South Africa in March. The selectors have also recalled off spinner Harbhajan Singh after he missed the last two one-day series due to a ban for slapping national team mate Shanthakumaran Sreesanth during a domestic Twenty20 game. Sreesanth, however, was overlooked due to a side strain but India were boosted by the return of experienced left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan, who had been sidelined since suffering an ankle injury during the first test in Australia last December. Some key changes have also been made to the middle and lower order with Yuvraj Singh and all rounder Irfan Pathan omitted for two players yet to win caps at test level. Rohit Sharma was included after the 21-year-old middle-order batsman won rich praise for his consistency in limited-overs cricket and left-armer Pragyan Ojha was included as a back-up spinner to skipper Anil Kumble and Harbhajan. The tests will be played in Colombo (July 23-27), Galle (July 31-Aug 4) and Colombo (Aug 8-12). Squad: Anil Kumble (captain), Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Vangipurappu Laxman, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Munaf Patel, Rohit Sharma, Dinesh Karthik, Pragyan Ojha, Parthiv Patel
