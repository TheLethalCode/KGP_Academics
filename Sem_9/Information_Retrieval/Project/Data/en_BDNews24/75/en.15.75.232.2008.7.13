<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  It was wrong on the part of the caretaker government to allow advisers to hold a meeting at the home of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina after her release on June 11, said Krishak Sramik Janata League president Abdul Kader Siddiqui on Sunday. "The advisers did not do right to go to her home as 'government officials' after releasing her from jail," Siddiqui told reporters after his party's political dialogue session with the government at the chief adviser's office. The government granted Hasina a temporary release to go abroad to seek medical treatment. Advisers went to her private residence the night of her release from detention. "It was not rational. [The meeting] raised doubts among people," Siddiqui said. The government has replied the advisers went there in line with their political duty for the greater interests of the country. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said after the dialogue Sunday: "The advisers are not just 'government officials'. We went there in line with greater political responsibilities." "We are pressing forward with all political parties with a view to heading towards a proper political environment," he said. "We will do whatever is needed for that. We are hopeful that all our activities will erase any doubts in future." "All doubts will disappear in the course of time," the adviser repeated. Siddiqui, however, stressed: "There was no problem if the advisers went to her house as private individuals and with an honest intention." "But we have to see whether they will do the same in future at the invitation of any other parties." "If they do not, it will be unfortunate," he said. The KSJL president added, nevertheless, that the government deserved credit for the humanitarian decision to allow Hasina abroad by temporary release. He also said his party's dialogue had taken place with the government in a genial environment. The party had placed a 28-point charter of proposals in the session, including trial of war criminals, an embargo on the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami, lifting the state of emergency, and return of the armed forces to barracks as early as possible. Siddiqui led an 11-member KSJL delegation, while chief adviser led the government side with commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal. The government will hold two regional level dialogues in Khulna and Jessore on Monday, said Hossaiin Zillur. bdnews24.
