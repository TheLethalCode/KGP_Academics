 KABUL, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 17 civilians, most of them children, and four police in a bazaar in southern Afghanistan on Sunday, police said. Taliban suicide bombs have killed more than 230 civilians and wounded nearly 500 already this year, NATO says. Afghan and foreign forces are stopping a greater proportion of the attacks but the Taliban are attempting many more suicide bombings this year compared to last, security experts say. In the latest attack the bomber, traveling on a motorcycle, targeted a police vehicle in a bazaar in the Deh Rawood district of Uruzgan province, the provincial police chief told Reuters. "Seventeen civilians and four policemen died in the attack. Thirty-seven more civilians and five police have been wounded," Juma Khan Himat said by telephone, adding the death toll could rise. Most of the civilian victims were children, he said. Afghanistan is suffering from a rising tide of violence this year, with a sharp increase in Taliban attacks, especially in the east where NATO says militants have taken advantage of peace deals in Pakistan to cross the border and fight in Afghanistan. The Interior Ministry in Kabul said 24 people, four of them police, including a senior officer, were killed in the attack. Growing insecurity has added to the rising frustration of many Afghans more than six years after U.S.-led and Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban government after it refused to hand over al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 attacks on the United States. The violence comes despite the increased presence of foreign forces, currently numbering more than 70,000. Top Taliban as well as al Qaeda leaders are still at large. The violence prompted some Western politicians to warn early this year that the country may slide back into anarchy. DOZENS OF MILITANTS KILLED Afghan and foreign troops now clash daily with militants who have some sanctuary in the lawless tribal regions of Pakistan. Five Pakistani Taliban were killed and 13 more wounded in clashes after they infiltrated a remote district in northeastern Nuristan province on Saturday, Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashari said. The fighting continued on Sunday and locals helped police defend the district, he said. The Defence Ministry said dozens of insurgents were killed and dozens more wounded in a counter-attack by the Afghan army in Nuristan on Sunday. It said only four soldiers were wounded when the insurgents attacked army positions. NATO said its soldiers and Afghan forces were locked in heavy fighting against militants in neighboring Kunar. There were casualties on both sides, the alliance said in a statement, without elaborating. Separately on Sunday, a roadside bomb killed a soldier from the U.S.-led coalition in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said in a statement. The soldier was killed when his vehicle struck the device as insurgents attacked a joint patrol of Afghan and coalition forces. At least 40 militants were killed as Afghan and coalition troops returned fire and called in airstrikes. The Taliban could not be immediately reached for comment about any of the reported incidents.
