<TITLE> Dollar slides on latest credit crisis fear </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, July 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fear that the two largest US mortgage finance companies are in such poor health that they need a government bailout pushed financial markets and the dollar lower on Friday, although stocks pared losses as officials began to talk of safety-net moves for the ailing sector. In a wild trading day fueled by speculation of whether the US government will rescue troubled housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, equity markets sagged, slumped and staged a short-lived rally on hopes a resolution was near. But the weight of a credit crisis that has slowed world growth and threatened to push the US economy into recession since a housing slump began more than a year ago reminded investors more pain than relief in the short term lay ahead. Contributing to the pessimism was a $5 jump in oil prices to a new record above $147 a barrel on lingering worries over Iran's nuclear aspirations and a potential strike by Brazilian oil workers next week. In fact, oil's rally could run further if Fannie and Freddie's troubles feed into the commodities boom by reducing the chances of a US interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Investors fear a protracted financial crisis would hit the already weak US economy and markets. The US stock market, bonds and the dollar all fell, with equities hit the hardest. The blue-chip Dow at one point fell below 11,000 for the first time since July 2006. The Dow and broad market S&P 500 both closed down more than 1 percent. Fears that Fannie and Freddie could require massive capital infusions also rattled investors in Europe where an index for the top 300 European shares closed at three-year lows and is now down 25 percent so far this year. Gnawing at investor unease was a New York Times report that said the US government was considering a takeover of Fannie and Freddie that could trim or eliminate the value of the mortgage companies' stock. "The bottom line is that we're in the middle of a financial tsunami. This is a storm the likes of which this country hasn't seen," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. Wall Street opened weak and extended its losses after US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said his department's chief aim is to back Fannie and Freddie in their "current form" -- comments that failed to soothe investor concerns. The two government-sponsored entities, which hold more than $5 trillion in mortgage assets and were established to finance home ownership, are pillars of the US economy. US Treasury prices slipped on fears a bailout would require a massive capital infusion and flood markets with more government debt. Yet the bonds of the two finance companies soared as investors bet the government would back their debt. Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the Fed and the Treasury Department are considering opening the discount window to the two companies. "Both the Fed and the Treasury are looking at various options ... like the discount window," the Connecticut Democrat said. The stock of the two companies fell to 50 percent of their day-earlier levels, but then cut their losses in half after Paulson played down the likelihood of a near-term bailout. Fannie closed down 22 percent and Freddie just 3 percent after a source told Reuters that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Freddie's chairman and chief executive his company and Fannie could obtain emergency funding. The Fed later said it had not discussed access to its discount window with either Fannie or Freddie. Some investors held out hope that the weekend would bring relief to Fannie and Freddie. "People are cognizant that some plan could develop over the weekend. They don't want to be too short," said Nick Kalivas, equity market analyst at MF Global Research in Chicago. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 racked up their sixth weekly decline; for the Dow it was the fourth straight decline. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 128.48 points, or 1.14 percent, at 11,100.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 13.90 points, or 1.11 percent, at 1,239.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 18.77 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,239.08. The dollar fell against major currencies, with the US Dollar Index .DXY off 0.73 percent at 71.965. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.66 percent to 106.36. The euro rose 0.89 percent to $1.5924. Spot gold prices rose $17.05 to $963.20 an ounce. Among other big declining shares, Lehman Brothers shares slid 16.6 percent to $14.43, a day after dropping more than 12 percent on unsubstantiated rumors of clients pulling back their exposure to the investment bank. There were some bright spots. Shares of Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc soared 8.6 percent to $66.50 after a source said the maker of Budweiser beer and Belgian-Brazilian rival InBev NV have begun negotiations for a friendly merger. Financial stocks led losses in Europe, with Credit Agricole down nearly 10 percent after newspaper Le Monde reported the French bank's chief executive and chairman could resign over losses tied to the credit crunch. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 8.6 percent after Zurich Financial pulled out of the bidding for RBS's insurance unit. The Swiss company's stock rose 4.2 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 2.6 percent at 1,126.39 points -- its lowest close since June 9, 2005, according to Reuters data. Euro zone and US government bonds briefly pared losses after Paulson's statement gave no hints of a bailout for Fannie and Freddie, whose shares by then had plunged more than 40 percent each. Those shares began to tumble in pre-market trade after The New York Times reported that the U.S. government was considering a takeover -- a move that would guarantee the mortgages the two lenders hold but that could leave shareholders with nothing. European shares initially rose on the report, with investors relieved that Washington looked ready to step in to save the two massive lenders. But shares later fell sharply to three-year lows after Wall Street opened lower. In Europe, the slide in equity markets more than offset modest gains for heavyweight energy shares on the back of record oil prices. US Treasury debt prices slipped on fears the government would need to sell more debt to back a potential takeover, and sparked a rally in Fannie and Freddie debt. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell 41/32 to yield 3.96 percent. The 30-year US Treasury bond fell 58/32 to yield 4.53 percent. Oil rose. US crude settled at $145.08 a barrel, up $3.43, after climbing as high as $147.27 earlier in the day, adding to gains of $5.60 from Thursday. London Brent crude settled at $144.49 a barrel, up $2.46. Overnight in Asia, stocks rose and government bond prices fell as investors initially believed efforts to bolster Fannie and Freddie would stem further fallout from the global credit crisis. Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 closed down 0.2 percent and shares elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.3 percent, heading for the first weekly gain since mid-May. Fannie and Freddie have been hit hard by the US housing crisis, seeing borrowing costs rise and suffering billions of dollars of losses as many investors lose confidence they can raise sufficient capital to stay afloat. If they failed, it would make it far more difficult and perhaps impossible for people to obtain home loans, which could cause the already hard-hit housing market to grind to a halt. "The credit crisis is getting more intense, the run-up in oil is getting more intense and, of course the potential for military conflict (with Iran) is intensifying," said Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco. "There isn't anything out there that's good. Nobody wants to be a long holder of stocks over the weekend. For the most part people are at their most defensive levels.
