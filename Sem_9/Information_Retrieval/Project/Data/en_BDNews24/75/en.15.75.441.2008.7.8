 RIO DE JANEIRO, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Out of form Ronaldinho has been included in Brazil's squad for the Olympic Games as an overage player. Real Madrid striker Robinho, another player over the 23 age limit, was also named in the squad by coach Dunga, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said on its Web site (www.cbf.com.br) on Monday. Players under the age limit included Liverpool midfielder Lucas, Manchester United midfielder Anderson, Werder Bremen's Diego, AC Milan striker Alexandre Pato and Manchester City's new signing Jo. Brazil, five-times world champions, have never won the Olympic gold in soccer and regard it as the one major title missing from their collection. Ronaldinho, troubled by injury and fitness problems, has not played for Brazil this year and has made only sporadic appearances for Barcelona. Barcelona's new coach Pep Guardiola has already said that Ronaldinho does not figure in his plans for next season and AC Milan are reported to be interested in signing him. Brazil, silver medallists in 1984 and 1988, will face China, Belgium and New Zealand in their first round group. Dunga, who is also in charge of the senior side, is under increasing pressure after recent poor results and his future in the job is seen as hinging on a good performance in China. The Olympic tournament, taken more seriously in South America than in Europe, is restricted to under-23 teams with three overage players allowed per team. The presence of the over-age players depends on the goodwill of their clubs, who are not obliged to release them. Brazil had hoped to include World Player of the Year Kaka in their squad but AC Milan said they would not let him go. Squad: Goalkeepers: Diego Alves (Almeria), Renan (Internacional) Defenders: Marcelo (Real Madrid), Ilsinho (Shakhtar Donetsk), Rafinha (Schalke 04), Thiago Silva (Fluminense), Alex Silva (Sao Paulo), Breno (Bayern Munich) Midfielders: Lucas (Liverpool), Anderson (Manchester United), Hernanes (Sao Paulo), Ronaldinho (Barcelona), Diego (Werder Bremen), Thiago Neves (Fluminense) Forwards: Robinho (Real Madrid), Alexandre Pato (AC Milan), Rafael Sobis (Real Betis), Jo (Manchester Cit
