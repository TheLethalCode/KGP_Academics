 HONG KONG, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rose and government bond prices fell on Friday after a report that the US government is considering taking over the two top US mortgage finance companies helped soothe fears about further fallout from the global credit crisis. The dollar also climbed after the New York Times said Washington may place Fannie Mae under conservatorship if problems at the government-sponsored entities worsen. That essentially means US taxpayers would bear any losses on the $5 trillion in mortgages the companies hold or guarantee, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the plan, who stressed no action was imminent. Markets reacted with relief after watching Fannie's and Freddie's shares fall 30 percent and 45 percent, respectively, this week on fears they may not be able to get the capital they need to survive. "Investors will pounce on any bit of positive news especially if it involves these mortgage lenders and the US government," said Mona Chung, fund manager with Daiwa Asset Management in Hong Kong. "But this is looks like another short-term fix and we still can't see the end of the tunnel as far as the turmoil in the financial sector is concerned," she said. European shares were expected to open up to 0.9 percent higher, boosted by heavyweight oil stocks as crude oil broke back above $140 a barrel, and by talk of the potential US government rescue plan. Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 0.2 percent, while shares elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region were up 1.3 percent by 0630 GMT, heading for the first weekly gain since mid-May. BONDS FALL Japanese government bonds and US Treasuries tumbled as investors moved money out of safe-haven debt on the Fannie and Freddie report. "If true, this has major implications for the Treasury market -- bad, clearly, without a doubt," said a trader at a US investment bank in Tokyo. September JGB futures extended losses to the day's low of 135.58, down more than a half point. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 3.84 percent from 3.80 percent late on Thursday in New York. The US dollar edged up against the euro and yen on expectations the US government would act to prevent the credit crisis from spiraling further out of control. The euro was at $1.5770, down 0.1 percent. The dollar was trading at 107.12 yen , up 0.1 percent. OIL APPROACHING A PEAK? Commodity prices remained high, keeping inflation concerns to the fore. Crude topped $142 a barrel after jumping overnight on threats to production in Nigeria and Brazil, and aluminum prices hit a record on output cuts in China, supporting expectations that higher costs will cut into the bottom line. Investors were also awaiting results later in the day from the world's fourth-largest steel maker POSCO and industrial giant General Electric. Earnings forecasts globally have been revised down as margins are squeezed by higher costs and slackening consumer spending, particularly in developed economies. However, as prices for raw materials such as oil continue to climb, more and more investors are confident that a sharp turn lower, based on reduced demand, is on the horizon. The rate at which institutional investors are sending equity capital to large commodity exporting nations such as Chile and South Africa has been falling fast, according to data from State Street Global Markets. "The macro backdrop also makes falling commodity prices more likely. Slowing growth and booming commodity markets are not generally compatible," State Street analysts said in a note. Furthermore, equity valuations in Asia ex-Japan have reached fair value, according to JPMorgan strategist Adrian Mowat. In eight out of 12 markets in the region, shares are cheaper on a price-to-forward earnings basis than the average trough valuations of the last three major financial events of the decade: the Asian financial crisis, bailout of Mexico and US recession. "During 2H08, markets will be sensitive to declines in headline inflation. We recommend that investors buy equities currently in this environment," Mowat said in a research note
