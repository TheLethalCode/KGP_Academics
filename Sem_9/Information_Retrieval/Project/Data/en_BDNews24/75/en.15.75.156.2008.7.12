 LONDON, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portsmouth completed the signing of England striker Peter Crouch from Liverpool on Friday with the 27-year-old signing a four-year contract. The clubs had already agreed an undisclosed fee for the lanky forward, who spent nine months at Portsmouth in the 2001/02 season, and completed the deal after Crouch passed his medical. "I'm really buzzing, I'm even happier than when I signed for Pompey the first time around seven years ago," he told www.portsmouthfc.co.uk. "A big factor in coming here was playing for Harry Redknapp, I've got a lot to thank him for and I believe he gets the best out of me. "Another huge thing was the side Pompey have got now, I think we've got a chance to do well this season. "We won the FA Cup but I think that's just the beginning. I'm looking forward to the best years of my career here," added Crouch, who has scored 14 goals in his 28 England appearances. Redknapp said: "Bringing a player like Peter here shows how far we have come and how far we can go. I'm delighted he's back. "I never expected to see him back here. He went off to Liverpool and did a fantastic job in my opinion and I'm looking forward to seeing him and Jermain Defoe up front - a big one and a little one - and we've got other good forwards here.
