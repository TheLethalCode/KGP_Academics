<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Sunday the caretaker government had not been entrusted with powers to sign an agreement over transit. "This government does not have any constitutional right to decide on what we have heard about any agreement on transit," Delwar told Tejgaon BNP leaders in his NAM flat. "If the government is neutral, it has to comply with the constitution." "Any act beyond its authority might foment an unwanted situation in the country," the BNP quoted Delwar as saying in a statement. The BNP leader said that the 1/11 changeover had been designed to resist the four-party alliance from going to power again. The Khaleda-nominated BNP secretary general alleged that a conspiracy was on to take the leaders of the country off the political scene by implicating them in false cases and spreading propaganda against them. Delwar came down hard on the government for what he said was its failure to rein in the prices of essentials and asked BNP supporters to get ready for a movement anytime. The BNP leader demanded release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Cocoand their medical treatment overseas. Delwar alleged there was a plot to shift Tarique to another hospital from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. bd
