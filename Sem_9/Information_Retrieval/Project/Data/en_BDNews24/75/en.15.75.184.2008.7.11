 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  A five-hour meeting between launch owners and Bangladesh Water Transport Workers Federation (BWTWF) on Friday failed to resolve a nationwide strike by launch workers. Water transport workers countrywide went on a wildcat strike from Thursday midnight demanding higher wages, resulting in the suspension of public transport on major river routes, officials said. Acting president of Bangladesh Inland Waterways Passenger Carrier Association (BIWPCA) Badiuzzaman Badal claimed that owners and workers "shook hands on a deal" in late night talks. But no announcement on ending the strike came after an official meeting between the BWTWF representatives and launch owners that continued from 3pm to 8pm, officials told bdnews24.com. Alamgir Kabir, deputy director and port and transportation officer of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), told bdnews24.com earlier in the day: "The water transport workers went on strike convened by BWTWF since midnight Thursday demanding better wages." Shah Alam, vice president of BWTWF, however, told bdnews24.com Friday: "Water transport workers are observing the spontaneous strike, but the federation had no prior knowledge of the movement." Alam said prices of essentials have doubled and tripled in recent years but the water transport workers have not seen any commensurable pay rises, still surviving on a meagre monthly wage of Tk 1,900. "Launch owners seem oblivious to the needs and suffering of the workers, which is why the strikers have put a stop to water transport across the country, the federation official said. bdnews24.com correspondents from other river ports of the country said that no launches had moved off the quays at Chandpur, Barisal, Bhola or Patuakhali since Thursday midnight. bdnews24.com Chandpur correspondent observed that the quay looked desolate after hundreds of passengers returned home failing to board any launch. bdnews24.com/co
