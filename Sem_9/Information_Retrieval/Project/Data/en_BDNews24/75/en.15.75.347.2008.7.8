<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The government moved to keep the market in check as the prices of essentials did not come down despite bumper output in the boro season, an adviser said Tuesday. "Also, the government will take effective steps to keep the market under control during the Ramadan. Government agencies including TCB have been directed to remain prepared," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters. "Although farmers have harvested bumper crops in the boro season they are not selling it." "Prices of paddy and rice would have decreased if farmers had sold crops. If farmers don't need to sell paddy and rice it means they are becoming self-reliant. Their capacity to stockpile crops has increased. They are now controlling the market. This is a new dimension in Bangladesh," the adviser said. According to the adviser, efforts are underway to keep the market economy at "logical level". "We are trying to engage government agencies including TCB in the effort to cool down the market." bdnew
