 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty inaugurated a biogas plant at Al Jamiatul Islamia Darus Sunna Madrasa in Teknaf Wednesday. Moriarty's wife Lauren Moriarty accompanied him. Students of the madrasa greeted the US ambassador with flowers. Moriarty spent some time with them. The diplomat praised the madrasa authorities for setting up the biogas plant and said such an attempt would play a significant role in saving Bangladesh's greens. Moriarty said the US would continue its support to such endeavours. Grameen Shakti, a renewable energy company that works in rural areas, provided technical assistance in setting up the biogas plant. Moriarty later inaugurated a project named "Oirabat Nature Interpretation Centre" funded by the United States Agency for International Development.
