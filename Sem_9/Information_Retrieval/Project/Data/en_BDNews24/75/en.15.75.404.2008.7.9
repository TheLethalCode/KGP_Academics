<TITLE> LDCs must press rich nations for broader market benefits: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Wednesday the least developed countries needed to stand united to press developed countries for meaningful market benefits. "If the LDCs can stand united, it will be easy for them to take advantage of global trading," the adviser told reporters after a seminar on "Upcoming WTO Ministerial Meeting and Challenges for Bangladesh" at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry organised the seminar. Debapriya Bhattacharya, ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the WTO, Geneva, who presented the keynote paper at the seminar, said Bangladesh were up against seven challenges. The core challenges are: having early information about the product coverage under DFQF (duty free quota free) market access, early implementation of the DFQF, ensuring that products of key export interest and products of high export potential are included on the initial DFQF list. He said Bangladesh could not benefit from duty-free access to 97 percent goods announced at the WTO conference in Hong Kong as Bangladesh could not name its exportable goods. FBCCI president Annisul Huq said: "It is extremely necessary for Bangladesh and other LDCs to pursue agenda on the areas of their vital interest and adopt a proactive role in the ongoing WTO negotiations to protect the interest of Bangladesh and other LDCs in global trade in goods and services." "We would like to reiterate that duty-free and quota-free market access must be given with a single positive list on the basis of most-favoured nations to all LDC members of WTO without discrimination," Huq said. LDCs are the most vulnerable members in the WTO, for whom special measures for meaningful integration into the multilateral trading system have been stressed. The FBCCI chief said: "In the case of agricultural negotiations the LDCs should be allowed flexibilities to provide whatever support and subsidies they need to develop their agriculture." The commerce adviser will lead Bangladesh delegation to the July 21-23 WTO ministerial conference in Geneva. bdnews
