 WASHINGTON, Sun Jul 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush's former press secretary Tony Snow, known for his genial jousting with reporters, has died of cancer, the White House said on Saturday. Snow, 53, who had been a conservative radio and television commentator, left the post as Bush's spokesman in September 2007 after taking the job the previous year. Bush said in a statement that he and his wife, Laura, "are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend." He called Snow "one of our nation's finest writers and commentators" who "earned a loyal following with incisive radio and television broadcasts." Snow learned in March last year that the colon cancer he had fought earlier had recurred and spread. But he said his decision to leave was for financial, not health, reasons. He had earned far more as a commentator than his White House salary. The affable Snow was credited with livening up the daily news briefings and was admired for his skill at sparring with reporters. Bush noted that Snow had worked as a speech writer in the administration of his father, former President George H.W. Bush, "and I was thrilled when he agreed to return to the White House to serve as my press secretary." Bush said it was "a joy to watch Tony at the podium each day. He brought wit, grace, and a great love of country to his work," and said Snow's colleagues "will cherish memories of his energetic personality and relentless good humor." Bush's father, speaking to FOX News, said Snow did his job in a way that showed "the political process didn't have to be mean and ugly." Snow could "disagree, but do it agreeably. He didn't have this cutting edge," the former president said. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat and fierce critic of the Bush administration, also praised Snow who she said "always showed the kindness of his Midwestern American roots." Snow and his wife, Jill, had three children
