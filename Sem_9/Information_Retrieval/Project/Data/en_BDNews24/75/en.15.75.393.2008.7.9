 Tehran, July 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has test fired nine long- and medium-range missiles, including one which it has previously said could travel as far as Israel and US bases in the region, state media reported on Wednesday. The tests occurred at a time of increased tension between Iran and Israel over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme, which the West fears is aimed at making bombs. Iran says its nuclear program is only for power generation. State Press TV said the missiles tested by Iran's Revolutionary Guards included a "new" Shahab 3 missile, which officials have said could reach targets 2,000 km (1,250 miles) away.
