<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com) - Not AKTEL, CityCell is all set to be a partner of the Bangladesh Football Federation. The federation signs a memorandum of understanding worth above Tk 15 crore with the mobile operator Monday. "We are going to sign a MoU with CityCell Monday and its worth is more than Tk 15 crore for three years," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters at his office Sunday. AKTEL was at the centre of discussion over the sponsorship deal, but the talks shifted suddenly as the mobile operator sought some more time from the BFF to finalise the deal. "We negotiated with both AKTEL and CityCell and finally chose CityCell," said the football legendary. Salahuddin said the sponsor would get a few major tournaments of the BFF yearly calendar, without giving further details. However, a BFF official said the mobile operator would earn the sponsorship rights to the B. League, the Federation Cup and the school tournament across the country at the cost of Tk 16.5 crore. The BFF will have a provision to add co-sponsors to those tournaments. bd
