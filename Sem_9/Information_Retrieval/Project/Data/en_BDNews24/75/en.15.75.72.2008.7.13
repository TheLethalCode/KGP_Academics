 MUMBAI, Sun Jul 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's national security advisor blames Pakistan's ISI intelligence service for the suicide bomb attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul this week, he said on Indian news channels late on Saturday. "We have no doubt that the ISI is behind this," M.K. Narayanan told NDTV, referring to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. "We are in the favor of the peace process, but the ISI is not in any way part of it. The ISI is playing evil. The ISI needs to be destroyed," he said, according to a transcript of the interview on the NDTV website. He told another news channel that India had a "fair amount" of evidence linking the ISI to Monday's car bomb that killed 41 people, including an Indian defense attache and a diplomat. Afghan authorities had also hinted they suspected the ISI, a charge Pakistan denies. An Afghan spokesman said after the attack that it bore the "hallmarks of a particular intelligence agency". India has close ties with Afghanistan, where it has pledged some $750 million towards reconstruction of the war-ravaged country. Some political analysts think Pakistan is increasingly wary of ceding influence to India. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1945 over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. The nuclear-armed rivals resumed peace talks in 2004. Narayanan told NDTV that he hoped the peace talks would continue
