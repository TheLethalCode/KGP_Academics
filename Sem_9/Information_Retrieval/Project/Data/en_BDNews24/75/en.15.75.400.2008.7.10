 Rajshahi, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders and supporters of Awami League and its front organisations in Rajshahi rejected the 14-party alliance's endorsement of Fazle Hasan Badshah as mayoral candidate. They locked the AL offices in Kumarpara in protest against the endorsement of Workers Party leader Badshah. At a rally held shortly after the alliance endorsed candidates for the four city corporation polls, AL's Rajshahi city vice president Rafique Uddin Ahmed said: "The AL central leaders want to destroy the carreer of a dedicated AL leader, Khairuzzaman Liton, son of the late AHM Kamaruzzaman Hena, by nominating others." The 14-party alliance endorsed four mayoral candidates for the forthcoming city corporation polls at a meeting at the home of AL acting president Zillur Rahman Thursday evening. "We never defied the command of the central committee. From today, we will not abide any more by the central committee," Rafique Uddin said at the rally. He said AL, with the support of the people of Rajshahi, would elect Liton mayor of the city to prove that Rajshahi was an AL base. "There is nothing called the 14-party alliance in Rajshahi. There are only two partiesAwami League and JSD. We are now announcing that we have rejected the 14-party alliance in Rajshahi from today," Rafique said. Advocate Mozaffar Hossain called on the central committee to give second thoughts to the matter. Chhatra League leader Zedu Sarkar said Fazle Hossain Badshah and his supporters would be chased out of Rajshahi city. bdnews2
