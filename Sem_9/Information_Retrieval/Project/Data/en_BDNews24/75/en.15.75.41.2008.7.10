 NEW YORK, Thu Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks fell in choppy trading on Thursday as worry over whether Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can obtain the capital they need overshadowed news of a planned $18.8 billion acquisition in the chemicals sector.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 4.65 points, or 0.37 percent, at 1,240.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.37 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,234.52.
