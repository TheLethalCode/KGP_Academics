 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission has finalised the process of demarcation of parliamentary constituencies, an EC official said Thursday. The gazette regarding the demarcation will be published in a day or two, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at EC office. The EC published a draft gazette of 300 parliamentary seats on Apr 29, of which the limits of 133 constituencies had been refixed. "Of the133 electoral constituencies that were refixed in the earlier draft, minor changes have again been made to 84 constituencies in the final process of demarcation," said Sakhawat. The election commissioner said the government would take stern action to implement existing electoral laws in the forthcoming city and municipal elections. He said if the election officials violate rules action would also be taken against them. "The commission has already decided to take punitive measures against the official concerned for violations in the scrutiny of the nomination papers in Rajshahi City Corporation elections," said Sakhawat. Rajshahi additional divisional commissioner M Akhteruzzaman announced five nomination papers as legal on July 8, which had earlier been declared invalid by the returning officer. However, the EC deemed the decision of the returning officer correct, cancelling the decision of the commissioner. Sakhawat said the EC will submit a letter to the establishment ministry to take proper steps against the official. Sakhawat Hossain also urged political parties not to participate directly or indirectly in candidates' campaigns. bdnews
