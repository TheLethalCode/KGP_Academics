 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  National Sports Council chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Monday asked the Bangladesh Football Federation president to focus on football at the grassroots level to find talents. "He (Moeen) gave me some advice and asked me to focus on football at the grassroots level and not to confine it to Dhaka football," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters after a meeting with the NSC chairman at the Bangladesh Olympic Association Monday. The army chief promised to assist the federation after having heard the programmes taken up by the newly- elected committee. "I let him (Moeen) know about the BFF programmes in the days to come and have sought help from him," Salahuddin said, "He assured me of extending his support to football." The BFF boss said that the NSC in association with the BFF was going to hold a youth (U-18) tournament across the country and Noakhali and Khulna would host one semi-final of the tournament each while the final would be held in Barisal. Apart from the meeting with the BFF president, the NSC chairman also met with the general secretaries of district sports associations and divisional sports associations in the NSC conference room. Moeen heard different problems from them and assured the representatives of solving those problems in his capacity. A few organisers demanded building stadiums in their respective districts, but the army chief said that they were concentrating on increasing the number of playgrounds instead of building new stadiums. The NSC boss asked the organisers to place their problems specifically with the NSC, which would look into those problems on the basis of priority. Moeen also said that the NSC would give a DSA award each year after evaluating the performances of all district sports associations. The organisers urged the NSC chairman to take initiative for a one-crore FDR for each DSA so that they could collect their funds from the deposits to run their yearly programmes smoothly.
