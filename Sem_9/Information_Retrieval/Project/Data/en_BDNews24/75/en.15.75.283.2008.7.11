 PARIS, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker David Trezeguet, who ended his France career on Wednesday, said Raymond Domenech was not up to the job of national coach and should have been fired after Euro 2008. "We are all aware that Domenech is not up to the task of being at the head of France, but nobody is willing to draw the consequences," he was quoted as saying by sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday. "I feel like Les Bleus have become more of a political issue than a sports one." Trezeguet was left out of the squad for Euro 2008 and France bowed out of the competition after finishing bottom of their group with just one point and one goal from three matches. "After the failure (at Euro 2008), I thought, like most French people: 'he has to go'. In every other country, they are wondering what the French are doing," he said. The 30-year-old striker had an uneasy relationship with Domenech, who called him up only five times after the 2006 World Cup final, which France lost to Italy on penalties with Trezeguet missing a spot kick. "Do you think I have forgotten the 2006 final against Italy? Sooner or later, football enables you to get your revenge. By depriving me of the Euro, this possibility was taken away from me," he said. Domenech was told last week he could stay in the post he has held since 2004. Didier Deschamps, captain of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup, had been tipped to take over from Domenech. Asked if he would have made the same decision had Deschamps been named France coach, Trezeguet said: "No. The only thing I asked was a clear posture from him (Domenech). I should have been part of the group." Trezeguet, often nicknamed "Trezegol", was second top scorer in Serie A last season with 20 goals, but despite his excellent club form with Juventus, he was unable to force his way into Domenech's plans. "My decision is made and I will not go back on it," Trezeguet added. "If Domenech calls me today, he is a hypocrite. Today, I prefer to leave my spot to someone who will be more flexible with the coach.
