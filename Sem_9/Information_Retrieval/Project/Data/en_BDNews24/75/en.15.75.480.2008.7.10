 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The 14-party alliance endorsed four mayoral candidates on Thursday for the forthcoming city corporation polls, meeting with strong resistance from local AL leaders in Rajshahi who immediately denounced the alliance-backed candidate in that city. The decision was taken at a meeting of the alliance at the home of AL acting president Zillur Rahman Thursday evening. Zillur told reporters after the meeting the alliance was backing Workers Party leader Fazle Hossain Badshah for Rajshahi City Corporation mayor; detained Awami League leader and incumbent mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran as mayoral candidate for Sylhet City Corporation, AL central leader Talukder Abdul Khaleque for Khulna mayor and AL convenor Shawkat Hossain Hiron for Barisal mayor. Leaders of the 14 parties have been in talks for days to finalise their candidate endorsements for four city corporation elections. Complexities arose over the choice of mayoral candidate in Rajshahi. Local Awami League leader Khairuzzaman Liton and Workers Party leader Fazle Hossain Badshah both submitted nominations, and stuck to their claims of 14-party backing until the alliance announced its support of Badshah on Thursday. Liton announced that he would fight for the position of mayor. After the 14-party alliance announced its decision, Liton told local reporters: "The Nagorik Committee has backed me as its candidate. I have no scope to backtrack. Except for Workers Party all others of the 14-party alliance in Rajshahi are with me." Fazle Hossain Badshah told bdnews24.com: "I think Awami League will solve the problem organisation-wise. I will also personally take the initiative." However, leaders and supporters of Awami League and its front organisations in Rajshahi strongly denounced the 14-party alliance's endorsement of Fazle Hasan Badshah as mayoral candidate, and the alliance itself at a protest rally following the endorsement. After the announcement, Zillur Rahman was asked who would get the alliance's backing in the municipal elections. He replied the decision would be taken locally. He also reiterated: "No local election including upazila polls can be held before the national elections." Zillur Rahman presided over the one and half hour meeting, with AL leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury, Workers Party leaders Rashed Khan Menon and Bimal Biswas, JSD (Inu) leaders Mainuddin Ahmed Khan Badal and Shirin Akhter, Ganotantri Party's Nurul Islam, Gano Azadi League's Abdus Samad, NAP's Enamul Haque and Samyabadi Dal's Dilip Barua among those present. bdnews
