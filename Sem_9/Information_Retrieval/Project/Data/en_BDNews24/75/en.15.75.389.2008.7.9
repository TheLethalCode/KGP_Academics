<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) Wednesday assured the Bangladesh Football Federation of solving the differences between district sports associations (DSAs) and newly formed district football associations (DFAs) in order to roll football in fields at the district level. "We will work, as a moderator, to reduce the differences between DSAs and DFAs so that the officials from DSAs and DFAs can work together in a bid to run the football at the district level," said BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed after a meeting with the BFF officials. The DFAs were formed by the BFF in line with the FIFA and AFC guidelines to make the local football bodies free from the government, but after the DFA formation, a question was raised as to which organisation-- DSA or DFA-- would conduct the football meets at the district level as the DSAs, affiliated to the National Sports Council (NSC), are legally authorised to hold the local football meets in districts. "We will sit with all parties -- BFF, DSAs and DFAs -- this month to find out the way to solve the differences, and I think both parties at district level should solve the problem in the greater interest of football," said Ahmed. The BOA secretary general also hoped that they would be able to solve the matter this month and the local football would roll in field in October. The BFF officials recently also sat with the highups of the NSC to solve the differences between two local bodies, but the NSC officials apparently told the football officials that they had nothing to do because of the legal embargo. The BFF is likely to start the national football camp for the 2009 South Asian (SA) Games in October next and BFF president Kazi Salahudin is eager to add foreign coach and trainer to the national team. Salahuddin said that they wanted to include a foreign coach and a trainer to the national team on time so that the players could get proper training during the camp. Kutubuddin said that they would focus football highly in the SA Game training and provide BFF with the maximum financial support for the foreign coach and the trainer. Bangladesh will host the SA Games in early 2009. Apart from Kutubuddin and Salahuddin, BOA vice presidents Mizanur Rahman Manu, Khandoker Jamiludddin, BOA CEO retired Col Waliullah, BFF vice presidents Badal Roy, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Sawkat Ali Khan Jahangir and its members Haroon-or-Rashid, Anwarul Haq Helal were among others present.
