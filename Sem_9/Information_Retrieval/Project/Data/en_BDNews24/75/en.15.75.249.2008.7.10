 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division on Thursday upheld a High Court order staying the proceedings of two graft cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A four-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, gave the ruling after hearing twin government appeals against the stays on the barge-mounted power plant case and Niko case against Hasina. The High Court Monday put two-month freezes on the trial proceedings of the two cases against Hasina and other accused. The court also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain within four weeks why the cases against Hasina should not be cancelled in line with the former prime minister's petitions challenging their validity. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal told the appellate bench Thursday: "As the High Court has stayed the proceedings of the two cases against Hasina, the trial of the cases remain suspended in the lower court." "Unless the stay order goes, it will not be possible to complete the trial of the cases within the stipulated time frame." "The High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed gave the stay order without having the jurisdiction of hearing such petitions. The bench heard the case as a matter beyond its jurisdiction and gave the stay order," the attorney general argued. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique Ul Haque replied: "The High Court heard both sides' arguments and gave the stay orderit hasn't yet given any verdict." The AL chief petitioned the High Court to cancel the power plant case on June 2, and on June 19 to cancel the Niko case. The ACC filed the power plant case against Hasina and six others on Sept 2 last year, and the Niko case on Dec 9. bdnews24.
