 Washington,july 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday condemned the attack on its consulate in Istanbul and a State Department spokesman said he could neither confirm nor rule out al Qaeda involvement. Three Turkish police officers and three gunmen were killed in the attack at the compound. "The United States condemns the terrorist attack that took place on our consulate general in Istanbul earlier today," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack. Reports in Turkey said al Qaeda involvement was suspected. "At this point one can't rule that out, but I also can't support at this point, those suspicions," McCormack said. "We're continuing our efforts to work with the Turkish government to determine who is responsible for it." He said the attack took place at a police booth about 75 feet from the entrance to the consulate. Witnesses told Reuters four attackers drove a car up to the compound. As the car halted, three jumped out and began firing at police at the guard post. McCormack said Turkish police had responded quickly and effectively, and Washington appreciated their courage in protecting US diplomats. He expressed condolences to the families of the dead and wounded officers. Turkey and the United States "will continue to stand firmly together to confront the threat of terrorism as we have done in the past," he said
