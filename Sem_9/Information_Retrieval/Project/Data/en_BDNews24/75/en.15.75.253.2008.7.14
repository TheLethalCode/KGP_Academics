<TITLE> Middle East envoy Blair prepares Gaza visit: sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GAZA/JERUSALEM, Mon Jul 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Middle East envoy Tony Blair is expected to travel to the Gaza Strip this week in what would be the highest-level visit by a Western official since Hamas took control a year ago, Hamas and Western officials said. The visit would come nearly a month after an Egyptian-brokered truce curbed cross-border fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the coastal enclave. Since his appointment last year, Blair has shunned Hamas, in keeping with a US-led boycott of the Islamist group over its refusal to recognize Israel and renounce violence. Blair's office on Monday declined to comment on the former British prime minister's travel plans. Hamas spokesman Ismail Rudwan said the group was aware of the planned visit and was making "all the necessary security arrangements". Rudwan, in a statement posted on a pro-Hamas website, said the expected visit proved "the stability of the security situation in Gaza". Palestinian and Western officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the trip could be delayed due to security considerations. Aside from UN officials, few Western dignitaries have visited the Gaza Strip since Hamas routed more secular Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and seized control in June 2007
