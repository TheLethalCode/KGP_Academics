 TEHRAN Wed Jul 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran test-fired nine missiles on Wednesday and warned the United States and Israel it was ready to retaliate if they attacked the Islamic Republic over its disputed nuclear projects. Washington, which says Iran seeks atomic bombs, told Tehran to halt further tests if it wanted the world to trust it. Rising tensions have rattled financial markets. Oil prices, which have recently slipped from record highs, rebounded almost $2 a barrel after Wednesday's tests. Speculation that Israel could strike Iran has mounted since its air force staged an exercise last month that US officials said involved 100 aircraft. The United States has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the nuclear row. "We warn the enemies who intend to threaten us with military exercises and empty psychological operations that our hand will always be on the trigger and our missiles will always be ready to launch," Revolutionary Guards air force commander Hossein Salami said, according to ISNA news agency. State TV showed missiles soaring into the sky from a desert launchpad and leaving long vapour trails. Iran should "refrain from further missile tests if they truly seek to gain the trust of the world," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. "The Iranians should stop the development of ballistic missiles, which could be used as a delivery vehicle for a potential nuclear weapon, immediately," he added. Iran, the world's fourth largest oil producer, insists its nuclear ambitions are purely directed at generating electricity. State Press TV said the "highly advanced" missiles tested by the Guards included a "new" Shahab 3 missile, which officials have said could reach targets 2,000 km (1,250 miles) away. Iran has previously said Israel and US bases are in its range. 'WAR OF WORDS' Some US facilities across the Gulf are little more than 200 km from Iran's coast, putting them in range of Iranian weaponry even if analysts question their accuracy. The United States also has troops based in nearby Arab states, including Qatar and Bahrain, along with ships patrolling the Gulf waterway. Iran has previously said US forces were vulnerable because of their presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. State TV said the missile has a one-tonne, conventional warhead. Israel, believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear-armed power, has vowed to prevent Iran from acquiring an atomic bomb
