<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  The national cricketers are going to learn English from the American International University of Bangladesh (AIUB) to bring fluency in English speaking . It is common with captain Mohammad Ashtabula to speak broken English. Other Bangladeshi cricketers are no exception. In this regard, the AIUB has come forward to comply with the request of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). "You know better how much they (cricketers) are weak in English and it is important for the players to speak good English fluently," BCB member Ishtiaq Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Ahmed said, "We have got a positive response from the AIUB and are now waiting for the BCB approval." However, the AIUB would not take any charge for teaching English to the cricketers. "It is not a new matter for us as we had earlier taught English to the different government officials without any cost," said Lutfar Rahman, public relations director of the AIUB. Abdul Kader Nazmul, AIUB sports coordinator, said that they would also teach computer literacy to the cricketers. bdn
