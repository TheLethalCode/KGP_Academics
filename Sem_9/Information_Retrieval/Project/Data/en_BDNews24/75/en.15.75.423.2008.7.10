<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday asked people to save energy and stop wasting gas and electricity to narrow the gap between demand and supply. Addressing a workshop and exhibition on "Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Programmes" at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, Fakhruddin also stressed using energy-efficient lights, applying energy-saving technology in industry and utilising renewable energy resources such as solar and wind energy. "Promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy technology has become a global trend in recent years due to a phenomenal increase in the prices of petroleum products," he said. Fakhruddin pointed to deepening awareness about the impact of climate change and fast-depleting natural resources across the world. "Bangladesh is no exception to this global trend." The CA said the government was preparing a draft of Energy Conservation Act, including provisions in the building code, to ensure efficient use and conservation of energy in buildings. "These provisions will include shading of building from sunlight and use of energy-efficient air-conditioner/cooler, efficient insulation materials, energy-efficient lights and installation of energy-efficient appliances." The CA said the government had been providing financial and technical assistance for the promotion of solar home systems through implementing agencies. "We have reduced import duty on solar panels from 5 percent to 3 percent." "The government is now focusing on other applications of solar energy, such as water heating, water pumping for irrigation and street lighting," Fakhruddin said. The CA said the government was keen to encourage private investments in the economic sectors and was promoting public-private partnerships in the energy sector. It was also considering adoption of policies for installation of merchant power plants by the private sector, said Fakhruddin. "If the policies are adopted small power plants, captive power plants and merchant power plants will be able to sell power to customers of their choice." Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission will oversee the matter, the CA added. Fakhruddin hoped the workshop would come up with new and innovative ideas for promoting energy conservation and use of renewable energy in the country. bdnews
