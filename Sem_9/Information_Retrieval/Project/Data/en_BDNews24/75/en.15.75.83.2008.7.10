<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Thursday turned down a writ petition demanding the cancellation of the schedule for polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities. A High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahammad briefly heard the deliberations on the petition before rejecting it, saying the Election Commission is vested with the right to hold elections and the court has no right to interfere with the commission's mandate. Supreme Court lawyer Ghiasuddin filed the petition on July 7. Taking part in the hearing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate ABM Nurul Islam told the court Thursday that the announced election schedule contravenes section 119 of the constitution, which says the EC's mandate is to elect the president and parliament members. The EC is illegally and unconstitutionally meddling with the local body elections instead, he said. The EC has to make public a finalised voter list before announcing any election schedule, as no such schedule can be announced without the voter lists, the lawyer argued. Therefore, the polls schedule has been an illegal and unconstitutional announcement, Islam reiterated. He further argued that the caretaker government is mandated only to hold the parliamentary elections, which it has bypassed and set about staging the local government polls. Islam told bdnews24.com after the ruling: "We'll appeal to the Supreme Court against the court order as soon as we get a copy of the verdict." The Local Government (City Corporation) and Local Government (Municipalities) Ordinance was passed on May 12. The schedule for elections to the four city corporations and nine municipalities was announced by the EC on June 20, the polls to be held on Aug 4. On July 6, another Supreme Court lawyer and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Jasimuddin Sarker had filed a separate petition with the High Court for staying the same local body polls, the hearing on which is scheduled to be held Sunday. bdnews
