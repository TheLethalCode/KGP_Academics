 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, July 10 (bdnew24.com) Bangladesh Bank is contemplating the introduction of mobile phone banking to speed up remittances from expatriate workers. Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Thursday the initiative is being considered with the interests of remittance recipients in mind. After launching a public campaign on foreign remittance at the Sonargaon Hotel Thursday, the central banker said foreign workers sent back a record $8 billion or Tk 54,700 crore in 2007-08, $2 billion more than the previous fiscal year. The money remitted in 2007-08 contributed more to the economy than the garment export industry, and was also more than the combined amount received in aid from donors and foreign direct investment, Salehuddin said. The BB governor said different moves to bring more money through banking channels, including measures against hundi transactions, played a significant role in increasing remittances. But, he conceded, a large amount of money was still being received from abroad through illegal routes, as foreign remittance through banks was still costlier and took longer. The central bank is therefore considering further steps, including mobile banking, to encourage remittance by banking channels, Salehuddin said. The governor said a domestic mobile phone company had already submitted a proposal in this regard. A senior central bank official also informed bdnews24.com that a Bangladesh Bank delegation visited the Philippines last year, returning a positive report on the country's remittance process using mobile phone SMS. The official said Bangladesh Bank was also looking into allowing foreign workers to send money to recipients in Bangladesh by using a similar SMS banking process. On how the system might work, he said: "According to the proposal, the branches or exchange houses of the banks in different countries will instantly inform a local bank or exchange house of the amount being sent by an expatriate worker." "After that the bank concerned or exchange house will inform the recipient of the remittance through an SMS, and will request the recipient to collect the money from a specified booth of [the mobile phone company]." The Bangladesh Bank governor said an airtight legal framework would be created so that the hard-earned money of overseas workers was not lost through the process in any way. Asked what amount of expatriate earnings comes to the country through illegal hundi transactions, the Bangladesh Bank governor replied: "The central bank does not have any information in this regard. Different quarters say the amount of money coming through hundi is equal to the amount coming through banking channels." If true, the amount coming through banking channels could double, with foreign exchange reserves increasing far above the present $6.25 billion. Salehuddin said the country would certainly be less dependent on foreign aid and the overall economy would be benefited if more remittance came through the proper channels. Asked when any agreement on mobile banking could be expected, he said: "Nothing can be said definitely in this regard yet. We have to formulate the legal framework first. A decision will be taken after that." bdnews
