<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com)Launch workers countrywide went on a wildcat strike from Thursday midnight demanding higher wages, resulting in the suspension of water transport on major river routes, officials said. Alamgir Kabir, deputy director and port and transportation officer of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), told bdnews24.com: "The water transport workers went on strike convened by BWTWF since midnight Thursday demanding better wages." Shah Alam, vice president of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers Federation (BWTWF), however, told bdnews24.com Friday: "Water transport workers are observing the spontaneous strike, but the federation had no prior knowledge of the movement." Shah Alam said prices of essentials have doubled and tripled in recent years but the water transport workers have not seen any commensurable pay rises, still surviving on a meagre monthly wage of Tk 1,900. "Launch owners seem oblivious to the needs and suffering of the workers, which is why the strikers have put a stop to water transport across the country, the federation official said. Kotwali police chief told bdnews24.com: "No launch has left from or arrived at Sadarghat launch terminal today, since the launch workers went on strike." bdnews24.com correspondents from other river ports of the country said that no launches were moving off the quays at Chandpur, Barisal, Bhola or Patuakhali since midnight. bdnews24.com Chandpur correspondent observed that the quay looked desolate after hundreds of passengers returned home failing to board any launch to their destinations. Launch company supervisor Md Ali Asghar told bdnews24.com that the launch owners had not been paying heed to the workers pressing their demands, even when they threatened work abstentions. Meanwhile, the labour and employment ministry held a meeting Thursday to discuss pay rises for water transport workers, forming a committee whose mandate will be to recommend a new salary structure that may be made effective from January 2009. A government handout on Thursday had said the workers promised not to go on strike for the time being in view of the government initiative for increasing wages of water transport workers. bdnews24.com/co
