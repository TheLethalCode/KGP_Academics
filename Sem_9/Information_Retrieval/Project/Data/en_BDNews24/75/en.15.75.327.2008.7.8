 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The Truth and Accountability Commission that will provide scope for leniency to those making voluntary disclosures about graft is poised to start work. Preparations for a formal launch are underway. The commission complex straddles three houses on Hare Road. Some staffers have started work at the commission's office, which will start function formally with the appointment of the chairman and two members. The secretary to the commission, a joint secretary, four deputy secretaries, private secretary to the commission chairman and two army officials and 20 others have been appointed, officials said. "Work for preparing offices is almost complete. The commission will start work formally when the chairman is appointed," the commission chairman's private secretary Zahid Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) chairman Mahbubur Rahman has been appointed secretary to the commission. He has not yet joined the post. But joint secretary Khademul Islam Md Belal, deputy secretaries Amir Hossain, Shamim Al Mamun, Abdullah Al Mamun, Shahed Iqbal and army officers major Md Khalil Ur Rahman and major Saad Ahmed Sumon have joined the commission. The bdnews24.com correspondent found some officials in the three houses named Tonmoy, Uttarayan and Totiny, with each of the two-storey buildings having six rooms. The buildings had earlier been used as residences for the ministers. Uttarayan will house the legal office of the commission and Totiny will be the administrative office. At Totiny, AKM Ruhul Amin who introduced himself as "personal officer" said: "We started work a few days ago." The council of advisers Sunday altered "Voluntary Disclosure (amendment) Ordinance 2008 by replacing the word "Army" with "Armed Forces" in it. The ordinance was designed to form the Truth and Accountability Commission. It was meant to eradicate corruption and continue economic development at the same time. The commission's tenure is five months. Anybody other than convicted for at least two years for corruption can take advantage of the provision for mercy. bdnew
