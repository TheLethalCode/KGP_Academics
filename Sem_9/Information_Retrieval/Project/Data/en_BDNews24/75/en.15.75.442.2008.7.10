<TITLE> Turk PM in Baghdad to boost ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Thu Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leaders of Iraq and Turkey held talks on security and economic cooperation on Thursday as they sought to strengthen ties strained by Kurdish PKK rebels who use northern Iraq to launch attacks on Turkish soil. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan earlier flew into Baghdad, the first Turkish leader to visit Iraq since the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. His visit is another sign regional countries are starting to re-engage with Iraq, where violence is at a four-year low. Erdogan was given a red-carpet welcome at Baghdad's airport, before heading to the heavily protected Green Zone government compound for talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group will be high on the agenda of Erdogan's talks. An Iraqi official said discussions would also focus on energy cooperation, investment, water supplies and the reconstruction of Iraq. Turkey's military launched a big ground offensive against the PKK inside northern Iraq in February, prompting concern in Washington about regional instability. Turkey's operations in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdistan region often draw protests from Baghdad. Ankara for its part has been highly critical of Baghdad's failure to deal with the several thousands guerrillas holed up in the north. Iraqi officials say the government has taken some measures, while noting it has major security challenges elsewhere. The PKK, which wants to establish an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey, uses the area as a base from which to stage attacks on targets inside neighboring Turkey. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, led a delegation of to Turkey in March, in a visit Erdogan said at the time would hopefully begin a "new page in Turkish-Iraqi relations". Ankara blames the PKK for 40,000 deaths since 1984 when the group took up arms. Like the United States and the European Union, Turkey considers the group a terrorist organization. Last September, Turkish and Iraqi officials signed an anti-terrorism deal in Ankara to tackle the PKK, although the two sides failed to agree on any border security cooperation. TURKEY A KEY TRADING PARTNER Erdogan's visit will also focus on economic ties. Turkey is one of Iraq's most important trading partners and Iraqi officials have called on Turkish firms to invest in Iraq. Turkish firms and products dominate northern Iraq's economy, and Turkish state energy firm TPAO is in oil exploration talks. Exports of oil from Iraq's northern Kirkuk fields flow through a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean. There are also plans for a natural gas link. During Talabani's visit to Ankara, Turkey's trade minister said bilateral trade between the two countries was targeted to reach $20 billion within two years, compared with more than $3.5 billion in 2007 and $940 million in 2003. Contracts won by Turkish construction firms in Iraq in 2007 topped $4 billion. Turkey views Kurdish northern Iraq with mixed emotions. On the one hand, it fears the emergence of a wealthy Kurdish independent state that could fuel separatist insurgency in its own Kurdish southeast. Turkey also fears Iraq's Kurds will wrest control of the disputed northern oil city of Kirkuk and turn it into the capital of a new state. But a blossoming of trade with the region could help revive Turkey's southeastern economy and alleviate the poverty that has fed rebellion there for over 20 years
