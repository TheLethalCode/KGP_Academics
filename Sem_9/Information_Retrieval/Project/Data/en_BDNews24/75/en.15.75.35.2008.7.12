 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government will again invite the BNP to dialogue, if necessary, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Saturday. "We are still determined to go ahead with all parties," the adviser told reporters after government dialogue with Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan at the Chief Adviser's Office. "The government is in touch with the BNP," said Rahman on hopes the party would join the dialogue. "The government had invited BNP earlier. A second invitation letter will be sent if necessary," Rahman said. In a news briefing, Rahman said Khelafat Andolan had proposed holding joint dialogue to take a final decision, after the end of bilateral dialogue. "The government is considering the demand." Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan chief Maulana Shah Ahmadullah Ashraf led the seven-member delegation to the talks. Mohammad Zafrullah Khan, the party's secretary general, said his party had placed a 30-point charter of demands during the dialogue. "If the government had kept the prices of essentials within the reach of ordinary people it would have remained in power until the doomsday." The government failed to do so, he said. The adviser said the government moved to stop businessmen raising commodity prices "irrationally". Rahman referred to the government's 100-day employment generation programme as one of the measures to ride out the price shock. Zafrullah said the government should make a list of all freedom fighters and declare them first-class citizens of the country. The significant proposals placed by the party include relaxation of the state of emergency during elections, vesting the Armed Forces magisterial powers on voting day, introducing presidential rule and declaring loan defaulters and their family members unfit for contesting the polls. The party also proposed awarding the Baitul Mukarram khatib an equal rank of the chief justice and freedom for the protesters of women's development policy. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the government side with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. The government started talks with political parties, professionals, business community and local government representatives on May 22 with the Workers Party of Bangladesh being the first. bdnews24.c
