 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The prime bourse ended nearly flat Tuesday, influenced by heavy buying and sell-offs. Increased investor participation led turnover and the trading volume on the country's twin bourses to rise from the previous day. An official with brokerage house Anchor Securities said trading perked up with investors betting money and locking in profits. "We have dealt with huge buying and selling orders," the official told bdnews24.com. Analysts said the day witnessed a rational trading with a passive atmosphere. "Although the general and all-share index remained almost flat but blue-chips rose, which is a good sign. Investors are betting on fundamentals, not rumours," said Bashir Ahmed, an investment consultant. Trade was quite rational with investors betting on market majors and the turnover going up significantly, said Ahmed who works for Stocks & Bonds. Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed echoed him. "Investors are making mature decisions."
