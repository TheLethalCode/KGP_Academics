 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com) Indices on the Dhaka Stock Exchange finished upbeat on the closing day of the week due to heavy buying in pharmaceuticals, power and textile shares. "Investors opted for pharma, power and textiles while selling off mutual funds and non-bank financial institutions," said an official of IDLC securities. Turnover and trading volume also increased substantially from the previous day. Market observers termed the day's trading as rational, and of an optimistic trend. "The blue chip rose relatively high compared to the other two indices, in a good sign that investors are acting maturely by betting on fundamentals not rumours," DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com.
