 New Delhi, July 09 (Reuters) - India's four communist parties handed over letters to the president on Wednesday formally announcing their withdrawal from supporting the government and requesting a no-confidence vote in parliament. "We have met the president and all four of our left parties have submitted letters withdrawing support from the UPA government," Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Prakash Karat told reporters. Communist parties that have provided the government with a parliamentary majority for four years said on Tuesday they were withdrawing their support in protest against the civilian nuclear deal.
