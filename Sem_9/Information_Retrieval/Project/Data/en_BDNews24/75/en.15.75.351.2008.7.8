 Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday urged the eight developing Islamic countries to create a fund to guarantee food security. Addressing the summit of the Developing-8, commonly known as D-8, in Kuala Lumpur, Fakhruddin stressed the need for working collectively in ensuring energy security in eight biggest Muslim countries that grouped into the D-8. Fakhruddin also said the D-8 members should take "tangible measures" so that people of the grouping could travel every country without visa. "Against the backdrop of current global food crisis, we should seriously consider creating a D-8 Food Fund to enhance our collective food security," the CA said in his speech. The unprecedented price hike of food-grains was "disproportionately affecting" the poor in many of the D-8 countries. Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey are the members of the D-8 formed in 1997. "We should collectively explore and implement capacity building programmes to ensure energy security of the member-states." "Among the D-8 members, we should be able to establish innovative financing mechanisms to ensure a steady supply of reliable and affordable energy," said Fakhruddin, a former central bank governor. The CA criticised the developed countries for, what he termed, their restrictive policies and practices on labour movement. "Opportunities for legal migration, however, remain limited because of various restrictive policies and practices in many destination countries," he said. "We should take concrete measures, and go beyond the visa agreement, to facilitate the movement of natural persons among the D-8 member-countries." Fakhruddin said D-8 should also take a common position on liberalisation of some services to ease the movement of labour to the developed economies. On economic cooperation among the D-8 countries, the chief adviser said: "Our model of economic cooperation must, however, strike a balance between equity and efficiency." "We must ensure equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities among the member-countries, taking into account the differences in our national circumstances." Trade among the D-8 countries stands at $49 billion, which is 9 percent of the world trade. In this context, the chief adviser said: "The full implementation of the preferential trade agreement (PTA) provisions will significantly boost the volume of trade." Fakhruddin went to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on July 7 and is likely to return home Tuesday. bdn
