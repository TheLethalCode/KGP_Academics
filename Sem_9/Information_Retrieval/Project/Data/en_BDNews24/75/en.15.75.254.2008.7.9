 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Wednesday rejected Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami's appeal for bail. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Court-3 turned down the bail appeal filed by barrister Abdur Razzak, state lawyer advocate Sheikh Golam Hafiz told bdnews24.com. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sep 2 with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 people, including ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia and her son Arafat Rahman Coco, on charges of awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through abuse of power. ACC deputy director Mohammad Zahirul Huda submitted a chargesheet in the case to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on May 13 accusing 25 people. Nine ministers, including Nizami, were implicated in the case later. bdnew
