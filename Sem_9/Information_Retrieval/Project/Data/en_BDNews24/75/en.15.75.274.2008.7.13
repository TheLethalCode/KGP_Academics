 Rajshahi, July 13 (bdnews24.com)Workers Party leader Fazle Hossain Badshah, the 14-party alliance's mayoral candidate for Rajshahi city, withdrew his candidacy Sunday. "I withdrew my candidacy on my own in an effort to keep the non-communal democratic force united," Badshah told reporters after withdrawing his candidacy around 4.30pm from the Rajshahi deputy election commissioner's office. Former Awami League MP Amzad Hossain and local AL leader Rafiq Uddin Ahmed accompanied him. Badshah's withdrawal cleared the way for Awami League leader Khairuzzaman Liton to run for mayor. The Awami League-led 14-party alliance endorsed four mayoral candidates for the forthcoming city corporation polls on Thursday. Local AL supporters had rejected the 14-party alliance's endorsement of Fazle Hasan Badshah as mayoral candidate. They had locked the AL offices in Kumarpara in protest against the endorsement of the Workers Party leader. A 'citizen committee' in Rajshahi city Friday called upon the 14-party alliance to endorse their chosen candidate Liton to run for mayor instead of the alliance-backed Badshah. bdnews2
