<TITLE> Rice in Prague to sign radar deal, Poland wary </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRAGUE, Tue Jul 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Tuesday negotiations with Poland on a missile shield deal remained incomplete hours before she was to sign a treaty in the Czech Republic on its part of the accord. The Bush administration wants to build the radar component of the missile defense system southwest of the Czech capital Prague, despite public opposition in the central European country as well as protests by Russia. The radar would be part of a shield protecting the United States and its European allies against a potential missile attacks from foes like Iran. Washington also wants to put 10 interceptor rockets in neighboring Poland, although talks on that have stalled due to Polish demands for billions of dollars to modernize its army and air defenses in return for hosting the missile base. Rice said she had constructive talks with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Monday but declined to predict on whether the two sides would reach an agreement. "We have told them what we can do... There are still some issues, so I can't say for certain what the trajectory is, but it was a constructive meeting yesterday," Rice told reporters as she flew to Prague. Analysts say the planned bases in the former Soviet bloc would raise U.S. security interests in the region at a time when Russia grows more assertive about its role on the global stage. Russia sees the shield as a threat, and has said it will aim its nuclear missiles at central Europe if the shield is deployed. The United States says the 10 rockets are no match for Russia's nuclear arsenal. But the plan still faces many hurdles, including widespread public opposition and tough ratification by the Czech parliament, where the three-party cabinet has just 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house. Several backbenchers have declared they would vote against it. The government must try to win over several independents to win the vote, which may possibly come only after a new US administration takes over from President George W Bush in January. Disputes over the radar have alienated many Czechs, wary of any foreign military presence after the Soviet invasion in 1968 and the following two decades of occupation. An opinion poll last month showed 68 percent of Czechs were against the shield, while 24 percent supported it. Rice will also travel to Bulgaria and Georgia on her European trip this week
