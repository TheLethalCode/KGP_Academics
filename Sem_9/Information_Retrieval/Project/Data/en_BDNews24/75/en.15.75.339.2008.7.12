 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Saturday ruled out fears of a food crisis and said domestic procurement and import were underway to build up an adequate stock in government warehouses. After a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase at the planning ministry Saturday, a government holiday, Mirza Aziz said the committee had approved a proposal for importing one lakh tonne of wheat. "A tonne of wheat will cost $419. Four bids have been received. The lowest bidder has been given approval," he said. "Wheat prices are fluctuating on the international market. A tonne of wheat was sold for $365 on the international market until July 5. Now it has crossed $400. " "Wheat output in Canada and the US was good this year. However, there are indications that wheat production was not very good in other countries," Mirza Aziz said. According to food ministry data, 6.11 lakh tonnes of paddy and rice have been deposited in government warehouses until Thursday thanks to the government procurement drive. The government has set a target to procure 12 lakh tonnes of rice and 3 lakh tonnes of paddy.
