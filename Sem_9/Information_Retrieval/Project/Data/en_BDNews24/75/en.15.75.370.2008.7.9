 TOYAKO, Japan, July 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Group of Eight rich nations urged the government of Afghanistan on Wednesday to take more responsibility for security, governance and reconstruction and pledged to increase assistance to that country's army and police. In a chairman's statement issued at the end of a three-day summit in northern Japan, the G8 also underscored its commitment to support presidential and parliamentary elections and agreed to strengthen assistance to the Afghan-Pakistan border region. "We renew our commitment to support Afghanistan," the statement said. Taliban militants have significantly stepped up their attacks on domestic targets and foreign troops this year, prompting concerns about the country's stability and the international rebuilding effort. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who led the discussion on Afghanistan at the summit, said all members agreed with "unprecedented unanimity" about the need to do much more. "I think every one of the G8 countries understands the question is critical, understands that success in Afghanistan is critical," he told reporters. "We have serious challenges there, and we simply must make progress on governance, on security and on development in the next 12 to 24 months. We have got to get this situation moving in the right direction," he said. Canada has 2,500 soldiers based in the southern city of Kandahar. So far, almost 90 soldiers have died since Canadian troops were sent to Afghanistan in late 2002. The government of President Hamid Karzai was elected after U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government following the Sept. 11 attacks, but the Taliban still pose a significant threat.
