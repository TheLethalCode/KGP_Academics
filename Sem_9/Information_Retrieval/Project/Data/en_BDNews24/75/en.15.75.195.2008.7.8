 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The import of capital machinery, important for industrial development in the country, is decreasing in signs of falling investment. According to the latest data of Bangladesh Bank on the first 11 months (July-May) of year 2007-08, the import of capital machinery declined 10.37 percent from the same period a year ago. On the other hand, the import of capital machinery increased 17 percent in July-May of 2006-07 compared with the same period of 2005-06. Business leaders expressed concern over the fall in the import of capital machinery and said the central bank statistics prove that investment was on the decline. "Business confidence has not fully returned. Businessmen and industrialists are investing cautiously, which is why the capital machinery import is dropping," BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "Capital machinery is most needed for setting up new industries. For industrial development in a country, the capital machinery import must grow by at least 15 percent," said Chowdhury, member of Bangladesh Better Business Forum. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Fazlul Hoque told bdnews24.com: "Whether the government admits it or not, there is no doubt investment is falling. The central bank's information about the import of capital machinery proves it." "The main yardstick of whether investment is increasing or decreasing is the import of capital machinery," said Hoque, another member of BBBF. "The gas and power crisis is a main problem for the industries sector. The industries which are in operation are not running properly due to the gas and power crisis. Entrepreneurs are not showing interest to set up new industries. That is why the import of capital machinery has decreased," he said. bdnews
