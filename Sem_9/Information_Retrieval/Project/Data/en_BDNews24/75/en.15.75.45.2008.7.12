 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)--A major reshuffle in the local administration is likely in August ahead of the upazila polls, an election commissioner has said. The Election Commission has asked the government to reorganise the field-level administration in the interest of free, fair, peaceful and neutral polls, EC M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com Thursday. The Cabinet Division in a recent order had asked the administration to act neutrally in the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities set for Aug 4. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at a recent meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed asked for a reshuffle in the administration soon. The government needs EC permission to transfer or appoint any official to any administrative post during the period from the announcement of an election schedule to 15 days after the polls, an official with the EC secretariat said. The CEC had earlier said the upazila polls might be held in early October. However, the EC has not asked for any change in the administration of the four cities and nine municipalities ahead of the polls. Sakhawat Hussain said the EC would take the August 4 city and municipality polls as a 'test and trial' case. "Through the polls, the EC wants to find out who influences polls and how. EC would find out whether past allegations of vote rigging were true at all," Sakhawat said. The EC would take a tough line on any misconduct by candidates and keep an eye on officials involved. A senior official of the EC secretariat said that the EC, on July 5, asked the police administration to transfer Manikganj Sadar police chief Yasin Ali. The top election office asked the establishment ministry to take action against additional divisional commissioner for Rajshahi, Md Aktaruzzaman, accused of approving candidacy of loan defaulters, the official said. The EC also requested the law ministry to take action against Notary Public Advocate Bayzid F Bostami, the official added. The cabinet division has recently asked the local administration to cooperate with the Election Commission to hold free, fair and peaceful polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities. The authorities also warned local administrations against any irregularity, neglect of duty, non-cooperation, misconduct and wrong information. bdnews
