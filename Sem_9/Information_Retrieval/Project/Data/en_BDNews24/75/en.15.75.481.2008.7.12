 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Jubo League Saturday announced a weeklong programme to press home a series of demands, including withdrawal of cases against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. The AL's front organisation made the announcement at the AL headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. In a written statement, Jubo League leader Mizanur Rahman said: "The government's anticorruption drive has turned into a drive to curb politics." "The drive is aimed at making Bangladesh into a country without politics," he alleged. Jubo League also asked the government to withdraw all charges against its chairman Jahangir Kabir Nanok and general secretary Mirza Azam. "False cases were filed against them to harass them politically," Mizanur said. Jubo League demanded that the government release all the leaders of AL and its associate organisations to hold a meaningful dialogue with the party and create a favourable environment for elections. The programmes include holding a joint convention of the north and south units of Dhaka Jubo League on July 14 at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium and a token hunger strike in upazilas from 10am to 2pm on July 16. bdnews
