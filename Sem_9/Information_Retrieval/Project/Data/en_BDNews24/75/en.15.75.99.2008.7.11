<TITLE> GE to sell Japan lenders to Shinsei: sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - General Electric Co will sell its Japanese consumer finance operation to Shinsei Bank Ltd, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the US company looks to unload assets globally. Shinsei will pay 580 billion yen ($5.4 billion) for the Japanese arm of GE Consumer Finance, said one of the sources, all of whom would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not yet been announced. In Japan, unlisted GE Consumer Finance includes a moneylender, Lake, as well as a credit card and housing loan operation. The deal may be finalized in the next few days, the sources said, putting an end to GE's year-long efforts to pull out of consumer finance in Japan, where changing government regulation has eroded industry profits. GE had previously said it was looking to sell Lake, but did not say anything about the entire Japanese consumer finance business. The US firm said on Thursday it will look to spin off to shareholders its entire consumer and industrial unit, signaling it wants to part with a large part of its portfolio, not just the $7 billion appliance arm it has been looking to sell. GE has been hit by calls from analysts and investors to simplify its sprawling operations, which range from jet engines to the media business. The deal also marks a significant bet by Japan's Shinsei, which is about one-third owned by US buyout firm J.C. Flowers & Co. The lender is wagering that it can build a profitable moneylender by leveraging its brand and retail bank operations. "In order to survive the regulation changes over the next two years the key is to get more market share," said Kristine Li, an analyst at KBC Securities in Tokyo. "Profitability will never be as good as it used to be, therefore volume is critical." Consumer lenders have seen their profits slide after Japan's parliament approved a law to lower the maximum interest rate they can charge. The regulations will go into effect by 2009, and moneylenders have already lowered their rates in anticipation. They have also been forced to repay previous interest that is now deemed illegally high. Lake has an outstanding loan balance of 650 billion yen, making it Japan's sixth-largest consumer finance firm, according to industry group data. OUTMANOEUVRED Consumer lenders Acom Co Ltd and Promise Co Ltd had also been bidding for Lake, but were outmaneuvered by Shinsei and eventually dropped out, the sources said. Acom is about 13 percent owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest bank, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the country's No.3 bank, owns about 20 percent of Promise. The price of 580 billion is considerably higher than market expectations, although previous reports said the deal would just be for Lake. No one was immediately available for comment at Shinsei. A spokeswoman for GE in Japan, who declined to be identified, said the company "did not have any updates" on the sale. As part of the deal, Shinsei will only be responsible for repaying up to 206 billion yen worth of legal claims on overcharged interest, with the rest to be shouldered by GE, said one of the sources. While the stricter regulation has pushed many moneylenders into debt and prompted industry consolidation, some Japanese banks see the turmoil as an opportunity to take market share. Shinsei already owns about two-thirds of both finance firm Aplus Co Ltd and consumer lender Shinki Co Ltd. It was not immediately clear how Shinsei would integrate the new units with its existing operations. Shinsei, which introduced 24-hour banking to a country where retail banking services lags those in many Western countries, believes it can make a similar change to consumer lending. The bank's president, Thierry Porte, has said it will be able to build a "new model" for the industry. Shares of Shinsei ended Friday trade down 3 percent at 358 yen, underperforming Tokyo's index of bank stocks, which ended flat
