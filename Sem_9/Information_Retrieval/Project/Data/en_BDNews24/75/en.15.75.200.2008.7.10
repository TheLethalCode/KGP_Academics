 HARARE, Thu Jul 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition MDC will on Thursday begin preliminary talks in South Africa on ending Zimbabwe's political crisis, an opposition source said. Both sides have been under heavy international pressure to enter negotiations since Mugabe's widely condemned re-election in a June 27 poll scarred by campaign violence. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition, which boycotted the election because of violence that it said killed 103 of its supporters, had until now refused to enter talks. It said negotiations could not resume until the violence ended and Mugabe accepted the result of the first round of the election in March, which was won by MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The MDC source said preliminary talks starting on Thursday would discuss ending the violence. "Our team is in South Africa, where they will have preliminary talks with ZANU-PF, starting today. It means something is happening. So these are not the actual talks, but preliminary discussions on what the talks will focus on," the source said. "This is where we are going to talk about issues of violence and it is from these discussions that the MDC will decide whether to engage in full negotiations if our conditions for an end to political violence are met. We will also have to agree on the agenda for the talks." Diplomatic sources in Pretoria also said the two sides had agreed to talks, which have previously been mediated by South Africa as the designated regional negotiator. CRISIS The violent June 27 election and its condemned outcome have worsened the crisis in Zimbabwe, whose economy has collapsed, sending millions of refugees into neighboring states and increasing pressure for a solution. The African Union, at a summit last month, called for talks leading to a national unity government. Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in a March 29 first round presidential poll but fell short of the absolute majority required to avoid a run-off. The MDC leader pulled out six days ahead of the second round because of the violent campaign against his supporters. Mugabe blames the opposition for the bloodshed. Western nations led by former colonial ruler Britain and the United States are pushing the UN Security Council this week to impose sanctions on Mugabe's inner circle South African President Thabo Mbeki has mediated unsuccessfully in the Zimbabwean crisis for more than a year, drawing increasing criticism. The MDC says he favors Mugabe and has called for expanded mediation
