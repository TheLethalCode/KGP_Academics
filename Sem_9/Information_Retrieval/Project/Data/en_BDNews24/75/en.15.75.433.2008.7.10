 MOSCOW/TBLISI, Thu Jul 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday its air force fighters had flown over the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia to prevent an attack by Georgian forces. The overflight was ordered less than 24 hours before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Georgia in a show of support for the ex-Soviet state, which wants to join NATO. Georgia denounced the flights as an unprecedented aggression and Rice also admonished Russia, saying "it needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it." "The violence needs to stop and whoever is perpetrating it, and I have mentioned this to the president, there should not be violence," she told a joint news conference with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. Russia supports separatists in two Georgian breakaway regions and the Russian foreign ministry said its jets had overflown South Ossetia because it believed Georgia was preparing to attack the rebel region. "The need arose to take urgent and active measures to prevent bloodshed and keep the situation within peaceful bounds," it said in a statement. "In order to clarify the situation, aircraft of the Russian air force carried out a brief flight over the territory of South Ossetia," it added. "As subsequent events showed, this step allowed (us) to cool hot heads in Tbilisi and prevent events developing along military lines, the likelihood of which was more than real.
