<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Saturday that if anyone contested local government polls in violation of the decision of his party and the four-party alliance, the party would not take the blame. "Whether or not to abide by the decision is one's personal matter. The party and the alliance will take a decision against violators," said the Khaleda Zia-nominated secretary general in a news briefing in his NAM flat. Earlier, Abdul Mannan Khan, former principal of Shahid Asad College of Shibpur upazila in Narsinghdi joined the BNP formally by handing Delwar a bouquet. Delwar congratulated Mannan on his joining the party and hoped the joining would help make the party stronger at the local and national levels. Ousted former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, now in jail in the Gatco graft case, was also a lawmaker of the same area. Criticising the caretaker government, Delwar said: "The caretaker government wants to grab democracy by implementing its blueprint. The people will not accept it anyway." He asked the people to be aware of what he termed the government's conspiracy against the country. The secretary general of the divided party asked the government to release BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. "BNP wants to join the dialogue ahead of the elections under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. Otherwise, we won't go to the dialogue," he said. He also demanded that Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco be sent abroad for better medical treatment. Delwar said that the government was plotting to hand over oil and gas and Chittagong port to 'foreigners'. "We have to stop the plot," he said. "The countrymen will not allow it anything that poses a threat to the country's democracy and sovereignty. BNP and the four-party alliance will tackle the threat at any cost." bdnew
