 Jessore, July 14 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Monday the non-partisan caretaker government was even-handed in its approach to political parties. Speaking at government's dialogue with local representatives in Jessore, Fakhruddin claimed that the government did not show bias in its dealings with any party. His comment came days after BNP, one of the two top political parties, accused the government of showing bias towards the Awami League, a political rival of the BNP. Keshabpur Press Club president Ashrafuzzaman Khan presided over the discussion, also joined by law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Fakhruddin said the Election Commission took preparations to hold elections to 300 to 350 upazilas by October. "Elections to other upazilas will be held in phases." Emphasising the need for a fear-free election environment, the chief adviser said: "The necessary environment for elections will be ensured. The government will make the voting environment is free from fear." Work for development of the agricultural sector has started, the CA said. "The government has stressed development of the agricultural sector to ensure food security. Farm subsidies will continue." Fakhruddin said the government would continue its effort to control prices of essential commodities. The CA said the government has taken up a project to construct 2,750 bridges across the country.
