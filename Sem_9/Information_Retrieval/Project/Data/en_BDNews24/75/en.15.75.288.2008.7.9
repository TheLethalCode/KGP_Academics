Rather, we should get together and help the nation tide over the crisis." Khaleda demanded again that the government to send her sons Tarique and Coco abroad for treatment. Explaining the circumstances of her sons, Khaleda said: "My sons Tarique and Coco are the sons of a freedom fighter, sons of a former president. They were orphaned as mere boys, when their father was killed by his fellow army men." "My sons today have been implicated in false cases. They have been ill and not receiving proper treatment. That's why I demand of the government to send them abroad for treatment." Khaleda was produced in court Wednesday morning for charge framing proceedings in the Gatco graft case. She was brought to judge Shahed Nuruddin's special court at around 10:15 am from the nearby special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex. The former prime minister's detained younger son Coco, also accused in the case, was not produced for the hearing as he has been exempted from court appearance on medical grounds. Other accused were present in the Special Judge's Court-3. Charge framing in the case began on June 30, when public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajol read out 22 allegations brought against the accused. The prosecution was continuing with its charges through Wednesday. Khaleda, Coco and 23 others accused in the case are charged with awarding Gatco a contract for handling containers at depots in Dhaka and Chittagong that incurred huge losses to the state. Misuse of power and collusion among the accused in violating the tender conditions are among the charges brought under the case. Khaleda and Coco were arrested from their Dhaka Cantonment residence on September 3 last year a day after the filing of the case. The ACC filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others initially. The antigraft body pressed charges on May 13 this year against a total of 25 people. The name of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, one of the original accused, was dropped from the chargesheet after his death. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. bdnews24.
