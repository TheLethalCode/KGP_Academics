 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet approved the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008 in principle Sunday, which bans political parties from running front organisations, said a government spokesman. After a meeting of the council of advisers at the Chief Adviser's Office, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters that the ordinance was sent to the law ministry for vetting. Munaim said the ordinance would likely get final approval and be published in a gazette by the end of this month. According to the ordinance, a national polls aspirant has to attach a document carrying signatures of 1 percent of the total voters in his constituency with his nomination paper. False information on the nomination paper may lead to cancellation of one's candidacy, Munaim said. If two candidates bag the equal highest number of voters, a re-election will be held, Munaim said. The ordinance says that a person sentenced to a minimum of two years in jail in criminal cases will not be eligible to contest the next national polls. Besides, those already served their sentences would have to wait for five years for contesting an election from the day his jail term expired. Besides, those adopted foreign citizenships and those were declared bankrupt by court, sacked from government offices on charges of corruption or forced to go on leave would have to wait five years to contest the polls. Apart from this, those who went into voluntary retirement will be able to contest the polls three years after retirement. People defaulting on loan repayments for six months before the time of nomination paper submission will not be able to contest the polls. Any person declared war criminal by a local or international court will not be eligible to run for elections. Provisions were added to the Representation of the People Ordinance to maintain transparency in candidacy, nomination and fund of political parties, Munaim said. A party will not be allowed to form an alliance with any unregistered party. A candidate will not be able to enter the election race from more than three constituencies. If anybody signs up for more than three constituencies, all of his applications will be cancelled, according to the ordinance. The ordinance has a provision for 'no' vote for the voters who are undecided over a candidate. If the number of 'no vote' exceeds 50 percent of the total votes, the returning officer will cancel voting of the constituency and announce a re-election by informing the Election Commission. bdnews24.c
