<TITLE> As communists fade, India's new kingmaker emerges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, July 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former wrestler who once counted a "bandit queen" as his ally has now thrown a lifeline to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, forgetting years of snubs and animosity from the government to emerge as a kingmaker. The withdrawal of the government's communist allies to protest a civilian nuclear deal with the United States has left an embattled government reaching out to Mulayam Singh and his Samajwadi Party to secure its parliamentary majority. The government will now have to negotiate with the former defence minister and his right hand man Amar Singh on issues from the nuclear deal to cabinet posts, from economic reforms to measures to tame inflation in a trillion dollar economy. "Mulayam is a very experienced operator who negotiates hard and has his eyes set on power," said Kuldip Nayar, a political expert and author on Indian history and current affairs. Mulayam Singh's rise to power highlights the peculiarities of coalition government in India, where national parties like the ruling Congress increasingly have to deal with the emergence of smaller caste and regional-based parties to stay in power. The Samajwadi leader is a controversial choice. He faces a corruption probe by police and critics said he did little to stop rising criminality in his home state of Uttar Pradesh. Mulayam Singh for years dominated Uttar Pradesh where he was chief minister three times. He is seen as a liberal and secular, more open to negotiation with the government than the strongly ideological communist parties. "The only difference between us and the left is that we are not rigid in our attitude," Amar Singh said in a recent Reuters interview. "We have not given unconditional support. We are not likely to give it either." Mulayam Singh relies on votes of Muslims and farmers from the Yadav caste but he lost the last election to Mayawati, another caste-based politician known as the "Queen of the Dalits", after a voter backlash of rising lawlessness in the state. His ambition will be to fight Mayawati. Despite years of the ruling Congress party and Mulayam battling each other in Uttar Pradesh, the state with the largest number of seats in the national parliament, Mayawati has now become a common enemy. The Samajwadi Party has a colourful history in one of India's poorest, most feudal and corrupt states. "Bandit Queen" Phoolan Devi, an outlaw who rampaged through Uttar Pradesh in the 1980s, joined it before she was gunned down. But it is also a party known for pragmatism. "Mulayam talks politics. Amar does the business," said New Delhi-based political analyst Mahesh Rangarajan. Amar Singh has called on a windfall tax on oil companies, banning exports of petroleum products and using foreign reserves to strengthen the rupee, a sign of the challenges the more orthodox prime minister may face before scheduled May 2009 elections. Mulayam Singh's right-hand man Amar Singh has links to billionaire Anil Ambani, head of Reliance Communications, one of India's biggest companies. He is known for lavish parties and his links to Bollywood stars such as Amitabh Bachchan. Critics say the Samajwadi Party has become a lobbying tool for Indian businesses. Some investors believe it just means the party will be more pro-business than the communist parties, who stymied years of free market reforms from the government. Congress party head Sonia Gandhi famously snubbed Amar Singh four years ago when she did not invite him to a dinner after deciding to form a government with the communists rather than the Samajwadi. Now the two parties rely on each other. It is an alliance that may continue until the next general elections. "Mulayam will be a very difficult partner for the government," said Rangarajan. "His pressure on the government will be enormous and the cost will only be seen later." "Has the government moved from the frying pan to the fire? Only time will tell."
