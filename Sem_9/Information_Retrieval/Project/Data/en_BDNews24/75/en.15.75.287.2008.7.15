 Washington, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunday's bold Taliban raid that killed nine American soldiers was no surprise to analysts who have been warning that the U.S. effort in Afghanistan needs more troops, aid and attention. In the latest sign of a marked increase of violence in Afghanistan this year, Taliban insurgents took over a nearby village and used buildings there to launch a complex assault on an outpost near the Pakistan border. "What we're watching is not some sudden upsurge," said security expert Anthony Cordesman of the center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The attack, which caused the biggest single U.S. loss of troops in Afghanistan since 2005, follows "a systematic growth in Taliban and Islamist influence backed by sanctuary and the regrowth of al Qaeda as a major force in Pakistan," he said. Cordesman said the Taliban do not always confront U.S. or allied troops in conflict. But the area under the influence of the Islamist group and their allies "has just about doubled every year since 2005," he said. Experts have warned that the Taliban have capitalized on a mixture of poor governance and economic hardship in Afghanistan, thriving trade in opium, U.S. policy mistakes and disarray in Pakistan to bounce back in many parts of the country after their 2001 ouster by U.S. and coalition forces. "The legion of failures both by the international community and due to the weakness of (Afghan President Hamid) Karzai are numerous and they're lethal," said Christine Fair, a South Asia expert at the RAND Corporation. "Because we have massively failed across every single vector of stabilizing Afghanistan, the Taliban are going to have supporters," she said, citing as key errors a failure to train Afghan police and poor international aid coordination. TROOPS, AID, DIPLOMACY Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama unveiled in on Monday a new strategy that would provide "at least two additional combat brigades" for Afghanistan. "We need more troops, more helicopters, better intelligence-gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there," he wrote in the New York Times. In addition to addressing shortfalls estimated at two to three brigades in a U.S. troop presence that stood at 36,000 on Monday, the United States needs to deliver development aid to Afghanistan and bordering areas in Pakistani, analysts said. "If we are going to succeed in 'win, hold, build,' we've got to have aid money and services that go out in the field, where the Taliban can win almost by default because there's no money, no governance and no security," said Cordesman. Last month in Paris, donors led by the United States pledged about $20 million in aid to Afghanistan, but many supporters there voiced complaints about corruption and inefficiency in Karzai's government. Stemming violence in Afghanistan also requires closer work with Pakistan, whose foreign minister visited Washington last week and rejected U.S. complaints about al Qaeda and Taliban militants insurgent havens in Pakistan's tribal regions. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also said Pakistan rejected the idea, suggested by Obama and other politicians, of U.S. troops attacking militants in its border regions. Cordesman said such attacks would be ineffective without full cooperation from Pakistan in closing off the havens. "No matter what we do ... we can't create a structure of stability by limited operations in the border area as long as there is sanctuary in Pakistan," he said. Asked about Sunday's attack and U.S. policy toward the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Washington and Islamabad were trying to deal with conditions on Pakistan's side of the border. "Discussions at a variety of levels have taken place in recent weeks and I suspect that those will continue as we try to address the border region problem in a comprehensive way," Whitman said.
