 Beijing, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiators trying to move forward with disarming North Korea began a second day of talks on Friday that aim to agree on methods to verify the North's own account of its nuclear activities. Envoys described the opening of the talks, the first session in more than nine months, as helpful but far from conclusive, as they seek to agree on a guideline for verifying North Korea's declaration. "Our goals should be to turn new expectations of various parties into a new consensus and to turn new aspirations into new momentum," Chinese chief envoy and chair of the talks Wu Dawei said at the opening on Thursday. The negotiators, from North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and host China, are seeking to push forward a preliminary disarmament deal that saw Pyongyang freeze and begin disabling its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. In exchange for those steps, and for handing over last month the declaration originally due at the end of 2007, North Korea will receive much-needed energy aid and the promise of improved diplomatic relations for the isolated state. But questions remain about the ambitions of North Korea, which defied international warnings by testing a nuclear device in 2006. In particular, Washington suspects that the North was secretly trying to enrich uranium, another path to making material for nuclear weapons. Chief U.S. envoy Christopher Hill has hinted that disagreement remained among the six countries over whether the declaration was adequate. Negotiators have also said there was discord over the specifics of how to verify the North's statement. The negotiating session is expected to wrap up on Saturday.
