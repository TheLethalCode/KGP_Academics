<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  Angry clients of BRAC Bank Monday confined a magistrate to the Detective Branch Headquarters after he refused to show them the retrieved jewellery robbed from the bank's lockers in January. The clients, who lost their gold ornaments to a heist in the bank's Dhanmondi branch, said they had been called in to identify their own jewellery but were later denied on the grounds of legal restriction. Forty-six clients gathered at the DB headquarters. Magistrate Shahin Uddin had asked them to apply individually to identify the ornaments, which prompted them to confine him in a room for an hour. The clients staged protests on the scene. Senior police officers calmed the situation. In January, robbers pillaged 60 lockers of BRACK Bank's Dhanmondi branch. Police retrieved 427 bhori of lost ornaments. The clients also came at the DB headquarters on June 23 to identify their valuables, but the magistrate was absent. bdnew
