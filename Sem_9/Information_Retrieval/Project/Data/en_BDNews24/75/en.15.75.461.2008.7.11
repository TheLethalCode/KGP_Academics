<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's industrial output rose 3.8 percent in May from a year earlier, sharply below the previous month's downwardly revised 6.2 percent, data showed on Friday. The figure was well below a forecast for growth of 7.2 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. Output growth has fallen from the double-digit levels seen early last year as tight monetary policy and a stronger rupee lowered demand. Manufacturing production rose 3.9 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with a provisional 7.5 percent in April. Industrial output rose 8.1 percent in fiscal 2007/08 (April-March), compared with 11.6 percent in 2006/07
