Sunrise Sporting Club will take on Diganta Prasari of Rajshahi in the opener. The decision was taken by the B. League committee, which also deferred the start of the qualifiers, originally scheduled for July 25, by one day. It will now begin on July 26, said the tournament committee coordinator Fazlur Rahman Babul. A total of 11 teams, split into three groups, will play the robin-round league basis matches and five teams from three groups will join 11 clubs from B. League for the 16-team finals. Babul said the BFF plans to play the qualifiers except the opener at the Army Stadium, but they are yet to get response for the army sports board following the appeal to allot the stadium. In another meeting of the BFF, the Futsal Committee decided to hold a Futsal tournament with eight Dhaka teams from the professional football league taking part in the meet. Babul said the committee decided to give Tk 20,000 to each of eight teams and it also provided the rules and regulations of the Futsal to the club officials. The participating teams would sit Monday and would finalise a suitable date for the tournament, added Babul.
