 LONDON, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A report that the US government is mulling a takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac supported banking stocks on Friday but bonds fell and the dollar was flat as investors focused on the glum reason for the move. Oil jumped nearly $2 a barrel to above $143, erasing the sharp losses seen at the beginning of the week. The New York Times reported that the Bush administration was mulling a plan to take over one or both struggling mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placing them in conservatorship. Such a move would guarantee the mortgages that the government-sponsored entities own, but could leave shareholders with nothing. The report lifted banking stocks, helping the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares up to rise 0.2 percent. "At the very least people need to be aware of the fact that with an election looming (or even without it), Fannie and Freddie being allowed to go down in flames is about as likely as (Federal Reserve Chairman Ben) Bernanke getting his old job back at the South of the Border Mexican-themed rest area," ABN AMRO said in a note. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average edged down 0.2 percent, but bank shares such as Mizuho Financial Group rose reversing direction. "After reading the article, the impression is that the government takeover would be very difficult, given their large debt and burden on taxpayers," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. The benchmark Nikkei ended down 27.52 points at 13,039.69. The index lost 1.5 percent for the week. The broader Topix lost 0.4 percent to 1,285.91. RISING OIL, WORRIES ABOUND Oil extended the 4 percent gains in the past session on heightened geopolitical worries in Iran and Nigeria, as well as fears of supply disruption in Brazil. U.S. crude was up around $1.90 to around $143.50 a barrel, after jumping $5.60 a barrel on Thursday. "There are continuing concerns over oil supplies over the short term," said Gerard Burg of National Australia Bank in Melbourne. The rises were taking oil back up to towards its record of $145.85, hit last week before a sharp downturn. The dollar consolidated near one=week lows versus a basket of major currencies, its decline halted by a recovery in US and European equity markets and the slightly improved sentiment on the financial sector. "For the time (the NYT article) is just giving a little boost to the greenback, but I think we have to stay cautious," said Carole Laulhere, currency strategist at Societe Generale in Paris. The euro was steady at $1.5773, near a one-week high of $1.5800 and back near the top end of the $1.5300 and $1.5910 range that it has been trapped in for the past two months. The dollar index steadied at 72.566, having hit a one-week low of 72.412 on Thursday. The dollar was flat at 107.16 yen. Euro zone government bond prices fell. Two-year cash yields were at 4.421 percent, around 4 basis points more than in late Thursday trade while 10-year Bunds were around 2 basis points higher at 4.406 percent
