"We look forward to positive results from this heads of delegation meeting," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said when making the announcement for the talks. Hosted by China, they also include the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and the United States. This round of talks is provisionally scheduled to last for three days, Qin said.
