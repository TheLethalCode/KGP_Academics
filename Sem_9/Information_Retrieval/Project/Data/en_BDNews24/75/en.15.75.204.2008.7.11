<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam allayed fears Thursday that the 100 days' employment generation scheme might cause inflation at the local level by increasing purchasing power beyond the supply of goods in local markets. Speaking at the conclusion of a two-day policy workshop on "100 days' employment generation: scope of implementation and challenges", the finance adviser said: "As the communications system throughout the country is good there will be no problem in reaching commodities from one area to another." As people's purchasing power is boosted through the scheme, the demand for goods will be met, said Mirza Aziz. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman echoed the finance adviser: "It has to be kept in mind that the project will not increase inflation at the local level." Bangladesh designed the 100 days' work generation programme on a similar model implemented in India. Adviser to the Indian finance minister, Shubhashish Ganguly, speaking at the workshop Wednesday, had mentioned that although the programme was successful in India inflation rose at the local level. "Inflation increased as money reached the grassroots people but commodities were not delivered in the same proportion," he said. But, he added: "As there is federal government in India movement of commodities from one state to another faces some problems. Bangladesh does not have the same problem." Asked about the likelihood of the work scheme triggering inflation here, finance adviser Mirza Aziz said: "Tk 2000 crore has been allocated to the employment generation programme. Compared to national economy, it is a small amount. So there is no probability of rising inflation." "Inflation may be created in one or two pockets, but it would not create an insurmountable problem," he added Under the programme the government will provide employment to more than 20 lakh people over 2008-09. Monga-hit, haor-baor and river erosion areas will be given priority under the programme. Every eligible worker will be guaranteed Tk 100 per day in wages under the scheme. If no work can be offered, they will be given a fixed amount of cash to meet the immediate expenses of their families. The finance adviser sstressed: "There will be no negative impact on the labour market. We have fixed the wage limit o that the labour market can operate normally." Asked what kind of work would be taken up under the programme, Mirza Azizs listed rural roads, utilising fallow government land, vegetable gardens, excavation of ponds and their renovation. He said the programme would not have much impact on the local and upazila elections. World Bank and private research organisation, Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC), jointly organised the two-day workshop. Economist and Samunnay chairman Atiur Rahman, BRAC Development Institute executive director Syed M Hashemi, Grameen Bank deputy managing director Dipal C Barua, PKSF managing director Kazi Mezbahuddin Ahmed and additional secretary of the finance ministry Mahbub Ahmed were among those present at the concluding session. bdnew
