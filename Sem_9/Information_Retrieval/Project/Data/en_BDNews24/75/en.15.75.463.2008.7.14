 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh under-21 hockey team suffered another painful 8-2 defeat to Pakistan in the Men's Junior Asia Cup in Hyderabad, India, Monday. The Bangladeshi boys took a 2-1 lead in the first half against the mighty opponents, who bounced back in the second half scoring six goals to seal the match. Asaduzzaman Chandan converted a penalty corner to give Bangladesh a second-minute lead before Kashif Ali levelled the margin for Pakistan in the 22nd minute, also converting a penalty corner. Two minutes later, striker Iqbal Nader put Bangladesh again ahead through a field goal and Bangladesh went for a lemon break with a 2-1 lead. After the breather, the scenario changed as Pakistan reorganised and pressed hugely on the Bangladesh territory as Abdul Hashem Khan, Shafoat Rasool and Jubair struck two goal each while Inayat Ullah scored one goal to seal the match. Bangladesh went 8-0 down to South Korea in their pool opener and handed a 7-1 defeat to Oman in their second match Sunday.
