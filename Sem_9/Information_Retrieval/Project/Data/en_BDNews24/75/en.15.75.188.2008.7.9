 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government is set to kick off a campaign for increasing the use of renewable power and energy, the chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim said Wednesday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will inaugurate a workshop at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel Thursday as part of the campaign, Tamim said at a press conference at the power, energy and mineral resources ministry. The workshop will be followed by a two-day exhibition of energy-efficient and renewable energy producing equipment in the hotel. Thirty-five government and private companies will take part in the exhibition. Tamim said the use of renewable energy kept rising across the world. "In Germany, 20 percent of total energy is renewable." "We need to create awareness among people about the necessity of using renewable energy and solar power, and preserving energy," Tamim said. The CA's special aide said solar power and power produced from biogas in Bangladesh accounted for only 15 megawatts. The government will offer incentives including loans to encourage the use of energy-efficient technology, Tamim said. Power division secretary Fouzul Kabir Khan was present at the press conference. bdnew
