 JERUSALEM, Sun Jul 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspicions of fraud mounted on Sunday against Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert with the publication in a newspaper of what it said were invoices backing police allegations he made duplicate claims for travel expenses. Denying any wrongdoing, Olmert flew to Paris for the launch of a French-inspired Mediterranean Union amid renewed calls in Israel for his resignation in the latest chapter -- dubbed "Olmert Tours" by the Israeli media -- of a corruption probe. On Friday, police said they were now examining whether Olmert, as mayor of Jerusalem and then trade minister, received duplicate funding for travel abroad from different public bodies and used the excess money to pay for private family trips. The veteran politician has long made visits overseas to deliver fund-raising speeches for various charities and groups or to speak at pro-Israeli events. The Haaretz newspaper published on Sunday on its front page copies of what it said were two invoices from the Rishon Tours travel company that charged two organizations for the same flights Olmert took between New York and Tel Aviv. The first invoice, dated May 19, 2005, and stating "For: Mr. Olmert/Ehud", billed Israel's Soldiers' Welfare Committee $6,616.65 for a first-class, round-trip ticket, with a June 8, 2005 departure date and a return leg on June 9. The second, dated May 24, 2005 and also listing Olmert's name, billed the Israel Policy Forum $7,813.65 for the identical flights. Olmert, Haaretz said, appeared at separate events for both organizations during his brief stay in New York. The newspaper did not disclose how it obtained the invoices. Olmert, who served as mayor of Jerusalem for 10 years until 2003 and then as a cabinet minister before succeeding Ariel Sharon as prime minister in early 2006, rejected the allegations that surfaced after he was questioned by police on Friday for a third time in the corruption investigation. "The reports and the leaks that emerged a short time after the questioning constitute a grave breach of acceptable norms," Olmert told reporters on the plane to Paris. "I was amazed by those distorted statements coming from members of law enforcement apparatus ... This could only harm the public's trust," Olmert said. PEACE EFFORTS The corruption case, which had focused on testimony from U.S. fundraiser Morris Talansky that he had given Olmert $150,000 over 15 years, could force him from office and disrupt peace efforts he has begun with the Palestinians and Syria. "The public can no longer tolerate this mockery," legislator Sheli Yehimovitch of the Labour Party, Olmert's main coalition partner, told Israel Radio, demanding he quit. "There's a limit to what the citizens of Israel should take from this person." In Paris, Olmert and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will attend the session of the Union for the Mediterranean. No meeting is scheduled between the two. Olmert is due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the French capital to continue discussions on a framework statehood deal they are trying to achieve before US President George W. Bush leaves office in January. Longtime enemies Israel and Syria are engaged in indirect peace talks through Turkish mediators. Some critics say Olmert's peace push forms part of the prime minister's strategy to save his job. Olmert has rejected the allegation and pledged to resign if indicted in the investigation. Olmert's lawyers are due to cross-examine Talansky this coming week in Jerusalem. Olmert has said any funds he received from the New York-based businessman were legitimate contributions to election campaigns
