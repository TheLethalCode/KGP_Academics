<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)Awami League on Sunday announced a "hunger strike" on July 19 protesting unabated hikes in price of essential commodities. The party will also hold a meeting on July 15 at its central office on Bangabandhu Avenue against "attacks on freedom fighters", said a senior party figure. Syed Ashraful Islam, AL's acting general secretary, announced the programmes at the close of a presidium meeting held at the residence of the party's acting president Zillur Rahman. "The government should not keep reciting the example of global prices to justify the relentless price hikes hitting the people here so badly," Ashraful said. Protesting the alleged harassment of a freedom fighter at a recent Jama'at-e-Islami backed Jatiya Muktijoddha Parishad conference, he said: "Strong punitive measures must be taken against those who were involved in humiliating a freedom fighter." Freedom fighter Sheikh Mohammad Ali Aman from Tangail was reportedly harassed in the conference at the Engineers Institution auditorium in the city Friday. Ashraful also told reporters that presidium members have yet to take any further decision about the 14-party endorsement for the Rajshahi mayoral polls, which has met with resistance in the city. Asked what the party will do if AL's executive council member Khairuzzaman Liton does not withdraw himself from the mayoral race, to make way for alliance-endorsed Workers Party leader Fazle Hossain Badshah, Ashraful said: "Please wait and maybe by this afternoon you'll be getting some positive news." Earlier, the acting secretary general called upon the caretaker government to make necessary arrangements to allow ailing former AL minister Mohammad Nasim abroad for appropriate medical treatment. He also asked that better medical treatment be ensured for other ailing and detained leaders, including AL presidium member Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, joint general secretary Obaidul Kader, Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Sylhet mayor Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran and Awami Swechchhasevak League general secretary Pankaj Devnath. "Please do not involve politics in the handling of medical treatment for anyone. It is unethical to deprive people of appropriate treatment," he said, addressing his comments to concerned policy makers. Asking the government to withdraw the graft cases filed against Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and AKM Jahangir Hossain, Ashraful said: "These are all false cases, filed to harass them. Even a betel-leaf vendor today may boast of earning a million taka." bdnews2
