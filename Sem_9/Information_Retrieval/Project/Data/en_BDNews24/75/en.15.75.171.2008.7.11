<TITLE> Now is the time to elect good leaders: Moeen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kuakata, July 11 (bdnews24.com)Army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed said on Friday that the country is being run without muscle power, which is the proper time for choosing candidates who will take Bangladesh towards prosperity. "If you elect good leadership, you will get a country with bright prospects. If you sell a vote you can live better for a single day, but not for the next five years," Moeen said, while addressing a house allocation project for Sidr-survivors. For Bangladesh to realise its potential, its human resources will have to become more skilled, the army chief went on to say. "The people are the country's best assets, with a workforce that could potentially bring huge foreign earnings." "One unskilled labourer, who earns only 300 riyals, after being well trained can earn more than three times that amount," Moeen said. Friday's function was organised by the Old Rajshahi Cadets Association (ORCA) at Kuakata beach, Patuakhali. Siddiqur Rahman, president of ORCA, chaired the programme, with Maj Gen Rafique, GOC Jessore and Commander of 55-Infantry Division, was special guest. ORCA, a non-political organisation formed in 1972 for humanitarian works, from donations by former Rajshahi cadets, has a tradition of aiding survivors of natural disaster, such as flood, cyclone, or famine. The army chief urged ORCA members to create a technical institution, so that Sidr survivors could have the opportunity to start anew with skilled and vocational training. It is also the time to develop sectors like tourism, and preserve agriculture, garments and ship-building industries to ensure the country's solvency, said Moeen. "Only then can Bangladesh become a mid-income country by 2015." ORCA has built around 80 homes on 5.5 bighas of land in the Kuakata rehabilitation area, to settle up about 500 Sidr-affected people. The project also includes a school, mosque, community centre, pond, sanitary latrines and deep tube-wells for safe drinking water. ORCA has also extended their project in northern districts such as Sirajganj, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Rangpur and Rajshahi. bdne
