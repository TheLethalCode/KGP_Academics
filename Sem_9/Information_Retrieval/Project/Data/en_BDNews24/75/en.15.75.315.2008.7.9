 Toyako, Japan, July 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States remains opposed to setting an arbitrary withdrawal date for its troops from Iraq, the White House said on Wednesday. "We have always been opposed and remain so to an arbitrary withdrawal date," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. The United States believes those decisions should be "based on conditions on the ground," and the Iraqis agree with that, she told reporters traveling with President George W. Bush at a Group of Eight summit in Japan.
