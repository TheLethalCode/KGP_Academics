<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim said Wednesday that the government's 100-days employment generation programme would help boost the purchase power of rural people. Addressing a workshop on "100 days of employment generation: implementation opportunities and challenges" at LGED Bhaban, the adviser stressed government and private sector coordination for proper implementation of the scheme. The government has allocated Tk 2,000 crore, in the budget for 2008-09, to create scope for employment for over 20 lakh rural unemployed people. The country's impoverished regions will be prioritised under the scheme. Each eligible person will get Tk 100 per day. If the government cannot offer them work, it will dispense cash for immediate expenses of their families. The adviser placed three proposals in a bid to make the programme an effective one. "There are 10,000 kilometres of dams in Bangladesh. The government can allocate funds for the maintenance and renovation of these dams." "Fishermen who may become unemployed due to an embargo on fishing jatka fish can be taken under the project." "Allocation can be given for irrigation also," said Karim. Also speaking at the conference, economist Wahiduddin Mahmud raised doubts about the success of the programme. "There are already a number of social safety programmes such as allowances for the disadvantaged, food for work programme and stipends. These programmes might clash with the new one and create disorder. The middle-men may be more benefited than the poor." The economist said that though the programme was modelled on a similar Indian scheme, its implementation would be difficult as the situation and aims were different here. Criticising the roles of non-governmental organisations in the implementation of such projects, he said: "The NGOs of our country mainly work in the service sector." Wahiduddin claimed Bangladeshi NGOs had not yet achieved the expertise to ensure people's social and welfare rights in coordination with the government. "But the Indian NGOs are doing lots of work for the protection of people's rights in different provinces." Indian finance minister's adviser Subhashish Gangopadhyay, who also joined the workshop, warned that his country had suffered increased inflation due to the implementation of a similar work programme. "The project was implemented through panchayet. The grassroots people got money in hand, but not enough commoditiesa problem that increased inflation," he said. "As the government of India is a federal one there are impediments over reaching commodities from one place to another. Bangladesh will not have to face the problem," Subhashish however added. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "The government has taken up the programme without aiming at any group. This is a new process for poverty alleviation. We need a coordinated effort for its implementation." World Bank sector director Michael Rutkowski said: "We have to ensure that the people who will get the facility can join the programme themselves. The selection process should be transparent and free of political intervention." World Bank and private research organisation Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC) co-organised the two-day workshop. PPRC executive director KM Ehsanul Haq gave the welcome speech. bdnews24.
