<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday held a hearing on a writ petition filed by detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia challenging the legality of Niko graft case and its trial proceedings. The court asked the Anticorruption Commission to submit documents, regarding the ACC's approval of the case and for taking the case into cognisance, by 2pm the following day. A High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed set Wednesday 2pm for the next hearing. Barrister Kaiser Kamal, the former prime minister's counsel, filed the petition on her behalf on Monday. Barrister Rafiqul Islam Mia and advocate Abdur Rezzak Khan stood for Khaleda in Tuesday's hearing. The petition requested the High Court to quash the case, and to halt the case proceedings in trial court as a primary step. It also asked the court to issue a rule nisi asking the government to explain why filing of the case and its trial proceedings should not be declared illegal. In her challenge against the case, Khaleda accuses the ACC chairman, two commissioners, a deputy commissioner and Special Judge's Court-9 of Dhaka of misconduct in bringing the charges. The BNP chief said, as prime minister performing her official duties according to 'rules of business', she had asked BAPEX to take necessary steps regarding three abandoned gas fields according to guidelines and regulations, but the Niko case had been filed purposely to harass her. Khaleda also mentioned that the ACC does not have the jurisdiction to challenge the 'rules of business', hence the Niko case filed against her has no legal standing. The petition said the Chhattack, Feni and Kamta gas fields had been declared abandoned after the necessary surveys. The government had handed over the abandoned fields to Niko to convert them into money spinners. The energy ministry had processed the deal, opened the files for Khaleda's signatures and she had only endorsed the joint decision. The High Court has already rejected an earlier petition filed by the former prime minister to scrap the case. The BNP chairperson, now behind bars on charges of corruption, filed the first petition on May 18. On May 20, a High Court bench said it was 'too embarrassed' to hear the appeal. A second HC bench rejected the plea to cacncel the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year, and pressed charges against Khaleda and 10 others on May 5, accusing them of scamming the state coffers of Tk 13,700 crore by signing an illegal deal with Canadian company Niko Resources Ltd. bdnew
