 Chittagong, July 12 (bdnews24.com)Home adviser MA Matin said Saturday that no more special anticrime crackdown would be launched ahead of the elections. Speaking to reporters after a discussion meeting on law and order at Chittagong Circuit House, the adviser, however, said routine drives would continue to main law and order. "Although incidents of robbery and mugging have slightly increased in Chittagong, the overall law and order situation has not deteriorated," he said. The adviser made a written speech to the meeting, pointing to recent news reports on robberies, muggings and extortions. Matin also asked law-enforcement agencies to go tough on crimes. The government, according to the adviser, is committed to maintaining law and order across the country. "Any criminal activity before the election will be checked with an iron hand." "The year 2008 is important for Bangladesh. The government is working to achieve democracy in line with the roadmap and will be able to hold an acceptable election under the Election commission and with the help of political parties." Chittagong deputy commissioner Ashraf Shamim presided over the meeting, also joined by Chittagong range DIG of police Shahidul Haq, Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner M Akbar Ali and other high officials. DIG Shahidul Haq said law and order in Chittagong has improved as the local problems have been resolved after the introduction of community police. bdnew
