 Seoul,july 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five regional powers will hold talks with North Korea from Thursday on ending its atomic weapons plans and verifying an account the secretive state gave in June of its nuclear programmes, a South Korean envoy said on Tuesday. The talks, the first in nine months, come after Washington responded to the declaration by the North of its nuclear assets by starting to take it off a terrorism blacklist. But Washington also called on Pyongyang to answer lingering question on proliferation and uranium enrichment "The official schedule for the top envoys' meeting will start in the afternoon of July 10," South Korean envoy Kim Sook told reporters before heading to Beijing for the talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. Analysts said North Korea may sign off on an inspection programme but will delay further disarmament steps for as long as possible to squeeze out concessions. "North Korea has no reason to reveal everything it's got," said Park Young-ho, an analyst at the South's Korea Institute for National Unification. "Nuclear armaments are not only North Korea's 'card' to play strategically at the negotiating table, but they are also a tool for Kim Jong-il to stay in power." Yonhap news agency reported that North Korean nuclear envoy Kim Kye-gwan had arrived in Beijing. In late June, the North presented a long-delayed account of its nuclear weapons programme that contained information on its plutonium production, but did little to address US suspicions of a secret uranium enrichment programme. North Korea, which tested a nuclear device in October 2006, was required in a disarmament-for-aid deal to make the declaration and start taking apart its Soviet-era nuclear plant at Yongbyon by the end of 2007. It had completed most of the disablement steps by the end of last year. On June 27, in a symbolic move to show its commitment to the deal, the reclusive state invited in media to witness a controlled blast that brought down the cooling tower at its ageing nuclear reactor. In return for these steps, the energy-starved North has received heavy fuel oil aid. Once it is removed from the US terrorism list, the communist state will see an end to sanctions that have mostly cut it off from international banking. The declaration, however, did not address the North's nuclear weaponry and facilities other than Yongbyon, which may cloud the next round of talks in Beijing. "The US and other players are expecting North Korea to declare and disable other facilities," said Kim Sung-han, a Korea University international relations professor. And there may even be problems with what it did declare because according to reports in Japanese media, the North said it produced about 30 kgs (66 lbs) of plutonium while US officials have said they think it is closer to 50 kgs
