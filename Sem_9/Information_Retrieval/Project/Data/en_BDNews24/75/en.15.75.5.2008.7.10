 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League is expected to announce the names of candidates from the 14-party alliance for the upcoming city corporation polls, a party leader said. The names will be announced Thursday evening after a meeting at the Gulshan home of AL acting president Zillur Rahman. "We would not like to say anything now. The names will be announced after the meeting of the 14-party alliance," said the AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam after a meeting of the party's central working committee earlier in the day. AL and the 14-party alliance have held several meetings over the candidacies for the upcoming city polls, but have been unable so far to come to a final decision in the matter. AL and Workers Party of Bangladesh, one of the alliance members, have recently been involved in some dispute over the mayoral candidacy for Rajshahi City Corporation polls. AL working committee member HM Quamruzzaman Liton and WPB politburo member Fazle Hossain Badshah both submitted nomination papers to the RCC. bdnews
