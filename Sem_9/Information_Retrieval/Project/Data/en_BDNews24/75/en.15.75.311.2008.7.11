The rate was also above a median forecast of 11.75 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts, and is the highest since annual numbers in the current series became available in April 1995. Inflation for the week ended May 3 was revised upwards to 8.73 percent from 7.83 percent. The annual inflation rate was 4.42 percent during the corresponding week of the previous year.
