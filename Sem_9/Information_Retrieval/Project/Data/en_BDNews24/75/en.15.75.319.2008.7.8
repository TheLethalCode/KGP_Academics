 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com) - The three-day match between Bangladesh A and England U-19s headed for a dull draw on the final day Tuesday at Hazelgrave Ground, Loughborough. The hosts were 94 for five at tea in their first innings after Bangladesh declared their first innings at 195 for seven on Day 3 as the first day of the game washed out following rains. Redfern and Brown remained unbeaten on 26 and one respectively at tea as pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin (2/30) and Nazmul Hossain (1/27) rattled the host's top order. Spinners Mosharraf Hossain and Suhrawardi Shuvo also took one wicket apiece. Earlier, having resumed the day on 115 for four, Bangladesh added another 80 runs losing three wickets and Bangladesh declared their first innings at 195 for seven at lunch with Surawardhi Shuvo and Nazmul Hossain remaining unbeaten on four and eight respectively. Overnight batsmen Nayeem Islam and Dhiman Ghosh added 63 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter was caught by Taylor off Fletcher, leaving the side at 173 for five. Nayeem soon followed Dhiman to be adjudged leg before by Sanderson scoring 40 runs, the second highest after opener Imrul Kayes struck 62 on Monday. Right-arm medium fast bowler Ben Sanderson returned four for 52.
