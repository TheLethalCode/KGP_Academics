<TITLE> Captain Smith rides to South Africa's rescue </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - South Africa captain Graeme Smith came to his side's rescue on Sunday with a fighting 107 which may help salvage a draw in the first test against England at Lord's. Smith added 204 for the first wicket with Neil McKenzie, who was still at the crease on 102 after South Africa had been asked to follow on Saturday 346 runs in arrears. At the close, South Africa were 242 for one, needing 104 to make England bat again with a day's play remaining. Smith, who was out for eight in the first innings, was unable to capitalise on a huge slice of good fortune after reaching his century in the final session. An edge off Kevin Pietersen's occasional off-spin, which seemed destined for Paul Collingwood at first slip, went through Tim Ambrose's gloves as the wicketkeeper lunged to his left. However, he was out without adding a run when a skied pull shot off James Anderson was taken safely by Pietersen running in from backward point. The England team and a near-capacity crowd gathered on a fine, sunny morning started the day with high hopes that England were about to end a sequence of five successive test draws at cricket's world headquarters. Instead the South African openers, resuming on 13 for no wicket, gradually took command on a pitch offering nothing to the bowlers except for some slow spin for Monty Panesar, who took four for 74 in the first innings. Panesar was introduced into the attack 48 minutes after the start of play and captain Michael Vaughan placed close fielders on both sides of the pitch. FAINT EDGE The left-arm spinner made the occasional delivery deviate from the bowlers' footmarks into the left-handed Smith and away from McKenzie but the only semblance of a chance in the opening session was a faint inside edge from Smith which hit the unfortunate Ambrose's pads. South Africa, who lunched at 67 without loss, carried on where they had left off after the interval, playing straight and running swiftly between the wickets. Smith reached his 23rd test fifty in 10 minutes short of three hours and brought up the 100 partnership with a controlled glide for four to third man. McKenzie completed his 15th test half-century in 234 minutes from 190 balls. Smith, using his height to drive confidently through the off-side, went on after tea to compile his 15th test century with 11 fours from 186 balls followed shortly by the 200 partnership. It was South Africa's 10th opening partnership of 200 or more in test cricket and Smith, who scored 259 in his only previous test at Lord's, has been involved in seven. McKenzie, who had played an excellent supporting role, reached his fifth test century with a scampered single just before the close. It was his first ton against England and came in 307 balls. Vaughan kept attacking and innovative fields in place and rotated his bowlers constantly in an attempt to conjure a wicket. Nobody bowled badly but the continued excellence of a pitch, on which England compiled 593 for eight declared in their first innings, neutralised his pace bowlers who were unable to get any significant movement. England are due to announce on Monday their team for the second test at Headingley in Leeds starting on Friday. If South Africa do scrape a draw after being thoroughly outplayed for the first three days, the case for the recall of fast bowling all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be overwhelmin
