 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League Monday vowed to resist any move to hold upazila polls ahead of national elections. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman described the government's activities as "whimsical". "We won't let the government hold upazila polls ahead of the national polls," Zillur said after at a meeting of Jubo League at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. "The government is doing unconstitutional and unlawful things one after another," Zillur said. Presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury demanded that the national polls schedule be announced by the end of July. The AL leader also alleged that the government had chosen its own candidates for constituencies and was plotting to help them win by any means. Amir Hossain Amu, another presidium member, asked the Jubo League leaders to prepare to face "any situation" in future. Amu said the government did not want the political parties to run front organisations as it feared the organisations might be obstacles to imposing their misrule. "People will not accept any election before the national polls," he added. bdnews
