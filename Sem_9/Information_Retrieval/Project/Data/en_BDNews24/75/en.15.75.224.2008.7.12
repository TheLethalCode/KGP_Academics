 Dhaka, July 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is almost set to strike a record sponsor deal with cellular phone company AKTEL in a week. "We are looking for a partner for football, and our demand is Tk five crore for the whole football programme, and we are hoping to tie up with a sponsor," said BFF senor vice president Salam Murshedi after emerging from the BFF executive committee meeting Saturday. "All types of tournaments and leagues organised by the BFF will be named after the sponsor and we will also try to associate co-sponsors for those tournaments and leagues to boost our financial status," said Murshedi. Meanwhile, the BFF is continuing their negotiations with AKTEL on the sponsorship. "The executive committee has given the go-ahead signal to president Kazi Salahuddin to negotiate the sponsorship deal and the meeting has also given him some guidelines in this regard." Of the 21 executive members, only Haroon-or-Rashid was absent. It is learnt that the BFF has almost reached a consensus on a Tk five crore deal with AKTEL for one year, and it is hoped that the deal will be stuck before Thursday next if everything goes well.
