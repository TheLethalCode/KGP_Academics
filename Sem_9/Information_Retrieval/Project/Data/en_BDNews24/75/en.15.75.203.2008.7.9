 ISTANBUL, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fenerbahce have signed Spain Euro 2008 winning striker Daniel Guiza from Real Mallorca in a four-year deal, the Turkish club said on its Web site (www.fenerbahce.org) on Tuesday. Guiza is former Spain coach Luis Aragones's first major signing since taking charge at the Istanbul club last week after he led his country to their first major title in 44 years. No further details on Guiza's signing were initially released by the club. The 27-year-old was the top scorer in the Primera Liga last season with 27 goals and scored twice during Spain's triumphant campaign in which he was used mainly as a substitute. Last season Fenerbahce reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League under Brazilian coach Zico, but they lost out to Istanbul rivals Galatasaray in the domestic title race
