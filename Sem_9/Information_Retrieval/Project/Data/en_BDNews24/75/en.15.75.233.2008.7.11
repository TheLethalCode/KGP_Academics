 Dhaka, July 11 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Friday stressed all-out family planning efforts for marginal populations, as a means to spreading development and prosperity. Speaking as chief guest at a programme in observance of World Population Day 2008, the chief adviser said: "To save the next generation we must fast reduce the rate of population growth." "We have to keep the population in check, and strengthen it as an efficient force for continuing development." The country's population is expected to reach 17.2 crore by the year 2020, the chief adviser said. "This will intensify current difficulties in meeting the basic needs of people, including food, shelter, health and education," he added. "It will also exacerbate environmental problems and overall development." Fakhruddin pointed out that in the recent years the rates of reproduction, population growth, mother and child mortalities have decreased through the use of family planning methods. "But motivational programmes still need to be intensified among the labouring class, landless and floating populations, shanty dwellers in the towns, people living in char, hoar, boar and remote hill areas," he said. "Special attention has to be given to the areas which are lagging behind in providing family planning services." He urged all, including different ministries, NGOs, and professional organisations, to undertake realistic and achievable programmes. The chief adviser urged all-out family planning efforts, and spreading the slogan "Not more than two children, one is better" at all levels of society, as part of national population policy. Health secretary AKM Zafarullah Khan presided over the programme at Osmany Memorial auditorium, with health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali also speaking. The theme of this year's World Population Day is family planning, with the slogan: "It's a right. Let's make it real." A colourful procession was brought out in the city in the morning to mark the day. bdnew
