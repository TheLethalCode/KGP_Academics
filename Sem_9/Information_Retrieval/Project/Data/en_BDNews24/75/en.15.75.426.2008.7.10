<TITLE> Hurricane Bertha weakens again in Atlantic </TITLE>

 MIAMI, Thu Jul 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Bertha weakened back into a Category 1 storm on Thursday as it churned its way toward the British colony of Bermuda, US hurricane forecasters said. The first hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic storm season saw its top sustained winds decrease to near 90 miles per hour (150 km per hour) and it was about 485 miles southeast of the mid-Atlantic offshore financial center by 11 a.m. EDT, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Bertha surprised forecasters with the speed and vigor at which it strengthened into a "major" Category 3 hurricane on Monday, only to almost fizzle back into a tropical storm on Tuesday. But warm waters and more favorable atmospheric wind conditions on Wednesday allowed the storm to gain traction again and reach the second level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, the Miami-based Hurricane Center said. It weakened again on Thursday morning but the hurricane center warned it could re-intensify in the next 24 hours. "Large swells and high surf have started to affect Bermuda. These conditions are expected to persist for the next few days," the center said. It said it was still too soon to determine the extent to which Bertha would affect Bermuda. Hurricanes of Category 3 and above are called "major" hurricanes and are the strongest and most destructive. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, was a monstrous Category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico before moving ashore as a Category 3. Bertha was moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 kph) and a gradual turn toward the north and a decrease in forward speed were expected during the next couple of days. It was highly unlikely that the storm would target the US East Coast, hurricane experts said, and the Gulf of Mexico, where the United States produces a third of its domestic crude oil, has been out of the firing line for days. Bertha developed last week near the Cape Verde islands off Africa. Its formation so far east so early in the season that began on June 1 and its explosive growth from a tropical storm into a major hurricane could be seen as harbingers of a busy summer. Hurricane experts have predicted the six-month season, which rarely gets into high gear before August, would see an average or above-average number of storms, though nothing like record-busting 2005, when 28 formed
