<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Tuesday expressed concern over a hike in the prices of commodities and compared the situation with monga, which means near-famine. "Prices of goods are rising due to irresponsible statements by the finance adviser. His comments hurt people. People did not expect such statements from an honourable person like him," the AL leader told reporters after a presidium meeting. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam ruled out the possibility of commodity prices coming down, in a recent statement which drew flak from different quarters. The AL meeting was held at acting party president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. Ashraful said the presidents and general secretaries of the 14-party allies will meet at 5pm Wednesday and decide on their next course of action in the ensuing city and municipal elections. "A statement will be released to the media tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." Ashraful said the 14-party alliance would launch a combined programme to protest the price hike of essentials and fuel price increase. "The issues will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting and a programme will be fixed. We are worried about the price hike. The government will have to take effective steps to curb the soaring prices of essentials." Reiterating their demand for withdrawal of the state of emergency before national elections, the AL leader urged the government to refrain from taking a unilateral decision. The AL asked the government not to hold upazila elections before the national election. "Let this government hold the upazila election one month after the national election. If necessary, let them transfer power to the elected government one month later." Ashraful also demanded that the government send ailing AL leader Mohammad Nasim abroad for medical better treatment. bdnews.24.c
