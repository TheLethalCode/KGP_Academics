<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The government and the Anticorruption Commission have appealed against Monday's High Court order halting the proceedings of two cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Appellate Division chamber judge MA Matin refrained on Tuesday from ruling on the HC order and set July 10 for a full-bench hearing on the appeals to overrule the HC's stay orders on the two graft cases against Hasina. Advocate Golam Kibria represented the ACC, additional attorney general Mansur Habib represented the government, while barrister Shafiq Ahmed stood for the Awami League chief at Tuesday's hearing. The High Court stayed the proceedings of the barge-mounted power plant case and the Niko graft case against Hasina for two months. The HC also asked the ACC and the government to explain within four weeks why the cases should not be declared illegal. Hasina petitioned the HC on June 2, challenging the validity of the power plants case, and on June 19 against the Niko case. The ACC filed a case on Sept 2, 2007 against seven people, including Hasina on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in the name of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for awarding contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants. The caretaker government included the case for trial under the emergency powers rules. The Niko case was filed against Hasina and six others on Dec 9 last year accusing them of causing state losses of about Tk 13,630 crore by awarding Canadian firm Niko Resources a contract to develop three abandoned gas fields without going through the process of tendering. bdnews24.
