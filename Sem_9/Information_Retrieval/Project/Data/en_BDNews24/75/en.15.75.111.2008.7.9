<TEXT>
 London, July 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath said on Tuesday the government had the necessary support in parliament to survive any no-confidence vote. India's communist parties said earlier they were withdrawing their support for the government after four years to protest against a civilian nuclear deal with the United States, which they say makes India subservient to Washington. The leftists, whose support had secured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's parliamentary majority, will call for a vote of no confidence in the government. "Of course we have the number. Of course the government will survive," Nath told Reuters in London on the sidelines of an awards ceremony. The Samajwadi Party has offered to support the government. It has 39 seats in parliament, compared with 59 for the communist parties. The ruling coalition needs the support of 44 members to win the confidence vote. It will try to win the other five seats from smaller parties. The Samajwadi Party has said it wants the ruling coalition to use the country's foreign exchange reserves to check the depreciation of the rupee and inflation. It also wants the government to ban exports of petroleum products. The minister said all concerns would be taken into consideration but that economic reforms would not be stalled. "I don't think the political scenario in the country is, in any way, unstable. India is a stable economy and certainly our government will seek a vote of confidence to move on," he said. India's nuclear deal is potentially worth billions of dollars to U.S. and European nuclear supply companies, and would give India more energy alternatives to drive its booming economy. Indian needs to seek approval for the deal from the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, then the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, where there is doubt about it since India is outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and finally ratification by the U.S. Congress.
