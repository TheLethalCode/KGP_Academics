 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  The country's oldest mobile operator, Citycell, has become the main sponsor for the Bangladesh Football Federation for the next three years since Monday through signing a memorandum of understanding worth Tk 16.5 crore. "Citycell is now BFF's partner in progress and will be the main sponsor of the B. League, the Federation Cup and the school tournament across the country and the co-sponsor of all the tournaments under the BFF banner in exchange of Tk 16.5 crore," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin said at a crowded press conference at the BFF House. "Citycell was supposed to be the main sponsor of all tournaments under the BFF banner, but it was kind enough to allow us to manage other sponsors for different tournaments as the federation needs a lot of money to develop football," said the former star footballer, who took over charge two and half months ago. Citycell chief executive officer Michael Seymour and Salahuddin signed the MoU on behalf of their respective organisations. "It is my great pleasure and honour to be present here today (Monday) on this historic occasion when Citycell joins hands with the Bangladesh Football Federation to bring back to life the passion for football in this country," said Seymour. Seymour said, "We are collaborating with the BFF under an agreement which is renewable every year for three years, and is subject to the performance of the federation in bringing football back to its former glory." "Under the dynamic and able leadership of the BFF president Kazi Salahuddin, we believe this is the right time to enter into this partnership." "...although the number of successes in recent times have been few, there are innumerable opportunities to rejuvenate the game by realising the latent talent of our youth," Seymour said, "With the positive development of football, we foresee our youth reviving the game not only within the country but also taking on these global challenges in the years to come." Salahuddin believed that the collaboration of Citycell would be a base from where they would start and produce quality football in future. "I will keep football in field for 10 months a year whatever I do," the former national striker replied to a query. The BFF boss said that they would place their required budget with Citycell whenever needed ahead of tournaments or leagues. BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi, vice presidents Manzoor Hossain Malu, Badal Roy, Shawkat Hossain Khan Jahangir, Kazi Nabil Ahmed, member Anwarul Haq Helal, Haroon-or-Rashid, Citycell head of marketing Dr. Anand Rajasingham and general manager, marketing communications & branding Sania Mahmood were among others present.
