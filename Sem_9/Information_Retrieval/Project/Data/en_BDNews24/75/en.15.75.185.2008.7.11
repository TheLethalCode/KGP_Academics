<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Fri Jul 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon formed on Friday a unity government that gave Hezbollah and its allies effective veto power as agreed under a deal that ended a political crisis in the country. A presidential decree announced the formation after a meeting between Prime Minister-designate Fouad Siniora and President Michel Suleiman. The opposition was granted 11 of the cabinet's 30 seats under the May 21 Qatari-mediated deal that ended a conflict which had triggered the worst fighting since the 1975-90 civil war. The opposition was guaranteed 11 of the cabinet's 30 seats under the May 21 Qatari-mediated deal that ended a conflict which had triggered the worst fighting since the 1975-90 civil war. All major decisions require a two-thirds majority or 20 votes in the cabinet. President Michel Suleiman was elected on May 25 in line with the deal, but squabbling over cabinet portfolios had held up the formation of a government. The new government would have one Hezbollah minister in addition to 10 ministers from its Shia Muslim, Druze and Christian allies, the sources said. The ruling coalition would have 16 ministers while the remaining three ministers would be picked by the president, the sources said. People close to Suleiman would be assigned the key defense and interior portfolios. The main task of the cabinet would be to ease political and sectarian tensions that had led to bouts of deadly violence, adopt an election law already agreed in Doha, and supervise next year's parliamentary election. After the formation of the government, Suleiman is expected to call rival leaders for round table talks to discuss various divisive issues. At the top of the agenda would be the fate of Hezbollah's weapons. Hezbollah maintains a formidable guerrilla army that had survived a war with Israel in 2006. Its domestic detractors say there is no more justification for the group to keep its arms after Israel pulled out of Lebanon while Hezbollah and its allies argue that it needs its arsenal to defend Lebanon against "Israeli threats". Hezbollah and Israel are expected to exchange prisoners later this month
