 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com)Indices on the country's twin bourses closed higher, driven by banks, insurers and power companies. On the opening day of the week, the trading volume and turnover recorded a slight decline. Brokerage house officials said investors sold off issues which rose over the last few days in a bid to make profit. "Banks, insurers, power companies and non-bank financial institutions were favoured by investors on Sunday," an official of brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, market watchers termed trading rational but said investors were losing interest in the market. "The day's trading was quite rational," Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of a private asset management company told bdnews24.com. But investors were losing interest in the market which is reflected by the lower trading volume, he added. "People are losing interest as some recent interventions have deprived them of benefit," said Sayeed of AIMS of Bangladesh.
