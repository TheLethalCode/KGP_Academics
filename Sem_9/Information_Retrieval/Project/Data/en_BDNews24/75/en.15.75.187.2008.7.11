 LONDON, July 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France playmaker Samir Nasri has agreed to join Arsenal from Olympique Marseille, the Premier League club announced on Friday. Arsenal gave no details of the deal, saying only on their website (www.arsenal.com) that the 21-year-old would be joining on "a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee". Manager Arsene Wenger said: "We are delighted to be signing Samir Nasri. He is young, quick and technically an outstanding player. He has shown great potential with his performances for Marseille and the French national team over the past two seasons." Nasri, who will join up with the rest of the Arsenal squad for pre-season training on July 21, made two substitute appearances for France at Euro 2008 and has 12 caps in total. "This is a very important step in my life as a football player because Arsenal is a massive club," Nasri said. "I will do my best for Arsenal and its fans and I am honoured to be part of such a great football club," he added. Last month he said on his personal website he had signed a four-year contract with Arsenal for a fee of 16.8 million Euros ($26.50 million), only for his agent to say no deal had been finalised
