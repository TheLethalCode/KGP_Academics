 ISTANBUL, Thu Jul 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police detained four suspects and patrolled the high-walled perimeter of the US consulate in Istanbul on Thursday, after a terror attack in which 3 policemen and 3 gunmen were killed. Busloads of police were stationed outside the mission, CNN Turk said, and security was tightened at other diplomatic installations. Police manned checkpoints at various points in the sprawling city to check the identity of passing motorists. Turkish television flashed news of Interior Minister Besir Atalay reporting the detention of four suspects, three of them in Istanbul. There were no immediate details. The US consulate had already been moved to a more secure locations in Istanbul following the September 11, 2001 attacks by al Qaeda terrorists in New York. Turkish police were investigating media reports that al Qaeda was behind Wednesday's attacks, and that the gunmen who carried it out had received weapons training in Afghanistan. Police were still looking for the fourth man in the squad, who escaped from the scene in a car during the gunbattle between the gunmen and police. The attack coincides with political tension in Turkey. The governing party is fighting to avoid being banned for alleged anti-secular activities and police are probing a shadowy far-right group suspected of plotting a military coup
