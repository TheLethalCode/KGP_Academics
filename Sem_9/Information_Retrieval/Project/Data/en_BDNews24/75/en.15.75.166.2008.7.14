 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday ordered Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam to surrender to Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court in 10 days in a graft case. The HC bench of justice Sharif Uddin Chaklader and justice Emdadul Huq Azad rejected Azam's appeal for quashing the case and granting bail. The HC asked the government not to arrest or harass the Jubo League leader in the next 10 days. Azam's counsel barrister Shafique Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The court has ordered Mirza Azam to surrender to Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. He cannot be arrested during the period." The HC has directed the trial court to consider his appeal for bail. Azam told reporters: "I have always lived an honest life. I will now surrender to the trial court. I hope I will get justice and bail. I will continue the legal battle." Azam appeared before the High Court bench at 10.30am Monday. Leaders and workers of Jubo League thronged the Supreme Court ahead of the hearing on his appeal. In line with law, the investigation report of a case has to be submitted in 60 days from the filing of the case, but the Anticorruption Commission submitted the chargesheet after a lapse of 179 days in Azam's case, the lawyer said. "So the case cannot proceed in the trial court." ACC counsel Khurshid Alam Khan said: "The ACC law says the investigation officer must complete an investigation in 45 days. If the investigation is not completed by the deadline he will get another 15 days. If the investigation officer cannot complete the investigation by this time, action may be taken against him. But it is not true that the case cannot continue in the trial court." "Completing an investigation in 60 days is guidance, not mandatory." In reply, barrister Shafique said there is a provision of taking action against the investigation officer if he overshoots the 60-day deadline. "But how did the investigation officer carry out an investigation after 60 days and submit a report? So Mirza Azam deserves bail." The court said the High Court cannot grant Azam bail as an arrest warrant has been issued against him. ACC deputy director Mobara Khanam on Jan 10 filed the case with Ramna Police Station against Azam on charges of earning illegal property and hiding information about wealth. The chargesheet pressed against Azam on July 7 alleged that the accused person had concealed information about wealth about Tk 34 lakh and earning Tk 53 lakh in illicit wealth. The same bench of the High Court granted bail to former BNP state minister Redwan Ahmed and wife Momtaz Ahmed in a case of earning wealth beyond known income. bdnew
