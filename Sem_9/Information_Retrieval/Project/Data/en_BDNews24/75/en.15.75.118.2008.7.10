<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 10 (bdnews24.com)  Money remitted by Bangladeshis living abroad is contributing more to the economy than the garment export industry, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said Thursday. Expatriates remitted approximately $8 billion or Tk 54,700 crore in 2007-08; the whole amount came in neat income, the central banker said at the launch of an information campaign on foreign remittance at Sonargaon Hotel. Salehuddin said the turnover in garment export was projected at $10 billion or Tk 68,375 crore for the last fiscal year, but a good chunk of the money went to import raw materials. The money remitted by expatriates in 2007-08 was also more than the combined amount received in aid from donors and foreign direct investment, he said. The increase in remittance could help reduce dependency on foreign aid, he added. The BB governor said measures against hundi transactions played a significant role in raising remittance as more money was now being sent through banks. But, he conceded, a large amount of money was still being received from abroad through illegal routes, as remittance through banks was still costlier and took longer. The central bank will take more steps to encourage remittances through banking channels, Salehuddin said. The International Organisation for Migration in cooperation with Bangladesh Bank and the Department for International Development has organised the information campaign on foreign remittance. bdnews2
