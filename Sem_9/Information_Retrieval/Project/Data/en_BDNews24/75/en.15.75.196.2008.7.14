 BRUSSELS/NEW YORK, July 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc accepted a sweetened $52 billion takeover bid from Belgium-based InBev NV to create the world's largest beer maker and end a month-long standoff. InBev, which makes Stella Artois and Beck's, agreed to pay $70 per share for the maker of Budweiser, up from its original unsolicited bid of $65 per share, both companies said on Monday. The improved offer marked a 27 percent premium to Anheuser's record-high stock price in October 2002. The deal, which analysts expect to gain regulatory approval, would be the largest in the industry and the third-biggest ever foreign takeover of a US company. The combined company Anheuser-Bush InBev would have about $36.4 billion in annual net sales, about 40 percent in the United States, and would brew about a quarter of the world's beer. InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito will be CEO of the new company while Anheuser will get two seats on its board. Brito said in a webcast the beauty of the deal lay in adding Anheuser's near 50 percent share of the U.S. market and in taking its Budweiser brand global. "It's about complementarity, not about overlap," he said. Anheuser's home town of St. Louis, Missouri, will be the headquarters for the North American region and the global home of the flagship Budweiser brand. The companies said all of Anheuser 12 US breweries would remain open. FRIENDLY END TO MONTH-LONG BATTLE The deal brings an amicable resolution to a month-long saga that was becoming increasingly hostile as the companies traded lawsuits and InBev set the stage to replace Anheuser's board. Anheuser Chief Executive August Busch IV had said he would not sell the company and Brito said he would not go higher. InBev shares were up 3.4 percent at 46.02 euros in mid-morning trading on Monday. Shares of InBev and Anheuser surged on Friday as news of the higher offer and the negotiations emerged. Anheuser closed up 8.6 percent at $66.50 and InBev ended 7.4 percent higher. "The synergies are better than expected, $70 is a reasonable price and InBev has avoided a long drawn-out battle in the courts," said KBC Securities analyst Wim Hoste in Brussels. The companies said the combination would yield cost synergies of at least $1.5 billion annually by 2011, to be phased in equally over three years. InBev will finance its purchase with $45 in debt, including $7 billion bridge financing for divestitures. It also has six months to determine additional equity financing with a further bridge of up to $9.8 billion set up. Morningstar analyst Ann Gilpin said each side would benefit. "Anheuser-Busch knows the US market a lot better than InBev, so InBev needs to retain key management from Anheuser for marketing and distribution," she said. To Gilpin, Anheuser shares were only worth $57 on a stand-alone basis, but she said $70 was a fair price since InBev would be able to cut costs and sell Budweiser and Bud Light -- the world's two top-selling beers -- overseas. The transaction, due to be completed at the end of the year, should have a neutral effect on normalized earnings per share in 2009 and boost earnings from 2010, the companies said. Adding another dimension to any deal was Mexico's No. 1 brewer Grupo Modelo, which is 50 percent owned by Anheuser. Modelo, which makes Corona, said it was in talks with InBev. BEER CONSOLIDATION After the merger InBev will regain the world brewing top spot it lost last year to SABMiller, which was boosted by strong growth in China and the purchase of Grolsch. It is also the latest mega deal in the fast consolidating beer industry, with Scottish & Newcastle having agreed to be broken up by Carlsberg A/S and Heineken NV. Analysts believe SABMiller will now look at possible deals with Mexico's Modelo or FEMSA, Foster's or Molson Coors, with whom it has agreed to merge US operations. Anheuser, whose shares have stagnated for five years as it failed to expand internationally like its rivals, will get a shot in the arm and its shareholders a handsome premium. InBev, known for fierce cost-cutting, must now deliver on its financial promises while dampening concerns of workers and politicians, including democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama who said it would be a shame if Bud were foreign owned
