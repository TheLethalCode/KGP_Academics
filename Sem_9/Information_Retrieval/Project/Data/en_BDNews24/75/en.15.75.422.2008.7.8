<TITLE> Communists end support for government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Tue Jul 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The communist parties that have provided the government with a parliamentary majority for four years said on Tuesday they were withdrawing their support to protest a civilian nuclear deal with the United States. The communist parties had said they would withdraw if the government formally went ahead with the deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Monday that move would come "very soon." It was the final straw for the left. "That time has come," Prakash Karat, head of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), India's biggest communist party, told reporters. Karat said the communist parties would formally announce their withdrawal in a meeting with India's president on Wednesday. Another senior left leader, Debabrata Biswas, said the four communist parties that had supported the government would ask the president to call a vote of confidence. The government has lined up support from a regional party to provide it with a parliamentary majority in case of a vote of confidence and hopes to avoid early elections. Prime Minister Singh arrived in Japan on Monday for a G8 summit where he is expected to tell U.S. President George W. Bush -- the man who shook hands with Singh on the accord at the White House in 2005 -- that the delayed deal will go ahead. The pact would be a major success for Singh, giving India access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology and moving the Asian giant's trade and diplomatic relations closer to the West. The withdrawal could plunge India into more political uncertainty that has already hit markets. The government believes it will survive the vote, having won the backing of the regional Samajwadi Party. TOO LATE FOR THE DEAL? IAEA diplomats said on Monday there was talk of a special July 28 board gathering to discuss the deal but any timetable for advancing it would be unclear until Singh authorised the IAEA to proceed. "This meeting would be India-specific, but no date for it has been set yet. It would be premature at this point," said an IAEA official who, like the diplomats, asked for anonymity due to political sensitivities. But some say it could already be too late for the deal to be passed before the end of Bush's term. With time running out before the U.S. election in November, India needs to seek approval for the deal from the IAEA, then the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group, where there is doubt about it since India is outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and finally ratification by the US Congress. The nuclear deal is potentially worth billions of dollars to US and European nuclear supply companies and would give India more energy alternatives to drive its booming economy. The support of the SP, which has a history of pragmatic alliances with governments, should ensure that Singh wins the vote and avoids an early election this year just as the government grapples with inflation at a 13-year high and signs of economic slowdown. The Samajwadi Party has 39 seats in parliament, compared with 59 for the communist parties. The Congress-led ruling coalition needs the support of 44 lawmakers to reach a majority. It would try to win the other five seats from smaller parties. India's political uncertainty has hit markets. Stocks fell 2.5 percent last week, pushed down not only by worries over the government's future but also by record oil prices and inflation
