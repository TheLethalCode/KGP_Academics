 NBR reaches revenue target for first time Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has fulfilled its revenue target for the first time in its history, the NBR chairman announced Wednesday. NBR revenue stood at Tk 47,201 crore for the fiscal year 2007-08, an increase of Tk 9,982 crore, or 26.82 percent, over the previous fiscal year. The initial target for 2007-08 was Tk 43,850 crore, later increased to Tk 45,970 crore following positive results in revenue collection. NBR chairman Muhammad Abdul Mazid said: "Revenue exceeded the target due to a number of reasons, including greater transparency and accountability in tax administration, cooperation of the taskforce and an improvement in tax paying culture." On whether the hike in commodity prices had any positive impact on reaching the revenue target, the NBR chairman said: "This is a matter of research. The hike in prices of commodities might be one of a number of reasons." Mazid said the drive against tax evaders would continue along with the scope of legalising undeclared income. "The drive against tax defaulters is a part of the NBR's regular activities. It is easy to find people of pure minds, but it is very difficult to find people of tainted ones. The NBR will do the hard job regularly from now," he said. Asked whether NBR officials would be awarded for their success in obtaining revenue, the top tax official said: "There should be an arrangement for reward for any good work. The NBR officials also deserve rewards." "We think the government will respond positively in this regard," he added. The National Board of Revenue earlier in the day published lists of the top ten corporate tax payers and top ten value added tax payers for the fiscal year 2007-08. The NBR boss announced the list in a press conference at the revenue board's office at Segunbagicha. "Next year, the NBR will publish a list of ten top defaulters along with the top corporate tax payers and VAT payers," he told reporters. On whether the hike in commodity prices had any impact on reaching revenue targets, Mazid said: "This is a matter of research. The hike in prices of commodities might be one of a number of reasons." According to the NBR list, the top tax paying organisations with the amounts paid are: Grameenphone Tk 435 crore, Standard Chartered Bank Tk 220 crore, Chevron Bangladesh Blocks 13 and 14 Ltd Tk 180 crore, Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd Tk 161 crore, Titas Gas (TND) Company Ltd Tk 136 crore, HSBC Tk 118 crore, Southeast Bank Ltd Tk 88 crore, Pubali bank Ltd Tk 78 crore, Citibank NA Ltd Tk 76 crore and Prime Bank Ltd Tk 67 crore.
