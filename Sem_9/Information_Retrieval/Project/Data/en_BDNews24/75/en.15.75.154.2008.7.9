 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Trading on Dhaka Stock Exchange was halted for hours Wednesday after a "massive" virus attack affected servers and work stations of different brokerage houses. An official of brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com that trading was halted for the first three hours. Trading resumed in midday and ended one hour late at 3 pm. "The DSE authorities warned brokerage firms Tuesday of virus attacks," an official of IDLC Securities said. It would not have happened if the DSE had taken precautions, said the official, asking not to be named.
