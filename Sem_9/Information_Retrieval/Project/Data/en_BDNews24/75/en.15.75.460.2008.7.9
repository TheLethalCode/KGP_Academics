<TEXT>
 New Delhi, July 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said on Tuesday the government will go to the International Atomic Energy Agency and seek its approval for a civilian nuclear deal with the United States after a confidence vote in parliament. "We will seek the approval of the board of governors of the IAEA only after the vote of confidence," Pranab Mukherjee told reporters, adding the government would wait for the president to formally decide on a date for the vote. Communist parties that have provided the government with a parliamentary majority for four years said on Tuesday they were withdrawing their support in protest against the civilian nuclear deal and would push for a no confidence motion soon.
