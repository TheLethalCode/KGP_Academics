 Dhaka, July 13 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board Sunday signed a six-year long form agreement with Singapore-based Nimbus Sports International awarding the firm the worldwide marketing rights of Bangladesh's international cricket. The agreement, which remains effective until March 31, 2012, was a follow-up on a short-term contract signed on Nov 21, 2006. Under the agreement Nimbus will exclusively market the media rights of the BCB events globally and will guarantee minimum revenues of $56.88 million to the BCB. After the agreement for shorter version both the parties took time to work out all the details of the deal clearly. A special BCB review committee, headed by its finance committee chairman Abdul Momen, reviewed the agreement and renegotiated some provisions of the proposed deal with the Nimbus' officials before making some recommendations. "It was a hectic negotiation with Nimbus, but we got a lot of things from them," Momen said at a press conference after the new deal was signed at a ceremony at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. BCB acting chief executive officer Nizam Uddin Ahmed and Nimbus executive vice president Yannik Colaco singed on behalf of their respective organisations. BCB president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali and its ad-hoc committee members were present. The then BCB selected committee, led by general secretary Mahbub Anam, had signed the short-term agreement with Nimbus, which raised questions about the financial transparency of the agreement. "Actually our approach was not to find out whether the previous board had had corruption," BCB media committee vice chairman Istiaq Ahmed said. "We wanted to make this deal stronger for BCB." About the allegation, Nimbus executive vice president Yannik Colaco said it has been common in the subcontinent to find "some things" when a big deal takes place. He insisted that it was the "most transparent process I have been ever through". It was also revealed that Nimbus agreed to reduce the production cost of the matches during the contractual period from $19.5 million to $15.31 million. bdnew
