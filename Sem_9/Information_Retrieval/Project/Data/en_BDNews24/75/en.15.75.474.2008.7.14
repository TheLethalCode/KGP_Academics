 Dhaka, July 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday began trial of the Bashundhara bribery case against senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman and former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Court-3, set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, set July 24 for the first witness testimony. Tarique was not produced in the court as he has been exempted from personal appearance on medical grounds. Other accused in the case are Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam, his two sons Safiat Sobhan and Shahdat Sobhan, director Abu Sufian, Tarique Rahman's associate Miah Nuruddin and businessman Kazi Salumul Haque Kamal. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against all eight on May 6 at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. They stand accused of exchanging about Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the alleged involvement of Safiat Sobhan, son of Bashundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered in 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdnews24
