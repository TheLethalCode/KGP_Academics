 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked exporters to look for new markets abroad and focus on product diversification to raise the country's export earnings. "Our export basket consists of a few traditional products only. But Bangladesh can produce many other products and can produce at a very low cost. I would ask the industrialists to focus on product diversification," she told the inaugural ceremony for Dhaka International Trade Fair on Friday. The month-long fair, a joint initiative of the commerce ministry and the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), kicked off Friday which the organisers expected would buck a two-year trend of falling export orders. Export orders from the fair in 2006 amounted to Tk 24.68 crore and they shrunk to Tk 22.6 crore in 2008 and Tk 19.91 crore in 2009. Ten countries, including US, China, India, Pakistan and Malaysia, are participating at the 15th Dhaka International Trade Fair 2010. The primie minister said that her government's prime focus was to eradicate poverty from the country. "This is possible through creating employments and there is no way other than industrialisation to achieve that," she pointed out. Citing power crisis as a major obstacle, Hasina came down hard on the past governments, including the two-year interim regime, saying that they had done nothing to boost power generation. "Already a new power plant of 727.5 MW capacity has gone into operation. By June next year, another plant with 917 MW capacity would be commissioned." The prime minister also mentioned that the government had amended the 2008 Policy Guideline for private sector's participation in the power sector. "We've amended the guideline allowing more facilities for the private sector to operate in the power sector. We have also taken initiative to buy power from neighboring countries," Hasina said. Speaking at the function, commerce minister Faruq Khan said the government hoped the fair would open up new avenues to boost the country's export and foreign investments and would augment the country's economic and business environment. He also said that the government had approved a Tk 275 crore project for a permanent Trade Fair Complex to hold the fair. "We hope work on the project would start very soon." On Monday, Khan had told reporters that the site for complex would be ready by 2011, the location being the runway of the old airport in the capital's Tejgaon area. FBCCI president Annisul Huq, EPB vice chairman Shahab Ullah and acting commerce secretary Mustafa Mohiuddin also spoke at the function held at the Bangabandhu International Convention Centre. The prime minister afterwards went to the fair ground where she formally launched the fair by cutting a ribbon and visited some of the pavilions.
