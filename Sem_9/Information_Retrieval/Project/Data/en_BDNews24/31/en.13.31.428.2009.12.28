<TITLE> Half of Bangladesh adults are TB carriers: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)Half of the adult population of Bangladesh are TB carriers but most of them are probably not aware of it as the germ remains dormant, a BRAC report said. BRAC health programme executive Dr Fahim Ahmed Chowdhury however said there is a silver lining that though such large number of people are infected, very few of them carry active germs. Bangladesh ranks sixth among some 22 countries having the highest number of TB patients in the world. Every year some two million people die of the deadly disease across the world. This was revealed at a roundtable held on Sunday at the National Press Club jointly organised by Health and Environment Journalists' Forum of Bangladesh (HEJFB), National TB Control Programme and BRAC Health Programme. Dr Fahim said , "Though the TB identification and recovery rates under the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) are 70 and 85 per cent respectively, in fact 73 and 92 per cents have been actually achieved. But we need to work more intensively on it." TB control programme manager Dr Nazrul Islam lamented that negligence on the part of many doctors in southeast Asian countries might be responsible for increasing the number of TB patients. If proper dose of medicines is not administered, TB germs become medicine-resistant, he pointed out. In last one-and-a-half year, health workers working for TB control have recorded some 283 cases. Of them, 19 died while 22 were irregular patients, Dr. Islam said, adding that the treatment of TB patients is expensive and tough. He said TB culture sensitivity testing laboratories are being set up in Dhaka, Rajshahi, Mymensingh and Chittagong divisions under the national TB control programme launched in 1993. Though TB was discovered some 127 years ago, drugs for its control were invented only 65 years ago. Though it sounds incredible, one person is infected by TB each second across the world and one dies of it every 15 seconds. Speakers at the roundtable said that despite the magnitude of the infectious disease, there is a lack of awareness about it in third world countries including Bangladesh. Taking part in discussion, TB and leprosy control programme director Dr Prabhat Chandra said a new survey report on TB control is expected to be released next month. b
