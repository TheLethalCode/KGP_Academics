 DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 28(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alastair Cook and Paul Collingwood cashed in on beautiful batting conditions to take England to 281 for three at tea on the third day of the second test against South Africa on Monday. South Africa, who scored 343 in their first innings at Kingsmead, were looking increasingly desperate as their bowlers were helpless to stop the Cook-Collingwood partnership, which had grown to 126 on a warm, windy day. Cook cruised to 115 not out, while Collingwood batted in typically businesslike fashion to go to 59 not out after England had resumed from their overnight 103 for one. The left-handed Cook reached his 10th test century when he drove Makhaya Ntini through midwicket for two runs midway through the session. Cook had been the anchor in the morning as England reached 190 for three at lunch, losing the wickets of Jonathan Trott for 18 and Kevin Pietersen for 31.
