 Rajshahi, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the police force to shake off colonial era attitude and serve people with dedication. "The Bangladesh Police should be transformed into 'service oriented' force by making reforms in its structure, rules and regulations," Hasina said in her speech on Thursday at a programme of trainee police superintendents at Sarda Police Academy in Rajshahi. She stressed the necessity for nourishment of democratic values in the police. The PM hoped the police officials, recruited under the 27th BCS (police) cadre, will discharge their duties properly to build a society free from militancy and terrorism. bdnews2
