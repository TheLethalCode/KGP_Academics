 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog said on Thursday it is hopeful of a deal with India on sharing the water of common river Teesta. "We have not discussed Teesta water sharing issue in details at today's meeting. But the committee hopes that Bangladesh and India will be able to reach an agreement on sharing the Teesta water," said Abudr Razzaq, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources ministry. He was talking to reporters after a committee meeting Thursday at parliament building. Razzaq said he as water resources minister from 1996-2001 started the negotiation on sharing the Teesta water. "The minister and the Joint Rivers Commission have informed us that the government has been working relentlessly to strike a deal on the Teesta," said Razzaq. Bangladesh has been pressing India for decades to reach an agreement on sharing the water of the Teesta, which is essential for irrigating the country's largest farming project in Rangpur region. The Water Development Board sources say, the government cannot implement the second phase of the Teesta irrigation project due to paucity of water in the river flowing down from India. India in the 1990s constructed a barrage at Gazoldoba in the upstream for irrigation projects. During the lean periods, the water level of Teesta falls sharply every year making the irrigation difficult in the downstream. The committee also criticised British MP George Galway for his "provocative" statement on the proposed Tipaimukh dam in India. The committee chairman, who earlier said that the proposed Tipaimukh dam would not harm Bangladesh's interests, came down heavily on George Galway. "He (Galway) cannot make such a provocative statement on the Tipaimukh dam. "He made the comment just to woo Bangladeshi voters in his constituency in Britain. "We, the committee members, strongly condemn his uncalled for comment on the Tipaimukh dam as he does not know anything about the project," said Razzaq. A parliamentary team, led by Razzaq, on 29 July this year, went to Indian state of Tripura to witness the progress of the Tipaimukh dam. The team could not see the site owing to bad weather. After landing at the airport in Dhaka Razzaq and his committee members said the project was aimed at producing power, not irrigation. Therefore, the proposed project would not harm Bangladesh's water availability in the downstream. George Galway at the council of the main opposition BNP on Dec 8 bitterly criticised India for attempting to construct the Tipaimukh dam in the upstream. Galway was also critical of the government's "silence" on the Tipaimukh dam.
