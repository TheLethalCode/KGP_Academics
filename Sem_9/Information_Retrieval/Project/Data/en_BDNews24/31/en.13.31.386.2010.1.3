 Dhaka, Jan 02 (bdnews24.com)  Millions of primary and secondary level children across the country received free textbooks on Saturday, in time for the first school day of the new academic year, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said. Nahid had vowed that textbooks would reach all students by Jan 2, for the first day of school, as prime minister Sheikh Hasina officially launched the book distribution programme on Dec 30. Uncertainty surfaced over the free distribution of books following the NCTB warehouse fire on Oct 17, 2009, that incurred losses of hundred of tonnes of books and printing papers. But Nahid repeatedly vowed to ensure timely distribution of books for students in 2010 "at any cost". Nahid expressed satisfaction on Saturday with the timely delivery and the success of the first-time initiative to distribute secondary level text books as well as primary. He hoped the success would reduce drop-out rate and help improve the quality of education. Nahid said there could be some places where the books might have not reached yet but the books will get there shortly. "We are monitoring the distribution and are hopeful of reaching all students without exception," the minister said as he handed books to students of Azimpur Girls School and College in the capital. The government printed 186,400,027 books this year for around 27,662,000 students of primary, ibtedai, secondary, dakhil and vocational schools. The government for the first time has included secondary level schools in its free textbook programme. Students of primary level, including ibtedai madrasas, had been receiving free textbooks up to 2009. bdnews24
