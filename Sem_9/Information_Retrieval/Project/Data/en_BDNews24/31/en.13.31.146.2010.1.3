<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 03 (bdnews24.com)A long awaited law to restore 'vested' property to rightful owners will be among the new bills to be tabled in the winter session of parliament, which starts Monday. The law minister Shafique Ahmed will also introduce a proposed amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code, aimed at ensuring greater press freedom, by curtailing arrest warrants against journalists in defamation cases. The two bills have been sent to the parliament secretariat for introduction in the new session. The Vested Property Return (Amendment) Bill 2010, will reactivate a previous law to the same effect, which was passed by the Awami League on April 11, 2001. It is meant to redress the long-disputed Vested Property Act, originally introduced by the Pakistan government in the 1960s, and which still gives the state power to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of his/her property. The VPA has long been criticised in Bangladesh and abroad as a major violation of the rights of citizens, especially minorities, who had property seized in the past simply on leaving the country. The previous Awami League government, just before its exit from power in 2001, tabled the new law, fixing a 180-day time limit to prepare a list of properly documented vested property in order to take steps to restore falsely seized lands. The subsequent BNP government, however, by the end of 2001 amended the bill replacing the 180-day deadline with an 'indefinite period'. The list was never completed. As per the new bill, the government will have to publish a list of all vested property within 30 days of the gazette of the new lawin particular immovable property of Hindus who left Bangladesh (Pakistan) in 1965 during the Indo-Pakistan war. Pakistan's military government in 1965 had declared these 'enemy' properties before seizing them. PREVENTION OF HARASSMENT AGAINST JOURNALISTS The law minister will also table the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill-2010 to indemnify journalists from arrest. The bill will replace the word 'warrant' with 'summon' in section 500 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1898. As justification, the minister, by way of statement of the bill, says that it will protect media freedom and stop harassment of journalists for writing reports which others might consider 'defamatory'. bd
