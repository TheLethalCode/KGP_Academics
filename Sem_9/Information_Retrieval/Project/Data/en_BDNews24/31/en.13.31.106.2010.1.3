 Dhaka, Jan 02 (bdnews24.com)  The immediate past caretaker government was blasted by the law minister, among others at a book launch on Saturday, for what he termed 'kangaroo court' trials. Speakers at the book launch in Dhaka severely criticised the two-year regime that imposed a state of emergency in the country between January 2007 and December 2008. "There was no rule of law or independence of the judiciary during the tenure of the military-controlled interim government," law minister Shafique Ahmed said at the launch of 'Notes from a Prison: Bangladesh' by ruling party MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. Officials of certain intelligence agencies, known collectively as 'joint forces', were in reality in control of the judiciary from the lower courts to the High Court, he said. Many judges could not work independently, said the minister. MP Alamgir wrote the book about his imprisonment on what he claims was a false corruption conviction during the interim government. The law minister told the ceremony that he too had witnessed the travesty of justice. "I also went to a kangaroo court set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban and saw officials of the joint forces sit there and judges would work in line with their indications." He also alleged that the military-controlled regime tried to bar him from taking part in the Supreme Court Bar Association polls because he had become Sheikh Hasina's defence lawyer. "Intelligence agency officials took me away and threatened to bar me from taking part in the polls." But he went ahead and took part ignoring the threats, he said. Alamgir also alleged that the Anticorruption Commission was used as a tool for oppression and repression. He demanded trial of Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, who was then the commission's chairman, besides two other commissioners. Joint forces detained Alamgir on February 3, 2007 and a special court at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban sentenced him to 13 years in prison in a corruption case. He later appealed to the High Court against the sentence. Alamgir was released from jail on October 20, 2008. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq said, "It is a matter of regret that those behind 1/11 have still not been punished." "There were at least three or four advisers of the interim regime who had foreign passports. Even Fakhruddin Ahmed, the chief adviser, was an American citizen." He said although Hasan Mashhud, a retired general, had been among the architects of the coup of Jan 11 2007, he was serving as the high commissioner to Australia. Rafiq said he believed that the government should try those involved with the incidents leading to the two-year state of emergency for the sake of accountability. The prime minister's adviser Salman F Rahman and New Age editor Nurul Kabir also spoke among others. bdne
