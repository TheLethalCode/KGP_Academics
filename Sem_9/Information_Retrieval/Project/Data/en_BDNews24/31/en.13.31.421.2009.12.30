 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Rajuk, the capital development authority, is holding a third round lottery on Wednesday to complete allotment of residential plots in Uttara Model Town and Purbachal New Town projects. Plots for eight out of 12 categories in Uttara Model Town and Purbachal, a new satellite town in the capital, were allotted in two earlier phases through a computer-based lottery system, a housing ministry official said. Wednesday's lottery is to be held at 11am in presence of state minister for public works and housing Abdul Mannan Khan, and the ministry's public prosecutor Fakhrul Alam said. A total of 1,748 plots in the two housing developments will be allocated to ministers, advisors, state ministers, MPs, and retired or serving officers of the government and autonomous institutions. Plots will also be allotted in the remainders of other categories and those will be distributed on a seniority basis which the housing and public works ministry officials had been scrutinising in the past few months.
