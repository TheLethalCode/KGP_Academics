 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)Vacation is a quintessential part of American life. Irrespective of their financial or social standing hard working Americans, from janitor to president, go on vacation each year largely to escape the daily grind and recharge their batteries. And hence, there was nothing unusual in the case of President Barack Obama taking a vacation  except that he is the first president in more than 20 years to get away from the confines of the White House or Camp David, the presidential retreat, for Christmas. Obama headed to Hawaii last week with family and friends to spend 10 long days there during the Christmas holidays. Frankly, most Americans probably would not have bothered about the details of the Obamas' vacation had it not been interrupted by the foiled attack on a Detroit-bound jet airliner with 278 passengers on Christmas day. White House correspondents who had traveled to Hawaii with the president immediately began reporting on the incident, which quickly focused all attention on the developing story. Obama was reportedly singing Christmas carols with his family at their secluded Hawaiian beachfront getaway on Friday when a military aide interrupted with the news of the foiled attack. He quickly excused himself to get on a secure telephone line installed just for his visit in case of emergencies like this. As the story unfolded many Americans came to know for the first time that the Obamas had rented a five-bedroom 7000-square-foot luxury villa costing $4,000 a night and is on the market for sale for $8.9 million. Of course, the American taxpayers are not footing the bill. So they didn't seem to bother about the high cost of his vacation. Still, it sent an incongruent message raising questions about whether the president should have been that far away and, more particularly, whether he should have indulged in this kind of luxury in a time of war and economic trouble. "The president works hard day in and day out, and the American people recognise that," Bill Burton, a White House spokesman, told reporters. "And I think the American people also recognize that it makes sense for the commander in chief to recharge his batteries, even though he's never fully off duty." Aides of past presidents made similar arguments, of course, with varying success. John Kennedy was on vacation in Hyannis Port, Mass., when the Soviets began erecting the Berlin Wall. The elder George Bush was in Kennebunkport, Me., even as he moved troops to the Persian Gulf to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Bill Clinton was on Martha's Vineyard when he ordered cruise missile strikes to retaliate for attacks by Al Qaeda on American embassies in Africa in 1998. Few presidents were more roundly castigated for their vacations than George W. Bush, who spent a lot of his presidency at his ranch near Crawford, Texas. He was there in the summer of 2001 when intelligence agencies warned of a possible attack by Al Qaeda inside the United States, and he was there again four years later as Hurricane Katrina pummeled New Orleans. Critics savaged him for those vacations. One liberal website posted this headline in 2006: "Careless in Crawford: Catastrophes Gather While Bush Vacations." To be sure, no liberal media outlets or websites have voiced any compliant about the current president's Hawaii vacation. But the conservative Web site Free Republic did. While Americans "are still caught in the grips of the recession," a posting on the site said last week, "Obama is living like a king with no criticism from the mainstream media." Still, pollsters from both parties said Obama had more leeway for an island sojourn since he was born and partly raised in Hawaii. "People recognize the president works hard, and going home for a break is reasonable for anyone," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. "He's just lucky home is Hawaii." Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist, said Hawaii "did strike me as an odd choice, considering everything," but added, "I guess he gets somewhat of a pass having spent time there as a kid, and it certainly beats Chicago this time of year." Obama has no relatives remaining in Hawaii since his grandmother died last year and his sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, moved to Washington this year. But he has brought his family here nearly every Christmas since he and his wife, Michelle, had their daughters, Malia, 11, and Sasha, 8. This year, Obama brought his sister and close friends Eric Whitaker and Marty Nesbitt and their spouses. Valerie Jarrett, another close friend who now serves as a senior White House adviser, also joined the relatives and friends staying in two neighboring rental houses nearby. Jarrett said the setting had a rejuvenating effect on Obama. "His visits allow him to reconnect with his roots and cherished childhood memories," she told the New York Times.
