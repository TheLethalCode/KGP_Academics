<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)--The government has failed to fulfill its Aman rice and paddy procurement target because the prices in the market have been higher than those fixed. The government has cut a deal with mill owners for supply of 7,000 metric tons (MT) of rice out of a target of 3,00,000 MT, while only 726 MT have reached the silos. Under the circumstances, the government has eased its conditions for mill owners to buy 40 percent rice from farmers to reach the target. Mill owners can now buy paddy from domestic market to supply rice to the government silos. The decision came from a meeting of the food planning and monitoring committee chaired by food minister Abdur Razzaque at the food ministry on Tuesday. The committee members, finance minister A M A Muhith, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury, food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman, agriculture secretary CQK Mostak and director general of the food department Peus Causta were present there. After the meeting, speaking to reporters, Razzaque acknowledged the sudden price spike of rice in the market. He said some businessmen are increasing price in the market spreading rumours that the price of rice has risen in India, which is facing a crisis. In fact, rice production has been on the rise in all neighbouring rice-exporting countries except India. But, it has been slightly less in India, he said. The minister also mentioned his meeting with India's agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and said India has a stock of 80 lakh metric tons of rice. So, India will not import rice from other countries despite a low production. In addition, Myanmar has offered to sell 2,00,000 metric tons of rice to Bangladesh at a reasonable price, he said. Asked if open-market sale (OMS) of rice will begin immediately, Razzaqe said the country has a stock of 11.26 lakh MT of rice and wheat. The government will import another 2,30,000 metric tons of wheat by the next two months. Under the circumstances, the government may launch OMS to control market. But, he said, the market has yet to behave abnormally. He clarified that the OMS will begin only if the market is unstable. But, the government has already launched food-for-work programme entailing 200,000 MT rice and its effect will be felt on the market in a couple of days. In addition, Razzaque said, the government will allocate 100,000 MT of wheat for Test Relief in ten days. b
