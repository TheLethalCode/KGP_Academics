 Madaripur, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Ferry services remained halted for four hours on Mawa-Kawrakandhi route across the Padma river due to poor visibility caused by dense fog. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) official Abu Alam Hawladar said ferry crossings were stopped as dense fog covered the signal lights. Meanwhile, road and rail communications were also hit. Four people died as a bus collided head-on with an oil tanker on the Dhaka-Khulna highway in Faridpur. And, trains remained halted on Saturday between Khulna and Dinajpur as a Parbatipur-bound oil train derailed at a rail crossing in Joypurhat town. Joypurhat stationmaster Abdul Jabbar said the train, carrying 1,350 metric tonnes of oil in 30 tankers, went off the tracks at 2.20pm. bdne
