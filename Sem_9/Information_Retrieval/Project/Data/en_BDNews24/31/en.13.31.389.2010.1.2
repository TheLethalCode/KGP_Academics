<TEXT>
 Natore, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  A pressure group of Natore enforced a half an hour blockade in the district town on Saturday demanding gas supply through pipeline. Thousands of people joined the programme at the call of Natore Gas Supply Movement Committee starting at 11am. Witnesses said the blockade had paralysed life in the town during the period when traffic movement came to standstill. The participants later in a rally said they would continue their movement until they get gas supply. Sirajul Islam, joint convener of the committee, said: "We won't allow supply of gas to Rajshahi through Natore if we are not provided it." Kazi Abul Hashem, convener of the committee, said: "If the government does not provide gas to Natore we will launch tougher movements." bdne
