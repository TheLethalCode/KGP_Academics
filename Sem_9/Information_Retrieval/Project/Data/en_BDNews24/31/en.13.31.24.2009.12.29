 KABUL, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan parliamentary elections must be held by late May as set out in the constitution and the international community should help secure and pay for the vote, the president's office said on Tuesday. Afghanistan is still recovering from a presidential vote last August that was marred by widespread fraud, violence and voter intimidation. Critics say a May poll does not leave enough time to introduce reforms needed to avert another flawed result. But Afghan President Hamid Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omar, said delaying the vote would be a political fiasco.

Karzai's relationship with the West has soured since his fraud-ridden re-election and the incumbent is under increasing pressure to stamp out widespread graft in his government. Strains on the relationship were highlighted when Karzai condemned a raid by foreign forces in a remote part of northeastern Afghanistan late on Saturday in which 10 civilians were killed, according to accounts from residents. The president was "angry" about the attack, which had not been coordinated with Afghan forces in the area, Omar said. A spokesman for the NATO-led force said there had been no NATO forces in the area at the time but they were looking into the allegations of civilian casual
