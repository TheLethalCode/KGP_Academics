 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)The government will invite tender for the construction of the Padma bridge in next February, the communications minister have told a parliamentary body. Minister Syed Abul Hossain told the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry on Monday that the much-awaited bridge connecting Dhaka with the southwestern region would be finished by 2014. "The ministry officials have informed us that the tender for the Padma bridge will be floated in February next year," Shaikh Muzibur Rahman, the committee chairman, told journalists after the meeting in parliament building. "The minister has told us that the present government will finish the Padma bridge construction during the tenure of the Awami League government," he said. The Padma bridge over the river Padma will be the largest in the country, leaving behind the 4.8-kilomtere long Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge, which connects Dhaka with 16 districts in the north. The proposed bridge, to span 6.15 kilometres, will boost communication of the country's south and southwest. It is also expected to bring new industry to the region, which the government says will expand the country's economy as a whole. The multi-purpose bridge is expected to drastically cut the travel time. The estimated cost of the bridge has escalated to $2.4 billion, with all but $140 million being pledged by donors, finance minister AMA Muhith said last Monday. The bridge construction will be completed during the incumbent government's tenure, which ends in 2013. Businesses hope that the bridge will also contribute to makingBangladesh's second sea port Mongla functional.
