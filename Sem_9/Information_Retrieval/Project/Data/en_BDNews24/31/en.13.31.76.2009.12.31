 Sayedul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Extra judicial killings remained a subject of concern and debate in 2009, as in recent years, moving the High Court itself to express grave misgivings. Deaths in reported encounters with law-enforcing agencies, commonly termed 'crossfire' to denote suspicious circumstances, continued unabated under the new government led by Awami League. The party was previously loudly critical of this crude method of tackling crime and terrorism. The accounts by law enforcers of 'armed encounters' or 'gun battles' explaining such killings remained unchanged. Meanwhilemuch to the chagrin of the human rights groups and civil societyhome minister Sahara Khatun and the state minister Shamsul Haq Tuku have repeatedly disavowed any 'crossfire' deaths. Sahara Khatun has rejected concerns of human rights organisations from home and abroad, stating categorically in November: "There has been no crossfire since our government has taken office. We're not killing (people) in crossfire." Tuku in the same month said: "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two deaths occur unavoidably." AROUND 150 'ENCOUNTERS' RAB statistics showed a total of 60 people died in 57 'encounters' with the elite force in 2009 of which one died in January, three in April, 12 in May, one in June, four in July, eight in August, 17 in September, nine in November and two in December. The 'encounter' or 'crossfire' killings totalled 195 in 2006, while the number was 93 in 2007 and 80 in 2008. Almost each of the backdrop stories said the 'suspected extremists/miltants/terrorists' shot first while trying to resist RAB from arresting them. Along with RAB, this year police members also killed some 68 people in 'encounters', according to data available from human rights watchdog Odhikar. Odhikar records said police encounters killed six people in January, one in February, one in April, one in May, five in June, one in July, 10 in August, 16 in September, 18 in October and nine in November. RAB-police joint raids also killed another 25 people this year. JUSTIFIED, SAYS RAB Speaking on this issue, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said in December: "Each gun battle involving RAB has been put through departmental investigation, but no wrongdoings were found. So we can say all the incidents were justified." Assistant inspector general (PRO) at police headquarter MD Nazrul Islam also told bdnews24.com, "Each gun battle involving firearms has been put through investigation. If any wrongdoings are found, departmental actions are taken against the offenders." He claimed no wrongdoings were found in 2009. According to Odhikar, 141 extrajudicial killings took place in 2009. Among which, 39 were killed by RAB, 68 by police, 25 by joint forces of RAB and police, three by army, one by jail police, one by forest guards, two by Bangladesh Ansar, one by BDR and one by naval coast guards. HIGH COURT, COMMISSION CONCERNED Two brothers, Lutfor Khalashi, 40, and Khairul Khalashi, 38, alleged to be extremists, were killed in a reported shootout with RAB in Madaripur on November 16 within 48 hours after their relatives expressed fear that they might be killed. The HC issued a suo moto rule the next day on the government and RAB to explain the shootout and killing of the two brothers in Madaripur, asking why the deaths should not be ruled extra-judicial. Despite that suo moto rule, extrajudicial killings continued to take place and the High Court on December 14 expressed grave concern at the unabated 'crossfire' deaths. HC also ordered the government to stop such extrajudicial killings until a next hearing on January 9, 2010. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), instituted during the tenure of the last interim government, meanwhile started its own investigation on the controversial 'crossfire' killings. But the commission chief, former justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury, blamed RAB and police for not providing enough assistance in the investigation. NHRC submitted its reports to the president which accused RAB and police of continuing extrajudicial killings and their non-cooperation. It also asked the president to form a separate probe commission for investigating these killings. bd
