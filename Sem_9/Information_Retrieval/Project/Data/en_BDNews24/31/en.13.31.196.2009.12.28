 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)Muslims in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world are observing Ashura amid religious fervour and solemnity on Monday, the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram in the Islamic calendar. The Shia community brought out a procession from old Dhaka's Hossaini Dalan Imambara at around 11:30am carrying the symbolic mausoleum of the Prophet Mohammad's two grandsons--Imam Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein. Pilgrims, most dressed in black, blare traditional Ashura chant through loudspeakers. The procession will end at Dhanmondi 2 marching through Baxi Bazar, Harnath Ghosh Road, Azimpur and New Market areas. Tajia and mourning procession also paraded the city streets in the morning. The Islamic Foundation has organised a discussion on the significance of Ashura and its lessons at the Baitul Mokarram National Mosque later in the day. Apart from that the High Court Shrine authorities have arranged programmes to mark the day. Ashura marks the climax of the Remembrance of Muharram and Shia Muslims commemorate the slaying of the prophet Mohammad's grandson Imam Hussein ibn Ali in 680 AD in the Battle of Karbala. On the first day of Muharram, the army of Caliph Yazid laid siege to Hussein and followers in the desert near Kerbala. Hussein was killed in battle 10 days later after he had refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid. Hussein was decapitated and his head was taken to Damascus, the seat of the Ummayad dynasty to which Yazid belonged. For the Shia, Hussein's death symbolises confronting tyranny in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also a reminder of the rift with Sunnis, who do not revere Hussein as Shia do, over the prophet Mohammad's succession. During the ceremony, the Shia beat their heads and chests and gash their heads with swords to show their grief and echo the suffering of Imam Hussein. It is observed in Iraq and in other countries with sizeable Shia communities, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Several million pilgrims are expected to converge on Kerbala. The day also bears significance for some Sunni Muslims as Moses fasted on that day to express gratitude to God for liberating the Israelites from Egypt. According to Sunni Muslim tradition, the Prophet Mohammad fasted on this day and asked other people to fast. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia issued separate messages for the day. bdn
