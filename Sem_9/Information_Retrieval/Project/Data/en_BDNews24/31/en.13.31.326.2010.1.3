 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com) --- Cyclone Aila coming on the heels of cyclone Sidr inflicted less damage but in some cases it was more intense, Power and Participation Research Centre, an NGO, said on Saturday. Loss of lives was not significantaround 150but long term damage to the regional economy was quite significant with 948,621 families and 323,454 acres of land badly affected, according to a PPRC study carried out in Aila-affected areas in December. Former adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, PPRC executive chairman, presented the findings at a press briefing at the centre's Dhanmondi offices. Significant pockets of the most affected zone were in great misery and faced uncertainty about a return to normal economic life, he said. Coastal areas of Satkhira and Khulna remain openly vulnerable to daily tides. Some 43,000 people are still living under the open sky on damaged embankments while 700,000 people are staring at total loss of livelihood and home in the two districts if the emergency repair of embankments is not completed in this dry season, says PPRC. Rahman said the unfolding disaster in Aila-affected areas has been worsened by panic among locals created by over-emphasis from climate change advocates on the possibility of inundation and scary discussions about climate refugees. Bangladesh is more akin to a case like the Netherlands which also faces inundation from the sea but has built a successful economy through addressing issues of embankments and local economic adaptation, he said. Procedural problems like emergency aid, inadequate cost estimates, supplementary funds to UNOs for maintenance of dams need to be addressed. Urgent supplementary plans on emergency repair of worst-affected embankments and a long-term strategy on developing an integrated action plan for the coastal areas through local consultations are badly needed, said Rahman. Southern Bangladesh is emerging as the new heartland of poverty and vulnerability and so the policy challenge should not be just on addressing disasters but of addressing a triple goal: of addressing disaster, climate change and poverty, he said. bd
