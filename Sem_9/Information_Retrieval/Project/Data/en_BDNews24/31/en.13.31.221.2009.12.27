 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) The four Dhaka University students against whom arrest warrants were issued on Dec 13 for involvement in unrest on campus during the last caretaker authority now want withdrawal of the case by the elected government. The students facing arrest are Jahidul Islam Biplob, Dween Islam Angel, Rofiqul Islam Shujon and Abul Hasan, who are finding it difficult to pursue their academic activities peace peacefully. Hakim Ali, the first chief additional metropolitan magistrate, Dhaka issued the arrest warrants. Dween Islam Angel told bdnews24.com Saturday, "We had protested the atrocities committed by the undemocratic government then, which eventually led to establishment of a democratic government today." "The government, therefore, should cancel the case filed against us immediately." Of the cases filed in connection with the August 2007 student unrest, all excepting one filed over torching a military vehicle had been withdrawn during the CG rule. Defence counsel Mostafizur Rahman Talukder said Dec 13 was set for recording testimonies, when four of the seven accused in the arson case were absent. But the court rejected the appeal for time and issued warrants of arrest against the four who failed to appear in the court. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim said Saturday, the arrest warrants had not reached the police station till then. The DU authorities have, in the meantime, applied to the home ministry to withdraw the case. The parliamentary standing committee on the education ministry also recommended cancellation of the case. Standing committee president Rashed Khan Menon told bdnews24.com, "The home ministry has intimated that it has initiated the process of case withdrawal." He also expects a good outcome soon. During a three-day student unrest on Aug 20-22, 2007, a military vehicle was torched at Shahbagh. Four DU teachers and eight students were arrested during the agitation. Though these teachers and students were convicted in a case, they were eventually freed after the president pardoned them. bdnews24.co
