 HUAY NAM KHAO, Thailand, Dec 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Thai army began the forced repatriation of thousands of ethnic Hmong asylum-seekers to Laos on Monday, defying international concerns that some would be persecuted back home. About 5,000 troops armed with batons and shields were dispatched to a mountain camp in Huay Nam Khao, 300 km (186 miles) north of Bangkok to clear the 4,400 Hmong, who say they face oppression by Laos' communist government if sent back. Known as America's "forgotten allies", the Hmong sided with the United States during the Vietnam War and many fled Laos in 1975 when the communist Pathet Lao took power. Tens of thousands have since been resettled in the US The United States and United Nations have expressed concern about the forced repatriation and the fate awaiting some of the Hmong upon their return to Laos. The United States on Sunday called on Thailand to halt the operation, which it said was a "serious violation of the international humanitarian principles that Thailand has long been known for championing". In a statement issued on Sunday, state department spokesman Ian Kelly also urged Laos to treat the returnees humanely, provide access for international monitors and facilitate resettlement opportunities. Thailand regards the Hmong in Huay Nam Khao as economic migrants with no claim to refugee status. SAFETY ASSURED Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said the Lao government had assured him the Hmong would be well looked after and the U.N refugee agency UNHCR would be allowed to visit them. Colonel Thana Charuvat, who is in charge of the repatriation, said troops would try to finish the operation in a day "to prevent any attempted resistance". More than 2,600 had already been taken out of the camp in army trucks on the way to an immigration centre in Nong Khai bordering Laos, Thana said. They will then be handed over to Lao authorities. Some 300, including designated leaders, had refused to leave. "After we separated the leaders, they gave up resistance," Thana told Reuters. "We assured them that Lao government has forgiven them and that they can ask for resettlement, if they want, when they are back in Laos." Rights groups and UNHCR say some of the Hmong could qualify for refugee status and should not be sent back. Thailand has denied UNHCR requests to visit the camp to assess their status. Thailand fears that by facilitating their resettlement in a third country, it could encourage more illegal migrants. A European diplomat in Bangkok estimated that a few hundred of the returnees may have legitimate fears of persecution, especially those who were part of the U.S.-backed resistance movement against the communists in the 1970s. Lionel Rosenblatt, president emeritus of Refugees International, said the deportation could hurt Thailand's reputation as a safe haven for people fleeing persecution. The country has been a key transit point for more than 1.5 million refugees from countries like Myanmar and Indoch
