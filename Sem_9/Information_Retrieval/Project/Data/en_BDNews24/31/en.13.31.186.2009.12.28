 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)--Muslims in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world will observe Ashura amid religious fervour and solemnity on Monday, the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram in Islamic calendar. Ashura marks the climax of the Remembrance of Muharram and Shia Muslims commemorate the slaying of the prophet Mohammad's grandson Imam Hussein ibn Ali in 680 AD in the Battle of Karbala. On the first day of Muharram, the army of Caliph Yazid laid siege to Hussein and followers in the desert near Kerbala. Hussein was killed in battle 10 days later after he had refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid. Hussein was decapitated and his head was taken to Damascus, the seat of the Ummayad dynasty to which Yazid belonged. For the Shia, Hussein's death symbolises confronting tyranny in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also a reminder of the rift with Sunnis, who do not revere Hussein as Shia do, over the prophet Mohammad's succession. During the ceremony, the Shia beat their heads and chests and gash their heads with swords to show their grief and echo the suffering of Imam Hussein. It is observed in Iraq and in other countries with sizeable Shia communities, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Several million pilgrims are expected to converge on Kerbala. The day also bears significance for some Sunni Muslims as Moses fasted on that day to express gratitude to God for liberating the Israelites from Egypt. According to Sunni Muslim tradition, the Prophet Mohammad fasted on this day and asked other people to fast. Like every year, Hossaini Dalan Imambara of Dhaka is all set to bring out a rally carrying the symbolic mausoleum of the Prophet Mohammad's two grandsons--Imam Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein. Pilgrims, most dressed in black, blare traditional Ashura chants through loudspeakers Tajia and mourning procession will parade the city streets in the morning. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia issued separate messages for the day. b
