 SEOUL, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it had detained a US citizen who entered its territory, apparently confirming a report that an American activist crossed into the state to raise awareness about Pyongyang's human rights abuses. Robert Park, 28, crossed into the North last Friday, other activists said.

Then the governments of the world will become more prone to say something, and more embarrassed and more forced to make a statement." Western governments and human rights activists say North Korea maintains a network of political prisons to crush the possibility of dissent where brutality is the norm and deaths are commonplace. The North uses unlawful and arbitrary killings and stpopages public executions to intimidate the masses, critics say. They say it prevents free speech, controls all media and crushes nascent attempts at reform by executing or imprisoning those who oppose the state. Park was quoted by activists who went with him to the border as shouting when he went across: "I am an American citizen. I am bringing God's love. God loves yo
