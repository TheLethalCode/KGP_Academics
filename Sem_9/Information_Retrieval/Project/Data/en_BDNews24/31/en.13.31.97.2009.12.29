<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is in process of formulating a policy to ensure voting rights for the expatriates, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Tuesday. "They may have to wait for until electronic voting system is introduced, which is not very far away," Huda said at a seminar on election management in Sylhet. Looking back a year after the Dec 29 2008 general election, he said: "We were able to hold the ninth national elections successfully though there were immense crises." "The EC is satisfied, but not absolutely," he said, adding even countries like USA and UK never carry 100 percent success in their national polls. Huda said the massive compilation of a photo-based voter list of 80 million people and the restructuring of parliamentary constituencies created some problems. However, he hoped that in future those issues would create no further problems. The chief election commissioner was speaking at a seminar entitled 'Development of Election Management' arranged as a part of the EC's Support to the Electoral Process Project at Sylhet. Sylhet divisional commissioner Mohammad Golam Rabbani presided over the programme. bdnew
