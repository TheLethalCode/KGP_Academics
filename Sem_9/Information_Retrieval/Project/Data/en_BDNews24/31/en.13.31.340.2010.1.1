<TITLE> US drone attack in Pakistan kills three militants </TITLE>

 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - A missile fired by a pilotless US drone aircraft on Friday killed at least three militants travelling in a car in Pakistan's North Waziristan region on the Afghan border, security officials said. "The bodies were burnt beyond recognition. We are trying to determine their identity," said one security official. On Thursday night, a drone attack killed at least two militants in the same region, known as a sanctuary for Taliban and al Qaeda militants fighting in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The United States carried out at least 50 drone air strikes in northwestern border regions in 2009, killing about 415 people, including many foreign militants, according to tally reports from Pakistani officials and residents. In 2008, there were 32 strikes that killed about 240 people. Pakistan worries the strikes could undermine efforts to deal with militancy because the civilian casualties inflame public anger and bolster support for the fighters. Pakistan has pressed the United States to provide it with drones to allow it to conduct its own attacks.
