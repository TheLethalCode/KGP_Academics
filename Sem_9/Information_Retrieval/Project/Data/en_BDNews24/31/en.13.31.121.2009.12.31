 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The prime minister, on New Year's Eve, said the five former army officers convicted of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 1975 assassination would be executed "at the start of the new year". "We are determined to carry out the death sentences at the very beginning of the New Year," Hasina said in a New Year message. "We will also start the processes of trying all brutal killings including that of four national leaders (in Dhaka Central Jail in 1975), war crime and grenade attack on Awami League assembly on August 21." Hasina also pledged to continue the past year's ongoing successes in different sectors in the New Year. President Zillur Rahman and opposition leader Khaleda Zia also greeted countrymen and expatriates for the New Year. Hoping for progress and prosperity in national life in the New Year, Zillur Rahman said: "We have to go forward to a golden future, leaving all failures and grief with the old year behind." In her welcome note, Khaleda called on all, including opposition party men, to work together and said: "We have to work unitedly to render New Year 2010 into a year of peace and progress." bdnew
