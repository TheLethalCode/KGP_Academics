 DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England off-spinner Graeme Swann climbed eight places to a career-high third in the International Cricket Council's test bowling rankings on Thursday. Swann claimed nine wickets in the match as England took a 1-0 lead in the series by beating South Africa by an innings and 98 runs in the second test in Durban which ended Wednesday. South African fast bowler Dale Steyn tops the rankings ahead of Australian all-rounder Mitchell Johnson. Swann also moved up three positions to fourth in the rankings for test all-rounders. South Africa's Jacques Kallis tops that list from New Zealander Daniel Vettori and Johnson.
