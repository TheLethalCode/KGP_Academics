 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Around Tk 83 crore ($12 million) could be saved in running costs every year if just one percent of the country's irrigation pumps could be powered by the sun, experts say. Bangladesh consumes over 2 million metric tonnes of import-based High Speed Diesel (HSD) every year, out of which 40 percent goes for irrigation in agriculture, a roundtable on uses of solar energy heard on Sunday. Some 800MW of electricity is also consumed for irrigation everyday. Maximum power production capacity in Bangladesh is around 4400MW against a peak demand of over 5000MWwith demand growing daily. Using solar energy in irrigation would ease diesel costs as well as lessen pressure on the national grid, said Khursheed-Ul-Islam, senior adviser of GTZ's Sustainable Energy for Development (SED) programme. During the Boro season, 120 million acres of rice fields in Bangladesh are irrigated by 1.33 million irrigation pumps. Some 12.5 percent of these pumps are electric, 85 percent based on small diesel engines and the rest are run by both, a report by the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) said. Recently, Rahimafrooz (Bangladesh) Ltd., as a pioneer, to set up a Solar Photovoltaic Water Pumping System (PVP), in a pilot project at Savar, which covers 20 acres of land for irrigation. Islam said, "The government must come forward to make it available for the people." Niaz Rahman, director of Rahimafrooz (Bangladesh) Ltd., said, "The technology can easily be spread if the government allots a fraction of the subsidy it gives for diesel. "The banks can also provide loans without interest," he added. The government announced in December that around 9 million farmers will receive cash subsidies for diesel through the coming Boro season, at an estimated cost to the government of Tk 350 crore. Syed Yousuf Hossain, chairman of Energy Regulatory Commission, suggested, "The solar pumps, as they are expensive in initial outlay, can be implemented through cooperatives." State minister for energy and power Brig Gen (retd) Enamul Huq in his speech as chief guest said, "The government is concerned with alternative energy since mineral resources such as gas and coal are being spent." He urged all to focus on alternative energy with a view to be self-dependent in power. bdn
