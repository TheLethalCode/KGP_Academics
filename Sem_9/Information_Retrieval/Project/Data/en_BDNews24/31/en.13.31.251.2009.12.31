 Rangamati, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Another 75 border guards accused of mutiny stand trial in the Rangamati special court. The Special Court No 4 set up at the BDR Rangamati headquarters began its second mutiny trial this week against rebel border guards of 9th Rifles Battalion. The 75 border guards were produced before the court on Thursday. Nayek subedar Rezaur Rahman, prosecuting the case, read out charges against the 75 accused before the panel of judges, headed by BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam. The prosecution told the court the accused on Feb 26 expressed solidarity with the Peelkhana mutineers. The court gave the accused 45 days until Feb 15 to prepare their defence. The same court launched the first of the BDR mutiny trials, against nine accused BDR personnel of 12th Rifles Battalion, ending hearings on Thursday. The February 25-26 BDR mutineers killed over 70 people at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. The rebellion quickly spread to other BDR outposts across the country. The government has formed six special courts in all, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny around the country. The first of the BDR mutiny trials began at Rangamati on November 24. Border guards have been accused in three separate mutiny cases in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. bdn
