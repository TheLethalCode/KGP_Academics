 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  A cold wave sweeping over northern and central Bangladesh, causing deaths and disrupting communications due to fog and poor visibility, looks set to continue, the met office said on Saturday. The north was hardest hit with temperatures plummeting as low as 6 degrees Celcius in some parts. At least 21 people died in road accidents over 24 hours in Faridpur, while 25 children died of cold-related diseases over the last ten days in Rangpur alone. Meanwhile, ferry services were disrupted at Mawa on Saturday. The meteorological department said moderate to thick fog would build up again over north-western Bangladesh and elsewhere between midnight and morning Sunday. Abdul Mannan, a senior meteorologist, told bdnews24.com that the cold wave might continue for at least two more days. TRANSPORT DISRUPTIONS Thick fog on Saturday disrupted ferry services on the Mawa-Kawrakandi route. Several ferries also remained stranded mid-river from 7.30am for around four hours, said officials. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) official Abu Alam Hawladar said ferry crossings had to be suspended due to dense fog. Meanwhile, train services between Khulna and Dinajpur also ground to a halt on Saturday as a Parbatipur-bound oil train derailed at a crossing in Joypurhat town. Joypurhat stationmaster Abdul Jabbar said the train, carrying 1,350 tonnes of oil in 30 tankers, went off the tracks at 2.20pm.
