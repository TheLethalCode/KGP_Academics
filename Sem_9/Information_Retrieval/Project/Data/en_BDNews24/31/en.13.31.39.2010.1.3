 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government will expand the Dhaka-Chittagong highway to six lanes in phases and rail-tracks between the capital and main port will be made two-way along the full distance, commerce minister Faruk Khan said on Sunday. He said these steps would be implemented with a view to enhance national trade through better transport facilities with the main port. The cabinet committee on public purchase has already approved Tk 16 billion (Tk 1600 crore) to expand the highway into four lanes within two years. "Then it will be made a six-lane highway," he said at a meeting with the newly elected members of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) at the ministry. The government eventually has plans to transform the Dhaka-Chittagong highway into an elevated one, he added. He said the railway line between the capital and the port city would be made two-way along its whole length within the next three years. "Waterways will also be developed," the minister said. Faruk asked the DCCI authority to form a monitoring cell, like that of FBCCI, to monitor prices of essentials. He also urged businessmen to refrain from making excessive profit. The minister told the delegation: "You are not given the respect you deserve only because a handful among you make huge profits." "We could control businessmen, but we don't want to," he added. Faruk told the chamber's delegation that it would be up to them if they wanted the government to impose stronger regulations on businessmen. b
