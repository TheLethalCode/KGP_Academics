<TEXT>
 ROME, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain David Beckham will be in England's 2010 World Cup squad providing he is fit and playing regularly, manager Fabio Capello said on Monday. The Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder arrives in Italy later in the day for the start of a second loan spell at AC Milan after the conclusion of the Major League Soccer season. "Certainly (I'll call up Beckham) if he is playing and physically fit," Capello told the La Gazzetta dello Sport. "I don't look at age, I look at qualities and Beckham has lots. He's serious, he's a great professional and the World Cup is incredibly important to him." Capello said he was confident that the 34-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder would repeat the good form he showed in his first spell at the Serie A club last season. "He will do well (at Milan). I have no doubt about it," Capello said. "David is a player with his head straight." Capello said he was pleased about his compatriot Roberto Mancini's arrival at Manchester City, making him the latest in a long series of Italian coaches to secure top jobs abroad. "It's a reason for pride for our football," he said. "(They choose Italians because) we bring ideas, desire for new things, experiences." However, the former Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid coach said that despite the success of his compatriots, Italian football still could learn from the English game. "The Premier League is the most interesting, attractive championship in the world," he said. "There are special aromas - full stadiums, safety, beauty, a lack of stupidity. "Take Newcastle United. They were relegated and they are applauded. Now they are in the second tier and 50,000 go to see them. The atmosphere in Italy is different - hostile, nasty. "We make the same mistakes with the management of the grounds, with violent fans. We don't improve, we don't move forward, we don't resolve the problems. This upsets me.
