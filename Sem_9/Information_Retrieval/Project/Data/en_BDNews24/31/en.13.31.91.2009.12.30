<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30(bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun has refuted reports about India sending extra security forces to protect its mission in Dhaka. After days of mounting newspaper reports, Sahara denied any knowledge of the matter just two days ago. But she told reporters Wednesday: "I have enquired about the matter. The news appearing in different dailies and telecast on different channels is absolutely false." The home minister was speaking at the prison directorate, where she had held a meeting with prison officials. Meanwhile, the foreign ministry, in a separate statement on Wednesday, made it clear that diplomatic missions in Bangladesh lie beyond the country's legal framework. In its statement, the ministry said foreign missions could have their own arrangements to ensure internal security and manage embassies and other activities according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Opposition BNP too had called for 'clarification' from the government on the issue, terming such deployment as a "threat to Bangladesh's sovereignty". b
