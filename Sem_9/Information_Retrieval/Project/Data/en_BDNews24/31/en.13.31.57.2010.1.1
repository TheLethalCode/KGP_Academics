<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladeshis celebrated noisily with fireworks and music on Thursday night to kick off into the New Year and the new decade, twice, as confusions reigned over clocks. Thousands of people counted down to midnight to welcome in 2010 the length and breadth of the country in a night of revelry. Usual New Year's gremlins--drunkenness, disorder and liquor ban breaches-- returned, but revellers were mostly well behaved. In capital Dhaka, huge crowds gathered on Dhaka University's TSC and Gulshan, Baridhara, Banani, Uttara, Dhanmandi neighbourhoods--the usual celebration hot spots. There were no immediate report of violence and casualties. Clocks went back at 11:59pm on Thursday night--rather than midnight--to restore Bangladesh Standard Time (BdST), GMT+6, but confusions meant many had two chances to cheer in the New Year. Daylight Saving Time was introduced for the first time this year, by putting clocks forward on June 19. Many of those who set off the traditional fire crackers or fireworks at midnight grumbles at having to fork out for two lots, but they paid for double the fun! Security agencies took the usual "special measures" across the country, including capital Dhaka. Some 5,000 members of Rapid Action Battalion hit the streets, 2,000 of them in the capital alone, to maintain law and order around the country. Around 10,000 policemen were also engaged in eight crime zones in Dhaka. Riot cars, water cannons and fire-dousing vehicles and ambulances were on stand-by just in case. Special check posts were thrown up throughout the city after 10pm. Bands played at big hotels and restaurants to keep the revellers entertained in the cities and towns
