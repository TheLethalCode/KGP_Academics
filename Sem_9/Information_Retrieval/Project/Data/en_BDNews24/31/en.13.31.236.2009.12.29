ACC chairman Golam Rahman made the request at a meeting with Attorney General Mahbubey Alam at AG's office. Alam told the ACC chief to refer the urgent cases to the AG's office and said that he would inform the chief justice about the issue. He later told reporters that many cases remained pending with the High Court following stay orders. So, the ACC cannot pursue the cases. At least 509 corruption cases are held up in the HC due to stay orders. Alam quoting the ACC chief said the cases need to be resolved immediately as the situation is hampering ACC activities. bdnew
