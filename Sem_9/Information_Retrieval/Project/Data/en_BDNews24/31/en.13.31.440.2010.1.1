<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid on Friday said it would be more convenient to address the opposition's allegations and grievances if those were made in the House during a parliamentary session instead of ventilating them outside. Speaking at a function of Khelaghar, a children's organisation, Hamid once again urged the main opposition BNP to join the parliament's winter session. "I urge the major opposition political party to return to the parliament without wasting time. If they shun the street and press their demands in the House, it would be easier for the treasury bench to listen to them and meet their demands," said the speaker. Hamid said, "I can't do anything about any demands made on the streets, as the parliamentary rules of business applies only within the parliament. Therefore, I request them to join the House." The winter session of parliament is scheduled to begin Monday. Since the end of the first session, the opposition BNP has been boycotting the parliament in pursuance of a number of demands including demands for increased front row seats for the opposition. BNP is also demanding withdrawal of an order to cancel the lease for opposition leader Khaleda Zia's Dhaka Cantonment residence and all political cases filed against Tarique Rahman and other BNP leaders. Earlier on Monday, the speaker had proposed to allocate one more front row seat to the opposition provided they would join the parliament and make their demands afresh. But senior BNP MPs barrister Moudud Ahmed and Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury turned down the offer saying that unless the overall environment is made more conducive, the opposition would not accept the speaker's proposal. The Khelaghar function on the occasion of the 500th literary session of the organization, was being attended by eminent Indian litterateur Sunil Gangopadhyaya and other renowned cultural and literary personalities. Speaker Abdul Hamid and eminent prose writer Hasan Azizul Haq inaugurated the event by releasing white pigeons and colourful balloons in the clear winter sky. Replying to a reporter's query, Hamid said, "I haven't yet received any official response from the opposition to my call urging them to join the parliament. I've heard about their stance expressed though the media. I've spoken to the chief whip of the opposition too." He expressed his hope that the parliamentary environment would be more conducive during 2010. Khelaghar chairperson Prof Mahfuza Khanam and general secretary Dr Lenin Chowdhury welcomed the chief guest and other dignitaries to the function. bdnew
