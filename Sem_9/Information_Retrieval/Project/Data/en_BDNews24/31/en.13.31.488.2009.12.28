 Nilphamari, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)--A train sped off the tracks early on Monday at Chilahati and ran half a kilometre on a dirt road before smashing four houses. No injuries were reported since the 10 occupants of two families were awake in the houses. No passenger was injured, officer in charge of Domar Police Station Abdus Samad said. Samad said the local Sokina mail train was heading for Chilahati from Pakshi and was supposed to stop at Chilahati station in Domar Upazila at around 3:30am. But the driver did not reduce speed, he added. The driver escaped immediately after the accident, and the guard and station master were nowhere to be found. Train operations on the route were suspended for almost 12 hours following the incident, resuming in the afternoon. The Rajshahi-bound Titumir Express (Up and Down), Barendra Express (Up and Down) and local trains run on the route. bdnews2
