 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken up a project worth Tk 487 crore to buy vehicles for the police. Home minister Sahara Khatun said on Sunday that this would make the police force more dynamic. "Under the project we will buy pickups, motorcycles and water vessels and they will be distributed to police stations," Sahara told reporters after a review meeting of the Annual Development Programme. Each police station will get two pickups and two motorcycles. Besides, the police stations located at the coastal and riverine areas will be provided with water vessels for special patrol. "Police personnel will then be able to reach spots more quickly and serve people better," said Sahara. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder acknowledged receipt of a proposal to raise the rank of the inspector general of police. Earlier the country's police chief had the rank of a three-star general (lieutenant general), but it was later lowered to that of a two-star general (major general). "We think it should be raised to a three-star rank," he said. Sobhan said the government would very likely take steps to raise the rank soon. Among others, the state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku, director general of the directorate of immigration and passport, Abdul Mabud, BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam were present.
