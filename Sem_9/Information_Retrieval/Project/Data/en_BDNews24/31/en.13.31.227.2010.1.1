 Patuakhali, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Patuakhali district administration imposed a Section 144 in the town banning meetings and processions as two Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal factions called meetings at same venue on Friday. Both of the factions called meeting at 10 am at the PDS field of the town to mark its founding anniversary. Patuakhaly deputy commissioner Md Riaz Ahmed told the reporters that the section 144 was imposed at the PDS field and its adjoining areas from 7 am to 10 pm to avoid any unwarranted situation. He said the police was also ordered to take necessary actions if rival groups of Chhatra Dal arrange programmes at same place. Gazi Ashfakur Rahman Biplob, general secretary of Patuakhali district Chhatra Dal, claimed it was his group that had called the meeting first. "But he told bdnews24.com, "Another group, loyal to the former minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, later called meeting at the same place." This faction of Chhatra Dal observed the founding anniversary cutting cake at the old court building field due to the imposition of section 144. On the other hand, Patuakhali municipal BNP's general secretary Md Zakir Hossain claimed the faction loyal to Biplob announced meeting at the same place to foil the anniversary programme under the leadership of Altaf Chowdhury. Early on Monday in Barishal, a clash over the anniversary programme left five Chhatra Dal activists injured. bdnews24.co
