<TITLE> Consistency key for India: Sehwag </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India must maintain their momentum and play at a high level on a consistent basis to keep their place among the world's top-ranked teams, said vice captain Virender Sehwag. India climbed to the top of the test rankings for the first time in December but the team has struggled to establish supremacy in one-day international cricket. They start the new year with a triangular one-day series involving Sri Lanka and Bangladesh from Monday, followed by two tests against Bangladesh. "I think our target is just to play good amount of cricket. You know, last two years we were playing very tough and good cricket. So hopefully we will do it in 2010 also," Sehwag told reporters on Saturday after the team arrived at Dhaka airport. "It's important for the team to play well consistently. If you do that you will stay there in number one or number two positions." India are ranked second in the one-day format behind Australia but can close the gap with a good performance in the tri-series, which they start as favourites. While Sri Lanka have made sweeping changes for the series, dropping key players due to injury and poor form, Sehwag said it did not make India's task any easier. "When the new players come nobody knows what he will do or what he does. It's difficult for the teams to bowl or bat against them," said Sehwag. "I think Sri Lanka still are a good side. It will be a tough task for us." India defeated a full-strength Sri Lanka 3-1 in a recent home series dominated by batsmen. Sehwag, one of India's key performers, said he expected more of the same in Bangladesh. "I think whenever you play in the subcontinent you will get the same kind of wicket," he added. "It's a good track to bat on and later on the wicket gets slower and slower and if dews are here then its a big factor."
