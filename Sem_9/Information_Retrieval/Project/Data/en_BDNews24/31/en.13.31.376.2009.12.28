<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  A BDR sepoy, 29-year-old Md Rokonuzzaman attached to Rifles Battalion-16, died suddenly on Sunday morning at BDR's Peelkhana headquarters. Kamrul Islam, officer in charge of New Market Police Station, told bdnews24.com a case unnatural death had been recorded. BDR authorities, in a statement, said Rokonuzzaman "collapsed suddenly" while reading the Quran after Fazr prayers at around 7am. He was rushed to the BDR Hospital in Peelkhana where the duty doctor declared him dead. The death was recorded (Surathal) at the hospital in presence of executive magistrate Abul Bashar Md Fakhruzzaman at 2:15pm, said the BDR statement. The janaza was held at 7pm at the BDR headquarters. Mohiuddin Ahmed, sub inspector of the station, said: "We were informed that a border guard had died while undergoing treatment in the BDR hospital. We sent it the body Dhaka Medical College Hospital for autopsy." Mohsin Reza, BDR information officer told bdnews24.com: "We suspect the death was due to a heart attack." He also said 66 border guards had died since the mutiny in February. Over 70 people, including 57 army officers, were killed during the Feb 25-26 mutiny at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka, which also spread to other BDR posts in the country. Tens of thousands of BDR members were held at Peelkhana and barracks across the country for questioning after the uprising. Since then some 3,500 border guards have been accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny and uprising around the country. Meanwhile, rights groups, both local and international, along with concerned citizens and relatives of BDR members, questioned the deaths of a number of border guards since the mutiny and urged investigation into "suspicious circumstances". A home ministry committee has since been formed specifically to investigate any suspicious 'deaths in custody' of BDR personnel. BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam in an interview with the BBC in April this year, said: "Post mortems of those died have been conducted by a civilian hospital and if there is any evidence of wrongdoing I am fully confident that police and other investigating authorities will be fully able fairly to investigate the matter." A senior army officer, deputed to the force, said in June this year that around 10 deaths a month occur among the 70,000-strong BDR as a matter of course. bdn
