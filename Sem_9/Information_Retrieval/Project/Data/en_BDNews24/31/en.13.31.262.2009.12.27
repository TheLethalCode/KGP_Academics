 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Sunday her government will talk with India over sharing the waters of 54 common rivers, including the all-important Teesta. Hasina said the technical committee had already met on the issue, and the Joint River Commission will sit soon. The prime minister will fly to New Delhi on Jan 10 for a much-anticipated summit with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh. The prime minister made the remarks at the inaugural ceremony of the 18th National Council and the 34th Council Meet of the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh (IDEB). Foreign minister Dipu Moni told reporters last week that Hasina would discuss the critical issue of water-sharing of the Teesta alongside other bilateral issues during her upcoming visit to India. "We are in negotiations on Teesta water sharing. The Indian water resources secretary is coming to Bangladesh on Jan 3 to expedite the negotiations," Moni had told a press briefing at the foreign ministry. The prime minister will fly to New Delhi on Jan 10 for the much-anticipated summit with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh. Dipu Moni has been pressing hard this year to advance toward a deal with India on Teesta waters. Indo-Bangladesh negotiations on the Teesta have been on and off for about a decade. Water resources ministry officials say Bangladesh approached India in 1999 to sign a treaty to share Teesta waters following the Ganges water-sharing treaty in 1996 during AL's previous term in power. Teesta is important to Bangladesh as its largest irrigation project is dependent on the common river. Bangladesh Water Development Board sources say over 750,000 hectares of land is irrigated by the Teesta. Govt to safeguard environment Hasina on Sunday also said her government will do everything possible to protect the environment and issued a stern warning against the plundered who encroached rivers and felled trees, endangering the ecological balance. She said some 700 small and big rivers of the country are sources of life and livelihood of the people, which also help drive agriculture and maintain environmental balance. But the rivers have lost the normal flow and navigability due to pollution, encroachment and unplanned management, she noted. The prime minister called the theme of the council "Lively Rivers, Lively Economy" as well-timed. She also mentioned the recent initiatives to clean the Buriganga bed, and dredging activities on Turag, Balu and Shitalakhya rivers around the capital. No developer will be allowed to pursue projects without having water bodies, solar panels and trees inside the boundary from now, she added. Hasina also said a plan to set up four satellite towns around the city is being developed to reduce the huge pressure on capital Dhaka. The prime minister in her speech urged the diploma engineers to properly carry their responsibilities. "Successful implementation of the government's development programmes depends on you as you carry those activities in the grassroots level," she said. bdn
