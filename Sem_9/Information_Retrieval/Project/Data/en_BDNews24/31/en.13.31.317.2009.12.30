Commerce minister Col (Rtd) Faruk Khan told a meeting of parliamentary standing committee that the prices of essentials in Bangladesh largely depended on the price-level in India, said standing committee members. "The minister has presented a report on price levels in India and other South Asian countries. The report shows that prices of commodities are lowest in Bangladesh," Sk Afil Uddin, a member of parliamentary standing committee on commerce ministry, told bdnews24.com Wednesday after the meeting. Rumana Mahmud, the lone member of the main opposition BNP, also echoed the similar view as expressed by Afil Uddin. "As per the report sent by the Bangladesh mission in Delhi, price level here is lowest in the area," Rumana told bdnews24.com. She said the committee discussed the performance of the commerce ministry in reducing abnormal price hike of essential commodities. "The committee has suggested the minister and the ministry to enhance its market monitoring mechanism to check sharp rise in prices," said the BNP MP. "We are trying to check price spiral," Afil Uddin quoted the minister as saying. He said the ministry officials informed the meeting that Bangladesh was very much dependent on the import from India. "Therefore, price hikes in India will certainly raise prices in Bangladesh," said Afil Uddin, an Awami League MP.
