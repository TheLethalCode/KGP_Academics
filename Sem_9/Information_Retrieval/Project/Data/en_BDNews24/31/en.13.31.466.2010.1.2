 (Corrects dead man's name) Lalmonirhat, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  One Bangladeshi was shot dead by India's Border Security Force (BSF) on Burimari border early Saturday. BSF took away the body of a 25-year old man into its territory, said Subeder Habibur Rahman, commander of BDR Burimari post. A letter has been sent to the BSF asking it to return the body, he said. Locals named the dead man as 'Shahjahan', a resident of Kashirdanga village under Patgram upazila, and a cattle trader. Killings by Indian border guards continue at the rate of at least one a month even after they pledged 'no more killings' on border areas during a joint meeting in Dhaka last year. bdnews2
