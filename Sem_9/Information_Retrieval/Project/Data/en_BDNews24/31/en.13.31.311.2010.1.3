 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said that her government will not compromise over conservation of the environment, warning real estate developers in particular against unplanned construction in the capital. Speaking at the inauguration of International Conference on Bangladesh Environment 2010 on Sunday, Hasina warned that the government would not approve any more housing projects in the capital that violated the relevant environmental laws. "We must protect the land, water bodies and rivers from the land-grabbers. The government will not accept such violations any more." She said not a single [housing] plan would be approved if it did not include a water body, despite threats to one of her cabinet members. "The minister is in a tight spot for that decision. Some people are even threatening him. But some things cannot be bought by money." She said the government would remain steadfast in its resolve and not a single housing project would be approved without the requirements. Addressing the conference, jointly organised by Bangladesh Paribesh Andolan (BAPA) and Paribesh Network at Osmani Auditorium, Hasina said the government would set up four satellite towns on the outskirts of the capital and ensure better mass transit facilities for commuters. She also said her administration would soon begin capital dredging of Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakhya rivers, which surround Dhaka, to revive their navigability and demolish illegal structures along those rivers. She said the government has already ordered the authorities to take necessary actions to save arable land and increase agricultural production. "Considering the potentially adverse impacts of climate change, the government has created a Climate Change Trust Fund, and has already allocated it Tk 700 crore." The prime minister also announced creation of a 'Multi-Donor Trust Fund' to be financed by the development agencies of different countries. She urged the environmental organisations to come up with new ideas and work together with the government to protect Bangladesh from the disastrous impacts of climate change. BAPA chairman professor Muzaffer Ahmad presided over the conference. Economists MM Akash, Anu Mohammad, Dhaka University vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique, University Grants Commission chairman Nazrul Islam, among others, were present. bdnews24.
