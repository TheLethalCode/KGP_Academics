<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government expects the upcoming Dhaka International Trade Fair to buck a two-year trend of declining export orders. Commerce minister Faruk Khan said Monday: "Export orders will rise this time." Export orders from the fair in 2006 amounted to Tk 24.68 crore. But they shrunk to Tk 22.6 crore in 2008 and Tk 19.91 crore in 2009. Ten countries, including US, China, India, Pakistan and Malaysia, are expected to display products at the fair. The Export Promotion Bureau is also forecasting Tk 13.82 crore in earnings from tickets, against production costs of Tk 8.56 crore. The difference will be calculated as net profit. TICKET PRICE RAISED The commerce ministry has decided to increase entry fee for the month-long 15th Dhaka International Trade Fair, scheduled to kick off on January 1, said the minister. Tickets will cost Tk 15 for adults and Tk 10 for children, up from Tk 12 and Tk 7 respectively. The minister said prices of tickets were raised for a number of reasons, to provide better public facilities as well as to restrict people's entry to the fair to a degree. "No such fair on earth has a lower entry fee than ours. But if the tickets are made too cheap, too many people will come to the fair, which creates certain problems." PERMANENT SITE 'IN 2011' Faruk Khan said that from 2011, the trade fair will have a permanent site, where the runway of the old airport in capital's Tejgaon is now located. "A world-class site for holding fairs will be built there." He said the cost was estimated at Tk 265 crore, of which China had offered to provide Tk 220 crore. bdn
