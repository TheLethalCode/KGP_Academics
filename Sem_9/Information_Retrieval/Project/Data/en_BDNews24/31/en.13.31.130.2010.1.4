 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)Secretarial-level talks of the Joint Rivers Commission began in Dhaka on Monday to discuss water-related issues including a possible Teesta water-sharing deal between Bangladesh and India. Indian water resources secretary UN Panjiar arrived in the city on Sunday evening with six delegates for the three-day talks at the state guest house Meghna. Shaikh Mohammed Wahid-uz-Zaman, water resources secretary, is leading the Bangladesh side at the talks that will focus on four issues including a possible agreement on sharing Teesta waters during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to Delhi. "The Indian authorities have agreed to discuss Teesta's water sharing at the secretary-level talks," a senior foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com on Sunday. According to the agenda prepared by the JRC, the two sides will address dredging of the common river Ichhamati, irrigating and supplying potable water to Indian people from Feni river, river bank protection of the common rivers and preparing drafts on sharing the Teesta water. Bangladesh has over 300 rivers of which 54 are transboundary entering from India. Dhaka has been urging New Delhi for decades for a deal on the common river Teesta, however, on which Bangladesh has the largest irrigation project covering 750,000 hectares of land in the greater Rangpur region. Bangladesh cannot go for the second phase of the project due to water crunch in the river during dry seasons. India in 1990s constructed a barrage in Gazoldoba in the upstream for irrigation which dries up the Teesta in the downstream. The foreign ministry official said Bangladesh would be 'liberal' on the issue of dredging of the Ichhamati as the Indian government had shown interest in the Teesta deal. India has been hammering on the issue for years even though Bangladesh sees no benefits in the project. A 20-kilometre stretch of high land on the bed of Ichhamati river (in Satkhira district) creates floods in India. The dredging will clear off the channel of the common river and make Indian territories free from floods. New areas of cooperation Newly appointed Indian high commissioner Rajeet Mitter on Sunday said that the prime minister's upcoming visit in India would usher in new areas of cooperation. "The Indian water resources secretary is coming to discuss the water-related issues. The secretaries will discuss the issue (signing of the Teesta deal)," he told reporters after meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni at the foreign ministry. It was Mitter's first meeting with Moni after he presented his credentials to president Zillur Rahman on Thursday.
