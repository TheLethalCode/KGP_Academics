 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)The government has revised the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, raising the total budget by one fifth to nearly Tk 3500 billion and bringing it in line with Awami League's election pledges, the planning minister said on Tuesday. The three-year development plan, in effect from FY 2008-09, will run until June 2011. The strategy paper was approved at a meeting of the National Economic Council, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on Tuesday. Planning minister AK Khandaker briefed journalists after the meeting. He said the PRSP-II, approved by the past caretaker government, has been amended in line with development objectives laid out in the Awami League government's electoral manifesto. The objectives of the amended strategy paper include accelerating poverty alleviation, focusing on the macro-economic for pro-poor development and extending social security coverage. The past caretaker government endorsed the PRSP-2 on Oct 23 2008. The newly amended strategy paper projected growth of GDP at 6 percent for the current fiscal year and 6.7 percent for FY 2010-2011. Growth was recorded at 5.9 percent during 2008-2009. Total expenditure for implementing PRSP-2 covering the period from July 2008 to June 2011 was estimated at Tk 2814.81 billion. But it has now been revised up to Tk 3457.40 billion. Tk 2582 billion will be available from local resources, says the PRSP-II. Total deficit has been estimated at $12.50 billion, or $4.17 billion a year, to be partially met with foreign funds. On an average, foreign aid worth $2 billion flows into the country every year. The remaining deficit of $2.17 billion, or Tk 152 billion, could be addressed through greater revenue earnings, the strategy paper stated. The planning minister said the government will return to a five-year plan from July 2010. The closing year of PRSP-2 will run simultaneously with the start of the country's sixth five year plan in 2010-11. The task for formulating the five-year plan is progressing, he said. bd
