 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Palestinians may review their West Bank security ties with Israel if it continues unilateral operations such as a December 26 raid which killed three militants, President Mahmoud Abbas said on Friday. After losing control of the Gaza Strip to rival Hamas Islamists in 2007, the US-backed Abbas reordered his West Bank forces in coordination with Israel, whose settlements and other occupied zones make the territory complex to administer.
