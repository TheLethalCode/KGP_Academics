 Mohosinul Karim bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The first year of the grand alliance government saw about 1,000 officers shuffled and one fired against about 2,000 transfers and about a dozen removed from service during the same period of the previous four-party alliance regime. Despite some sweeping changes and attempts at administrative reforms, HT Imam, the prime minister's establishment and administration adviser, expressed mixed feelings on the overall situation of the administration. He said a 'few' developments took place, but those were not 'satisfactory'. Imam also said most of the reforms are on paper only, though there are some improvements made towards the main goal. The present government could not execute some administrative reforms including renaming the ministry of establishment, he said. Rather, the 'citizens charter', initiated during the interim government, has now become inactive. Concerning a large number of contractual appointments, H T Imam said, "Abrupt promotions to some important posts like cabinet secretary, the prime minister's chief secretary are not possible. So, officers were appointed on contract-basis to these posts." Some 74 officials were appointed on a contract-basis, while 960 officials were reshuffled in the first year of the incumbent Awami League led grand alliance government. About 200 officials of the ministry of establishment were made OSD (officer on special duty) including 11 secretary-level officers in 2009. At the same time, at least 700 officers of different levels of senior assistant secretary to secretary levels were promoted to different posts. About 300 assistant secretaries got administrative seniority. Officials, blacklisted and dismissed during the regime of four-party alliance, have been given special facilities like receiving 'promotion on back date' by the present government. About a dozen bureaucrats were fired in the first year of the four-party alliance government. But the grand party alliance did not follow the trend. Only one officer  information secretary ATM Fazlul Karim  was discharged for publishing a book mocking Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. On making 11 secretaries OSD, Imam told bdnews24.com: "Many of them had bad reputations. So, they were made OSD. However, some of them are going to be posted immediately. It is not true that OSD always refers to a punishment. Sometime OSDs are made for good cause too." Replying to a query on exempting bad officials, Imam said, "We should have taken punitive actions against them. But that would have been a bad example. We do not want to work like BNP who fired 46 officials overnight and made hundreds OSD." According to the ministry, posts of 960 officers of different levels were reshuffled this year. Of which, 287 were given deputy secretary posts and another 233 to senior assistant and assistant secretary posts. The four-party alliance, in its first year, reshuffled 1,779 officials to different posts and appointed 169 officers on contract-basis. Another 170 joint-secretary level officers were promoted. The grand alliance government, accusing the four-party alliance of playing a massive partisan role, transferred 10 secretaries in the very first week of its tenure. The present government formed a review committee to investigate the grounds on which officials were sacked or deprived of promotion. The committee, led by the prime minister's education adviser Alauddin Ahmed, has named 523 officers in 642-page recommendations as victims under the four-party government. A number of officials among those recommended have already appointed on contract-basis in some important posts, while some others have received promotions on back dates as they are soon going to retire. Promotions of about 500 other officials whose promotions are due and have not made yet are under consideration of the review committee and the ministry of establishment, ministry officials said. bdnews
