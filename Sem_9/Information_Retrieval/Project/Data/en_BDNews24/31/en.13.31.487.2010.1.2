 Joypurhat, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Train communication remained halted on Saturday between Khulna and Dinajpur as a Parbatipur-bound oil train derailed at a rail crossing in Joypurhat town. Joypurhat stationmaster Abdul Jabbar said the train, carrying 1,350 metric tonnes of oil in 30 tankers, went off the tracks at 2.20pm. He suspected that old and weak railway sleepers might have caused the accident. Two rescue trains reached the spot at around 5.15 pm, the stationmaster said. bdne
