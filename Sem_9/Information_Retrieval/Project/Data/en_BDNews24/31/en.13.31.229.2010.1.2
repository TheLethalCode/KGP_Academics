 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  When Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is conferred with the prestigious Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development in New Delhi during her visit to India this month, it will be in recognition of her "outstanding contribution to promotion of democracy and pluralism, her determined drive to alleviate poverty and secure social and economic justice for her people through inclusive and sustainable development, and her consistent commitment to peace." The citation that Indian President Pratibha Patil will present to Hasina will perhaps also mention the efforts she had made during her first tenure (1996-2001) as prime minister to end the insurgency in Chittagong Hill Tracts by striking a deal with the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS) in 1997. But what will remain unspoken is India's gratitude for Dhaka's tacit cooperation with New Delhi over the past year that resulted in the arrests of as many as seven fugitives of Indian law  ULFA 'Chairman' Arabinda Rajkhowa, 'Deputy Military Chief' Raju Barua, 'Finance Secretary' Chitraban Hazarika and 'Foreign Secretary' Sashadhar Choudhury, Rajkhowa's bodyguard Raja Bora and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) operatives Thadiyantavide Nazir and Shafaz Shamsuddin  the latter two suspected to be involved in the 2005 terrorist attacks in the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Neither Dhaka nor New Delhi officially admitted any role of Bangladeshi agencies in creating the situations that led to the arrests of the seven. As New Delhi's official versions go, all of them were arrested after India's Border Security Force (BSF) personnel spotted them near the Indo-Bangla border. Hazarika and Choudhury were said to have been caught near the border in northeastern Indian state of Assam on November 4. Nazir and Shafaz were detained by the BSF personnel near the border at Dawki in Meghalaya  another State in India's North-East  on December 2, followed by the arrest of Rajkhowa, Barua and Bora along with their families from the same place two days later. The similarities in the circumstances in which the seven were caught make it clear that the arrests were results of a tacit understanding between India and Bangladesh. There are reasons for which India and Bangladesh could not claim success over this new phase of cooperation. Since the two countries are yet to have an extradition treaty, it would have been difficult for Dhaka to hand over the five ULFA and two LeT terrorists to Delhi, had they been formally arrested in Bangladesh. The ULFA general secretary Anup Chetia was arrested in Dhaka on December 21, 1997, under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act for illegally entering into Bangladesh and for carrying foreign currencies and satellite phone. He could not be handed over to India due to absence of any extradition treaty. Bangladeshi agencies' tacit help in arresting the seven is perceived in New Delhi as a goodwill gesture by Dhaka ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India, which was originally scheduled in the third week of this month, but has been deferred to January 10 next year. Without referring to the recent arrests of the ULFA and LeT terrorists, Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao told a news conference that cooperation between Dhaka and Delhi on security and counter-terrorism measures had "achieved positive results". If cooperation in security and counter-terrorism measures has emerged as a cornerstone of India-Bangladesh bilateral relationship in 2009; its early signs were evident in the remarks of the then External Affairs Minister of India Pranab Mukherjee in a joint press-conference with his Bangladeshi counterpart Dipu Moni in Dhaka on February 9 itself. Identifying the growing menace of extremism and terrorism in South Asia as an "area of concern" for India and Bangladesh, Mukherjee noted: "Closer cooperation on security issues is the need of the hour. We should move to address such issues with the understanding that both our countries will benefit in the long run." Mukherjee's visit to Dhaka in February was the first high-level contact between India and Bangladesh after the Awami League Government came to power after the December 2008 parliamentary elections. And it happened just a few weeks after 10 LeT terrorists from Pakistan sailed into India's financial capital Mumbai and killed 174 people in a three-day-long carnage. It was the time when New Delhi was engaged in a diplomatic war against Islamabad and mobilising global opinion to put pressure on Pakistani Government to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in that country. In order to isolate Pakistan in South Asia, India was also trying to rope in Bangladesh and other countries in the region in its fight against terrorism and its state and non-state sponsors. On her part, Dipu Moni assured Mukherjee that the Awami League government in Dhaka would pursue a policy of zero-tolerance towards terror  both in Bangladesh and emanating from the country. After the parliamentary elections in India in April-May, the Foreign Minister reiterated the same, when she visited New Delhi in September and reassured her new Indian counterpart S M Krishna that Dhaka would not let anti-India elements to operate from Bangladesh. It was after her landmark visit that intelligence agencies of both the countries chalked out the detailed strategy to turn the heat on the ULFA militants, who  as alleged by New Delhi  had set up bases in Bangladesh to carry on guerrilla operations in northeastern Indian state of Assam. Towards the end of 2009, the 10th India-Bangladesh Home Secretary level talks on December 2 was yet another landmark event that drew the outline of future bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and his Indian counterpart G K Pillai finalised the drafts of Agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, Transfer of Sentenced Persons and Combating International Terrorism, Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking. The three agreements are likely to be signed during the Prime Minister Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January. The Home Secretaries agreed to develop mechanisms to further hasten the process of verification of nationality status of prisoners lodged in the jails of the two countries; particularly of those who had already completed their sentences so that they could be repatriated early. They agreed to redouble efforts to locate criminals under Interpol Red Corner Notices in either country and to take immediate action on the basis of real time and actionable information. They also decided to enhance cooperation in capacity building in Police and other law enforcement agencies. The year 2009 witnessed India and Bangladesh stepping up bilateral cooperation in combating the menace of extremism and terrorism. And 2010 undoubtedly holds more promises as it begins with Hasina's much-waited visit to New Delhi, which India  to put it in Indian Foreign Secretary Rao's words  is "eagerly looking forward to".
