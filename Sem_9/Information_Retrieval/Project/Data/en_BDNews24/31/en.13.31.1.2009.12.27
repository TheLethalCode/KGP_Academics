 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  An annular solar eclipse will be visible from Saint Martin's Island and Cox's Bazar on Jan 15, the last eclipse to be visible from Bangladesh until 2014. Starting at 12:44:30 BDST, the eclipse will last eight minutes and 29.6 seconds. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line, but the distances are such that the apparent size of the Moon is smaller and does not blanket the whole of the Sun as viewed from Earth. The Sun appears as a thin bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the silhouette of the Moon. The eclipse starts on Jan 15 at Uganda, passes through Nairobi, enters the Indian Ocean where the longest eclipse will be seen mid-ocean. After that it enters Maldives, where the second longest eclipse occurs with 10.8 minutes of viewing. It will then enter and exit India at Rameswaram, the only place under the eclipse on the Indian mainland. After Rameswaram, it will enter Sri Lanka at Delft Island, exits at Jaffna in Sri Lanka, cross Bay of Bengal and end on the Myanmar - China border. On July 22 this year, a rare full solar eclipse was seen in Bangladesh's sky. The next eclipse in Bangladesh, after Jan 15, will be 2014. The next annular solar eclipse will be visible in Bangladesh on February 17, 2064. Shahjahan Mridha Renu, president of Onusanditshu Chakra Bigyan Sangathan, in a briefing on Sunday said they had set up over 50 camps for people across the country to watch the eclipse on Jan 15. The main observation camp will be set up in Cox's Bazar sea beach while there will be one for the scientists at Chhenra Dwip in Saint Martin's Island, Renu said. bdnews
