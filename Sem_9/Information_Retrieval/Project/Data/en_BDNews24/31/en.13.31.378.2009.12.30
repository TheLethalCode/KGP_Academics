 Chittagong, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  At least four workers were injured after a dismantled iron sheet fell on them at a Sitakunda ship breaking yard on Wednesday, just days after four workers were killed in a blast at a nearby yard, heightening safety concerns about the industry. Sitakunda police chief Monirul Islam said the accident took place at around 2 pm on the premises of Unique Traders, a ship breaking yard owned by SM Al Mamun, son of a local MP Abul Kashem Master. Witnesses said the ship yard authorities had been barring police and others from entering the site after the accident. Three of the injured workers were named as Ledu Mia, 35, 'Nayan', 25, and Ameer Solaiman, 30, all undergoing treatment at Al Amin Hospital and Medical Centre. Last Saturday, an explosion aboard an out of commission oil tanker killed at least four ship breakers and injured 10 others Rahim Steel and Ship Breaking Yard at Madam Bibirhat. Ship breaking is flagged as a 'Category Red', or 'extremely hazardous', industry in Bangladesh. It produces thousands of tonnes of scrap metal used by re-rolling mills, but is not officially recognised as an 'industry' and serious concerns prevail over work safety as well as environmental standards. There are around 87 yards along the 12 kilometres of coastal area from Fouzdarhat to Kumira in Sitakunda, where about 30,000 people are employed in hazardous working conditionsmaking it one of the largest ship-breaking centres in the world. Workers dismantle ships by hand without proper machinery, protective wear or training. The yard owners also compel the breakers to take apart ships without clearing the vessels of toxic materials. According to some estimates, at least 400 ship breakers have died over the past 20 years in Sitakunda yards. In most cases, the families of the deceased and injured get no compensation Successive administrations have spoken of formulating a policy to better regulate the unofficial industry, as has the incumbent government. Hassan Mahmud, state minister for environment, this week said the government would set up a specific zone for ship-breaking yards at Sitakunda and introduce greater regulation for better environmental and safety standards. bdnew
