 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)--Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has asked the government to clear the air over alleged kickback over foreign investment in the energy sector. She said, "Some serious allegations have recently been raised about foreign investment in a plant in the energy sector. The nation hopes that the relevant quarter will come out in public with a proper answer." The BNP chairperson made the remarks on Tuesday in her speech at the closing ceremony of the 18th National Convention and the 34th Council Meeting of the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh (IDEB) at Kakrail in the capital. The former prime minister, however, did not name those in involved in the reported scam. The pro-BNP newspaper Daily Amar Desh recently published a report, alleging that the prime minister's son Sajib Wajed Joy and energy adviser Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury took a bribe from US company Chevron. The daily reported on Dec 16 that Joy and Chowdhury had allegedly accepted a Tk 35 crore kickback from Chevron for landing it a Tk 370 crore deal without tender. The newspaper's editor Mahmudur Rahman was energy adviser to Khaleda in her second 2001-06 stint as prime minister. Senior members of the cabinet have dismissed the allegations out of hand, saying it was designed to divert the attention from the corruption of Khaleda's elder son Tarique Rahman. Khaleda called for measures to save the Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu rivers surrounding Dhaka to save the capital. She also expressed concern about India's unilateral withdrawal of water in the upstream by damming rivers, which she said, was wreaking havoc on the environment in Bangladesh and planned construction of Tipaimukh dam. She asked all to stand up to it. "We are being deprived of the due share of the Ganges waters because of the Farakka dam. India is also trying to build another dam at Tipaimukh; we all know about its possible devastating effects. "We must speak out to save the river-centric civilisation and economy," Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday inaugurated the four-day convention and spoke of the government's tough stance to stop pollution and encroachment of rivers. Citing the development programmes in the power sector during the BNP-Jamaat led alliance government, Khaleda said, "We gave special attention and took effective measures to augment production of power since the growth in power is the scale to the social and economical progress. "The engineers should be more aware to protect misuse of power and reducing systems loss," she added. Khaleda mentioned the country is at stake and urged all to be united for the betterment of the present and to wipe out the uncertain future. bdnews
