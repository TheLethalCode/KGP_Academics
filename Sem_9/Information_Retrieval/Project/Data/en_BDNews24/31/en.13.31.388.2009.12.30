 DURBAN, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad ripped through South Africa's top order to put England on the brink of victory on the fourth day of the second Test on Tuesday. Swann and Broad took three wickets each to leave the hosts reeling at 76 for six in their second innings, trailing England by 156 runs with one day left. Ian Bell made a fine 141 to lead the touring side to a huge total of 575 for nine declared and off-spinner Swann dismissed Ashwell Prince and Hashim Amla before tea. Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy and Graeme Smith then fell in rapid succession after the interval and only a gritty stand between Mark Boucher and Morne Morkel enabled South Africa to reach the early close without further loss. Smith and Prince survived the opening burst in relative comfort but Swann's second delivery deceived Prince (16) by going straight on, catching the inside edge of the bat and rebounding off the pad to short-leg where Bell took a low reflex catch. The off-spinner then bowled Amla for six as the batsman drove loosely and the ball turned sharply through the gate. Broad struck three times after tea when Kallis (3), De Villiers (2) and JP Duminy (0) all made misjudgments trying to leave the ball. Kallis shouldered arms and had his off stump knocked over by an in-swinger which also seamed off the pitch
