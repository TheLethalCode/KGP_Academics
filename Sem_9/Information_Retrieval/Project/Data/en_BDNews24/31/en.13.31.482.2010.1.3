 DHAKA, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's young team are good enough to be competitive in the one-day Tri-Series in Bangladesh this month, their coach Trevor Bayliss said on Sunday. Sri Lanka, who face hosts Bangladesh on Monday in the opening match of the tournament which also involves India, made sweeping changes following their defeat by India last month. Batsmen Sanath Jayasuriya and Chamara Kapugedera, fast bowler Lasith Malinga and spinner Ajantha Mendis were dropped and batsman Mahela Jayawardene, all-rounder Angelo Mathews and bowlers Muttiah Muralitharan and Dilhara Fernando are injured. "We had a number of injuries in India which forced us seeing some of the young players that have been close to the team for long years. We are very happy with the way they were performing in the last few games," Bayliss told a news conference. "It has brought some youthful enthusiasm to the team and we are looking forward to see how they develop over the coming month and years," he said. "They may be lacking a little bit of experience. But the more games they play the more they will be experienced. If we play good cricket we have a good chance of winning." he said. Sri Lanka will be without leading spinners Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis. "Obviously, we have come from India and the young Suraj Randiv is probably the best spinner we had on the tour," Bayliss said. "He bowled exceptionally well against India in his first two or three games. So we are very happy the way he is coming to international cricket. "Obviously Malinga Bandara, he has been around for a number of years playing second fiddle to Murali and Mendis. He gets another opportunity." "The spin bowling all-rounder (Muthumudalige) Pushpakumara made his debut in India," Bayliss added. "So we are quite happy with the depth we have in our bowling. They are very young and inexperienced but they are talented."
