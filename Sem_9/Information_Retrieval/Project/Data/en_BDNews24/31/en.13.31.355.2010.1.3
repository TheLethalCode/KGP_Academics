 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government cannot begin issuing Machine Readable Passports and Machine Readable Visas by the April deadline, an official said on Sunday. "It might take until May or later to even start the project after completion of the tender process," Brig Gen Refayetullah, director of MRP and MRV project, told reporters after a meeting at the home ministry. The directorate of immigration and passport has sent the tender proposals to the home ministry. But the tenders still need the approval of the cabinet purchase committee. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who chaired the meeting, told reporters: "The government is sincerely trying to implement the MRP and MRV projects but it's taking some time to complete the formalities." The home ministry will send on the tender proposal to finance ministry for approval and later to the cabinet purchase committee through the cabinet division. "It will take some time to start the project after getting all the approvals," Sahara said. In July 2005, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) declared machine readable passports in a specified format would be the worldwide standard. The organisation's 188 Contracting States, including Bangladesh, agreed that all must begin issuing ICAO standard MRPs no later than 1 April 2010. b
