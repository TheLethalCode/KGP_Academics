 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)--bdnews24.com picks some key moments that shaped the year that was 2009 The new government faces an exceptional crisis less than two months into office when bursts of staccato gunfire shatters peace on the morning of February 25 at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters in the heart of the capital. Border guards in an armed rebellion kill over 50 army officers. As the mutineers hold thousands of families hostage inside the compound for two heart-stopping days, the rebellion spreads to other BDR outposts around the country. Bashundhara City, Bangladesh's biggest shopping mall, catches fire on March 13. Seven lives are lost as fire fighters battle through the day to put out the flames on the top floors of the 20-storey tower. The raging inferno is watched by crowds of thousands at the city centre location. It raises fire safety concerns for Dhaka's burgeoning high-rise cityscape. On April 20, the government serves an eviction notice on opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Having already cancelled the lease of her Cantonment residence at 6 Moinul Road, it gives her 15 days to leave. The Awami League government claims that the leasing process had been faulty and that Khaleda had violated lease terms. Khaleda's party, the main opposition BNP, protests vehemently. The first case of H1N1 is confirmed in the country on June 18, seven days after the World Health Orgnaisation declares it the first global flu pandemic in 40 years. The first death in Bangladesh from the virus is reported two months later. A woman, Mita Chakrabarty, is the first confirmed victim of swine flu in the country. Daylight Saving Time (DST) is introduced for the first time in Bangladesh on June 19, with clocks advancing one hour from 11:00pm to midnight for 'an extra hour of daylight' to save power. Clocks go back an hour at 11:59pm on Dec 31, ending the first-ever spell of DST in Bangladesh. Bangladesh win their first-ever overseas Test series--admittedly against a weakened and inexperienced West Indies side after senior players boycotted the series over a pay dispute--between July 9 and 20. It is also the first time they have won two successive Tests. At the centre of the accomplishment was "Ice Man" Shakib Al Hasan, standing in for the injured captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. He picked up the Man-of-the-Series prize awards for both Tests and ODIs, which the Tigers won 3-0. Bangladesh falls in the shadow of the longest and last total solar eclipse of the century on July 22. The country, along with eclipse watchers around the world, holds its breath for the spectacular event. The country's largest IPO to date hits the country's twin bourses on Nov 16. Grameenphone's much-anticipated Tk 4.86 billion offering attracted subscriptions worth Tk 17.25 billion from over one million prospective investors. The floating caused the prime bourse's key index to surge 22 percent and cross a new high above the 4000 mark. In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Nov 19 upholds death sentences for five former army officers convicted for the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, ending a long, tortured appeals process that had kept the nation awaiting a final verdict for 34 long years. Passenger ferry MV Coco-4 partially capsizes in the Tentulia river in Bhola on Nov 27, the night before Eid-ul-Azha. The ferry overloaded from hull to decks, tips over as it attempted to dock at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. In one of the worst single disasters in recent memory, the death toll reaches 85 as bodies are pulled from the vessel and surrounding water for the three days following t
