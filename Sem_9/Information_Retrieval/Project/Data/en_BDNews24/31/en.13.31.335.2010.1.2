 Faridpur, January 2 (bdnews24.com)  At least four people were killed and twelve injured when a private bus collided with an oil tanker on the Dhaka-Khulna highway on Saturday. The accident came just a day after 17 bus passengers were killed in a crash on the same highway in Faridpur. Faridpur deputy commissioner Helaluddin Ahmed said Saturday's accident occurred at Digholia in Modhukhali Upazila at around 10:30am, as the bus belonging to Faridpur Sugar Mill hit a Padma Oil Company tanker head-on. The dead were identified as Helal Joardar, a book keeper of the sugar mill, bus driver Tota Mia and two Ansar members Shushil Kumar Bala and Nazrul Islam. Another Ansar, Abdur Rauf, was sent to Dhaka Medical College in a critical condition. Ahmed said 12 Ansars were guarding a large amount of cash on board the sugar mill vehicle. The bus was carrying Tk 3.5 lakh for sugarcane purchases, of which Tk 2.2 lakh was found immediately after the accident, the deputy commissioner told bdnews24.com. Madhukhali police chief Syed Mohsinul Haque said they later recovered the rest of the cash from three men of Digholia and Paikkandi in Modhukhali Upazila. He said the three would be charged with theft. Officials also said 70 rounds of bullets belonging to the Ansar members on the bus went missing after the accident. Madhukhali Upazila officer SM Mostafa Kamal said Helal Joardar, a freedom fighter, was laid to rest with due honours at his village Raipur in Madhukhali Upazila. The three other bodies were handed over to relatives. bdn
