 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun on Monday said she did not know anything about the presence of 'Indian forces' brought to provide extra security to the Indian High Commission premises in Dhaka. Responding to queries from the reporters the minister said, "I have heard this for the first time from you. My ministry is not aware about this." Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder told bdnews24.com that If India wanted to send any state troops to Dhaka for security purposes a bilateral discussion should have been held. But no such discussions were held between Dhaka and Delhi. The High Commission might have brought private security men from India, he said. "But I don't know." Responding to a query, Sikder said, the Indian high commission claimed a security threat about a month ago. "Since then, security has been tightened at each of the foreign missions." STRENGTHENING RAB Regarding recent developments on extra facilities for Rapid Action Batallion, Sahara said the government is thinking of buying two helicopters and setting up a forensic laboratory for the special force. Sahara said RAB also has problems as do other forces. "As we have come to know them, we will try to solve those as soon as possible," she said. About RAB's proposal on creation of more battalions, Sahara said: "I think it is a rational proposal. A small workforce cannot cover a huge area. Their proposal has been sent back only for further scrutiny, nothing else." The home ministry, after a meeting on Dec 27, returned the proposal to the elite crime busting force, asking it to resubmit it with more details. The home minister was talking to the reporters after visiting the RAB headquarters in the capital. bdn
