<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  An offer of one more front row seat in parliament will not be enough to bring the opposition to parliament in the forthcoming winter session, front-ranking BNP leader Barrister Moudud Ahmed said on Wednesday. He said, "Other pending issues, such as withdrawal of false and harassing cases filed against BNP leaders, including chairperson Khaleda Zia and senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman, will have to be settled." "We will join parliamentary sessions only when a congenial environment is created." Moudud's comments came after speaker Abdul Hamid urged the opposition to rejoin parliament earlier in the week. At a press briefing on Monday, Hamid said: "If they (BNP) place their demand in parliament for an additional seat on the front row, I will request the leader of the house and prime minister to consider this issue." Brushing off the speaker's offer, Moudud said: "We want to join parliament. But it is not so that our only demand is an additional front seat." "There are several cases filed against BNP leaders, including one regarding our leader's (Khaleda) cantonment house. We want proper solutions to these issues through discussion." Moudud, a member of BNP's standing committee, the party's highest forum, was talking to journalists at the graveyard of party founder and late president Ziaur Rahman in capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of Krishak Dal, a BNP affiliated organisation. Answering a query, the BNP leader said: "2010 will not be the same as 2009. Party leaders, activists and the people will prepare for tougher movements in the new year." bdnews
