<TEXT>
 Rangamati, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  The special court in Rangamati completed hearing of witnesses in the trial of nine border guard mutineers and adjourned the proceedings on Wednesday until February 14. Twelve witnesses gave testimony, from 9.30am to 1.30pm, before a panel of judges headed by BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam. The Special Court No 4 set up at the BDR Rangamati headquarters was due to take testimony of 18 witnesses, but it ended the process after hearing just 12 witnesses saying there would be no need for further hearing. On February 14, the accused mutineers will be produced before the court to present their defence. The court framed charges against the nine border guards of 12th Rifles Battalion on Dec 27, marking the first indictment since the BDR mutiny in February this year. The nine accused are havildars Shibbir Ahmed, Sohrab Hossain and Shamsul Haque, signalman Abdur Rahman and sepoys Md Abul Kalam Azad, Sakhawat Hossain, Russel Kabir, Zahir Uddin and Sarwar Kamal. The February 25-26 BDR mutiny left over 70 people dead at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. The rebellion quickly spread to other BDR outposts across the country. The first of the BDR mutiny trials began at Rangamati on November 24. Some 39 border guards have so far been arrested and accused in three separate mutiny cases in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. The government has formed six special courts in all, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny around the country. bdnews2
