 DUBAI, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Yemeni government said on Saturday it would not tolerate any "terrorist" activities on its territories after Somali insurgents said they were ready to send reinforcements to al-Qaeda in Yemen. Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi told Yemen's news agency he was surprised at the Somali group's statement. "Rather than threatening to export terrorism to other (countries), they ought to help achieve security and stability in their own war-torn country," Qirbi told Saba News.

On Saturday, a Yemeni official welcomed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's invitation to host a meeting in London on January 28 to discuss countering radicalisation in Yemen. The talks will be held in parallel with an international conference on Afghanistan the same day. "This is a step in the right direction to intensify international efforts to support Yemen's development," an official source told Saba News. "Eradicating poverty, extremism and unemployment in developing societies is the way to end radicalism and ensure a suitable environment for such phenomenon is not created." Brown said on Friday Yemen presented a regional and global threat as an incubator and potential safe haven for terrorism. Compounding the challenge from al Qaeda, Yemen faces a separatist rebellion in the south and an insurgency by rebels from the minority Shi'ite Zaidi sect in the nor
