 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)The government Wednesday made it clear that the diplomatic missions in Bangladesh lie beyond the country's legal framework. In a press statement, a foreign ministry spokesperson said the foreign missions could have their own arrangements to ensure internal security and manage embassies and other activities according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Foreign ministry issued the statement following publication of reports on deployment of India's own personnel to ensure security of its high commissioner in Dhaka. The main opposition BNP and its allies termed such deployment as a "threat to Bangladesh's sovereignty". Home minister Sahara Khatun has rejected the media reports on Indian security personnel's deployment. "As per section 22 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, the diplomatic missions, their residence and the premises are protected from any type of trespassing and are out of the host countries' legal framework," said the statement. "Besides, the foreign missions can introduce their own system to guarantee the internal security and regulate other activities," said the statement.
