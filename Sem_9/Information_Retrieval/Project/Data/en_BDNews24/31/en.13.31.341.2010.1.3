 CARACAS, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela reported on Saturday 60 tonnes of drugs were confiscated in 2009, an 11 percent bigger haul than the previous year, and said anti-narcotics efforts had improved since it ended cooperation with the United States. The South American nation is a major transit country for Colombian cocaine to Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States.

According to the drug office's latest statistical breakdown, between January 1 and December 24 of 2009, cocaine accounted for 27.5 tonnes or 45.9 percent of the drugs captured, while marijuana was 32.2 tonnes or 53.8 percent. In 2008, the cocaine haul was 33.6 tonnes or 61.5 percent of the total, and marijuana 20.7 tonnes or 37.9 percent. In November, a US official said the problem of drug smuggling through Venezuela had grown worse since Chavez ended cooperation with the United States. Most of the Colombian cocaine smuggled out of South America by air for the US market was moved through Venezuela, said David Johnson, the assistant secretary of state who heads the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affai
