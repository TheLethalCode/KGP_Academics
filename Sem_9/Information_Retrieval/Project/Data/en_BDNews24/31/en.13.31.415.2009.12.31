 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has launched the government's free textbook distribution, for primary school children, as well as secondary school students in a first, allaying fears that the schoolbooks would not reach students in time following the hugely destructive NCTB fire in October. She handed books to 11 students of primary, secondary, ibtedai, dakhil and vocational schools at her secretariat office on Wednesday. Some 27,662,529 children will receive their textbooks on Jan 2, the first school day of the next academic session, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said after the inaugural programme. Nearly 190 million books have been printed for free distribution across the country, the minister said. In addition, 10 percent books have been kept with NCTB as buffer stock. These will be distributed during any disaster or in emergency. Nahid told reporters at his ministry that the books have already been sent to districts and upazilas. He said they had reached nearly every school, except one or two situated in inaccessible or hilly areas. "Distribution will be completed for all schools to begin teaching from the first school day of the new year," he said. There may be exceptions in some places due to remoteness of access or other unavoidable reasons, but books will be made available to all within a deadline, he said. District and upazila level monitoring committees will manage flow of books if there are seen to be any scarcity in particular areas. ONLINE TOO Textbooks will also be uploaded onto NCTB's site for the first time, so students in need can download what they require. "Every moment is important for students and so the government is ensuring books to students on time to prevent them from wasting a single day of schooling," said Nahid. He said syllabuses have also been sent to schools. Authorities concerned have been asked to begin teaching activities on time. Nahid said books were being distributed for both primary and secondary school students for the first time free of cost, despite many adversities. He also said if it wasn't for the NCTB warehouse fire, it would have been possible to ensure distribution well in time for the new year. The National Curriculum and Textbook Board warehouse in Tejgaon in Dhaka caught fire on October 17, burning hundreds of tonnes of books and printing paper over three days. Nahid said book sellers also threatened to prevent the government from distributing books at secondary level for free, and added: "They do nearly Tk 46 crore business on school books every year." "They even threatened me. Even after that, it has been possible to distribute books for the assistance of media and printers." b
