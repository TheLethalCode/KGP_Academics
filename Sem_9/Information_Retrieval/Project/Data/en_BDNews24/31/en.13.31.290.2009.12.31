 CARACAS, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez scoffed on Wednesday at US magazine Newsweek's predictions that he would be toppled by a military coup and his Cuban mentor Fidel Castro would die in 2010. In a lengthy televised New Year's address, Chavez, who has taken Castro's position as Latin America's leading critic of US power, described Newsweek as "the empire's magazine." "They feed on hatred and the wishes of the imperialism that they represent -- big money, big newspapers, the TV stations of the global bourgeoisie," he said.

Chavez said he joked to his brother and Cuban President Raul Castro about it. "I told Raul, 'this guy's going to bury you, me and all of us'." Chavez was in a buoyant mood despite news this week that Venezuela's economy had shrunk an estimated 2.9 percent in 2009 -- its first contraction in five years. Critics say that is evidence of the failure of his decade-long experiment in "21st century socialism", but Chavez blames OPEC-mandated oil output cuts and the global crisis. Either way, Venezuela has hit the recessionary cycle after most other nations. Rallying supporters for a political battle in 2010, Chavez called for "patriotic passion" to resist an opposition attempt to quash his majority in the National Assembly legislature at an election scheduled for Septemb
