<TEXT>
 Rangamati, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Rangamati on Tuesday resumed trial of nine border guards charged with mutiny. The Special Court No 4 set up at the BDR Rangamati headquarter began hearing at around 9:30am with the border force's director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam heading the panel of judges. The court on Sunday framed charges against the nine border guards of 12th Rifles Battalion, marking the first indictment since the BDR mutiny in February this year. It also heard testimonies of two witnesses that day. The first of the BDR mutiny trials began at Rangamati on November 24. Some 39 border guards have so far been arrested and accused in three separate mutiny cases in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. Nine of them were produced before the special court on November 25. They were given until the next hearing (December 27) to pick up a BDR lawyer or a civil lawyer for their defence. The nine accused are havildars Shibbir Ahmed, Sohrab Hossain and Shamsul Haque, signalman Abdur Rahman and sepoys Md Abul Kalam Azad, Sakhawat Hossain, Russel Kabir, Zahir Uddin and Sarwar Kamal. SPECIAL COURTS The February 25-26 BDR mutiny left over 70 people dead at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. The rebellion quickly spread to other BDR outposts across the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny around the country. If convicted, they face a maximum seven years in jail under BDR laws. President Zillur Rahman had sent a reference to the Supreme Court on August 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on August 25 and ended on September 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act. bdn
