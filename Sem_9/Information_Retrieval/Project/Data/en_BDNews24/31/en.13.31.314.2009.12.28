 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)Muslims in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world were observing Ashura on Monday with processions marked by religious fervour and solemnity. The Shia community's main procession was brought out from Old Dhaka's Hossaini Dalan Imambara at around 11:30am carrying the symbolic mausoleum of the Prophet Mohammad's two grandsons Hussein and Hasan. Pilgrims, most dressed in black, blare traditional Ashura chants through loudspeakers. The procession will end at Dhanmondi Road 2 marching through Baxi Bazar, Harnath Ghosh Road, Azimpur and New Market areas. Other mourning processions paraded other parts of the city in the morning. The Islamic Foundation also organised a discussion on the significance of Ashura and its lessons at the Baitul Mokarram National Mosque later in the day. The High Court Shrine authorities have arranged programmes too to mark the day. Ashura is observed on the 10th day of the lunar month Muharram in the Islamic calendar. It marks the climax of the Remembrance of Muharram when Shia Muslims commemorate the slaying of the prophet Mohammad's grandson Imam Hussein ibn Ali in 680 AD in the Battle of Kerbala. On the first day of Muharram, the army of Caliph Yazid laid siege to Hussein and followers in the desert near Kerbala. Hussein was killed in battle 10 days later after he had refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid. Hussein was decapitated and his head was taken to Damascus, the seat of the Ummayad dynasty to which Yazid belonged. For the Shia, Hussein's death symbolises confronting tyranny in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also a reminder of the rift with Sunnis, who do not revere Hussein as Shia do, over the prophet Mohammad's succession. During the ceremony, the Shia beat their heads and chests and gash their heads with swords to show their grief and echo the suffering of Imam Hussein. It is observed in Iraq and in other countries with sizeable Shia communities, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Several million pilgrims converge on Kerbala in Iraq for the festival each year. The day also bears significance for some Sunni Muslims as Moses fasted on that day to express gratitude to God for liberating the Israelites from Egypt. According to Sunni Muslim tradition, the Prophet Mohammad fasted on this day and asked other people to fast. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia issued separate messages for the day. bdn
