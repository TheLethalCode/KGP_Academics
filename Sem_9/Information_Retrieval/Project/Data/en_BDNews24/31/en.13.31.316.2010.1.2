<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina has said the government will formulate a policy for the hazardous ship-breaking industry "immediately". The prime minister's statement, at the national convention of the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB) in Chittagong on Saturday, comes in the wake of deaths of four workers in an explosion at a ship-breaking yard last month and continued environmental concerns regarding the industry. "We (the government) are not against the ship breaking industries, but that should not be at the cost of environment." "Stern actions will be taken against those who are involved in tree felling in the coastal areas," Hasina warned. She urged all the people of the country to be conscious of the changing environment as Bangladesh is the most affected by climate change. Criticising the previous interim government for high inflation, Hasina said, "We have brought down the price of rice and fertiliser." She also blamed the previous tenure of BNP government for "pushing the country to 20 years back in their seven years of rule". IEB central secretary, engineer SM Nazrul Islam, presided over the inauguration of the convention, organised at the IEB's Chittagong headquarters. Industry minister Dilip Barua, employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, state minister for environment and forest Hassan Mahmud, state minister for public works and housing Abdul Mannan Khan were also present at the convention. Hassan Mahmud, following the fatal accident last month, had said the government would set up a specific zone for ship-breaking yards at Sitakunda in Chittagong and introduce regulations for better environmental and safety standards. He also said the government was framing a policy in coordination with labour, industries, environment and shipping ministries keeping in view the hazards of ship-breaking, worker safety and the interest of yard owners. Ship breaking in Bangladesh is tagged as hazardous on account of poor worker safety and threat to coastal environment including illegal logging to make way for the breaking yards as well as pollution from toxic wastes on scrap ships. bdnews2
