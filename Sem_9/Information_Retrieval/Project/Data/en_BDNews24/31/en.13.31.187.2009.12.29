<TEXT>
 Kishoreganj, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A citizens group enforced a half-day strike in Bajitpur Upazila in Kishoreganj district on Tuesday demanding the Upazila be made a district. The 6am-2pm strike suspended all traffics in the Upazila. Shops and businesses were also shut down. Processions were taken out in many areas of the Upazila in the morning in support of the strike. Strikes were observed several times earlier demanding to make Bajitpur a district instead of the government's move to create the proposed new district of Bhairab. Meanwhile, buses and trucks resumed operation in Kishoreganj after a transport strike was called off on Tuesday. A faction of transport workers opposing the election to Kishoreganj District Motorjan Sramik Union scheduled to be held on Jan 4 had called the strike on Sunday. Kanchan Miah, leader of the movement, told bdnews24.com that they had decided to call off the strike considering public suffering. The agitating transport workers have been demanding punishment of Kishoreganj District Motorjan Sramik Union president Sirajul Islam for alleged embezzlement of union funds. They have also been demanding re-scheduling of election to the union after compiling a correct voters' list. bdn
