 Prodip Kumar Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)--Law minister Shafique Ahmed says the New Year will see local collaborators of Pakistan army stand trial for the crimes they had committed during the nation's freedom struggle in 1971. "2010 will be the year of the trial of the 'war criminals'. The government is almost done with the preparations," he told bdnews24.com in an exclusive interview on Thursday. The nation's long wait will end in the New Year, he said and enlarged on the process. "I've already said the investigating agency and the prosecution panel will be appointed by February or March. It might take even less time if the logistics supports, including the tribunal building, are ensured," Ahmed said. Asked if the investigators will require training since the issue is complex and new to them, Ahmed said, "I think they will not need training. "The retired officials of the intelligence agencies including the Criminal Investigation Department are very skilled." Trainings can be arranged on demand, the minister added. He refuted allegations by some quarters that the government dragged its foot in kicking off the trial. "It is not a question of whether the trial will take place or not, it must be held. And it is not that the government is doing nothing. "Parliament passed the trial proposal unanimously, updated the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act and allotted Tk 10 crore to mobilise the prosecution," he pointed out. He termed the all-party demand, excepting Jamaat-e-Islami, to try the war criminals an expression of 'national unity', though a bit belated. The minister laughed off the suggestion of the Islamist party that planned war crimes trial is anti-Islamic. "They have always been creating confusion to deceive the people, which are now clear to all. They are trying to save themselves using religion as a shield. "The criminals would not be left untried. They will have to face the trial," Ahmed asserted. He said the trial will be based on the evidence and documents gathered by the investigating agency from different sources including the Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee and Sector Commanders' Forum. He defended his record in office. "I think I have been successful in my job. My major task was to pass the ordinances formulated during the caretaker government." Already some 66 ordinances have been approved, he said. During the last one year, the Criminal and Penal Code (Amendment) Law-2009 and the National Human Rights Commission Act-2009 have been passed to separate the judiciary from the executive division. The number of judges in the Supreme Court has been increased, he added. "But, the major achievement is that the trial of Bangabandhu murder case is complete." He, however, said he had limitations as a minister. "I think more tasks could be accomplished at a faster rate. I will keep it in mind in the new year." Ahmed, while sketching out his plans for the upcoming year, said: "I will try to digitise the prosecution system around the country. The court and case management system also need to function effectively. "The Law Commission has been asked to start the Alternative Dispute Resolution which will reduce the number of cases. The ADR will also be initiated for the criminal cases to some extent. "Legal assistance for the helpless and poor people will be extended by the government during the next year," the minister added. bd
