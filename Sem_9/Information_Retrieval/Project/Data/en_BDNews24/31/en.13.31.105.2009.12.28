 Khagrachharhi, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Unknown assailants killed a Janasanghati Samity leader at Dighinala upazila in Khagrachharhi early on Monday. Police suspected Pradip Kanti Chakma Jogesh, 43, was hacked to death at Baradam. Dighinala police chief Subhash Chandra Paul told bdnews24.com that intra-party conflicts might have led to the killing of the indigenous leader, whose head bore several wounds from sharp weapons. His body was later sent to Khagrachharhi Sadar Hospital for autopsy. Paul, however, said Jogesh had four criminal cases filed against him. But, he was out on bail. Earlier on Sunday, a man was killed over internal family disputes in Kaminipara area of Matiranga upazila. The deceased's name is Tarun Kumar Tripura, 30.
