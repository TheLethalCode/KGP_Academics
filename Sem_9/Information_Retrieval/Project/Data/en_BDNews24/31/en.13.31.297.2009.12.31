 DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 30 (Reuters) - England called up uncapped Hampshire batsman Michael Carberry on Wednesday as cover for Paul Collingwood before the third test against South Africa. Collingwood dislocated a finger during the second test in Durban, which England won by an innings and 98 runs to take a 1-0 series lead. Collingwood, who scored 91 in Durban, could be fit for the third test starting on Jan. 3 but England took advantage of the fact that left-hander Carberry, 29, was in South Africa as part of England's performance programme. "We're very hopeful Colly will be fine for Cape Town but it's difficult to tell until he holds a bat again and does some fielding," England captain Andrew Strauss told reporters after his side clinched victory in the second test on Wednesday
