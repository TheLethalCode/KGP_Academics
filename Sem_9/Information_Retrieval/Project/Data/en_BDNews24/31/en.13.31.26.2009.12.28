 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)Myanmar deputy foreign minister Maung Myint arrived in city on Monday to lead his country's delegation at foreign secretary-level talks, which are likely to feature the thorny issue of Rohingya refugees entering Bangladesh from the neighbouring state. The two-day talks between Bangladesh and Myanmar starts on Tuesday at foreign ministry. "Deputy foreign minister Maung Myint and two officials of Myanmar have already arrived," Saida Muna Tasneem, a foreign ministry director general (external publicity), told bdnews24.com Monday. She said foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes will lead Bangladesh side while Myint, who holds the status of foreign secretary, will head the five-member team of his side. Quayes recently told journalists that Bangladesh would press its neighbour to stop pushing Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh territory. Myanmar's Muslim people from the Northern Rakhain state have been crossing into Bangladesh in large number since 1991 to escape persecution by the rulers there. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees set up camps in Bangladesh to repatriate the Rohingya people. Some 28,000 out of 500,000 Rohingya refugees registered in 1992 have been living in the refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district. But many of those repatriated under the UNHCR returned into Bangladesh and now mingle with local people for fear of repression in their homeland. Local officials say almost all of the repatriated Rohingyas have intruded into Bangladesh again and have been creating social problems. According to international law, host country cannot force repatriation of refugees. The foreign secretary also said the discussion will also feature introduction of banking facilities between Bangladesh and Myanmar to increase business activities between the two counties.
