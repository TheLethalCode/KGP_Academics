<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said Sunday the Bangladesh government has not yet been officially informed by India of its intent to deploy special security forces at its high commission premises in Dhaka. The secretary told reporters at his office: "A high commission is a sovereign and independent territory. But a foreign mission can only augment its security with special forces if it is not restricted by the host country's laws." A number of newspapers have reported that a 50-member team of special security troops is being brought to increase protection of the Indian high commission following threats to the mission earlier this year. The main opposition BNP expressed concern over the news on Dec 26 terming it "unusual and unprecedented". They also demanded an explanation from the foreign ministry and the government on the matter. Meanwhile, the newly appointed Indian High Commissioner in Bangladesh Rajeet Mitter arrived in Bangladesh on Saturday, foreign ministry officials said. Quayes was speaking at his office, during an inaugural ceremony for the Dhaka Correspondents Association website.
