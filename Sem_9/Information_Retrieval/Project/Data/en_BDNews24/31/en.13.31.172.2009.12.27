 Dhaka,Dec27(bdbews24.com)---BNP is making a list of its leaders and activists 'persecuted by trumped-up charges' across the country during the one year of the Awami League-led government. "The Awami League has established a reign of terror across the country by oppressing and filing false lawsuit against opposition leaders and workers," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told a news conference at National Press Club on Sunday. Former state minister for education Ehsanul Haque Milon hosted the press conference to protest 'the occupation" of his residence at Kachua in Chandpur. The main opposition party is listing such incidents which will be divulged in public in due course, he said. He condemned 'occupation' of the former minister's residence by the 'hooligans of the ruling party'. Mosharraf alleged that local Jubo League leaders 'Jakir' and Chand Mia--supporters of local MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir--usurped Milon's house on Dec 22, but police took no steps. He portrayed the 'grim' picture of oppression on BNP leaders and activists in Chandpur and elsewhere in the country. Kidnapping, rape, plundering and occupation are common phenomena, he said. Coming to power with a pledge for change, the Grand Alliance government wanted to change days by persecuting opposition leaders and workers, he said. The press conference was attended among others by former state minister for land Ruhul Kuddus talukdar Dulu and Jatiyabadi Mohila Dal leader Nazmun Nahar Baby. b
