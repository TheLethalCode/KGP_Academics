 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to drop 458 more cases filed for 'political persecution'. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, the head of a scrutiny committee that recommended quashing of the cases, said this while talking to reporters on Thursday after the committee's 11th meeting. The committee has, so far, recommended for withdrawal of 1817 cases, of them 195 filed by the Anticorruption Commission and the rest done under the penal code. Some 1,056 cases -- 31 by the ACC and 1025 filed under the penal code -- were placed before Thursday's meeting. Islam said: "Twenty one cases of the Anticorruption Commission have been recommended for withdrawal. Three cases were rejected and seven cases set aside for a decision in the next meeting. "Under the penal code, recommendations were made for dropping 437 cases, 38 cases rejected and 550 cases placed for the next meeting." Cases, filed by the ACC, to be dropped include one case each against former minister Mosharraf Hossain, Jatiya Party secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawlader and former Proshika chairman Kazi Faruk Ahmed. Cases filed under the penal set for withdrawn are four cases against MP Abdur Rahman Badi, two against Jubo League leader Apu Ukil, and two cases each against former MP Hazi Selim and Mohiuddin Ahmed. The state minister said many harassment cases were filed during 2001-2007 against Awami League leaders and activists. The committee earlier recommended withdrawal of a case filed against BNP senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman and a case against senior BNP leader Moudud Ahmed. bdn
