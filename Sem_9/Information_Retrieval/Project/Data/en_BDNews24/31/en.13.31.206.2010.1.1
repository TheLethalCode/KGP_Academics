 Kushtia/Pabna, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Officials of the Joint River Commission on Friday inspected the flow of water of Padma river near the Harding's bridge point in line with the Ganges water sharing treaty. Kabibur Rahman, executive engineer of the Water Development Board's Pabna hydrology department, told the reporters that the JRC officials examined the water flow in 10,000 feet upstream from the Harding's bridge. According to the deal signed in 1996, JRC experts inspect the water flow in Padma at Farakka point in India and Harding's bridge point in Bangladesh from January 1 to May 31 every year. A two-member delegation from India comprised Indian Water Commission deputy director Shyam Narayan Singh and assistant director Sunil Kumar Saha and a three-member Bangladeshi delegation, headed by Kabibur Rahman visited the Harding's bridge point. Rahman told bdnews24.com, "In line with the deal, Bangladesh was supposed to get 67,650 cusecs everyday in the first cycle of the first month (January 1-10). But it seems that Bangladesh will not get its rightful share of the water." Bangladesh has never got a fair share since signing of the Ganges water sharing treaty, he regretted. bdnews24.com
