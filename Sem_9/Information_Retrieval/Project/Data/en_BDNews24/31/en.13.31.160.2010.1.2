 Dhaka,Jan1(bdnews24.com)---Two groups of Chhatra League, student wing of ruling Awami League, went on rampage at Sergeant Jahurul Haque Hall of Dhaka University on Friday night. Tension is prevailing on the campus as several blasts rocked the area adjacent to Johurul Haque hall. The infighting started when BCL activists Salam and Sohel were locked in a scuffle over badminton game on Jashimuddin Hall premises. Some BCL workers of Johurul Haque sided with Sohel while Salam got support from BCL activists of different halls. In a sequel to the incident, the rival group allegedly backed by Johurul hall unit BCL president Riazuddin Chowdhury Suman vandalised some rooms including that of BCL hall unit secretary Shamsul Kabir Rahat. Rahat alleged that Suman ransacked his room, but Suman denied the allegation saying that Rahat made the attack. At 9 pm, several blasts rocked the adjacent road of Johurul Haque spreading panic among the inmates of the hall. Dhaka University deputy proctor professor Amjad Ali told bdnews24.com, "On learning the agitation, we rushed to Jashimuddin Hall and Johurul Haque Hall and tried to resolve the problem." Shahbagh Police chief Rezaul Karim said, "Clashes had spread on the campus between the two groups. But police took control of the situation." He admitted hearing the sound of blast on the campus. bdnews24
