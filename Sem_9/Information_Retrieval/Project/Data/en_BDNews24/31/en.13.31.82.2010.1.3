<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 03 (bdnews24.com)The government will adopt a zero tolerance policy for plagiarism in the upcoming Secondary School Certificate examinations next month. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid made the announcement on Sunday after a preparatory meeting on the exams scheduled to begin from February 1. "We are mounting efforts to hold the exams in a completely fair environment free of cheating. Anyone flaunting rules inside or outside the exam centres will be taken to task." The secondary school exams are the first public exams that students face in their lives after 10 years of formal education. These exams are typically plagued with widespread cheating with virtually hundreds of students expelled from exam halls. Strict government action and tough invigilation have previously met with resistance from the examinees as well as their parents. The minister said widespread public support to this governmental effort would be absolutely necessary to make it a success. "Authorities have been directed to take appropriate measures and gain popular support through local level meetings and discussions," he said. Nahid said, no examinee will be allowed to take cell phones or bags to the examination halls. "Educational institutions have been alerted already to notify the examinees regarding the embargo in advance," said the minister. The education ministry has asked all concerned to raise widespread awareness and mobilise necessary public support against plagiarism at the public examination. At the same time, local authorities at each exam centre have been directed to hold meetings on the subject with quarters including locally influential people and upazila (sub-district) officials. Nahid said the government had decided to hold the secondary school exams in February instead of March, in a bid to bring forward the academic year. About 1.2 million students are expected to sit for this year's exam. bd
