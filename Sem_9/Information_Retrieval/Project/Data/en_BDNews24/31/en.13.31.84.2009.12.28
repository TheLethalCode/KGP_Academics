 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)Clocks will go back at 11.59pm on Dec 31, rather than midnight, to return to Bangladesh Standard Time (BdST), the government clarified on Sunday. Bangladesh introduced Daylight Saving Time (DST) for the first time on June 19 this year, by advancing clocks one hour from 11:00 pm to midnight. A cabinet decision last week that clocks would go back at midnight on the last day of the year caused some to speculate that midnight would 'strike twice' for New Year's Eve revellers this year. A notice from the power ministry on Sunday, however, clarified that clocks would be set back again one minute before midnight on Dec 31. The government has also decided to continue with Daylight Saving Time from next year to ensure maximum utility of daylight, said the notice. Clocks will be advanced to 11:59pm (GMT+7) from 10:59pm on March 31, to continue until Oct 31. They will be turned back to 10:59pm (GMT+6) from 11:59 pm on Oct 31, to run until March 31. The power ministry said the objective was to ensure maximum utility of daylight and cut consumption of power. Most countries around the world, except for the tropics, have introduced Daylight Saving Time at one time or another. At present, some 70 countries practice DST. Japan, India, and China are the only major industrialised countries that do not observe some form of daylight saving. b
