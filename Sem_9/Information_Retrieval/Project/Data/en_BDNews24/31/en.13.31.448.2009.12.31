 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has called the Awami League's one year in power a "failure." She also alleged that the government was busy safeguarding foreigners' interests instead of meeting its pledges to the country. "The government has proved to be a failed one in its one year. They have no successes anywhere. They are busy with themselves and their digital dream," she said on the eve of the new year, speaking at a ceremony to mark Dinajpur Awami League leader Omar Faruk Chowdhury's joining BNP. Welcoming newcomers to her party, at her political office in Gulshan, she said: "What Awami League is, people know it to the backbone today. They are busy extorting, grabbing tenders and land." "They have done no work for the welfare of the people for the last year." She said voters have given the government opportunity to work for the development and welfare of the country and to ensure peace and prosperity, but they had not taken that opportunity. She greeted countrymen and expatriates on the occasion of the New Year, and hoped BNP would successfully go forward in 2010. BNP standing committee members Mahbubur Rahman, Nazrul Islam Khan, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam, among others, were present at the ceremony. bdnew
