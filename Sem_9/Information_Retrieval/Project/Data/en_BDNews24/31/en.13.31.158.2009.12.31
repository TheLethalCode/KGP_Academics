 JAKARTA, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indonesian resort island of Bali faces a risk of attack on New Year's Eve, a statement issued by the US Embassy quoted the island's governor as saying, but the governor's office denied making any such comment. Bombs detonated by Islamic militants targeting bars popular with Westerners on Bali killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, in 2002.
