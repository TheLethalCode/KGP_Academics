<TITLE> Why 'deadliest blow' on CIA made little splash </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Losing eight Americans in a single attack on a battle field is big news. But surprisingly when a suicide bomber infiltrated a secure base in Khost in eastern Afghanistan killing Americans on Dec 30 it made no headlines during the prime-time evening news. Yet the attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman, it turned out, was the single deadliest blow on U.S. intelligence personnel since the US embassy in Beirut was bombed in 1983. Initial reports by the major TV networks, including ABC and NBC News, made a cursory mention of the incident, saying eight American civilians were killed by a suicide attacker in Afghanistan. It was not until late in the evening when Rachel Madow, host of the MSNB show TRMS, disclosed that the slain American civilians were actually CIA agents. Only then did the American viewers come to know about their real identity. The question many here are asking: why did the news of the huge casualty of CIA agents in a single attack make no splash. Part of the reason may lie in the utmost secrecy that characterises the spy agency. Despite the fact that the United States is an open society where transparency is widely valued, the CIA is the one taxpayer-funded government agency that most Americans hardly know anything about. No one even knows how many people work for the spy agency; more importantly its budget is a closely guarded secret, and even members of Congress don't seem to know about it. The thick layer of secrecy that wraps the agency perhaps explains why the reporters failed to elicit any concrete response from the CIA about the bloody incident two days before New Year. A CIA spokesman would only say that they would notify the immediate family members of the victims. But it is certain that their names will never be made public. It is unclear exactly how the assailant managed to gain access to the heavily guarded U.S.-run post, which serves as an operations and surveillance centre for the CIA. The bomber struck in what one U.S. official described as the base's fitness centre. The bomber and those who aided him must have had very good intelligence to gain access to the secure base without arousing suspicion, Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert and professor at Georgetown University told the Washington Post. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and said the bomber was "an Afghan National Army officer wearing a suicide vest," the Associated Press reported. In addition to the dead, eight people were wounded in the attack, several of them seriously, U.S. government officials said. According to news reports, the CIA has been quietly bolstering its ranks in Afghanistan in recent weeks, mirroring the surge of military troops there. Agency officers coordinated the initial U.S.-led attack against the Taliban in Afghanistan in late 2001, and have since provided hundreds of spies, paramilitary operatives and analysts in the region for roles ranging from counterterrorism to counternarcotics. The agency also operates the remote-control aircraft used in aerial strikes on suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in the lawless tribal provinces on the Pakistan side of the border. The campaign of strikes in Pakistan has not been officially acknowledged, but it has escalated rapidly in the past two years. Intelligence experts who have visited U.S. bases in the region say the CIA officers at Chapman would have focused mainly on recruiting local operatives and identifying targets. "The best intelligence is going to come from the field, and that means working closely with the Afghans," Hoffman said. The loss of experienced CIA field officers would be particularly damaging to U.S. efforts in the area "because they know the terrain," he said. "Every American death in a theater of war is tragic, but these might be more consequential given these officers' unique capabilities and attributes." Khost has been the scene of several major attacks this year. In May, an attack killed 13 civilians and injured 36 others. Seven Afghan civilians were killed and 21 were wounded by an improvised explosive device detonated outside the main gate of Forward Operating Base Salerno on May 13. According to newspaper reports, a total of 90 CIA employees have been honoured for their deaths in the agency's service since its inception in 1
