<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)--The country's top taxman has warned tax-dodgers that their political clout will not save them from facing legal action. Political identity of the tax dodgers will not be considered in taking action, National Board of Revenue chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed told a press conference at NBR auditorium on Wednesday. "However powerful they might be or whatever their political identity, NBR will sue them," he said. "Our sole objective is to boost revenue collection and so if someone evades tax payment, it becomes an important issue for us." Member of income tax division Aminur Rahman said out of 72 cases filed against tax dodgers during the caretaker government's rule, 32 has been disposed of. "Though an elected government is running the country, cases are still being filed against VIP tax dodgers and the process will continue uninterrupted," Rahman said. The NBR boss said revenue collection amounted to Tk 21,616 crore during July-November of the current fiscal year. He expected this year's revenue collection to surpass the target. Ahmed said, "Current VAT law will undergo reform in a bid to boost revenue earning in this sector." "The draft of the bill will be placed at the cabinet meeting on Feb 4, 2010." Complexities in customs law will also be addressed, he added. The NBR chief said a survey will be launched countrywide in search of new taxpayers. Another 400,000 taxpayers are likely to be added by June next year to the over 22,00,000 individuals taxpayers with TIN, he said. bdnew
