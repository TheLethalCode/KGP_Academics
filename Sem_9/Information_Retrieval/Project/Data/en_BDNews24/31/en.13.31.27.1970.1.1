 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has sought clarification on a recent allegation involving foreign investment in the country's energy sector. Khaleda raised the question on Tuesday in her speech as the chief guest at the closing ceremony of the 18th National Council and the 34th Council Meet of the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh (IDEB). She said, "A serious allegation has been made recently regarding foreign investment in a gas plant. The nation hopes that the relevant quarter will come out with a proper answer in public." The opposition leader, however, did not name those in involved in the reported scam. The daily Amar Desh recently published a report, alleging the prime minister's son Sajib Wajed Joy and energy adviser Toufique-e-Elahi took a bribe from US company Chevron. The daily reported on Dec 16 that Joy and Chowdhury allegedly accepted a Tk 35 crore bribe from Chevron for helping it get a Tk 370 crore deal without tender. The newspaper's editor Mahmudur Rahman was energy adviser to former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Senior members of the cabinet have refuted the allegations in the Amar Desh report, saying it was designed to malign the Awami League-led alliance government. bdn
