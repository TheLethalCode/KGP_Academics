 CARACAS, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez said in a New Year's message the "illusion" around US President Barack Obama was over and rich nations had left the world on the verge of ecological disaster. Quoting from both Karl Marx and the Virgin Mary, Latin America's leading critic of US power said only socialist and Christian principles could right the wrongs of capitalism. "It's not an easy task, I acknowledge," Chavez said in a written message carried by state media on Monday. Chavez initially sought to foster good ties with Obama, shaking his hand and giving him a book at a regional summit. But he has been increasingly critical of late, saying Obama failed to curb "imperialist" policies in Afghanistan and Iraq, and was tolerant towards a coup leader in Honduras.

Analysts expect Chavez to win the 2010 National Assembly vote, albeit it with a reduced majority. "The elections are crucial to the continuation and deepening socialism of the Bolivarian Revolution," said Chavez, whose idol is Venezuela's independence hero Simon Bolivar. In his New Year's message, Chavez said Venezuela was coming out of the "hell" of four decades of capitalism before him. He noted new government measures, including a Corporation of Socialist Markets set up to provide cheap products ranging from cars to "arepas," the popular local pancake.
