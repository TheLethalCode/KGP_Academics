 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh Upazila Parishad Association, a forum of chairmen of the local government bodies, met with the chief election commissioner on Sunday to press a set of demands. They demanded that their five-year tenure is counted after they get responsibilities, an end to 'interference' by MPs in the running of upazila affairs, withdrawal of cases against those candidates who failed to show their election expenses and opportunity to run in national elections while holding Upazila Parishad offices. The association's convener Harunur Rashid Hawlader said the elected representatives are yet to be handed over the responsibilities a year into the upazila elections on Jan 22. Parliament passed the Upazila Parishad (Amendment) Act 2009 in its maiden session, according to which the term starts from the first meeting of the bodies. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said the issue of tenure is not a concern of the Commission. However, Huda said he would take up the issue with the local government ministry and the prime minister. Association's member secretary Badiuddin Badsha said allowing the chairmen to contest the national elections would help to build up a skilled leadership. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, however, disagreed with the contention. "Elections will be held in line with the (electoral) laws. There is no scope to contest a election while holding an office," he said. Colleague M Sohul Hossain said: "The cases filed against those candidates who failed to state their election expenses in due time are now a matter of court. The Election Commission has nothing to do with it now." However, the election commissioners said the local government and rural development ministry was considering their issue of the MPs' interference in Upazila Parishad's business. Huda said, "Local government remained unpracticed for a long time as no elections were held. The current Upazila Parishads would need sometime to become dynamic and vibrant." bdn
