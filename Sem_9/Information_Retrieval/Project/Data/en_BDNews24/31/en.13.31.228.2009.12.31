<TITLE> BNP looks for direction after year of disarray </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)the country's main oppositionhas been plagued by political disarray and lack of direction throughout much of this past year. Instead of playing its rightful role in a parliamentary democracy, it boycotted parliament and criticised the government from outside. The boycott that began with a row over seating is now a stand against "oppression" and "harassment" by the government, according to party leaders. Shattered by an ignominious defeat in the last general election, the opposition party looked to be in utter confusion as internal bickering took its toll on the organisation, weakening party structure. The last straw on the camel's back was the legal battles facing many of its leaders, including party chairperson Khaleda Zia, who had to fight in court in cases related to corruption and misuse of power during its previous stint in government (2001-2006). Of late though, BNP was able to hold its national council session, after a hiatus of 16 years, overcoming widespread internal conflicts and groupings, say observers. But the party failed to hold local councils in 27 districts due to internal feuds. BNP held its long-overdue fifth national council on December 8 at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in capital Dhaka. The council created a new post of senior vice president for Tarique Rahman, indicating that the elder son of the party chairperson is the heir apparent. Tarique Rahman, who is now abroad on parole from jail for medical treatment, earlier held the post of senior joint secretary general of the party. Mirja Fakhrul Islam Alamgir replaced Tarique in that post. In a major rehaul, the party council stripped pro-reform leaders of important posts and rewarding those who were devoted to party chairperson during the two years of military-backed caretaker government, as analysts had predicted. NEW FACES Some 12 new faces were inducted in the BNP Standing Committeethe party's highest policy making body while a number of young leaders were brought to the forefront of the organisation. Khaleda Zia, the BNP chairperson and a former prime minister, retained her grip tight on the party leadership with the national council having re-elected her as the party chairperson. But despite all rhetoric about making the party more dynamic, the organisational structure of BNP remains the same as before, say analysts. Earlier, Khaleda had declared 2009 as the year to reorganise BNP, but in reality they failed to develop BNP at grass root level while its leadership still appeared divided between pro-reform and anti-reform forces. Observers said the BNP secretary general and other central leaders failed to address the conflict within the party. YEAR OF WALKOUTS BNP attended the maiden session of the 9th parliament on January 25 but then began a non-attendance protest over a seating dispute. The main opposition staged several walkouts from the House over certain issues during the first session but resorted to prolonged boycott as the government cancelled the allotment of Khaleda Zia's residence in Dhaka cantonment. ON AWAMI LEAGUE Asked to evaluate the performance of the Awami League-led alliance government, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, now in Singapore for medical treatment, told bdnews24.com, "This government has no success other than persecuting opposition party." "The government is also keen to sign accords with foreign countries, contrary to national interests," he said While evaluating the success of his own party, he said, "BNP succeeded in holding a fruitful council in the face of difficulties and conspiracies." BNP standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Moudud Ahmed were also critical of the government saying that one year of the AL regime is marked by soaring prices of daily necessities, deteriorating law and order situation and extra-judicial killings. Tariqul Islam, another BNP standing committee member, told bdnews24.com, "The Awami League government has failed to generate employment It's one year in power is marked by politicisation of the administration, tender rigging and unabated rise in crime and terrorism." People of the country are tired of misrule of the Awami League government, he added. bdne
