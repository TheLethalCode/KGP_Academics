 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)--A Khulna court on Sunday ordered BNP MP Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury to appear in court in a defamation case. Khulna chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Barekuzzaman issued the order after Sultana Rahman Shilpi, a pro-Awami League lawyer, filed the case on Aug 17. The case accused the opposition legislator of making provocative and defamatory comments about the Aug 15, 1975 assassination of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Chowdhury reportedly said in a meeting in August that the Aug 15 event was "necessary for the nation." A number of defamation cases were filed in different places throughout the country over his remarks. Chowdhury, however, secured anticipatory bails from the High court in several cases after arrest warrants were issued against him. bdnews24
