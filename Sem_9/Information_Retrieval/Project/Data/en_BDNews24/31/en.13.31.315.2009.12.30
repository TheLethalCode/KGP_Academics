 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  A junior Chinese minister Wednesday clarified his country's position at the Copenhagen talks to Bangladesh as part of its global climate diplomacy. Hu Zhengyue, a Chinese assistant foreign minister in-charge of international treaty (Asia), who arrived in Dhaka on Tuesday, met foreign minister Dipu Moni at foreign ministry. The minister acknowledged Bangladesh's concern over climate change and assured Dhaka of providing all possible assistance in this regard. He also had talks with foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes at the state guest house Padma and discussed bilateral issues. Foreign ministry officials said Zhengyue's visit is a testimony of the role that Bangladesh has played in international arena. Prior to the Copenhagen talks, US president Barack Obama and British premier Gordon Brown telephoned Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and appreciated Bangladesh's concern over climate change. "The Chinese minister recognised Bangladesh's concern over climate change," a senior foreign ministry official, who attended the bilateral meeting, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "He also made the Chinese position clear to Bangladesh on his country's role in climate change negotiations," he said. The official quoted the minister as saying that China would voluntarily cut emissions as his country was in the process of development. "The developed countries polluted environment for the past 200 years, so they should play their part first," he quoted Zhengyue as saying. The developed countries stress on a legally binding treaty to reduce emissions while the developing economies press for voluntary emission cuts. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the Copenhagen talks raised the issue that a sea level rise would devour about 17 percent of Bangladesh's land in the coastal areas, which will result in the displacement of about 20 million people. However, a foreign ministry press statement said foreign minister Dipu Moni told the visiting minister that Bangladesh would like to work with China to make the Bangladesh-Myanmar-China' road project a success.
