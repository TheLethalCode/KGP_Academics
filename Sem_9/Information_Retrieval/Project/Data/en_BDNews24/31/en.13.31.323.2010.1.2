<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed office bearers of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal on Saturday faced the wrath of the colleagues deprived of position in the committee. The aggrieved activists also burnt an effigy of the new JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku on the campus. Three leaders were injured after they came under attack in front of DUCSU Bhaban at around 11am. A 171-member committee of JCD, student of BNP, was declared on Friday with Tuku as the president and Amirul Islam Khan Alim the general secretary. The injured, health and environment affairs secretary Ajmalul Haque Pilot, entertainment secretary Ruhul Islam Rony and deputy office secretary Ziaul Haque Zia, were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. DU proctor KM Saiful Islam, who visited the spot on hearing the incident, said he brought the situation under control persuading the angry JCD activists to go back to their dormitories. A protest procession was taken out from Madhur Canteen at around 12:30pm. The demonstrators later in a rally declared the office bearers of the new committee persona non grata on the campus. They demanded reorganistion of JCD under the leadership of senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman. Former library secretary Asaduzzaman Palash told bdnews24.com that Tuku and Alim had made the draft list of the new committee. But the leaders who made sacrifice at different times have been dropped from the new list at the last moment, he said. Palash blamed Tuku for the change. JCD general secretary Alim admitted the allegation. He said the leader (Khaleda Zia) has the authority to change the committee. She can make the change if she wishes, Alim said. On July 1, a partial committee was announced through a press release by making Tuku president and Alim general secretary. Four leaders of Firoz-Nirab group were expelled in mid July after they opposed the announcement of the committee. Akramul Islam, supporter of Firoz-Nirab group and former joint secretary of JCD DU unit, said they are upset about the past of the newly formed members. He, however, said they would not oppose against the new committee approved by Khaleda Zia. bdnews
