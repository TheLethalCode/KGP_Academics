 ISLAMABAD, Jan 1(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 10 people were killed on Friday in a suicide bomb attack on a volleyball game in northwest Pakistan, a local police chief said. "At the moment, we have reports of nine to 10 deaths, but this number could increase. We're removing people from the rubble of collapsed roofs," police chief Ayub Khan told Reuters by telephone. "It was a suicide attack. The bomber was on foot and he blew himself up during the game," Habibullah Khan, a police official, told Reuters by telephone. The blast took place in the town of Lakki Marwat, near Taliban strongholds. The attack came on a day of protests against militant violence in Pakistan, a US ally. Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi nearly shut down on Friday as religious and political leaders called for a strike to denounce bloodshed after a suicide bomber killed 43 people at a religious procession this week. The Taliban claimed responsibility for Monday's attack on a huge crowd of Shi'ite Muslims and threatened more bloodshed. The prospect of increased violence comes at a trying time for President Asif Ali Zardari, who faces political heat because corruption charges against some of his aides may be revived. The pro-American leader has vowed to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda but they remain defiant, killing hundreds of people in bombings since October despite facing major government offensives. In a sign of growing anxiety over security, the United Nations will withdraw some of its staff from Pakistan because of safety concerns, a UN spokeswoman said on Thursday. On a visit to Karachi on Friday, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said militant groups were harming Pakistan, a country Washington needs to help stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan, where Western troops are battling a Taliban insurgency. "They are hired assassins. They are enemies of Pakistan. They are enemies of Islam," he told report
