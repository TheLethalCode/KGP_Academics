<TITLE> South Africa will not panic after heavy loss says Smith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 30 (Reuters) - South Africa will not be panicked into making sweeping changes after their innings defeat to England on Wednesday, captain Graeme Smith said. England bowled South Africa out for 133 in their second innings to complete an innings and 98-run win and take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. After a remarkable 2008, in which they won 11 of their 15 tests and took first place in the world rankings, South Afric have lost four of their six tests this year. "It's clear in our heads what we need to look at, those areas in which we are not up to standard. It's obviously been a disappointing year and we have not lived up to the hype of 2008," Smith told a news conference. "We reached a certain point, but we haven't been able to take it to the next level. We need to look at why we haven't done that, we need to reassess and make 2010 a better year. "But it's important to take the emotion out of the decision making. We've now got a crucial test coming up in Cape Town and we need to make the right decisions to win that game. "It's important to have a wakeup call, we were outplayed and it just wasn't good enough, but it was one collapse and, as disappointing as it is, I'm not a big believer in calling for mass changes.
