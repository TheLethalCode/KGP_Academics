<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Criminal Investigation Department has sought an extension for submitting the investigation report in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Investigation officer of the case, CID's Abdul Kahhar Akand, filed a motion with the metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah for more time. The judge set Monday for a hearing. On August 3 last year, Md Masdar Hossain, then judge of Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal 1, had directed further investigation after taking statements of some 61 witnesses. Later the case was transferred to the metropolitan sessions judge's court and the CID was given a further extension. At least 24 people, including Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, wife of president Zillur Rahman, lost their lives in the attack on August 21 on Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka. Scores sustained injuries, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Investigators, during the previous BNP administration, are accused of attempting to derail the case through different means including recording of false statements from witnesses. After BNP's tenure was over, newly appointed investigators, during the regime of the subsequent interim government, eventually pressed charges against 22 people, including BNP leader Nasiruddin Pintu and JMB leader Mufti Hannan, on June 11 last year. BNP's former state minister for home, Lutfozzaman Babar, now in jail, was also recently shown arrested in connection with the grenade attack. bdnew
