 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Clocks will go back on Dec 31 to restore Bangladesh Standard Time (BdST). An official announcement Wednesday reminded the public that they must set back their clocks back an hour at 11.59 pm, to return to GMT+6 . Bangladesh introduced Daylight Saving Time (DST), that is GMT+7, for the first time on June 19 this year, by advancing clocks one hour from 11:00 pm to midnight. The cabinet decided on Dec 24 that clocks would go back on the last day of the year. It also decided to continue with Daylight Saving Time from next year to ensure maximum utility of daylight. Clocks will be advanced to 11:59pm (GMT+7) from 10:59pm on March 31, to continue until Oct 31. They will be turned back to 10:59pm (GMT+6) from 11:59 pm on Oct 31, to run until March
