 LOS ANGELES, Jan 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prosecutors said on Thursday they did not have enough evidence to charge boxer Mike Tyson over an altercation with a paparazzi photographer at Los Angeles airport in November. The photographer, who went to the hospital that day with a cut to his forehead, will also not be charged. "Our office conducted a full and thorough review of the case and ultimately we decided not to file charges against Mr. Tyson or the photographer," said Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. Former heavyweight boxing champion Tyson and the photographer were both arrested on November 11 after a clash at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said both men were pressing charges against each other for battery.
