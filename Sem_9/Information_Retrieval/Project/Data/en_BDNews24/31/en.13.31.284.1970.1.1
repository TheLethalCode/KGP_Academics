 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP on Monday demanded clear explanation from the government about the Indian security forces guarding adjoining areas of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. BNP leaders said activities like deployment of Indian forces outside the High Commission building amount to intervention into the sovereignty and national security of the country. BNP demanded explanation from the government relating to the development. BNP standing committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan were speaking at a press conference at the party's Naya Paltan's headquarters. Quoting a number of newspapers and TV channels, Nazrul Islam said: "We came to know through these media that Indian forces were on guard outside their High Commission, searching passing people. This kind of security on the roads outside the commission premises is quite apprehensive." Mirza Abbas said: "Every country has their embassies and high commissions in Dhaka. But it is the government's failure that the Indian forces are guarding outside their commission. Should we than think our government has failed to provide security to the foreigners?" Gayeshwar said: "As an independent country, if it needs to beef up security at an embassy or high commission, it is the government who should provide security. BNP will have agenda demanding clarification of this issue from the Bangladesh government." Responding to a query, Nazrul Islam said, "We are not blaming any country (India) for taking such actions. But we demand sufficient security for the foreign missions, embassies and high commissions from our government." Terming the remarks from state minister for home and foreign secretary 'vague', Islam said, "Internal securities of a high commission are its own concern. But we have objection if it deploy guards outside the commission premises." bdne
