<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com) Myanmar has agreed to take back 9,000 Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said on Tuesday. Myanmar has assured Bangladesh it will begin the process of repatriation "as soon as possible", Quayes said after a meeting with his counterpart Maung Myint. Quayes told reporters at the foreign ministry that Myint had offered to begin repatriation of 9,000 out of 28,000 registered refugees from Myanmar's Northern Rakhain state, currently housed in Bangladeshi camps. Myint arrived in Dhaka on Monday to lead his country in two-day foreign secretary-level talks that began Tuesday. Quayes recently told journalists that Bangladesh would press its neighbour to stop pushing Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh territory. Myanmar's Rohingyas, a Muslim minority, have been crossing into Bangladesh in large numbers since 1991 to escape persecution by the rulers there. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has set up camps in Bangladesh for eventual repatriation of the Rohingya people. But according to international law, the host country cannot force repatriation of refugees. bdne
