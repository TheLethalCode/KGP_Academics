The prospect of increased violence comes at a trying time for President Asif Ali Zardari, who faces political heat because corruption charges against some of his aides may be revived. The pro-American leader has vowed to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda but they remain defiant, killing hundreds of people in bombings since October despite facing major government offensives. In a sign of growing anxiety over security, the United Nations will withdraw some of its staff from Pakistan because of safety concerns, a UN spokeswoman said on Thursday.
