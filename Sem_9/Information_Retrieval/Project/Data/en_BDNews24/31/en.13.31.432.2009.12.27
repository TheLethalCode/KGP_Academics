 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government will form an investigation agency and a prosecution cell by March next year to try war criminals, law minister Shafique Ahmed said Sunday. He said, "The tribunal will be set up at the old high court building. Offices for the investigation agency and prosecution cell will also be set up at that building." "These will be created within the next February-March" The minister said the present judicial service commission's office will be shifted form the old court building to Judicial Administration Training Institute in a month. Responding to a query Shafique said, "War criminals' trial is going to be held not to harass any particular individual or party. Only those committed the heinous crimes against humanity will be brought to justice." "Jamaat-e-Islami will not be able to protect the real culprits no matter how hard they try. They (war criminals) will, of course, be tried." The minister was talking to the reporters after visiting the old high court building and Judicial Administration Training Institute. The present government after coming to power took initiatives to try the collaborators (Rajakar, Al-Badr and Al-Shams) of Pakistani Army during the Liberation War in 1971. Initially, it was decided to set up the tribunal in a building at 14, Abdul Gani road. bdn
