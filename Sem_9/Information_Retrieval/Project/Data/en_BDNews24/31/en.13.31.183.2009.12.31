 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Progress in the power and energy sector, without which the country's development is not possible, will be the big challenge in the coming year, the finance minister said on Thursday. AMA Muhith claims that Bangladesh has nearly emerged form impact of the global recession. He told reporters: "Imports of capital machinery and exports are upward. The remittance (inflow) is very good. The reserve of foreign currency is satisfactory. Thus, it can be said that we have nearly come out of the 'great depression'." He, however, admitted that investment situation is not satisfactory and said: "Only investment is a little bit bad. We are trying and so we hope that the situation will be improved." Muhith spoke at the vendor agreement signing ceremony marking the transfer of the liabilities and assets of Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sanstha to newly formed Bangladesh Development Bank. He saw establishing good governance and good policy as the second challenge. Muhith said prime minister Sheikh Hasina and president Zillur Rahman will address the ceremony to mark the government's one year anniversary on Jan 6. He also said he will address parliament on Jan 4 on the state of the economy. bdnews
