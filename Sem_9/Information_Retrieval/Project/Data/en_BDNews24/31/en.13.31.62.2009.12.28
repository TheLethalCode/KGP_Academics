<TEXT>
 Patuakhali, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Laws are being framed to avoid 'false' allegations of poll rigging by defeated parties after elections, an election commissioner said on Monday. Since 1991, four parliamentary governments have come to power after elections, but the defeated party has always raised allegations of election rigging while the winning party maintained the election was free and fair. "Those who face defeat in the elections often raise irrational complaints about rigging," M Sakhawat Hossain said. "In future, no agent will be allowed to leave the voting centre before 3pm so that none can make any election rigging allegations," Sakhawat said. He was speaking at a views exchange meeting with local administration officials at Patuakhali deputy commissioner's office. The Election Commission is thinking of holding local government elections in the coastal belt between mid-May and June, Hossain said. Before this, the commission will be busy holding Dhaka City Corporation elections in March, he said. Deputy commissioner Riaz Ahmed and Barisal deputy election commissioner Monirul Islam, among others, were present at the meeting. Hossain later visited the site for the EC's Patuakhali Server Station that will maintain and update electoral rolls and ID cards. bdn
