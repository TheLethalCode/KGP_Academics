 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  A parliamentary watchdog has decided to request the chief justice to resolve a "conflicting" situation that exists between parliament and judiciary over a judge's recent controversial statement on legislature. The parliamentary standing committee on law ministry took the decision on Thursday to send a letter to the chief justice seeking his "prudent decision" to settle the issue for the greater interest of the nation. "The judiciary and parliament are in possible loggerheads over the recent comment of the Justice (Nozrul Islam) on parliament," Suranjit Sengupta, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "The committee has decided to send the letter to the chief justice seeking his intervention to settle the disputes between two organs of the state in the interest of the country," he said. "This is an ominous sign that the two organsparliament and judiciarycome face to face over an issue," he said. The letter will be issued on the next working day, said Suranjit. Justice Chowdhury at a recent discussion meeting critiscised the law making process in parliament saying, "Passage of laws is not much difficult (in parliament). Clerks do the drafting and parliament members take no time to pass them. "Most of them even do not read the drafts." The following day, state minister for law Quamrul Islam said he may lodge complaint at the Supreme Judicial Council against Chowdhury for his defamatory comment on sovereign parliament. A censure motion might also be moved in parliament, he warned. Law minister Shafique Ahmed also defended his junior minister saying, "Such remarks from a justice are not prudent. I think he did this from ignorance." "These kinds of comments regarding parliament members are not sensible for a sitting judge. Parliament members are also embarrassed," he added. Suranjit Sengupta said his committee is the best forum to settle the possible tirades between the two organs. bdnews2
