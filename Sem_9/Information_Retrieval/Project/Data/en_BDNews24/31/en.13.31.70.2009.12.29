 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said her government is facing difficulty in overcoming a state of inertness left by the BNP-led four-party alliance and caretaker governments. She expressed her gratitude to the people for voting the grand alliance to power. Awami League-led grand alliance won a landslide victory by bagging 262 seats in the national polls held on December 29, 2008. "We will rise up to the peoples' expectations at any cost," Hasina said in her address while inaugurating the Shaheed Buddhijibi Shetu (3rd Burignanga Bridge) on Tuesday. "We will build a digital Bangladesh to implement our election manifestos. The government is determined to fulfill its pledges," she said marking the first anniversary of national elections. "The country came to standstill due to the corruption by the BNP-led alliance government in their five-year term and panic created during the two-year regime of the caretaker administration. "We have to face troubles to tide over the sluggishness," she said. The PM referred to the achievement of the government saying, "Prices of essentials have come within people's reach, salaries have been hiked and development projects are being implemented. "We have been able to remove our name from the lists of the state of corruption and militancy." Criticising the past government she said: "The four-party alliance government wanted to influence the elections by making fake voters' lists to continue with lootings and corruptions. "They formed caretaker government with their own people, which resulted in the 1/11 changeover." Hasina also came down hard on the military backed caretaker government for its promulgation of state of emergency. "There was an attempt to remove politics from the country. But the caretaker government was compelled to hold the elections in the face of demands by the people, expatriates and other countries." The 708 metre long bridge on the Buriganga river stretches from Mohammadpur's Basila to Keraniganj's Waspur. The PM said her government has approved a 20-year road master plan to invest in transport sector. LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, state minister for law Quamrul Islam and state minister for LGRD Jahangir Kabir Nanok were also present there. bd
