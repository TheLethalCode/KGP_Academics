 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, in reaction to the speaker's nominal offer on Monday of another front row seat in parliament for the abstaining opposition party, said the seating dispute was not the only issue at stake. Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "It's not right to say that the opposition is absent from parliament only because of the seat dispute. Nor is it correct to assume that BNP will return to parliament just because one more seat is offered on the front row." He said "oppression" and "harassment" by the Awami league-led government were "the main bars" to the opposition joining parliament. "The speaker and the government have to remove these obstacles," he added. He said the speaker had an important role to make the parliament effective. "But it's not acceptable if the government asks us to join the parliament and, on the other hand, continues harassing the opposition leaders," said Chowdhury. "We've always said BNP wants to join parliament, we've never said we don't want to. But it is the government who is destroying that chance." He said the government must stop filing "false cases" and harassing opposition leader Khaleda Zia and son, the party's senior vice chairperson, Tarique Rahman. Chowdhury also said: "The government is doing development projects with their women MPs in our constituencies, which should also be stopped." bd
