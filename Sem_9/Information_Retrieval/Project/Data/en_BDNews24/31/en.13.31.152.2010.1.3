 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  More than 37 lakh, or 3.7 million, voters have been enrolled ahead of the upcoming Dhaka City Corporation polls, a draft updated list revealed on Sunday. Biswas Lutfar Rahman, deputy election commissioner of Dhaka division, said over 235,000 voters had been included in the updated list so far. The previous list had 35.25 lakh, or 3.52 million, voters. The EC earlier said it would start the process of declaring the schedule for DCC polls after the final list is made public on February 3. A voter can apply for changes and correction within 15 days of publishing the updated list on January 18, Rahman said. These applications would be resolved by January 26 and included in the final list by January 31. Those who would fail to be enrolled can get enlisted by contacting the district election office, the official added. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has already said the DCC elections, delayed by two-and-a-half years, would be held by March. The term of the current DCC elected officials, including the Mayor, expired on May 24, 2007. bd
