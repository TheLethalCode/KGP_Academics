<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury on Tuesday asked Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation officials to be more responsible in protecting land from grabbers. "Either be more responsible or leave your jobs if you wish to side with land grabbers. If you do, it is the government and people who will be benefited," she said. Matia made the comments, at a review meeting of her ministry on the Annual Development Programme, after hearing of land grabbing in Bagura and Savar from the state-run BADC, which is meant to ensure agriculture support for farmers. BADC chairman SM Nazmul Islam said the corporation is losing the possession of its land in Bagura, to a private organisation. He said a housing company is also grabbing land for a mushroom project in Savar. bdnews
