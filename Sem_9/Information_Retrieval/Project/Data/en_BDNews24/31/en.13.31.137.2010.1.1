<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 01 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has threatened to launch a strong movement if the government compromises on key national interests with India. Khaleda Zia, BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition, told a rally of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal at Paltan Maidan on Friday in Dhaka that her party would not accept anti-state deals with India. She referred to the controversial issues like Tipaimukh Dam and India's request for transit through Bangladesh, and said, "BNP will not accept any anti-state deal." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is due to leave for India in the second week of January, when these issues are likely to be discussed. Speaking on the occasion to mark the founding of BNP's student wing, Khaleda said,"We will welcome her with bouquet if she resolves longstanding disputes with India." But Khaleda warned that if Hasina compromised national interests she will be denounced with protests. She also cautioned Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leaders that any allegation of tender-grabbing and extortion against them would be dealt with strictly. In her 25-minute long speech, Khaleda Zia said, "The government has proved failure in the last one year." Referring to Indian embassy's security, she said, "The foreign embassy security is being provided by that country's forces, but the government claims to know nothing about it." She said such ignorance will only mean that someone else is running the country. Khaleda said, "Independence and sovereignty are not secure under this government." Pointing out that her party had been cooperative, she said, "We have given the government one year time. We did not take any anti-government programme." "We had hoped that the government would fulfill its pledges, but it did not." She also criticised the unconstitutional two-year long caretaker government. Regarding extortion and tender grabbing by Bangladesh Chhatra League, the ruling Awami League's student wing, Khaleda said, addressing Hasina, "Bring back Chhatra League in line. You were forced to dissociate yourself from the organisation and stood down from your post because they were so unruly." Khaleda then said that should Hasina fail to run the country well, she might stand down from her post of prime minister as well. "Stand down from you post of prime minister and save the country." Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Sultan Salauddin Tuku presided over the rally to mark the 31st founding anniversary of BNP's student wing
