 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Clocks went back on Thursday night, also New Year's Eve, to restore Bangladesh Standard Time (BdST), giving Bangladeshis two chances to cheer in the New Year. Unique circumstances caused clocks to strike midnight 'twice' on Dec 31. After introducing Daylight Saving Time for the first time this year, by putting clocks forward on June 19, the government has decided to restore standard time at midnight on New Year's Eve. Accordingly, people put their clocks back an hour at midnight on Dec 31, and then see in the New Year a second time an hour later. An official announcement on Wednesday reminded the public that they must set back their clocks back an hour at 11:59pm, to return to GMT+6 . Bangladesh introduced Daylight Saving Time (DST), that is GMT+7, for the first time on June 19 this year, by advancing clocks one hour from 11:00pm to midnight. The cabinet decided on Dec 24 that clocks would go back on the last day of the year. It also decided to continue with Daylight Saving Time from next year to ensure maximum utility of daylight. Clocks will be advanced to 11:59pm (GMT+7) from 10:59pm on March 31, to continue until Oct 31. They will be turned back to 10:59pm (GMT+6) from 11:59 pm on Oct 31, to run until March
