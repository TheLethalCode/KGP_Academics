<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  A government circular on handing over functions to elected representatives of upazila parishads has renewed a split among chairmen and vice chairmen of the local councils. A spokesperson for one grouping threatened a strong movement if the circular of the local government ministry is not revised by Jan 20 to give due authority to the elected representatives. Abdul Majid Photo, chairman of Saturia upazila in Manikganj, issued the ultimatum to the government on behalf of a group of upazila chairmen and vice chairmen at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Sunday. Elections to 480 upazila parishads across the country were held on January 22 2009. However the local councils have yet to start functioning, while disputes have arisen over authority of the parishads. Photo said: "The government has kept us ineffective for almost a year through a conspiracy hatched together with the bureaucracy." He said a local government directive for government officials to hand over upazila parishads was actually a "bluff". "In spite of the assurance from ministers, the circular of Dec 31 only increased the authority of the upazila nirbahi (executive) officers," he said. The circular gives the UNO the authority to prepare a number of reports as well as the Annual Confidential Report of the council officials. The elected representatives demanded immediate revision of four sections of the circular, said Photo. He said he hoped that the government would accept a 10-point charter of demands by their deadline. According to him, the charter would help activate the local councils. Otherwise, the platform of chairmen and vice-chairmen would launch a strong movement from Jan 21, said Photo. Photo claimed he spoke for five different groupings of upazila chairmen and vice chairmen, including the Upazila Parishad Association and four other groups led by Muhibur Rahman, Ziaul Haque, Fuku and Jahangir Alam. Rahman, Haque and Alam were all present at the press briefing. Photo said that there were no other groupings among the chairmen and vice chairmen and warned all of them would join the movement to be launched on Jan 21. DISAGREEMENT However, the Upazila Parishad Association, formed after the election of Jan 22, apparently is not in agreement with the Photo-led forum. The association's convener member Bodiuzzaman Badsha said, "They are not doing anything democratically. They just want to become leaders." "They have no contact with the government. They are making illogical demands. We do not even agree with their demands," Badsha said when asked about the press conference. A 17-member representative group of the association had a meeting with the chief election commissioner last week. They had demanded that their tenure of five years should be calculated only after they had effectively taken over. "We think the (upazila parishad) law will be revised in the next session (of parliament) as per the prime minister's pledge," Badsha said on Saturday. "There is no point revising the circular. We demand an amendment to the law. The circular will follow the law," said Badsha. bdnew
