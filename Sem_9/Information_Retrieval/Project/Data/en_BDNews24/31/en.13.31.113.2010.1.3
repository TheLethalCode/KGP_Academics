 KARACHI, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan laid on heavy security on Saturday for a boxing tournament, the country's first international sporting event since militants attacked the Sri Lanka cricket team's bus last March. Spectators were barred from the Benazir Bhutto international boxing tournament and some 3,000 police and paramilitary personnel guarded the venue in the congested Kharadar area of Karachi.

Police and paramilitary troops were positioned on the roofs of nearby houses and on the roads leading to the venue which were barred to public transport. A large crowd of people watching the screen cheered loudly as Indian Sanjay Singh fought his bout against an Uzbekistan boxer. Organisers had put up a prize fund of $60,000 for the boxe
