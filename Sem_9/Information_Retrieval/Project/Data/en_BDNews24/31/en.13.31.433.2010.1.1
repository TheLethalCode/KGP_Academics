 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)--The government is not willing to halt extra judicial killings, Sultana Kamal, a leading human rights activist, has alleged. Kamal, executive director of Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a human rights organisation, and a former adviser of a caretaker government, said on Friday the government could easily stop such deaths if it had the will. "As a political government, it should have done so." "So, it refuses to admit such occurrences," she said at the launch of a report on the state of human rights in Bangladesh in 2009 at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity. Comparing with the previous military-controlled interim government that had jailed Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chief Khaleda Zia, Kamal said, "There appears to be no difference between a military and civil government. "The trend of human rights violation appears unchanged." ASK claimed that 229 people died in crossfire in 2009 against 175 in 2008, which is also alarming. The report said there were several failures and a few successes as regards the human rights situation in Bangladesh in 2009. It observed that there were some positive developments on this front during the year. It observed that the ruling Awami League, after taking office in early January last year, endorsed the human rights commission act and strived to implement Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord. But they were not fully or properly implemented. The report also said there were extra judicial deaths violating human rights. The Anti-Corruption Commission's operations had also become remarkably slow. The report also stated that there were numerous instances of violence against women. ASK in the summary report said human rights situation has not improved significantly considering the overall situation, though it is not enough to judge the one-year old government. Rather, extra-judicial killings are still rampant though the government said at the beginning that no more deaths in so-called crossfire or encounters would take place. Now denying crossfire instances, the government says law enforcers fire in self-defence. The watchdog, however, praised the administration for thrashing out a political solution to the bloody mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles in late February. But, it added, deaths of border guards in army custody remained a cause for concern. Citing its own investigation, ASK said captives have been inhumanly tortured on remand for confessions. Allegations also have it that many detainees have been coerced into giving depositions under threat of crossfire. According to ASK, three journalists were killed and 175 tortured, harassed and threatened. There were 439 women raped, 35 Fatwa incidents and 227 faced family tortures. In addition, 279 women fell victim of dowry, of whom 189 were killed. Sixty-three women faced acid throwing. bdnews
