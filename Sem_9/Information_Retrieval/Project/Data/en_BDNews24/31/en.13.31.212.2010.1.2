<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has said the investigation into the BDR mutiny killings will take more time, and she will not give a specific time line for the case to come to trial. The home minister on Dec 8 said that a charge sheet would be pressed by the end of last year. "Investigation is a matter of time. From now on, I won't give any specific date," Sahara told reporters on Saturday at a programme at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters. Over 70 people were killed, most of them army officers deputed to the border force, during the BDR mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters on February 25-26 last year. The rebellion spread to other BDR outposts across the country. Six special courts, including two in Dhaka, have been set up to try around 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny across the country. Three of the courts outside Dhaka have already begun trial of incidents of rebellion outside the capital. According to opinion sought from the Supreme Court, the killings at Peelkhana are to be tried under criminal law, separately from mutiny charges under BDR law. bdne
