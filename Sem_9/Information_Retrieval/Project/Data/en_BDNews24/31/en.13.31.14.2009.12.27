 Rangamati, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Rangamati framed mutiny charges on Sunday against nine border guards of the 12th Rifles Battalion, marking the first indictment since the BDR uprising in February this year. The court also heard testimonies of two witnesses and adjourned proceedings up to Dec 29. Tight security measures have been taken at the Special Court No 4, set up at the border force's Rangamati headquarters especially for the BDR trials in the district. The trial proceedings resumed Sunday after a recess of more than one month. Rangamati began the first of the mutiny trials on Nov 24. Thirty-nine border guards have so far been arrested and accused in three separate mutiny cases in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. Nine of them were produced before the special court on Nov 25. They were given until the next hearing (Sunday, Dec 27) to pick a BDR lawyer or a civil lawyer for their defence. The nine men are havildars Shibbir Ahmed, Sohrab Hossain and Shamsul Haque, signalman Abdur Rahman and sepoys Md Abul Kalam Azad, Sakhawat Hossain, Russel Kabir, Zahir Uddin and Sarwar Kamal. The hearing on Sunday started at around 3pm at the special court with the border force's director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam heading a panel of judges, according to BDR trial law. At the beginning of the trial, Gen Moinul asked prosecutor Lt Col Habibur Rahman if all the accused were brought to court properly. Five members of Rifles Battalion-12 were brought from Rangamati jail while four others from the quarter-guards of the Rangamati headquarters, Rahman said. The prosecutor said there was evidence and witnesses of crimes perpetrated by the nine rebel border guards, and placed a list of 18 potential witnesses. Then the BDR chief read out the charges and announced the beginning of the hearing. Prosecutor Rahman produced his first witness, DAD Riazuddin Ahmed, who gave nine minutes of detailed testimony. The defence then questioned the witness. Following this, another prosecution witness, Aliya Ferdous Dipti, wife of former acting commander of Rifles Battalion-12 Major Alauddin, gave her testimony to the court. She was then cross-examined by the defence. Gen Moinul then adjourned the proceedings on Dec 29. SPECIAL COURTS The Feb 25-26 mutiny left over 70 people dead at the border force's Dhaka headquarters, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. The rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the mutiny around the country. If convicted, they face a maximum seven years in jail under BDR law. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act after the fact. bdnews2
