 SOWETO, South Africa, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At Norman's Corner Bar in Soweto, staff are getting ready for a long night -- especially if the home team get the better of Mexico in the opening game of the first World Cup to be held in Africa. "It's going to be packed," said Zanele Mpeke, 29, who works at the tavern, which sells bottles of beer and cheap whisky from behind a metal grate. "The customers are going to go crazy and I don't think we're going to get much sleep tonight, especially if South Africa win," she said. Bars in the sprawling township are installing big screen televisions, extending their opening hours and offering free drinks for women. Soweto lies a stone's throw from the showpiece Soccer City stadium and South Africa's national flag flutters from hundreds of television aerials and gateposts in the township. In the build up to Friday's opener, children playing in the streets and workmen riding in the back of a truck blew plastic vuvuzela trumpets in the township, known around the world as a focus of the anti-apartheid struggle. Many homes are also flying the flags of other competing nations, particularly Brazil and Portugal, and residents are pleased the football spectacular has increased tourist interest in the neighbourhood, once home to former South African President Nelson Mandela. Sibongile Magora turned her modest Soweto home into a bed and breakfast seven years ago, but she has never had guests coming from as far afield as China before.

"The guests want to see what they have been reading about in newspapers and books and they know a lot about Soweto." Long before soccer fans started booking hotels for their World Cup stay, tourists looking for a taste of authentic urban South Africa have been making space in their itineraries for the township. LOOK ITS BEST Gleaming bus stops and newly planted trees along highways are testament to the money spent to make it look its best, but some people in Soweto are disappointed they have not reaped greater benefit from being on the doorstep of the action. When they fancy a kickabout, Valentine Armstrong and his friends make do with a dusty scrap of land sandwiched between tinned-roofed buildings in the township's Orlando East area. "It's a dream come true for South Africa," the 13-year old said as a cold wind lifted clouds of dust and scraps of litter into the air. "But I think it would be good if there were extra benefits. It would have been better to improve our football grounds and to have grass." Crime rates are high in Soweto and even on a quiet weekday morning, doctors and nurses at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital were treating patients involved in shootings and assaults. They are putting in place a special plan to deal with an expected surge in admissions to the trauma unit as fans pack the township's taverns or flock to big screens that will broadcast the games. "Some people get drunk even if they have one glass," said a hospital spokesman. "But we are ready for anything -- in the country and in the hospi
