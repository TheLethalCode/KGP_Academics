 SEOUL, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to the UN Security Council rejecting accusations from South Korea that it was behind the sinking of one of its neighbor's navy ships, saying it was the victim of a US-led conspiracy. The letter, addressed to the UN Security Council president from the North's permanent representative to the body, followed the filing of a complaint by the South last week demanding action by the international community to deter further aggression.

Despite the tense confrontation, the South said on Wednesday it had approved the shipments of baby formula for North Korean infants as a rare exception to the ban on trade, travel and movement of goods across their border. The United States, the South's biggest ally, said Seoul may not seek a full Security Council resolution because of rising tensions after the sinking of the Cheonan. Seoul said it would hold discussions with its allies to ensure action was taken. Western diplomats say China, North Korea only real ally, will not tolerate new sanctions, while Seoul appears determined to have the council at least agree on some form of reb
