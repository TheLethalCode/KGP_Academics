 Harare, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - African states must intervene in Zimbabwe to prevent widespread bloodshed, the opposition said on Tuesday, accusing President Robert Mugabe of trying to provoke violence as a pretext for a state of emergency. Movement for Democratic Change Secretary-General Tendai Biti said the ruling ZANU-PF had launched a violent campaign against opposition supporters following a stalemate over March 29 elections. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai says he won the presidential vote and should be declared president immediately, ending the 28-year rule of Robert Mugabe. ZANU-PF is pressing for a delay in issuing the presidential results pending a recount and is also alleging abuses by electoral officials in an attempt to overturn its first defeat in a parliamentary poll. "There's been massive violence inside our country since the 29th of March 2008 ... MDC people are being beaten up ... farms with remaining pockets of white people are being invaded.

Earlier, a farmers' union said independence war veterans had evicted more than 60 mostly white farmers from their land. The veterans have frequently been used as shock troops by Mugabe. "The situation is very severe. The evictions are continuing right round the country. We have over 60 farmers evicted as of this morning. Every couple of minutes my phone is ringing with another case of eviction," said Commercial Farmers' Union President Trevor Gifford. The veterans had forced farmers to leave their farms with only the clothes they were wearing. Those evicted included at least one black farmer, Gifford told Reuters. Police said they were not aware of the farm invasions. The MDC says Mugabe is delaying the presidential election result to give him more time to prepare for a runoff against Tsvangirai, and has asked the High Court to force release of the outcome. The court ruled on Tuesday it would treat the opposition's application as urgent and began hearing arguments in the case. Legal proceedings are already in their fourth day and could drag further, delaying the end of a 10-day stalemate that has dashed hopes of a quick answer to the crisis. Zimbabwe has inflation of more than 100,000 percent -- the highest in the world -- an unemployment rate above 80 percent and chronic shortages of food and fuel. Millions have fled abroad, most of them to South Afri
