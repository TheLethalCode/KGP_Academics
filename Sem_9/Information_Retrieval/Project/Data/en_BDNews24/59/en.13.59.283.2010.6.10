 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)--The budget for next fiscal proposes 18 percent less fund for the fire service and civil defence compared to the outgoing year's spending. The squeeze for the hamstrung firefighters comes on the heels of two major deadly incidents in recent times, the June 3 fire at Old Dhaka's Nimtali that claimed at least 119 lives, and the June 1 building collapse at Begunbari that killed at least 25. The budget proposal for 2010-11 fiscal year by finance minister AMA Muhith on Thursday revealed allocation of Tk 1554.4 million for the sector, down from Tk 1889.1 million in the revised budget of the FY 2009-10. The parliament on Sunday mourned the dead in the Old Dhaka fire and Begunbari building collapse. One-minute silence was observed in respect for the dead and a special prayer was offered. A national day of mourning was observed on Saturday for those who died in the Nimatli fire.
