 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank has warned that Bangladesh and most other South Asian countries will fall short of reaching millennium development goals due by 2015, the multilateral lending agency said in a statement Tuesday. MDGs are a set of eight globally agreed development goals. The statement was released on the eve of launching the Global Monitoring Report by the WB and IMF. The report says Bangladesh has more unequal outcomes in primary education than middle-income countries such as Brazil and Colombia and is affected more than three times as much as India on extreme weather events. The WB recommends that programmes combining microinsurance and adaptive infrastructure for Bangladesh to face increased risks of flooding as a result of climate change. The report also says that absenteeism by physicians in larger clinics was 40 percent, while the rate was much higher, 74 percent, in smaller sub-centres (upazila level) with a single doctor. Bangladesh offers scope to receive scaled-up aid in the form of budget support, investment projects and technical assistance, according to the report. Although much of the world, including South Asia, is set to cut extreme poverty in half by 2015, prospects are gravest for the goals of reducing child and maternal mortality, with serious shortfalls also likely in human development goals such as primary school completion, nutrition and sanitation. The report was simultaneously launched in Dhaka, New Delhi and Islamabad from Washington through a multi-country video conference on Tuesday. "The report's central message is that urgent actions are needed to help the world meet the MDGs and combat climate change that threatens all countries, especially poor ones and poor people," Dr Zia Quoreshi, WB's adviser and the author of the report, told the conference. He said the goals of development and environment sustainability are closely related and the paths to the goals have many synergies. "Assessment at the MDG midpoint shows significant progress on some goals but major shortfalls on most of the goals," said Quoreshi. Speaking on a worldwide price hike in foods, the WB adviser said: "It would create a political window opportunity to bring an end of the deadlock in agricultural trade liberalisation." WB president Robert Zoellick in the statement expressed his concerns about the risks of failing to meet the goal of reducing hunger and malnutrition. "As the report shows, reducing malnutrition has a 'multiplier' effect, contributing to success in other MDGs including maternal health, infant mortality, and education," said the WB chief. The Global Monitoring Report: MDGs and the EnvironmentAgenda for Inclusive and Sustainable Development stresses the link between environment and development and calls for urgent action on climate change. The report warns that developing countries stand to suffer the most from climate change and the degradation of natural resources. South Asia faces a large potential health risk from climate change through increased malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria. Factoids of the report suggests that South Asia will likely meet the poverty reduction MDG and contribute the most to global poverty reduction in the next decade but said most human development MDGs are unlikely to be met at the global level while South Asia is off track in areas like nutrition, maternal health, child mortality and education. However, the region is on track to meet the access to clean water but off track to provide improved sanitation. The WB-IMF report said South Asia has the highest incidence of child malnutrition. The child malnutrition rate in India is double the African average. The risk of malnutrition increases with high food prices. The percentage of births attended by skilled personnel is 41 percent in South Asia, which is "very low". The report suggested strong and inclusive economic growth, pace on human development goals, integrating environmental sustainability into core development work, more and better aid, effective harnessing of trade for strong and inclusive growth, and leveraging IFI (international financial institutions) supports towards an inclusive and sustainable development. bdn
