 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) Finance minister AMA Muhith has made it abundantly clear that he is looking to tax Bangladesh's growing affluent class to ramp up internal revenue, with a proposed FY11 budget heavily geared towards propping up the rural economy. Faced with a massive budget deficit, and under pressure from multilateral lenders to expand local revenue sources, the minister slapped higher taxes on a raft of luxury goods, including air conditioners, consumer vehicles, and real estate, in his proposed budget on Thursday. Deciding against higher taxes for personal incomes, the government intends to bring another 0.5 million tax payers into the fold, to meet the NBR's ambitious target of raising Tk 725.9 billion in the next fiscal. The budget deficit for the next fiscal is projected to be Tk 393.23 billion, five percent of the GDP. The government also thought the better of imposing a tax on capital market earnings of individuals, but opted for a capital gains tax on companies. It will seek to offset part of its deficit through government bonds that will offer higher interest rates than the banking system, the minister said. "I would like to make it clear that income earned by individuals through trading of shares of any listed company shall remain out of the purview of taxation," Muhith said in his budget speech. The proposed budget sees higher taxes on motor vehicles between 1000cc and 1500cc and microbuses below 1800cc, as well as imported motor cycles, apartments, cigarettes, air tickets, imported air-conditioners, imported refrigerators etc. Citing the "tremendous" growth and "high incomes" in the real estate sector, Muhith proposed to "rationalise the rate of tax collection from real estate developers at the time of flat or building registration". With import duties accounting for 38 percent of internal revenues, Muhith will hope that his strategy of import substitution, i.e. raising import duties on goods that have locally manufactured substitutes, will not only protect local industry but also increase the tax burden on the affluent few who will prefer finished foreign brands
