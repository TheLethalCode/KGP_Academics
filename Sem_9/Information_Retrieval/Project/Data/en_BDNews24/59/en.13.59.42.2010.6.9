 ISLAMABAD, June 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen in Pakistan torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for Western forces in Afghanistan, killing at least seven people in the first such attack near the capital, police said on Wednesday. The Taliban frequently attack trucks carrying supplies for US-led foreign forces in Pakistan's northwest and southwest bordering Afghanistan, but the attack near Islamabad late on Tuesday was unprecedented. "Seven people were killed and more than 50 trucks were set on fire," police official Ghulam Mustafa said. Six people were wounded. Police said 10 to 12 gunmen attacked the trucks, parked at a depot in Tarnol. "The attack took place around 11.35 p.m. and we are still trying to find out how this attack has happened," Shah Nawaz, head of Tarnol police station said. "The attackers walked into the depot and started indiscriminate firing." The assault underscores growing insecurity in Pakistan where the Taliban have unleashed a wave of suicide and bomb attacks across the country in retaliation for military offensives on their strongholds in the northwest. Militants allied to the Pakistani Taliban killed more than 80 people in two brazen attacks on Ahmadiyya, a minority religious sect, in the eastern city of Lahore late last month. The US military sends 75 percent of its supplies for the Afghan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 percent of the fuel for its troops. The attacks, especially in the northwestern Khyber tribal region, have forced NATO to look for alternative routes, including through Central Asia
