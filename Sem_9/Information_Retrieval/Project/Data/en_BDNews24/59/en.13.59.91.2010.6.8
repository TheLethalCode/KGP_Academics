 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnew24.com)  The questions of tests and pre-tests prior to SSC exams will follow the creative format this year. The decision came at a meeting, chaired by education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, and in attendance of the education board chairpersons. In 2010, the SSC exams of Bengali first paper and religion were held under the new creative format questions instead of the previous multiple choice questions. The exams in general science, social sciences, geography, chemistry and introduction to business will be held in the same system, an education board chairman said. Barisal Board chairman Dr Bimal Krishna Majumdar said the exams in classes six, seven and nine will also have creative format question papers from now on. Another decision about punitive steps against teachers who refuse to carry out their duty in public exams and evaluate answer sheet was also taken at the meeting.
