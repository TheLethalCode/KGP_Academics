 Chittagong, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The BNP-backed Chittagong City mayor candidate's chief polling agent Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury has complained to the Election Commission that prime minister Sheikh Hasina had broken the electoral code. He claimed that the prime minister had asked two influential Hindu community leaders, Binod Bihari Chowdhury and Rana Dash Gupta, to influence Hindus in favour of the Awami League-backed candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. In the document sent to the chief election commissioner, Khosru says, "To influence the Chittagong City Corporation 2010 election, the honourable prime minister yesterday spoke to Binod Bihari Chowdhury and Rana Dash Gupta over the telephone to get a specific community to vote for ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury." "Holding the topmost position of the country, such actions of the prime minister to influence a certain community in voting is against Section 14 of the electoral code." "This is direct involvement; an obstacle to fair, neutral and model election," it said. The Election Commission has been requested to take steps for holding a proper and influence-free election. M Manzur Alam is backed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party under the banner of the Chittagong Development Movement. A copy of the letter was also submitted to the returning officer of the June 17 polls. b
