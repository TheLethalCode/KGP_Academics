<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has ordered six officers in charge (OCs) of the capital to submit a progress report on the implementation of its ban on waste dumping in the Buriganga River. The bench of justices Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Naima Haider ordered the six on Wednesday to submit progress reports every three months after the officers appeared before the court in response to a contempt of court order issued on Monday. The court also reminded the officers of its earlier warning that it would take legal steps against them if they did not comply with the order. On Monday, the court issued a contempt of court ruling on the OCs for not complying with a previous order to stop the dumping. It also ordered Kotwali police chief Salahuddin Khan, Keraniganj police chief Md Assaduzzaman, Hajaribagh police chief Enamul Haque, Lalbagh police chief Mohammad Ali, Kamrangirchar police chief Shafiqul Islam and Demra police chief Mahbub Hossain-to appear in person to answer the court on Wednesday. The order on Monday came in response to a petition filed by the human rights organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The court had also asked the officers to explain why punitive measure should not be taken against them for disobeying the court order. The petition had referred to the May 4 High Court order asking authorities to deploy police at the Buriganga banks to stop the dumping of waste. However, the police officials had not, it was claimed, made the deployment as ordered and had showed contempt for the court. bdnews
