 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister has said a fully fledged National Human Rights Commission will be constituted this month. "A full committee will be formed with a chairman and not more than six members in line with the law," Shafique Ahmed told reporters at his Secretariat office on Tuesday. Speaker Abdul Hamid is working on the scrutiny of the members, he said. The NHRC was formed during the tenure of the past caretaker government by an ordinance. Later, the bill was passed in the first session of the ninth parliament. It contains a rule that says the committee consisting of a chairman, one permanent member and temporary women and anthropologists should be appointed for three years. Since the formation, the works are going with the single chairman only. The term of the current chairman justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury will end on June 20. bdne
