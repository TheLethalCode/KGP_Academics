<TEXT>
 United Nations, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council imposed a fourth round of sanctions on a defiant Iran on Wednesday over a nuclear program the West suspects is aimed at developing the means to build atom bombs. Iran insisted it would go ahead with the uranium enrichment at the centre of the dispute. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the U.N. resolution was "valueless" and should be thrown "in waste bin like a used handkerchief." But Russia and China, which have strong economic ties with Tehran and have at times resisted sanctions, fully backed the new U.N. move. President Barack Obama said the sanctions would be vigorously enforced. The resolution passed by the 15-nation council followed five months of negotiations between the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. With 12 votes in favour, it received the least support of the four Iran sanctions resolutions adopted since 2006. Brazil and Turkey, angry at the West's dismissal of an atomic fuel deal with Iran that they say made new sanctions unnecessary, voted against. Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah is in the government, abstained. The four Western powers had wanted much tougher measures -- some targeting Iran's energy sector -- but Beijing and Moscow succeeded in diluting the steps outlined in the 10-page resolution. "Until the world's concerns with Iran's nuclear defiance are fully resolved, we must work together to ensure that the sanctions in this resolution are fully and firmly implemented," U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council after the vote. "This council has risen to its responsibilities. Now Iran should choose a wiser course," she added. Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking nuclear weapons, insisting that its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful energy purposes only. IRAN REMAINS DEFIANT Tehran's envoy to the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Vienna said the sanctions would not impact Iran's determination to press ahead with its uranium enrichment program. "Nothing will change. The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue uranium enrichment activities," Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh told reporters in Vienna. China, which had hesitated for months before joining talks on new sanctions in January, called for full implementation of the new measures and urged Tehran to comply with international demands about its enrichment program. "China calls on all members of the international community to implement the resolution comprehensively and in good faith," Ambassador Li Baodong told the council. He added that it was "imperative to return to the track of dialogue and negotiations" and that the point of the new sanctions was "to bring Iran back to the negotiating table." In Washington, Obama told reporters the new sanctions were the most comprehensive that Iran had faced and sent an "unmistakable message." He added: "We will ensure that these sanctions are vigorously enforced, just as we continue to refine and enforce our own sanctions on Iran." The resolution calls for measures against new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to the nuclear or missile programs is suspected, as well as vigilance over transactions with any Iranian bank, including the central bank. COMPANIES BLACKLISTED It also expands a U.N. arms embargo against Tehran and blacklists three firms controlled by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and 15 belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The resolution also calls for setting up a cargo inspection regime similar to one in place for North Korea. Annexed to the draft resolution is a list of 40 companies to be added to an existing U.N. blacklist of firms whose assets around the world are to be frozen on suspicion of aiding Iran's nuclear or missile programs. The new blacklist includes only one individual, Javad Rahiqi, head of an Iranian nuclear centre where uranium is processed. His assets will also be blocked and he will face an international travel ban. Turkey and Brazil last month revived parts of a plan brokered by U.N. nuclear inspectors in October for Tehran to part with 1,200 kg (2,600 pounds) of low enriched uranium (LEU) return for special fuel rods for a medical research reactor. Iran's LEU proposal also raised concerns, Russia, France and the United States said in a note to the U.N. watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency, diplomats said in Vienna. Iran had proposed to part with no more LEU -- potential atomic bomb material if enriched to a very high purity level -- than it did under the original October deal, even though its LEU stockpile had almost doubled since then, they said. Iran had also begun refining uranium to a higher level in February. The first two Iran sanctions resolutions, adopted in 2006 and 2007, passed unanimously. The council approved a third set of sanctions in 2008 with 14 "Yes" votes and one abstention. Three rounds of punitive measures aimed at Iran's nuclear and missile industries have hit its economy hard but failed to persuade its leadership to halt its nuclear program or come to the negotiating table. Instead, Iran continues to enrich uranium at increasingly higher levels, despite occasional hints of possible military action against its nuclear sites by Israel or Washi
