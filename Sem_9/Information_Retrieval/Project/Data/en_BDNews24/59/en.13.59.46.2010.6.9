<TITLE> New law to curb high fees, fake certificates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) The proposed private university law could stop selling fake certificates by some private universities. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Wednesday that if passed, the law would also prevent the private varsities from charging high tuition fees from the students. The government would be in a better position to monitor the private universities after the bill's passage, he told the parliament. "The bill has been cleared at [Wednesday's] meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on education," Nahid said answering Tahura Ali of Awami League. "If the bill is passed, the private universities will not be able to charge tuition fees according to their whims. Also, they will not be able to sell certificates without teaching," said the minister. As per the proposed law, the private universities will have to set tuition fees after consulting the University Grants Commission. The law will also authorise the government to take action if any of private universities violate it. There are 51 private universities in Bangladesh since passage of the first private university act in 1992. Allegations abound that they charge exorbitant tuition fees, though the standard of education is not satisfactory in many institutions. The government in 2005 cancelled licences of five private universities on charges of malpractice. The present Awami League government has taken initiative to pass a new private university law scrapping the previous one. The new law will empower the vice chancellors, instead of the owners, to have the final say in running the universities
