 Chittagong, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  More than 50 Awami League central leaders and MPs have been campaigning for ruling Awami League-backed Chittagong mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. The AL leaders have been taking part in the campaigns by turn since the schedule was declared for the June 17 city corporation elections. However, there were few central leaders to accompany M Manzur Alam, the BNP-backed candidate, who is also running for the port city's mayor's office, officially under the banner of Chittagong Development Movement. BNP leaders say presence of central leaders in a local government election is unnecessary. bdnews24.com correspondent Mintu Chowdhury reports from the ground that the central AL leaders were holding talks with different sections of AL supporters and MPs, and representatives from religion-based minority communities to engage them in the campaign. AL presidium members Suranjit Sengupta and Amir Hossain Amu roamed around the port city since Friday morning, campaigning on behalf of Mohiuddin, who is contesting the polls under Nagorik Committee. Moreover, organising secretary Ahmed Hossain, Nuh-ul-Alam Lenin, Afzal Hossain, Fazilatunnesa Indira, Sujit Roy Nandi, Aminul Islam Amin and former personal secretary to the prime minister Alauddin Nasim also conducted campaigns separately. The Chittagong MPs including Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon, Abdullah Al Islam Jacob, Tarana Halim and Mamtaz Begum also campaigned for Mohiuddin. A team led by joint secretary general Mahbub-Ul Alam Hanif has already visited the city. The central leaders currently at Chittagong are expected to leave by June 14. Suranjit met Binod Bihari Chowdhury and Rana Dash Gupta on Friday alongside launching mass-campaign. Regarding the presence of many AL leaders, Ahmed Hossain told bdnews24.com: "Awami League is a dynamic political party. So the party leaders have joined the campaign with a united front for the party's candidate." Regarding the low presence of BNP's central leaders, he said that the opposition was in trouble over candidature. There are power struggles within (BNP), he commented. BNP's standing committee member Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, opposition chief's advisor Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, Mir Nasir Uddin, Abdullah Al Noman and M Morshed Khan campaigned for Manzur. b
