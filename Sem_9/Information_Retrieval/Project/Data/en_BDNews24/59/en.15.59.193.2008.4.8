 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday put freezes on the Dhaka University Teachers Association polls set for April 12. Assistant judge Sheikh Merina Sultana ordered a status quo on the polls following a case filed by Md Ashiqul Islam, a fourth-year student of the Accounting and Information Systems at the university. The DUTA president, registrar of the university, education secretary, election commissioner for the DUTA polls Prof Dalem Chandra Barman and Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner were made respondents. The court asked the respondents to explain in two days why an order would not be issued, banning the polls. In case details, Ashiqul Islam said the emergency powers rules do not allow any polls to take place. The DUTA polls created an "unstable situation and destroyed the academic atmosphere" on the campus, the case alleged. "It caused a great loss to the students," it said. Contacted by bdnews24.com for reaction, DUTA general secretary Syed Anwar Hossain alleged a vested quarter was plotting against the polls and used the student for the purpose. Prof Hossain expressed concern over the incident and said: "We can understand the fate of the national polls through this incident." "There has been such a conspiracy to stop the polls of an autonomous body, so it is very clear to the nation what would happen to the national polls," Hossain said. The election to the association was supposed to be held on Jan 1 as per the DUTA constitution. It was rescheduled three times for March 4, March 27 and April 12. bdnews24
