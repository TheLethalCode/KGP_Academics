 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)--Over 1.5 million cases are on trial in the lower courts of Bangladesh, according to the law minister. Shafique Ahmed revealed the figure at a question-answer session in the parliament on Tuesday. Replying to a question of Lakshimpur-1 MP Nazimuddin Ahmed, he said, "Until Jan 1, 2010, there were around six lakh civil cases and nearly 10 lakh criminal cases on trial at lower courts." "The government does not have any plan to form a separate cell for legal assistance of the poor people like other developed countries," said the minister, answering a question from Manirul Islam, MP of Barisal-2. He also said, "The government has already taken some steps to expedite the trial process." "The government has appointed 210 assistant judges and judicial magistrates and appointment of another 100 judges and magistrates is under process," he said. "The government is also working to find alternative means to resolve conflicts. We will take steps after suggestions from the Law Commission," added Shafique. Answering Golam Dastagir Gazi, MP of Naraynganj-1, Shafique said, "After the Grand Alliance government came to power, 35 judges have been appointed at the higher court as permanent and additional judges. Among them 11 are permanent and 24 are additional judges." In reply to another question, from Giasuddin Ahmed of Mymensingh-10, he said, "According to Section 11(5) of International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973, the tribunal is authorised to order arrest or put one under house arrest, provided there is adequate evidence." The law minister replied to Meher Afroze Chumki, MP of Gazipur-5, saying that according to government statistics, the current number of lawyers is 41,391. He said that the justice system was highly dependent on the skills, efficiency and knowledge of lawyers.
