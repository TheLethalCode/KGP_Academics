 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)--The government plans to net at least half a million new taxpayers to achieve its target of revenue collection, finance minister AMA Muhith said in his budget proposal for FY 2010-11. The budget proposal targets around Tk 928.5 billion--11.9 percent of the GDP--in revenue earnings. Of the amount, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is to earn Tk 725.9 billion. The budget, however, does not propose any change in individual as well as corporate tax rates. "As many changes were made last year, we consider that there should be a scope to assess the impact of those changes." Muhith told the parliament that the government planned to introduce spot assessment system for income and payment of income tax through one stop service for "small new taxpayers" and a simple two-page income return form for them. He also said they would expand the ongoing survey to add new taxpayers through outsourcing. The government will make TIN (tax identification number) mandatory for utilities services connection and for registering or renewing fitness of automobiles to find more taxpayers. The finance minister also unveiled plans to connect with the database of National ID Project "to verify information given and modernise TIN management." The 11th national budget under the Awami League government also mulls over working out a couple of reforms in the National Board of Revenue (NBR). "NBR formulates policy and carries out administrative jobs to implement it. For this, capacity building and strengthening of NBR has become absolutely essential," Muhith said. All income tax offices in Dhaka would be automated by the next year and a team of experts would be formed to update the income tax law, added the finance minister. "Restructuring of manpower and other facilities of the income tax department will be finalised by the first quarter of the next fiscal." He also said that a 'Tax Calculator Software' would be attached to the NBR website for convenience of the taxpayers. Muhith proposed to allocate Tk 60 million to spend on motivational programmes for all taxpayers. "The NBR will take initiatives on a priority basis of programmes to build awareness regarding income tax and dispel fear.
