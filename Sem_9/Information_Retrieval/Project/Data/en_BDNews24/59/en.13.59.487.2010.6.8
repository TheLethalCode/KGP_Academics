 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)--The capital's real estate regulator Rajuk on Tuesday resumed demolition of Begunbari's tilted seven-storey building. Rajuk workers along with those hired by the building's owner began work for the second day around 10am under official supervision. Shafiqul Islam, Rajuk's Mohakhali zone official, said on Monday that they had a plan to take down 10-12 risky buildings in the area. The building owner initiated the dismantling of the building on Sunday and the agency workers joined in on Monday. On Saturday, Rajuk officials had said that they would begin demolition on Monday if the building's owner did not initiate the work by then. The seven-storey building leaned to its north on June 4, creating panic amongst the residents and locals as a five-storey building in the same area toppled off its base and crushed 25 people living in tin-shed shanties adjacent to it. b
