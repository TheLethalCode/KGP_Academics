 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com) - British home secretary Jacqui Smith arrived in Dhaka Tuesday night on a two-day visit. "The home secretary landed around 10.00 pm on a chartered plane," Syeda Nazneen Ferdousi, press and public affairs officer of the British High Commission, told bdnews24.com by phone. Smith, the first-ever female home secretary of the United Kingdom, is the third senior minister to visit Bangladesh in the past four months. Before her, foreign secretary David Miliband toured Bangladesh in February 2008 and International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander in December 2007. Smith will meet with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, home affairs adviser MA Matin, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, a statement issued by the home ministry says. "The UK home secretary will discuss the ways of co-operation on countering terrorism and extremism, managing migration, the UK's support for police reform in Bangladesh, and support for the process of building a sustainable democracy," the statement adds. Her visit will conclude with a press conference at the British High Commissioner's residence. She will leave on April 10, the statement said. bdnews
