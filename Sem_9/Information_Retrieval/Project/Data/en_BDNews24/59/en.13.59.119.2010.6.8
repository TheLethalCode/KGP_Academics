 Chittagong, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Chittagong University administration has suspended three Bangladesh Chatra League activists for attacking their rivals. The decision was taken in an emergency meeting of the University Board of Residence-Health and Discipline on Tuesday afternoon. The three BCL activists are 4th year history student Tanvir Ahmed, final year philosophy student Abu Sayed Arafat and final year anthropology student Abdullah Al Asad. They were suspended for six months. The suspended activists were the followers of Chittagong University City Awami League leader A Z M Nasir Uddin. The university authority also asked why further measures would not be taken against them. CU vice-chancellor and president of the discipline board, Mohammad Alauddin, told bdnews24.com that the three BCL activists were suspended for six months for being involved in criminal activities and breaking the university rules and regulations. Dr Alauddin also said that further strict steps would be taken if they failed to explain satisfactorily reasons behind stabbing university students. The clash ensued when an activist of the BCL group backed by Chittagong City Corporation mayor hopeful ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury smoked in front of a leader of the other group backed by Awami League leader AJM Nasiruddin in the Jhupri area.
