 Dhaka, June 9(bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Wednesday that the government was monitoring the activities of the controversial 85 Upazila election officers, who were appointed by the previous BNP-led administration. Although they were sacked by the caretaker government, the officers were reinstated by order of a tribunal, she said during her question time at the parliament. "Action will be taken if any of them tries to manipulate the election," she added. BNP-led four-party alliance government appointed 303 Upazila election officers during its tenure in 2005, allegedly on partisan consideration. The officials, however, had to retake selection test in May 2007 after the caretaker government came to power. Of them, 85 candidates who failed the test, were discharged. Recently the officials were reinstated upon the verdict of administrative appeals tribunal and rejoined the service last month. Replying to a complimentary question from Junayed Ahmed Pulock MP, the prime minister said, "Right of franchise is our constitutional right. We will do everything to protect the constitutional right." "Democracy ensures accountability. A lack of it breeds corruption," she said Hasina further said, "The Election Commission will have to be further strengthened to ensure free, fair and credible election. Election is very crucial in economic development." She claimed there was no government interference in any of the polls held during the present regime. Earlier, answering a question from Shahin Monoara Haque MP, the prime minister said, "The Election Commission may consider the persons responsible for making fake voter lists in 2006. The government will extend required assistance regarding the matter." The number of voters in the list prepared in 2006 during BNP-led four-party alliance government was 9.33 crore but the figure shrank to 8.10 crore in the list prepared by the caretaker government. She also said, "Those who spoilt thousands of crore of taka from state exchequer should be brought to book after proper investigation so that none dares to repeat the same in future." Replying to a query from Lutfar Rahman MP from Cox' Bazar, Hasina said, "Technological and financial surveys on setting up a deep sea port at Sonadia Dwip has already been completed." The government is going to establish the sea port at an estimated cost of Tk 14000 crore, she said. "It would attract more foreign business as it would be cost-saving." "On top of that as an international sea port, China, Myanmar and India will be able to use it, which will boost revenue earnings," she added. Answering a query from AKM Rahmatullah MP from Dhaka-10, she said the government has taken steps to launch a commuter train service in Dhaka to ease transport problem, which would be further extended to neighbouring districts. b
