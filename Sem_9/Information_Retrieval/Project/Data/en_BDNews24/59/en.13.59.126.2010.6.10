 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)--Funding for climate change adaptation has remained unchanged. Finance minister AMA Muhith in his budget speech on Thursday proposed allocation of Tk 7 billion for the upcoming FY 2010-11, the same as in the previous fiscal. The funds will be spent on rehabilitating the climate victims. In his speech, Muhith said: "For the rehabilitation of the dislocated population from areas affected by climate change, steps have been taken to construct cyclone resistant dwellings in the Aila-affected districts under Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong division by utilising this allocation." In addition, a $110 million fund styled Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund has already been formed with the assistance of development partners. The cabinet has recently approved a policy titled 'Climate Change Trust Fund Policy' as part of an integrated plan and a law governing this trust fund is awaiting approval, he said. A refinancing fund of Tk 3000 million has been formed to facilitate installation of effluent treatment plant (ETP) by the industries, the minister added. The government has made it mandatory to install ETP at factories and industries to reduce environment pollution. The government has a plan to bring 20 percent of land under forestation programme through 16 investment projects targeted for launch in the next fiscal to maintain environmental balance and attain self-reliance in forest resources. Apart from that, efforts are underway to modernise the forecasting and warning system for climate change effects, according to Muhith. b
