 SEOUL, June 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - North Korea said Saturday it would launch "an all-out military strike" on loudspeakers installed by Seoul to broadcast cross-border propaganda as tension mounted over the sinking of a South Korean warship. "The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK (North Korea) will launch an all-out military strike to blow up the group's means for the psychological warfare," the North's General Staff of the Korean People's Army said. "It should bear in mind that the military retaliation of the DPRK is a merciless strike foreseeing even the turn of Seoul, the stronghold of the group of traitors, into a sea of flame," it said in a statement. South Korea put up loudspeakers in 11 locations along the tense border in order to resume anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, suspended since 2004, in retaliation for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. Seoul also plans to set up electronic displays. The move amounted to "a direct declaration of a war" and a "flagrant violation" of the inter-Korean declaration for peace and reconciliation signed in 2000, the statement went on. "Therefore, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will launch an all-out military strike to blow up the group's means for the psychological warfare," it said. The statement, published by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, described the loudspeakers as "a hideous provocative act of infringing upon the dignity and supreme interests of the DPRK". Tensions are high after a multinational investigation said the North's submarine torpedoed the 1,200-tonne corvette, killing 46 sailors, near the disputed sea border in the Yellow Sea. The two sides have remained technically at war since the end of the 1950-53 conflict, and each waged a cross-border propaganda campaign during and after the Cold War. They agreed in 2004 to halt the official propaganda to ease relations, although the North still complains strongly about private Seoul groups which launch anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the tightly guarded front
