<TITLE> Japan`s new BOJ head approved, keeps rates on hold </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's parliament formally approved acting Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa as the central bank's permanent head on Wednesday, bringing to a close a political impasse that had left the post vacant since last month. The backing for Shirakawa, Japan's youngest BOJ governor in 50 years, came as the central bank kept its main policy rate on hold at 0.5 percent, as expected. Approval comes in time for the 58-year-old governor to fly to Washington for a meeting of G7 finance leaders on Friday that will seek ways to ease the global credit crisis. Shirakawa won approval in both houses of parliament, including the upper chamber controlled by opposition lawmakers, but the government's candidate for deputy governor, former finance ministry official Hiroshi Watanabe, was rejected. That veto by the upper house leaves the central bank's policy board with two vacancies and the potential for further wrangling over who should fill those posts. Financial markets are more focused on US economic problems than the BOJ leadership, but analysts see Shirakawa, who won parliamentary approval last month to be deputy governor, as a realistic choice to end the three-week gap at the top of the BOJ. There was frustration, though, that a broader policy stalemate between the government and the opposition Democratic party had delayed decisions on the central bank leadership. "Everyone's pretty much fed up. At least they now have a BOJ governor to go to the G7," said Katsuhiko Kodama, a senior strategist at Toyo Securities Co Ltd. "It's all rather embarrassing." RATES ON HOLD Shirakawa faces a delicate balancing act in his new job, with Japan's interest rates already near rock bottom at 0.5 percent but with some investors still expecting a rate cut this year. He delivered his first rate decision as BOJ head on Wednesday, having already been acting in the role since previous governor Toshihiko Fukui retired last month. While the BOJ's decision to keep rates on hold was no surprise, markets are watching closely to see if it has become more pessimistic in its outlook for the Japanese economy. The central bank will release its monthly economic report at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), and Shirakawa will hold a news conference from 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT). "The BOJ may need to revise its scenario after soft industrial production figures in January and February. Many now believe that the BOJ will either sit tight or cut rates rather than raise them," said Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas, another analyst disheartened by the lengthy succession stalemate. "It showed people at home and abroad Japan's lack of ability to govern as well as the lack of competency of the Democrats and the government," he said. BUREAUCRATS RULED OUT Rejection by the upper house of the government's two earlier nominees for the job had left the central bank without a permanent head for the first time in more than 80 years. Watanabe, formerly a vice finance minister for international affairs, won support from some opposition lawmakers because he has expertise in international monetary and financial issues. But he was opposed by the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Ichiro Ozawa. The Democrats, worried about government influence on monetary policy, decided to stick to their stance that BOJ posts should not go to former finance ministry bureaucrats. The government now needs another two candidates for the central bank -- one for deputy governor and another for a policy board member to fill the gap left when it promoted Kiyohiko Nishimura to the other deputy governorship. BNP Paribas's Kono questioned where the government would find qualified candidates to fill the jobs who could win opposition approval -- saying even qualified academics were usually serving on government advisory panels. "But now they won't be approved as they are seen as close to the government. That means there are not many people left," he said
