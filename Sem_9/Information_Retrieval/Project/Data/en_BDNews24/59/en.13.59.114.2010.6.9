<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has asked the government to pursue the democratic path, or else face dire consequences. She asked the Awami League-led Grand Alliance government to change its attitude. "Follow the law and democracy if you want to complete your tenure," the two-time former prime minister said at a mass sit-in demonstration at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka on Wednesday. Her BNP and its allies staged the programme in protest against what they said were the government's interference in the judiciary and appointment of incompetent judges. Khaleda repeated her assertion that the ongoing programme should be seen as a warning to the government. "If the government does not change its attitude we all have to prepare for tough programmes." The opposition leader has claimed that ever since the ruling Awami League came to power in January 2009, her party supporters have suffered at the government's hands "We shall not tolerate any more of the government's oppression and repression. We shall strike back," Khaleda said in her one-hour speech at the rally. She sought to assure her party leaders and workers when she said "There is nothing to be upset or worried about because the days of this government are numbered." Addressing the judges, she said, "With courage, you should neutrally conduct your judicial work, as the people stand by you." She also criticised the way the government was implementing its policy on the withdrawal of charges thought to have been pressed for political persecution. The BNP alleges that unlike those cases involving government supporters, the cases of those linked to the BNP were not being withdrawn She also sounded warning to the police. "Those over-enthusiastic members of the investigating agencies who are detaining opposition party leaders and workers and getting remands by filing cases, you will also have face dire consequences." "Because the days are not over, more days remain in the future. You may also be remanded for such activities." She also alleged that state-run Bangladesh Television had broadcast false news against her and her sons and said, "Those who were involved in broadcasting the false news will one day have no one to protect them." She criticised the government's 'partisan role' in the administration, violation of services code, job termination, and forced retirement. "Those who are victims of this conduct will get back their jobs when we return to power. And those who have got their jobs through the government's partisanship will lose theirs." On the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation elections, she said her party will begin a mass movement against the Election Commission if any type of rigging, as she claimed happened in the Bhola by-election, took place there. Khaleda also responded to the government's criticism to her party's shadow budget. "We placed some budget proposals for the welfare of the people. Now they are saying that we have violated the constitution by doing that." Then, in an apparent reference to the 1986 elections, she said, "Now my question to you is, was the constitution not violated when you convened parliament at the South Plaza of Sangsad Bhaban (parliament building) after having lost the [military dictator HM] Ershad-staged elections?" "This party (the Awami League) has been violating the constitution timeand again, and now it is making its own allegations about others being unconstitutional." Khaleda also demanded the re-opening of the daily newspaper Amar Desh, and the release of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, ex-deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, and former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu. bdne
