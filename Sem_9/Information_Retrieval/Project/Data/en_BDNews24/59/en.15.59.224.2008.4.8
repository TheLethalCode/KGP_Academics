 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken up a Tk 100 crore special job creation project to help the rural poor earn money, a government official said Tuesday. Work on the project named 'Money for Work' begins in April, said Molla Wahiduzzaman, acting secretary of the food and disaster management ministry. Wahiduzzaman said that the people enjoying VGF or VGD facilities would not benefit from this project. Each worker under the project will get Tk 150 a day. The secretary said deputy commissioners had been asked to implement the project. Upazila Nirbahi Officers in cooperation with Union Councils will identify the 'real poor' and create jobs for them. The project includes repairing embankments and roads, excavating canals to boost agricultural output, planting trees, building bamboo bridges as well as public health and environment related works. Divisional commissioners will inspect the projects and report to the ministry to ensure they are being implemented properly. A senior official of the food and disaster ministry said that deputy commissioners would allocate money for upazilas on the basis of population size and needs. bdnews24.c
