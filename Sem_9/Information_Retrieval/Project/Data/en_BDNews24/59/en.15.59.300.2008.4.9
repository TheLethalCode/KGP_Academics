<TITLE> Jones eyes 2009 Ashes after injury nightmare </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WORCESTER, England, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Simon Jones is fit and ready to win back his England place after enduring almost three injury-hit years since he last played a test during the 2005 Ashes-winning series. Jones, 29, was a key man in that 2005 triumph over Australia with 18 wickets, before a succession of injuries left his career in tatters. Having left Glamorgan and his native Wales, Jones begins his latest comeback with new county Worcestershire next week. From the time he missed the fifth Ashes test in September 2005 with an ankle problem through to multiple setbacks with his knee -- Jones despaired at how his career was disintegrating. "It's been very hard, going from such a high to such a low in such a short space of time and having to take a long time to get back to where I want to be," Jones told Reuters on Tuesday. "I found it tough to start with and thought 'what am I doing wrong?' I couldn't understand why I kept picking up injuries. Fair enough if I was a lazy sod and didn't do the right things. "It was one thing after another. Freddie (Andrew Flintoff) has had the same problem with his ankle. It is just a frustrating time because you don't get into any rhythm and you miss the game a hell of a lot. "I sometimes watched the (Ashes) footage if I was feeling low. I only need to watch a bit and it gets me going again because there is no bigger spectacle than the Ashes. That's one of my motivations, to do well, keep fit and push for a place if not this season, next season when the Ashes come round again." Jones has enjoyed a successful England career, having taken 59 wickets at 28 in 18 tests. Even before his most recent injury nightmare he had battled back from a separate knee ligament injury from the 2002 Brisbane test. He believes his timeout of the game will at least have helped preserve him when so many international cricketers seem to be on a constant treadmill, further hastened by the global Twenty20 extravaganza. "It's a blessing in disguise, looking at it as a positive," said Jones. "Look at Brett Lee, he's 32 and is bowling the best he has ever bowled and he has had some serious setbacks with his ankle and with his back and he is still bowling quickly." Jones is just excited at the prospect of playing cricket again and has remodelled his approach to fast bowling -- he plans on running in to the crease faster to build momentum in his action rather than his old amble in and explode style. Jones was given a few tips from boyhood hero Allan Donald, the former South Africa fast bowler, during a practice game against Warwickshire this week. He's now a man with a mission to put his new fitness and technique into practice. "This season is going to be vital for me," he added. "Although I don't want too much pressure on myself I know that I can get back to where I want to be with England, and working well with Worcester.
