 Madrid, July 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- European champions Spain left for the World Cup on Thursday determined to play down their tag as favourites to win the title for the first time after a history of coming up short.

Spain are in Group H and will face Honduras on June 21 in Johannesburg and Chila four days later in Pretoria. Crown Prince Felipe and his wife Letizia will attend Spain's first match against Switzerland in Durban, the royal palace said Thursday.
