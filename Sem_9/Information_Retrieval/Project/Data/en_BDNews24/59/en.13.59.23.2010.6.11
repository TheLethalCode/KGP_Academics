 Dhaka June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The vice-chancellor and the acting registrar of Jahangirnagar University appeared before the High Court on Thursday on contempt of court charge over sexual harassment in the university. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Govinda Chandra Thakur ordered the top officials of the university to ensure security of a female teacher accusing a male colleague of sexual harassment. Earlier on June 3, the bench had issued a contempt of court rule against them -- VC Sharif Enamul Kabir and acting registrar Abu Bakar Siddique -- for their violation of a High Court directive on prevention of sexual harassment, for which the public university has been infamous. The court had also asked them to appear before it on June 10 and show cause within 10 days why contempt of court proceeding would not be initiated against them on a petition by Ain O Salish Kendra, a rights organisation, and the female teacher. The university officials on Thursday apologised for the delay in responding to the rule. The bench exempted them from personal appearance in the next hearing dates. The High Court on May 14, 2008 had issued a guideline regarding prevention of sexual harassment in the university. The guideline stipulates that university authorities shall not disclose the identity of the complainant until the allegation is proved. The contempt petition said the university authorities did not go by the guideline. It also stated that recently a five-member committee of Jahangirnagar University, led by senior teacher Khurshida Begum, had been probing allegation of sexual harassment against a teacher. On June 27, 28 and 29, three national dailies had published a circular signed by the acting registrar that mentioned the investigation and name of the complainant. Private TV channel ATN Bangla also aired a report on the matter on May 1, it added. It also said 'Ain O Salish Kendra' had served a legal notice on the university's vice-chancellor, complaint committee chief and acting registrar in May. In reply to the notice, the acting registrar and complaint committee chief said the complainant's name had appeared much earlier in the print media. Barrister Sara Hossain moved the petition for the complainant. bd
