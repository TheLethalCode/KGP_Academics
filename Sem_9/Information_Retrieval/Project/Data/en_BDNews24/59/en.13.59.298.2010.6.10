 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Planning to implement large projects, the finance minister has proposed an 87.78 percent increase in the power division's allocation for the next fiscal. For energy, which includes development of coal, gas and petroleum, he proposed to reduce the allocation by 1 percent. AMA Muhith on Thursday proposed Tk 49.99 billion for power, up from Tk 26.62 billion last fiscal. The minister mentioned that the country's development had been hampered much due to energy crisis in the past years. The government plans to install power plants with a generation capacity of 9426MW (megawatts)--792MW to be added to the national grid by the year 2010, 920 in 2011, 2269MW in 2012, 1675MW in 2013, 1170 MW in 2014 and 2600 MW in 2015. The energy and power sector, in total, is proposed to be allocated Tk 61.15 billion the next fiscal. It was 43.10 billion in 2009-10. Expenditure in the power division will increase mostly for purchasing electricity from rental plants at a higher price and also from the expensive diesel- and furnace oil-fired plants. Moreover, coal and imported LNG (liquefied natural gas) will be considered as fuel sources for future plants. The country faces a daily shortfall of 2000MW, with rolling blackouts that hit the manufacturing sector hard. The minister mentioned old age plants, gas crisis and insufficient transmission lines responsible for the wide gap of capacity and generation. The current total generation capacity stands at around 5,500MW, when the average daily production stands at around 4000MW. A shortfall of around 1000MW is caused due to lack of gas and for maintenance of old and defective plants. The rest is considered as mechanical and auxiliary loss during generation. However, around 15 percent more is deducted from the total generation before distributed to some 1.20 crore consumers around the country. To implement the plan swiftly, Muhith said, direct procedures had been launched to purchase and produce power terming the power division a 'thrust sector'. Muhith blamed the lengthy tender procedures and low response in tender for slow development in power generation. With this change in trend, power production cost will rise, but will be adjusted through what the finance minister said would be 'subsidies and rationalisation of the sales price. Muhith also cited that development of gas production under a first track programme, launched in 2009, was underway. It could add 200 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd). Moreover, the government has plans to extend the distribution pipeline by 256 kilometres. Procedures were on to sign contracts with two foreign companies over three gas blocks in the Bay, Muhith added. Country's 17 gas fields, out of 29, currently produce around 1950 mmcfd against a demand of 2500 mmcfd. Besides, 5 percent of the 9426MW will come from the renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy plants, by 2015 and 10 percent by 2020, he added. The minister said the draft coal policy has already been formulated, while the energy policy was in the process of getting updated..
