<TEXT>
 MOSCOW,June 9 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad plans to stay away from a meeting of the Shanghai group this week as ties between Moscow and Tehran are fraying over Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, a high-ranking Russian source said. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security group set up as an alternative to NATO in 2001, will hold a meeting in Uzbekistan Thursday and Friday when it will consider opening its doors to new members. Besides heavyweights Russia and China, the group also includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Several countries, including Iran, India and Pakistan, hold observer status and have in the past expressed interest in joining the regional grouping.

At the meeting this week, Afghanistan will be represented by its president Hamid Karzai and Turkmen leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov will also make an appearance, the Kremlin said. Kyrgyzstan, where a bloody uprising dethroned President Kurmanbek Bakiyev in April, will be represented by the country's acting foreign minister Ruslan Kazakbayev. The meeting in the Uzbek capital Tashkent will consider and possibly adopt a new document that will allow new members to join the group, the Kremlin top foreign policy aide, Sergei Prikhodko, said. He refused to say which country has the best chance to win membership in the near future but noted that Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan were all keen to join.
