<TITLE> Penalty strike was never in doubt, says Gerrard </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LIVERPOOL, England, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steven Gerrard said he never doubted he would convert the late penalty that sent Liverpool into the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday despite one of his worst games for the club. "That was possibly one of the worst performances I have ever put in wearing a Liverpool shirt but I was confident I would score the penalty," Gerrard told ITV. Liverpool beat Arsenal 4-2 at Anfield in a thrilling second leg of their quarter-final to go through 5-3 on aggregate. Gerrard's penalty snatched the initiative back from Arsenal who were poised at 3-3 on aggregate six minutes from time to go through on the away goals rule. The penalty and another goal in stoppage time clinched it for Liverpool. Liverpool's captain was played out of position on the left and had failed to make an impact before once again turning into his side's Champions League saviour. Gerrard said Liverpool were lucky to book a semi-final tie against Chelsea for the third time in four years. "Arsenal are a fantastic team. They passed us off the pitch but we stayed together," he said. "We never lacked belief and in the end we came through. "It was a fantastic team performance but it would be difficult to say the best team won. "They had a lot of possession and created chances but over two legs we are a match for anyone. We will be ready for Chelsea." Manager Rafael Benitez said: "This will go down as a great European night. "Arsenal played well in the first half and then there were six goals and we won, so our supporters will be happy," he told the post-match news conference. "We started badly and were giving the ball away. Then we conceded a goal, but I was pleased with the character of the players and the way they reacted." Benitez defended his surprise decision to play Gerrard on the left and use Peter Crouch in attack in a move that seemed to hamper rather than improve his side. "Peter Crouch scored three goals against Arsenal last season and scored again on Saturday (in the Premier League)," he said. "I wanted to use our strength in attack with (Fernando) Torres's power and pace and Crouch's threat in air as well as Gerrard and (Dirk) Kuyt.
