 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) Journalists and BNP-leaning politicians and professionals observed a six-hour hunger strike in front of National Press club on Tuesday demanding that Amar Desh resume operation. They also demanded release of Mahmudur Rahman, acting editor of the Bengali- daily newspaper. Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists (BFUJ) and Dhaka Journalists' Union jointly organised the programme that started at 10am and ended at 4pm. Speakers, at the mass hunger strike, alleged that the government had set a bad example by taking an editor to remand after arresting him in a framed case.
