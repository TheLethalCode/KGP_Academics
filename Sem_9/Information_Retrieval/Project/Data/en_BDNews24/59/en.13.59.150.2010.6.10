<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith has proposed to allocate Tk 64.52 billion for the home ministry, which is only 2 percent higher than the current fiscal. The allocation in the previous fiscal was Tk 63 billion. Though the proposed budget increased allocation for police, BDR and Ansar, it dipped in other important sectors such as fire brigade, prisons and civil defence. An allocation of Tk 37.27 billion has been proposed for police, which was Tk 33.08 billion in the outgoing fiscal. Allowance of Tk 11.24 billion has been proposed for Bangladesh Rifles, which is Tk 1.47 billion higher than the current fiscal. Last year the allocation was Tk 9.77 billion. Ansar and Village Defence Party have been allocated Tk 4.7 billion, down from Tk 3.99 billion in the current fiscal. The budget for the next fiscal proposed 18 percent less fund for fire service and civil defence compared to the outgoing year's spending. The squeeze for the hamstrung firefighters comes on the heels of two major deadly incidents in recent times, the June 3 fire at Old Dhaka's Nimtali that claimed at least 119 lives, and the June 1 building collapse at Begunbari that killed at least 25. The budget proposal for 2010-11 fiscal has an allocation of Tk 1.554 million for the sector, down from Tk 1.889 million in the revised budget of the FY 2009-10. Allocation of Tk 4.40 billion has been proposed for prisons, down from Tk 3.30 billion from the current year. An allowance of Tk 0.67 billion has been proposed for the coast guard in the 20110-11 fiscal year, which was Tk 0.62 billion in the outgoing fiscal. Narcotics control was proposed to get Tk 0.20 billion against Tk 0.18 billion in the present fiscal and the passport and migration department was proposed to get Tk 3.48 billion against Tk 2.80 billion. bd
