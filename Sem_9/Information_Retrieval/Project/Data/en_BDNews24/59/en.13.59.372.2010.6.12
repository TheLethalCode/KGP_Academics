<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh is set to celebrate the ninth World Day Against Child Labour on Saturday. This year's mantra is 'Prevent risky child labour, ensure child education'. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, on the eve of the day, asked the government institutions, national and international development organisations, labour and owners' organisations, and the people of the country to be sympathetic to working children. Joint secretary Arun Kanti Aich, on behalf of the labour and employment ministry, said this at a press conference at the National Press Club on Friday. Aich said, "The main theme of this year is to stop the risky child labour by 2016." The international day this year is set to be celebrated in Bangladesh with the joint initiatives of women and children affairs ministry, primary and mass education ministry, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the UNICEF, led by the labour and employment ministry. According to the national child labour survey of 2003, conducted by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the total number of children engaged in work in Bangladesh stands around 7.4 million. Among these, 3.2 million are child labourers and more 1.3 million are involved in risky jobs. In reply to a question Aich said that there were many things yet to be done to prevent child labour. The last child labour survey was conducted in 2003 to identify the number of child labourer, fields of engagement and the working environment. The work-plans were obstructed due to lack of updated data. Even the list of risky jobs for children was not identified too, he added. The joint secretary said it was important to formulate a work-plan, containing time frame, resources and duties of organisations to achieve the targets stated in the National Child Labour Prevention Policy 2010. Among others the press conference was also attended by deputy secretary of primary and mass education ministry Md Abul Kashem Bhuiyan, deputy secretary of women and children affairs Namita Haider, child protection expert of UNICEF Youo Osoya and acting director of ILO's Dhaka region Ganan Rajbhandari. bdnews2
