<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The capital market profits will be taxed from the next fiscal but individual investors are exempted. Finance minister AMA Muhith chose to reassure the individual investors first. "I would like to make it clear that income earned by individuals through trading of shares of any listed company shall remain out of the purview of taxation." However, companies will be charged 10 taxes on their income from share trading. Sponsor shareholders or directors are set to pay taxes at a flat rate of five percent on their income. Companies will also have to pay a tax of 3 percent on the premium they secure on share prices. Individual and corporate tax will remain same.
