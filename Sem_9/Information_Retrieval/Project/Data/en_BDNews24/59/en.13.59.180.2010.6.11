 Chandpur, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign minister Dipu Moni has admitted the government's failure in the power sector but claimed successes in other sectors. "We've seen success in some large sectors, but not yet in the power sector People are suffering a lot for the power crisis in these searing hot days," she said at a meeting at Chandpur Sadar Upazila Parishad auditorium on Friday. The minister, however, slammed the previous two governments, particularly one led by the BNP, during which, she said, some Tk 200 billion was embezzled from the power sector but generation was not increased by a single megawatt. Blaming the 2001-6 alliance government for the crisis, she said: "The present government would not have to face such severity of the problem had they worked for increasing power generation." The foreign minister listed the government's efforts to overcome the crisis. Earlier, Moni distributed honorary allowance among the freedom fighters and maternity allowance among the poor mothers. At the Sadar Upazila, 146 freedom fighters were given Tk 1,500 each and 238 poor women Tk 2,100 each for the first six months of the current calendar year. She said the allowance for the freedom fighters is not enough. "But due to various limitations, the freedom fighters cannot be honoured properly." The minister said the governments after 1975 dishonoured the freedom fighters. "The previous (alliance) government put the anti-liberation war people in top positions of the state," she added. Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, accused of war crimes during the war of independence, was a cabinet minister during that government. On the new budget unveiled on Thursday, the foreign minister said the government has given topmost priority to the social safety sector. The budget proposed a 15 percent rise in allocation for allowances of different disadvantaged groups including the disabled, the elderly, poor lactating mothers, widows, and insolvent freedom fighters. As per the proposal, the sector will get Tk 309.57 billion, 23.5 percent of the total budget, she mentioned. Local government officials, Awami League leaders and local government representatives were present among others. bdn
