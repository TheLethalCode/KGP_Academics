 Dhaka June 10 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP, in its immediate reaction on Thursday evening, dismissed the proposed budget as "too ambitious" and slammed the government for giving more to defence than to crucial power and energy. "This budget is full of unrealistic dreams ... devoid of any reality," secretary general Khondoker Delwar Hossain told reporters at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. All 38 MPs of the BNP, its ally Jamaat e Islami and BJP boycotted the budget proceedings. "This government failed to achieve its own targets last year," he said, "and I see no reason why it wouldn't fail again." The former parliamentary chief whip was particularly scathing about "the government's lack of commitment" towards the energy and power sectors. "Our leader proposed to make the power and energy the top priority. The government didn't pay heed to that," he said, referring to Khaleda Zia's budget proposals presented at a Five-Star hotel in the capital three days earlier. "The countrymen have been going through untold sufferings due to the gas and power crisis. The government just doesn't care." The BNP leader alleged that much of the last year's development budget allocation was used to benefit the ruling party supporters rather than for the welfare of the people. "It's all sound and fury ... all rhetoric," he said and added that the party would speak again after reviewing the budget in more detail. The secretary general was flanked, among others, by standing committee members M K Anwar and Abdul Moyeen Khan, joint secretaries general Aman Ullah Aman and Rizvi Ahmed, and organising secretary Fazlul Huq Milon.
