<TITLE> Japan's new PM pledges to build a 'vigorous country' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 8 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Japan's new centre-left Prime Minister Naoto Kan unveiled his cabinet Tuesday and vowed to create a "vigorous country," restore its public finances and mend strained US relations. Kan -- a onetime left-wing activist who takes over as Japan's fifth premier in four years -- was due to be sworn in later by Emperor Akihito along with his cabinet, which he dubbed his "people's militia". The new leader signalled he wants to rebuild US ties damaged by a row over an American airbase that led to the tearful resignation of his predecessor Yukio Hatoyama last week after less than nine months in office. The post-World War II Japan-US security alliance is "the cornerstone" of Tokyo's diplomacy, Kan said days after speaking with President Barack Obama. Hatoyama stepped down after reneging on an election pledge to move the unpopular Futenma airbase off Okinawa island, giving in to Washington's demands but enraging locals and splitting his ruling coalition. Kan said: "About the Futenma issue... Japan and the United States have reached an agreement and we have to work based on that, but I will do my best to ease the burden for the people of Okinawa." On the economic front, Kan said Japan's investment "bubble" had burst 20 years ago and the country now suffers over 30,000 suicides a year, pledging: "I want to rehabilitate Japan drastically and create a vigorous country." With public debt nearly twice the size of gross domestic product, a ratio far worse than that of cash-strapped Greece, he said that "rebuilding financial health is essential for Japan's economy". "We are continuing to gather debt. This problem should be handled as the country's biggest topic. This kind of problem goes beyond party politics." Announcing his new cabinet, the former finance minister chose his deputy, fiscal hawk Yoshihiko Noda, to succeed him as the steward of Asia's biggest economy, which is recovering from recession. In a show of continuity from the previous administration, Kan kept 11 of 17 ministers in their posts, including Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada and Defence Minister Toshimi Kitazawa. One new cabinet face was former model and TV presenter Renho, 42, who uses only one name. Famed for grilling bureaucrats for wasting public funds, she takes over as minister in charge of administrative reform. The new premier, popular for his plain-speaking style, is riding an early wave of support, with approval rates above 60 percent, after pledging to clean house in his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). With just weeks to go until upper house elections, Kan has reshuffled the party leadership to sideline DPJ heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa, dubbed the "Shadow Shogun", whose funding scandals have damaged the party's credibility. Kan is likely to make his international debut at G8 and G20 summit meetings in Canada at the end of the month. He does not intend to visit the Shanghai Expo this weekend as Hatoyama had planned to do, reports said. The new prime minister started his political life as a citizens' activist for environmental, pacifist and feminist causes. He gained kudos when, as health minister in the 1990s, he unveiled government culpability in a scandal over HIV-tainted blood that infected more than 1,000 people with the virus that causes AIDS. Unlike other top DPJ figures, Kan was never a member of the conservative Liberal Democrats, who ruled Japan almost without break for half a century before they were ousted at the polls last August. Newspaper editorials have praised his humble beginnings as the "son of a salaryman" and drawn a contrast with the privileged background of his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, the millionaire-grandson of a prime minister. One company has started selling "Yes We Kan" T-shirts online. Kan, in keeping with Japanese tradition, said he gave his cabinet a nickname -- Kiheitai, or people's militia, a reference to commoners who rose up against Japan's feudal shogun overlords in the mid-1800s. "The Kiheitai was not a military formed by the sons of lords," he said. "The Kiheitai was joined by all kinds of people from outside the samurai class. With the ambition of the Kiheitai, I would like us to put up a daring fig
