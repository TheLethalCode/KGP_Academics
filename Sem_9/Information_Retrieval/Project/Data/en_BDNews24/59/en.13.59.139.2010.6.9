<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) Abul Hashem found himself on the wrong side as he fell victim to the pervading corruption of the judicial system. And he had to learn it the hard way. The farmer from Chandina Upazila's Sakuch village in Comilla spent 17 days in prison in a case of mistaken identity. He was released after a hearing on Wednesday. Comilla police sub-inspector Mohammed Jalal arrested Hashem on May 23 in a case pending with Dhaka's Speedy Trial Tribunal and sent him to Comilla's Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court. He was subsequently sent to Dhaka from Comilla jail to stand trial. The warrant showed that Hashem was arrested in a case filed with the Tejgaon police in February 2002 which was later forwarded to another court. However, Dhaka's Detective and Criminal Intelligence additional deputy police commissioner Md Ruhul Amin said the CMM court's records show that the case was filed by the Anticorruption Commission against a number of Akij Group of Industries officials. It also revealed that there was no mention of any suspect by the name Abul Hashem. Furthermore, Hashem is a poor farmer of Comilla and has no scope of being charged with corruption, he said. On Monday, Md Habibur Rahman, who represented Hashem, appealed to Dhaka's Speedy Trial Tribunal for his release after describing the original incident. After the hearing, judge Rezaul Islam ordered his release and spoke to lawyers, including the public prosecutor. He said that similar incidents had happened before and ordered steps against those responsible. At the hearing, the judge asked Hashem if he had made enemies with any villagers or whether there were any cases against him. Hashem revealed that there was a four-year old civil case regarding his homestead's area with his neighbour Ali Miah at Comilla court. His elder brother Momen was the plaintiff. But Momen died two months ago. In Hashem's release order, the judge mentioned that the arrest warrant, that was included in the case papers sent by Comilla's Senior Judicial Magistrate's Court-5, had a seal of Speedy Trial Tribunal4 on it. However, there was no record of the case in the court's register. The judge also said that a certain quarter fabricated the arrest warrant in the name of the court to harass and torture an innocent man. It was found that the arrest warrant did not have the required sign of a judicial magistrate. The warrant also failed to mention the section of law under which Hashem was accused and a reference number. Md Rafiqul Islam, special public prosecutor of Dhaka's Speedy Trial Tribunal4, told bdnews24.com that the district police superintendent is required to endorse any warrants following the separation of the judiciary from the administration. He also said that the procedure was not followed in this case and that Comilla and Chandina police violated the procedure. Chandina police chief Nurul Afsar Bhuiyan admitted that they had made an error and expressed his sympathy. He said that they did not notice the mistake due to pressure and haste. He also promised support for Hashem saying that he had to spend 17 days in prison for their mistake. Hashem's son told this correspondent that along with the police, their lawyer 'Habibur' was also treating them badly. He has already charged Tk 30,000 as fees and has asked for a further Tk 20,000. b
