<TITLE> Iraq's Sadr threatens to scrap ceasefire </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bagdad, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr threatened on Tuesday to end a truce he imposed on his militia last year, raising the prospect of worsening violence just as top US officials prepare to testify on Iraq in Washington. Sadr urged his Mehdi Army to "continue your jihad and resistance" against US forces, although he did not spell out if this was an explicit call for attacks on American soldiers. His warning came a day after Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki threatened to bar Sadr's movement from political life if the anti-American cleric did not disband his militia. Despite the more than 7-month-old ceasefire, Sadr's followers have clashed with Iraqi troops and US forces in the south of the country and Baghdad in the past two weeks in the country's worst violence since the first half of 2007. "The Iraqi government should know that the Mehdi Army will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi people to provide all they need from security, stability and independence," Sadr said in a statement. "If it is required to lift the freeze (ceasefire) in order to carry out our goals, objectives, doctrines and religious principles and patriotism, we will do that later." The cleric also announced he was postponing a massive anti-US march planned for Wednesday in Baghdad -- the fifth anniversary of the capital's fall to American troops -- for fear his followers would be attacked. "I call those beloved Iraqi people who wish to demonstrate against the occupation to postpone their march, out of my fear for them and my concern to spare their blood," Sadr said. American and Iraqi troops clashed with gunmen in the cleric's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City for a third straight day on Tuesday, part of an upsurge in fighting that is likely to colour two days of testimony to Congress by US ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and top commander, General David Petraeus. Hospital sources in Sadr City said the fighting on Tuesday had killed three people and wounded 52. CEASEFIRE KEY TO REDUCED VIOLENCE Before the eruption of fighting two weeks ago, the Mehdi Army ceasefire had been widely credited with helping sharply reduce violence across Iraq. Any formal scrapping of the truce could trigger widespread fighting with security forces and also plunge Iraq back into a deadly spiral of sectarian violence. The United States has about 158,000 troops in Iraq and plans to pull out five combat brigades, or roughly 20,000 soldiers, by July under plans announced last year. Petraeus is expected to argue in his testimony for a pause in reductions once the initial pullout is completed in July. Crocker told CNN television that a premature withdrawal would lead to violence not seen since the US-led invasion to oust Saddam Hussein in 2003. "As bad as it was in 2006 we were here. If we spiral into conflict again and we're leaving, everybody knows we're not coming back so I think the gloves then come completely off," Crocker said. Renewed violence could spark calls for troops withdrawals and embolden Democrats in the United States, who argue that the year-long "surge", which boosted US troop numbers in Iraq by about 30,000, has failed to yield a lasting peace. Sadr's aides had said on Monday the cleric was ready to disband his militia if Shia religious leaders demanded it. Sadr has a history of pulling back unexpectedly from confrontation and then allowing his militia to show its strength. Maliki ordered a crackdown on the militia two weeks ago in the southern city of Basra, provoking clashes throughout Baghdad and the Shia south. That fighting ebbed just over a week ago when Sadr ordered the militia off the streets, but picked up again on Sunday with clashes around Sadr Ci
