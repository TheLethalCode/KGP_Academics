 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam has hinted that Union Parishad and municipality elections could be held in November. "Our aim is to hold the Union Parishad elections in November. The municipal elections will be held in the same period," Ashraf said Friday. He was attending a post-budget press briefing at the National Economic Council conference centre. Ashraf said the government was moving forward to strengthen the local government. He also criticised the previous caretaker government, which wanted to hold the Union Parishad polls before the ninth parliamentary elections. "They did not have an honest intention. "They issued Upazila, city corporation, municipal and Union Parishad ordinances and annulled the old laws, whereas they did not have the right to do so," Ashraf, who is also the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, said. He said that the present government formulated the laws again. "The local government elections will be held under the new laws. "The Union Parishad elections, the largest body of the local government, will also be held during the winter," he added. Ashraf said that the local government would be strengthened with the allocations. AMA Muhith during his budget speech said that the Upazila and Union Parishads could not work well. He cited long delay in holding polls of the Union Parishads as its main lack. There are more than 4,500 Union Parishads and around 300 municipalities, whose tenure have expired. bdn
