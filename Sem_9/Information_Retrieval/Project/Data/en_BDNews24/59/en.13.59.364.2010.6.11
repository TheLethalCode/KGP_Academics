<TITLE> 6.7% growth tough to achieve: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The 6.7 percent growth projected in the budget of 2011 fiscal year would be a challenging target to achieve for the government, says the Centre for Policy Dialogue. A growth rate target between 6 and 6.5 percent could have been more realistic, the private research firm said at a post-budget press briefing on Friday. Finance minister AMA Muhith rolled out the budget of almost Tk 1321 billion on Thursday for the coming financial year beginning on July 1. "The kind of investment needed for a 6.7 percent growth may be hard to attain," said CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman. According to its budget review, the growth target has been set '"ambitiously" in the context of uncertainties regarding industrial sector, especially power and external demand factors. It said the targeted gross investment and Annual Development Programme for FY1124.6 percent and 4.1 percent of the GDP respectively suggest considerable improvement in private investment rate. "That will much depend on PPP (Public Private Partnership) realisation," added Rahman. The CPD also finds maintaining inflation at 6.5 percent for FY11 will be a tough ask. Touching on revenue earnings, it pointed out that the collection of non-NBR tax and non-tax revenue may suffer some blows in the coming fiscal. Out of the total 910 projects of the Tk 385 billion annual development programme (ADP) for FY11, 222 are carryovers, 213 are to be completed in the coming fiscal, 381 are continuing projects and only 94 are new, reads its budget review. "Without the carryovers, the ADP would have been Tk 295.51 billion," said the CPD official. Health, power and education sectors are carrying over 73, 36 and 33 percent of their allocations respectively. The CPD review says that both the physical and social infrastructure sectors are lagging behind in the ADP. It suggested emphasising on the sectors with higher proportions of carried over projects and projects that are supposed to finish by the next fiscal in a bid to improve the ADP implementation rate and resource utilisation. "The last budget came up with a wide range of reforms to perk up ADP implementation. So far, only amendments of PPA and PPR have been done," Rahman told the media briefing. He warned about disruption in private sector credit flow as the proposed budget for FY11 heavily relies on bank borrowing to cover the budget deficit a 81 percent hike from the revised budget of FY10. The overall budget deficit is expected to be within Tk 393.23 billion, which is five percent of GDP. CPD feels that rate of income tax would have deserved a revise given the increase of annual inflation rate eroding the purchase power of the low and fixed income group. It, however, criticised imposing a three percent tax on the premium value of shares of companies. "Premium value is not income, it comes from the capital," said Rahman adding that it would discourage companies to get listed with the capital market. The research arm lauded the budget's initiatives to work reforms of tax administration, but said that implementation of those would require transparency, accountability, efficiency and motivation "at all levels." CPD points that the government has "managed" to overlook certain promises it made in the previous budget like decentralisation of public policy administration, reforms in rescheduling private sector loans. "There is no mention of the Better Business Forum or the Regulatory Reforms Commission in the budget," added Rahman. On implementing the budget, CPD executive director said that much attention should be given on accountability and transparency. Success of the implementation of the budget proposals and targets will hinge on efficacy of delivery, efficiency of development administration and good governance, reads the CPD budget review
