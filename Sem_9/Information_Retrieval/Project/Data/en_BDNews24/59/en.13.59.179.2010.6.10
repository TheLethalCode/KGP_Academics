 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has asked the National Board of Revenue to explain why the tax evasion case against Arafat Rahman Coco was not unlawful. The bench of justices Ashfaqul Islam and SM Emdadul Haque has issued the order on Wednesday on a writ petition filed by lawyers of Coco, BNP chief Khaleda Zia's younger son. The NBR chairman and the relevant officials have been asked to answer the court in the next week. The NBR filed the tax-dodge case against Coco on Mar 1 last year. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque argued for Coco at the hearing, while the state was represented by attorney general Mahbubey Alam.
