"Some have called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics because of recent problems in Tibet. As I said in London on Sunday, I do not agree," Rudd said in a transcript of a speech delivered to students at Peking University on Wednesday. "I believe the Olympics are important for China's continuing engagement with the world," Rudd said. "Australia, like most other countries, recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet. But we also believe it is necessary to recognise there are significant human rights problems in Tibet." Rudd called for "all parties to avoid violence and find a solution through dialogue," he added. "We wish to see the year 2008 as one of harmony and celebration, not one of conflict and contention," he said. Chinese police have detained a total of 953 suspects for involvement in riots in Tibet last month, the Himalayan region's governor said on Wednesday.
