 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Whilst reiterating the government's commitment to attain food sufficiency by 2012, finance minister AMA Muhith cut the agriculture ministry's budget in real terms. There was a slight increase of only 0.5 percent. In his budget, Muhith said inflation was 8.8 percent last year. The budget allocated to the ministry rose by less than Tk 0.4 billion from Tk 67 billion. In his speech, the minister announced that the level of subsidy given to the sector would be cut by nearly 20 percent from 49.5 billion to Tk 40 billion in the coming fiscal. He also announced plans to decrease the allocation of money for improving irrigation facilities in the southern part of Bangladesh by 32 percent from Tk 4.27 billion to Tk 3 billion. He did however announce an initiative to introduce an 'Agriculture Insurance' scheme to provide small and medium farmers with crop price support in the event of crop failure due to natural disasters. No details were however provided of how this scheme would work or its cost. In addition, Muhith said that the government planned to "keep fertiliser prices within the reach of the farmers"  though again no details were provided of how this would be done. The minister also announced a government programme to distribute organic, green and bio fertilisers to 97 lakh families in the country "to popularise the use of natural fertilisers in kitchen farming with a view to increase agricultural production". He also set out plans to produce and distribute a total of just over 2 lakh tonnes of high yielding seeds to farmers. Storage capacity will also be increased from 40,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes. The government also has plans to adopt schemes to grow hybrid paddy on 12 lakh hectares and salinity resistant paddy on 10 lakh hectares. bdnews
