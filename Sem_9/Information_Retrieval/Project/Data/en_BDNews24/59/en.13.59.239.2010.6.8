<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  A committee has recommended withdrawal of another 411 'politically motivated' cases on Tuesday. Earlier on May 19, the committee recommended withdrawal of some 437 cases. Following the national committee's 19th meeting at the home ministry, the committee chief and law state minister Kamrul Islam told journalists about the recommendation. He also said that five of the 411 cases were filed by the Anti-corruption Commission. A total of 761 cases, including 12 by the Anti-corruption Commission, were tabled at the meeting. Ninety cases were not recommended for withdrawal while another 260 are set to be reviewed in the next meeting, Islam said. The national committee has so far recommended withdrawal of 5,539 cases, including the ones on Tuesday. A total of 8,666 cases have been recommended to the committee. Of the cases, 5,128 are under the penal code and 411 were by the Anti-corruption Commission. State minister for home Shamsul Hoque Tuku, law secretary Anwarul Haque, additional home secretary Iqbal Khan Chowdhury and others attended the meeting. The main opposition BNP has long been alleging that only cases against ruling party activists were being withdrawn and the ones against the opposition activists were not being addressed properly. The Awami League-led coalition government formed the national scrutiny committee on February 2009 aiming to withdraw cases that were filed for political harassment. The committee started recommending cases from its first meeting in June 2009. The committee chief said that they intend to complete all work regarding withdrawal of cases as fast as possible. bdnews2
