 MADRID, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime minister-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on Tuesday pledged spending measures to stop a housing crisis dragging down Spain's economy, during a second term in office already looking tougher than his first. "The strengths of our economy will help to absorb the shock but not cut us off from the turbulence of the world economy," Zapatero, whose Socialist Party won re-election on March 9, told the lower house of parliament. Zapatero is to be sworn in this week. In his first term he presided over a housing and economic boom and won popularity among the young and liberal by legalising gay marriage and reducing the influence of the Catholic Church. With households now owing more than annual income in debt, a current account deficit running at 10 percent of national output and a housing bubble beginning to burst, the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy is threatening to flip from boom to bust. In his speech, Zapatero pledged a 400-euro rebate for tax payers, speedier payment of VAT rebates for businesses and tax breaks to encourage Spain's struggling construction sector to renovate old town centres. He also announced a programme to help building workers find new jobs and a plan to meet unions and business leaders to find ways to boost productivity. The measures, part of a planned 22 billion-euro ($34.70 billion) fiscal stimulus package, were immediately criticised by the opposition conservative Popular Party as failing to deal with the extent of the economic distress. OPPOSITION UNIMPRESSED "Not enough and insufficient," was the reaction of Popular Party parliamentary spokeswoman Soraya Saenz de Santamaria. A debate on Zapatero's speech was due to start later on Tuesday and parliament was expected to vote on whether to swear him in as prime minister on Wednesday. The Socialists, who fell just short of an absolute majority in parliament, have already said that they expect to lose Wednesday's vote but are assured of winning a second round on Friday, when only a simple majority will be required. The Bank of Spain forecasts economic growth will fall to 2.4 percent this year from 3.8 percent in 2007 despite the big increase in government spending which it expects will eliminate by next year a budget surplus that has been running at 2 percent of gross domestic product. The bank also warned of risks to the downside if the global credit crunch persists and as the residential housing sector, which has been accounting for 10 percent of GDP, goes into steep decline. With house prices three times higher than in 1997 despite no major increase in real wages, the International Monetary Fund last week warned that they were overvalued by up to 20 percent. As was the case with their last government, the Socialists will have to rely on support from other parties to pass legislation. Zapatero specifically asked for help from the Popular Party, which opposed him ferociously throughout his last term, especially over his failed attempt to negotiate a peace deal with Basque separatist guerrillas ETA. He is more likely to have to rely on votes from moderate nationalist parties from the Basque Country and Catalonia. Zapatero also pledged to reform Spain's inefficient courts and public administration and continue his liberal social policies by ensuring equal rights for women and minoriti
