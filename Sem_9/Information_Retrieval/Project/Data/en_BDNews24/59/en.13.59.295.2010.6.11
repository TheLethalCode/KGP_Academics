<TITLE> Grieving Mandela misses emotional start to World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Africa's first football World Cup kicked off in Johannesburg on Friday as the hosts played Mexico but a grief-stricken Nelson Mandela stayed away after the tragic death of a great granddaughter. Fans wept as five planes swept over South Africa's Soccer City stadium at the start of a lavish opening ceremony before 1,500 performers piled on to the pitch for a dance routine which saw them create a map of the continent. And after brief turns from some of the biggest names in African music, it was left to South African President Jacob Zuma to declare the tournament open and the Uzbek referee Rashan Irmatov to blow the starting whistle. "The time for Africa has come. It has arrived," Zuma told 85,000 supporters packed into the stadium. "Allow me ladies and gentleman to say I am honoured and privileged to be given an opportunity to declare the 2010 FIFA soccer World Cup open." The crowds had been hoping that Mandela, South Africa's first black president, would be present to inspire the Bafana Bafana national team. But he was instead nursing his grief after the death of his 13-year-old great granddaughter Zenani Mandela. The youngster was killed in a car crash on the way back from an eve of tournament concert which police say was caused by a drunk driver. The 91-year-old Mandela, still the nation's moral inspiration more than a decade after he stood down, did appear on a giant screen with his words interspersed in a song that implored fans to "overcome all adversity". Blasts from ear-splitting vuvuzela horns drowned out the chants of the Mexican fans as the match kicked off. The ground was far from full for the opening ceremony as park and ride buses struggled through traffic jams and train services suffered delays. Ever since it was awarded the tournament six years ago, South Africa has had to fend off accusations that its poor infrastructure and high crime rate meant it could not stage an event of such magnitude. The hosts hope that a successful tournament with world renowned names such as Argentina's Lionel Messi, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and England's Wayne Rooney will overturn perceptions of Africa as the hopeless continent -- a place regarded by many as synonymous with war, famine and AIDS. "The World Cup must make the world see the beautiful landscape, humanity, progress and vibrant spirit that is in this continent," Zuma told visiting heads of state. "They will see that this continent is not about wars and conflict. It is a continent of peoples who love peace, harmony and sustainable development." All the stadiums and World Cup infrastructure projects have been completed on time although crime is still a worry. Journalists have been robbed at gunpoint and thieves have even stolen cash from the rooms of the Greek team. The first of the tournament's 63 matches, between South Africa's Bafana Bafana team and Mexico, followed the opening ceremony at Soccer City, a showpiece arena rebuilt to resemble an African cooking pot, lying just a long kick from Soweto. The once sprawling network of tin shacks -- now home to millionaires and Africa's largest shopping mall -- was the frontline of the battle against apartheid which ended in 1994 with the election of Mandela as president. "I never thought this day would come. The games have started, nothing can stop us now. Bafana Bafana must win," said Martha Shange from Johannesburg, one of the first to enter when the gates opened. After the opening match, Cape Town will later host France and Uruguay. Roads around the stadiums have been declared off limits and bomb squads swept the seats before the gates opened. In a briefing to officers, police commissioner Bheki Cele warned the eyes of the world would be on them. He said 34,000 police would be deployed around the stadium, with 10,000 reservists at other public area
