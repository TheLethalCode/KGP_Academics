 BISHKEK, June 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Kyrgyzstan's interim government declared a state of emergency and slapped a curfew on southern parts of the country Friday after ethnic clashes left at least 23 people dead and over 300 wounded. Interim President Roza Otunbayeva -- whose government has struggled to assert its rule over the ex-Soviet state since taking power amid unrest in April -- backed off earlier statements that authorities had regained control. "The situation remains tense. Similar conflicts occurred in the month of May. Then we were able to bring the situation under control by imposing a state of emergency," she said in a statement. "Now again we are forced to impose a curfew." Witnesses reached in Kyrgyzstan's southern capital Osh by telephone described chaotic scenes, with gunfire ringing out throughout the day and heavily armed helicopters swooping low over the centre of the city. "I can't leave the city. There are no flights, no cars, no public transport whatsoever," Andrea Berg, Central Asia researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch, told AFP by phone from a guest house where she remained trapped. "There is still shooting going on. While I'm talking to you I hear shooting and it's really not far away," she said. Brawls had broken out overnight between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbek groups in the southern city, once the stronghold of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was overthrown in April, witnesses said. Buildings and cars were set alight and shop windows smashed across Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second largest city, as groups of armed men battled in the streets with guns and improvised weapons. "About a thousand youths armed with batons and stones gathered Thursday evening in the centre of Osh," Azamat Ussmanov, a local resident, told AFP. "They broke shop windows and the windows of residential buildings, burned cars. Several fires broke out in the town." The leaders of Russia and China called for calm in Kyrgyzstan as growing unrest there topped talks at a regional security summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in neighbouring Uzbekistan. "We sincerely hope that this phase of internal turmoil is overcome as soon as possible," Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at the meeting of the group led by Russia and China. "China and other neighbours will continue to offer Kyrgyzstan all possible help," Chinese President Hu Jintao said through a Russian translator, calling for "a swift stabilisation of the situation." The United States, which maintains a key airbase outside the capital Bishkek seen as vital to ongoing coalition military operations in Afghanistan, also appealed for stability. "The United States Embassy in Bishkek is deeply saddened about the reports of injuries and loss of life due to violence in Osh. We urge everyone to resolve differences peacefully," the US embassy said in a statement. It added it was "in contact with the government to discuss the importance of a quick return to peace in Osh." The US base at Manas, outside Bishkek in the north, is a key hub for US air refueling tankers and the giant transport planes that ferry US troops and supplies to and from Afghanistan. NATO has increasingly relied on the base as 30,000 additional US forces deploy to Afghanistan. The authorities had sent armoured vehicles to Osh in a bid to restore order, government spokesman Farid Niyazov told AFP. Since last April's uprising, which ousted Bakiyev and left 87 people dead, foreign and international leaders have warned of the danger of civil war in this strategically important country. The latest clashes came just days after the government lifted a state of emergency in the neighbouring district of Suzak. The interim authorities had imposed restrictions there from May 19 to June 1 following violent demonstrations. They also cancelled presidential elections, which had been scheduled for this autum
