<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  City development authority and real estate regulator RAJUK is set to knock down another illegal four-storey building at Begunbari, Tejgaon. The demolition is set to start on Saturday. Shafiqul Islam, officer in charge of RAJUK's Mohakhali zone, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday about their decision. Islam said, "The demolition of the illegally built four-storey building, Ahsan Ulum Hafizia Madrasa and Orphanage, at Middle Begunbari adjacent to Hatirjheel, will start from 10am on Saturday." He also added that some 30 RAJUK workers began demolition of the seven-storey building at around 11am on Monday that was tilting to one side on Friday along with workers employed by the building's owner. Earlier on Monday Shafiqul said that they would start knocking down another five-storey building of East Nakhalpara Samiti Bazar, that had also tilted to one side at around 10am on Thursday. RAJUK's magistrate Rokon-ud-Daula is monitoring the demolition of Begunbari's seven-storey building. Rokon-ud-Daula on Tuesday told bdnews24.com, "The fifth floor has already been demolished. The building owner's men are working along with the RAJUK workers." The building (40/A/7 North Begunbari) was seen to have tilted on Friday scaring residents and local people that there might be an imminent collapse. Following an on-site visit that day, RAJUK threatened to dismantle the building if the owner did not start demolition by Monday. It also hung a demolition notice on Saturday and the building's electricity connection was cut. All the residents of the building had moved out fearing collapse. A total of 25 people died when a five-storey building toppled over and fell on to adjacent shanties on June 1 in the same area. bdnew
