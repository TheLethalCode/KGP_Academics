 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  The mobile phone operators and set vendors are disappointed with the proposed budget for retaining the SIM tax and duty on handsets. Leaders of the Association of Mobile Telecom Operations in Bangladesh (AMTOB) and Mobile Phone Importers' Association (MPIA) said the trend of increasing mobile phone consumers will face a setback. "Now the tax on a SIM is Tk 800. If the government had withdrawn the tax, mobile operators could use the money they are spending in subsidy to enhance the network, better service and introduce new technology," AMTOB president Zakiul Islam told bdnews24.com on Thursday. He asked the government to reconsider the SIM tax. "SIM tax would impact the tele-density. Current tele-density increase is the result of subsidy of the operators." Currently there are six operators in the market. Zakiul said they were providing new connections by paying subsidy for SIM tax. Tele-density will increase fast and more high quality service could be provided if the government withdrew SIM tax and reduce the import duty on the capital equipment of the telecom industry, he observed. If the operators stop paying subsidy, the rate of increased consumers will slow down, he added. MPIA general secretary Faisal Alim told bdnews24.com that the government was asked to set import duty of every handset at a flat Tk 100 instead of the current 12 percent. "Smuggling of handsets will increase because of this. Local currency will be sent abroad through 'hundi' and negative economic activities would increase," he said. He claimed that though the government is talking of building a 'digital Bangladesh', it is not reflected in the decisions. While presenting the budget proposal for 2010-2011 fiscal in the parliament on Thursday, finance minister AMA Muhith said, "Tele-density is growing fast in the country. Now, tele-density has increased to 38 percent. Internet usage has increased to 6 percent of the population." b
