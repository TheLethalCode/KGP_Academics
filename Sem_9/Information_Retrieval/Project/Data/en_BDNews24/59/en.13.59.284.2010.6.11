 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)--The Awami League is observing on Friday the second anniversary of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's release from prison. Two years ago, on this day, the military-backed caretaker government was forced to release Hasina. Awami League's executive committee and presidium members will greet the prime minister at her government residence, Ganabhaban, around 4pm.. Leaders and activists of the party's associate organisation are also to attend the meet. Hasina was arrested from her Dhanmondi residence, Sudha Sadan, on July 16, 2007 on charges of extortion. She was then imprisoned in the special prison facility in the parliament complex. Under pressure, nationally and internationally--and recognising that Hasina's involvement in the planned Dec 29, 2009 elections was crucial--the caretaker government released the Awami League leader after 11 months of imprisonment. bd
