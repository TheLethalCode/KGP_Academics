<TITLE> Brazil's Lula calls UN Iran sanctions a mistake </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRASILIA, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's president said the UN Security Council had lost a "historic opportunity" to negotiate with Iran on its nuclear program by imposing new sanctions on Wednesday. Brazil and Turkey, angry at the West's dismissal of an atomic fuel deal with Iran that they say made new sanctions unnecessary, voted against the fourth round of sanctions imposed by the 15-nation council against Iran. Brazil's government said it was unsure whether the South American country and Turkey would remain involved in talks with Iran to seek a solution to the nuclear standoff. "Sadly, this time it was Iran who wanted to negotiate and those who didn't want to negotiate were those who think that force resolves everything," President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in televised comments. "I think that taking this decision was a mistake." Lula called the UN resolution a false victory that underscored Brazil's longstanding calls to reform the council. "I think the Security Council threw out a historic opportunity to negotiate calmly on Iran's nuclear program," he said. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim told reporters in the capital Brasilia he saw no reason why the fresh round of sanctions would have any impact on the nuclear dispute. "It's more likely that it will have a negative effect," he said. He said he was unsure whether Brazil and Turkey would remain involved in negotiations with Iran, but said he expected Brazil's relations with the United States to remain strong despite the disagreement over the Iran issue. The West suspects Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing the means to build nuclear bombs, but Brazil has argued that sanctions are counterproductive and has tried to use its growing diplomatic weight to mediate in the standoff. Brazil and Turkey helped broker an agreement announced in May under which Tehran agreed to send uranium abroad, reviving a fuel swap plan drafted by the United Nations with the aim of keeping Iran's nuclear activities in check
