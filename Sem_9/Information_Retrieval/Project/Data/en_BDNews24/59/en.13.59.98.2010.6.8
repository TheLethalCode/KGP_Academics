<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) The police have remanded closed newspaper Amar Desh's acting editor Mahmudur Rahman into their custody for eight days to question him. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Ismail Hossain granted four days' remand on two charges, one for sedition and another for publishing posters and publicity material of the banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court's order came in the wake of two separate 10-day remand petitions by the investigation officers of the cases. Airport police sub-inspector Azizur Rahman Sarker, investigating the sedition charges against Mahmudur and 15 other suspects, appealed for 10 days to question him. Detective Branch inspector Nurul Amin, who is on the militancy-related case filed under anti-terrorism law with Uttara police, appealed for 10 days to question Mahmudur. Two others suspects in the case, Tahrir chief Mohiuddin Ahmed and joint coordinator Morshedul Islam have been questioned earlier. Mahmudur was shown arrested in the case because of the information divulged from them. Hearings of both remand petitions were held at the same court. Mahmudur was presented before the court for the hearings that begun around 2pm. The remand petition for the case filed with Uttara police was heard first. Metropolitan public prosecutor Abdullah Abu represented the state, while Mahmudur spoke for himself. Abu said, "Hizb-ut-Tahrir chief coordinator Mohiuddin Ahmed and joint coordinator Morshedul Islam, who were arrested earlier, spoke of Mahmudur's communication with Hizb-ut-Tahrir media and publicity secretary Mostofa Minhaz during questioning." He added the police believed that the militant outfit printed all their leaflets, posters and booklets from the daily's press. "So it is necessary to question the suspect to [find out the truth]." To his defence, Mahmudur said the daily was suffering the government's wrath for criticising the government's policies and functioning. When he published columns and reports demanding compensation from India for the Farakka dam, conspiracy started to close down the publication. None of the witnesses in the case can provide definite proof for the charges against him, Mahmudur claimed. The prosecution, at the remand hearing for the sedition case filed by Airport police chief Abu Saleh Md Shamsuddin, said Mahmudur met with government officials on Nov 24, 2006 at his Uttara office to conspire about rigging the national poll results for the BNP-led four-party coalition. However, their meeting had been disrupted and they had been forced to leave the scene as journalists found out about the meeting. The suspect needed to be questioned intensively to find out the identities of those who had attended the meetings and what they had been plotting about, Abdullah said. The defence said there had been no conspiracies that day. If so, the caretaker government that had arrested the current prime minister and opposition leader would not have let Mahmudur get away. There was no point to remand him in the case filed after such a long time, the court heard. The court allowed both investigators four days each to carefully question Mahmudur. Mahmudur was arrested in the early hours of June 2 in a fraud case filed by Amar Desh publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu. Perceived to be a BNP-leaning newspaper, Amar Desh has been closed and the paper has not been published since June 1. The newspaper was first published in Sept 2004 published by Hashu. Hashmat Ali is the brother of Mosaddek Ali Falu, a close aide of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Falu is now in jail. Mahmudur took over the newspaper in 2008. bdnews2
