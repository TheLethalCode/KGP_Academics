 Brussels, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soaring food prices risk creating an economic and humanitarian "tsunami" in Africa, the European Union executive warned on Tuesday, calling for an international mobilisation to ensure food security there. In a statement after meeting the incoming president of the African Union Commission, Jean Ping, EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Louis Michel said the rise in food prices was less visible than that of oil prices. But it nevertheless has "the potential effect of a real economic and humanitarian tsunami in Africa", Michel said in a statement. Michel said the European Commission planned to boost emergency food aid to Africa in the short term and to push for an "international mobilisation" on food security there. The statement did not elaborate on the planned aid increase. It said funds set aside for agriculture and rural development in EU aid to Africa for 2008-2013 already exceeded 1.2 billion euros ($1.9 billion), compared with 650 million euros in the previous five-year period
