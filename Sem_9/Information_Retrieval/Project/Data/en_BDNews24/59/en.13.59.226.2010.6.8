 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain faces a "formidable" challenge to cut government borrowing and needs more ambitious plans to reduce the deficit over the medium term, ratings agency Fitch said on Tuesday. It said the UK needs to speed up cutting a budget deficit currently running at 11 percent of GDP and said the previous government's plans were starting to look weak compared with austerity measures announced by Spain, Portugal and Italy. "Both the size of the deficit currently projected for 2011 and the failure to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP within five years are striking," Fitch said. The debt crisis in euro zone nations has made investors extremely nervous and the Fitch report, while adding little new to the debate on fiscal policy, triggered a sharp reaction and pushed the pound more than half a cent down against the dollar. "It's not passing judgement on the forthcoming budget, but it is a reminder that we need further austerity measures to bring the public finances onto a sustainable footing," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. The new coalition-led government has already announced 6 billion pounds of spending cuts this year and will unveil further measures in an emergency budget on June 22. Later on Tuesday, Chancellor George Osborne was due to spell out how the government would conduct this year's spending review as it prepares the public sector for big cuts in funding to curb the deficit. DEEPER CUTS NEEDED Fitch recommended that UK government borrowing should be 1 percent lower than projected in the March budget throughout the medium term. Those forecasts envisaged a reduction in the budget deficit to 8.5 percent in 2011/12, falling to 5.2 percent of GDP by 2013/14. The extra cuts would help restore "fiscal space," or a cushion against further economic shocks, Fitch said, but it seemed to suggest this may not be attainable only by cutting spending. "Achieving such a path purely on the basis of further spending cuts would imply unprecedented real declines in primary spending," it noted. The government said it agreed that more needed to be done to tackle borrowing. "Fitch's report makes the case clearly for an acceleration of deficit reduction, particularly in light of events in the euro area sovereign debt market in recent months," a Treasury spokesman said. The new administration has said it aims to achieve a significant reduction in the structural deficit over the course of a five-year parliamentary term with 80 percent of the reduction being achieved by spending cuts and 20 percent by tax hikes. That compares with the previous Labour government's plans for two-thirds spending cuts and one-third of tax measures. But the government has also slammed Labour's growth forecasts for the coming years as overly optimistic and they are likely to be revised down at the budget, which is likely to mean the deficit will be higher. Fitch noted that plans to reduce the tax burden on businesses would also have an impact. Moreover, it was not clear whether the government aimed to start cutting the structural deficit earlier or whether it was aiming for a bigger adjustment over the medium term. "The net result of this could be a broadly similar medium-term path for the actual deficit, albeit one that could be more credible," Fitch said. "Nevertheless ... it would be surprising if the medium-term deficit path was not revised downwa
