 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) The parliament on Wednesday passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill-2010, which is expected to rectify the discrepancies in collecting transfer fees of non-farming land in the rural and urban areas. The bill was placed for passage by finance minister AMA Muhith. As per the bill, which amended the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984, residents irrespective of locations will have to pay one percent of the total value of the non-farming land as transfer fee. Earlier, residents in semi-urban and rural areas outside the city corporations, municipalities and cantonments were exempted from paying the one percent transfer fee for same type of land costing up to Tk 100,000. But the people in the urban areas had to pay the transfer fee. The parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry, however, recommended that the fee should be at least four percent in the rural areas and five percent in urban areas. But the finance minister did not accept the proposal. Muhith on June 2 tabled the bill in the parliament and it went to the standing committee for its opinion. Parliament also passed the "Stamp (Amendment) Bill-2010" and a bill on appointment of non-cadre officers to the National Board of Revenue. b
