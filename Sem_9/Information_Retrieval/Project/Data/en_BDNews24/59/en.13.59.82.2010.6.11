<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11(bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh chapter of Transparency International expressed its concern over the scope of legalise 'black money' proposed in the budget for the next fiscal year. "It will encourage corruption in a massive way," said Iftekharuzzaman, the executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), on Friday. Finance minister AMA Muhith in his budget speech on Thursday proposed that anyone could invest undisclosed money in bonds issued by Infrastructure Finance Fund by paying 10 percent tax. Undisclosed money is widely referred to as black money. The Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog's local office considers the budget 'over ambitious'. The huge investment proposed in electricity, gas, defence and river dredging will become impossible to make if the government fails to handle it with honesty and transparency, it said. The TIB also expressed its concern over the move to amend the anticorruption law and said it would make the Anticorruption Commission less effective. The minister in his budget speech said the cabinet approved a number of amendments to the anticorruption law to ensure effective prevention of corruption. bdnews
