<TITLE> Most youths 'happy, but want life abroad' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  An overwhelming nine out of ten young people in Bangladesh are either "happy or very happy", though almost half want to live outside the country, according to a wide-ranging survey of youth conducted by the British Council. The survey, whose results many will find both surprising and contradictory, also found that three quarters of young people in Bangladesh have no interest in politics, with just one percent being a member of a political party. "Today Bangladesh needs a national debate on how we utilise the social and human resources at our disposal," says Charles Nuttall, the director of the British Council in Bangladesh. The age category interviewed in this survey represents about a third of the total population, close to 50 million people. "Our proposal is that this debate should result in a youth charter which embodies the hopes, aspirations and rights of all young people  and maps out a path to how they will be realised," he adds in a preface to the survey. Published on Saturday in a report, "Bangladesh: The Next Generation", the survey involved hour-long interviews with 2,167 males and females aged between 15 and 30, which the British council claims was representative of the demographics of young people in Bangladesh. "Sampling techniques were used to ensure all seven administrative divisions were included: two districts from each of these were then selected, and a rural and urban area from each of these sampled", the report says. The sample of young people interviewed was, according to the report, also representative of the different occupation categories used by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics  with students representing a third of the total sample size. The survey found that young people had an overall positive view of the country's progress  with 79 percent believing that it is "heading in the right direction". However, 60 percent of the interviewees said that they felt that corruption "will definitely or may get worse in the next five years," and a third feeling that corruption will "definitely" increase. They also ranked bribery as the second most important factor, next to education, in securing a job with 12 percent believing it to be the "major factor." These factors may explain that although 88 percent defined themselves as happy or very happy, 42 percent wanted to live abroad. On student politics, the survey found that only 15 percent thought that "student politics are a good thing" with 36 percent of those questioned saying that "student politics have a detrimental effect on educational institutions." At the same time, 30 percent of the young people thought that they should get involved in politics. The survey found that there was a high sense of social responsibility amongst young people. As many as 98 percent believed that "they should be involved in social work", with 95 percent saying that they were "willing and able to address local and community issues". However, only six percent could actually identify a youth-based or youth-run organisation or movement, and only six percent of young people in rural areas actually participated in community work. The significance of mobile phones in the life of young people is reinforced in the report, with 73 percent owning a mobile phone. However, if this survey is to be believed, the government's 'Digital Bangladesh Within 2021' vision still has a long way to go as only 15 percent of the interviewees said they "use the internet"
