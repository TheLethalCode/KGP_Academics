<TITLE> Panama calls presidential vote for May 3 next year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PANAMA CITY, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Panama will hold a presidential election on May 3 next year, the electoral commission said on Tuesday, with the vote likely to pit a former housing minister against a supermarket mogul. Balbina Herrera, who is leading in polls, resigned on Monday as housing minister to focus on her campaign for the nomination of the ruling center-left Revolutionary Democratic Party, or PRD. Panama City's charismatic mayor, Juan Carlos Navarro, is also in the running for the PRD nomination. One of them is expected to face the leading opposition candidate, supermarket entrepreneur Ricardo Martinelli, who heads the Democratic Change Party. A constitutional limit of one term at a time means President Martin Torrijos cannot seek re-election in 2009. He could run again once the next president's five-year term ends. Since he was elected in 2004, Torrijos has become known as an economic reformer, last year winning a referendum to expand the Panama canal and overseeing record levels of economic growth. Last year, the economy expanded more than 11 percent.
