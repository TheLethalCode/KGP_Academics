 Chittagong,June 8 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has defended 'mesbaan'-- a custom of treating guests to a feast-- saying it was his family tradition. The Awami League-backed mayoral candidate seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure appeared to be replying to an election commissioner who had urged candidates to refrain from 'mesbaan', which the commissioner claimed breached electoral code. Mohiuddin said the traditional feast of Chittagong had long been a part of his family tradition even before he was mayor. Mentioning that hospitality was part of his upbringing, he said, "I have learnt to be generous and warm with guests. And I have been taught to always make sure that as a host I look after my guests" "Or it would be a bad omen." Earlier in the day, commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain had said, "We have information that mesbaans are being held with cows slaughtered at some mayoral candidate's home or in the clubs." However, he did not name any names at a meeting with some of the candidates for the June 17 city corporation elections, civil society representatives and journalists at the Chittagong Circuit House. Mohiuddin said during his day's campaign that he wanted to set an example for compliance with the electoral laws and code of conduct. "I wholeheartedly believe in the electoral code of conduct declared by the Election Commission." "I will extend the maximum cooperation to uphold the democratic trend in the upcoming city corporation elections," he told reporters at Citizen Committee's office on Tuesday. He also praised the EC's steps to pre-empt attempts to rig ballots. Responding to a question from journalists, he said, "I am against sticking posters or writing graffiti. I have always tried to keep the city neat and clean during my tenure in office." He alleged that some "quarters" were tearing off his campaign posters at night at different parts of the city. He also alleged that some "quarters" were printing coloured posters with his picture as part of a conspiracy against him and demanded probe into the matter. Mohiuddin also said he had lodged a complaint with the EC. bdnews2
