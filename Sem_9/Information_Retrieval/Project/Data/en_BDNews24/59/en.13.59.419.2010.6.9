 Chittagong, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is yet to respond to a request for changing four polling centres ahead of the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls. The letter was sent to the EC a few days back but there has been no feedback, assistant returning officer Farhad Hossain said. Farhad told bdnews24.com that as per Local Government (city corporation) Election Law 7(5), no institutions run and controlled by the mayor or councillor candidates can be used as polling centres. A letter signed by chief returning officer Jasmin Tuli was sent to the EC asking to shift four polling centres in five educational institutions. The centres are Mostafa Hakim KG High School, Joynab Ara Primary School, South Jharnapara non-government school, Shah Amanat Ideal School and College and Notun Kuri Ideal School and College. Farhad also said they have learnt that the institutions are controlled and run by CCC polls candidates. bdn
