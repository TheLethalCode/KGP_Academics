 Savar, April 8 (bdnews24.com)Workers Tuesday ransacked a factory in the Dhaka Export Processing Zone and clashed with security officials, leaving at least 50 people injured, police and witnesses said. The trouble started in the canteen of Expiance Clothing Company after workers found that the food served for lunch was unsatisfactory. As the security officials approached to take the situation under control the workers clashed with them. About 3,000 workers were involved in the violence, police said. Ashulia Police Station sub-inspector Abdul Alim told bdnews24.com from the scene that even police could not escape the wrath of the angry workers. Quoting the factory officials, BEPZA general manager SM Abdur Rashid said the chaos began when the workers went to take their food, but found the pieces of meat small. "They became agitated and started ransacking," he said adding that they would find out whether there was any other cause behind the incident. The company's merchandising officer Shahadat Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "It cannot be imagined that the workers would cause such huge damage over such a trifling matter. "They entered the factory with iron rods and brickbats and ransacked the ground-to-fourth floors. They vandalised furniture, machines, doors and window panes. Clothes worth lakhs of taka have been destroyed. They have also broken my computer." He said, "Detectives, police, BEPZA authorities and insurance companies are determining the extent of the damage." No case was filed immediately. Security had been beefed up in the area to avert any further violence, he said. No arrest was made during the violence. Some workers of the factory said that the factory authorities had long been depriving them of transport facility and even did not pay annual bonus properly. Owner of Expiance Clothing Company is a Pakistani citizen. His name is Miah Maksud Ahmed. bdnews24.c
