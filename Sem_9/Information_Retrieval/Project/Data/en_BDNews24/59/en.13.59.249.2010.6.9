 Chittagong, June 9 (bdnews24.com)--A senior opposition leader has alleged that the government is making sure its mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury win the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation elections. "The government is plotting to make him win to save him from 14 corruption cases," BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP told reporters at his Goods Hill house in the port city on Wednesday. "Around 55,000 dubious names are there without photographs in the voter roll. They have been kept reserved for the pro-government candidate's ballot boxes." Mohiuddin is vying for the mayor post from the pro-government Citizen Committee and M Manzur Alam from pro-BNP Chittagong Development Movement. Salahuddin claimed that Awami League men had already come to the city to cast the fake votes for Mohiuddin. "Anybody found without identity cards will be resisted," he announced. He alleged that the policemen transferred are still carrying out their duty in Chittagong. "Their transfer will be effective after the government implements its conspiracy with their help." The BNP leader said the caretaker government prolonged its tenure for two years on the plea of making photo-based voter identity cards. The Awami League government also announced that they would not allow anybody to cast votes without photo IDs, "but now they have gone back on their word," the leader alleged. Asked if BNP will lodge complaint with the Election Commission, he said: "With whom shall we lodge the complaint? They are our employees. They get salaries because we pay taxes." The Chittagong BNP leader claimed a conspiracy was on to scare activists of the pro-BNP candidate off the electoral scene by launching a drive to arrest criminals. "Everyone knows who are entertaining guests at Mesbaan feasts every day ahead of the election eve. But no steps are being taken against them," he said referring to Mohiuddin treating guests to traditional feasts. bdne
