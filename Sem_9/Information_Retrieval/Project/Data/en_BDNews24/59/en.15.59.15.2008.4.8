 MUNICH, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German police raided scores of offices on Tuesday in a probe into a group suspected of financial irregularities estimated at millions of euros (dollars), and drug abuse. The prosecutor's office in the town of Ravensburg said a police searched some 100 offices at 35 different locations in southern Germany, including the southwestern Allgaeu region and the greater Munich area. A number of people were detained during the raids. Prosecutors said the investigation into alleged financial wrongdoing was focusing on a group of people centred around the 54-year-old operator of an agricultural estate in Allgaeu. Investigators suspect the group's leader of pretending to employ workers on the estate, only for these people to return their wages to him. Following this, several million euros were transferred to foreign bank accounts, they added. "Many of the fictitious employees and those involved belong to a community on the 54-year-old's farm. He is believed to have controlled and exerted a massive influence on them," they said. The community is also suspected of buying and consuming drugs. Authorities detained an unspecified number of people, and an arrest warrant has been issued for the group's leader. A spokesman for prosecutors said the investigation had no connection to a large-scale probe by German authorities into suspected tax evasion by its citizens in Liechtenste
