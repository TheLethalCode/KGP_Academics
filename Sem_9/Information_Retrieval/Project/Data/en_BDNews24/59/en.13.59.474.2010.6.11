<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Lawyers for Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman have threatened to sue the magistrate and police officers for 'not going by the court directives regarding his remand'. Nasir Uddin Ahmed Asim and Sanaullah Miah alleged at a press conference on Friday afternoon that Mahmudur was being tortured in remand. They said they will file contempt of court petition if the High Court orders were continued to be disregarded. Asim said the High Court bench of justices Tariqul Hakim and Soumendra Sarker on Thursday asked the authorities to follow an Appellate Division verdict of 2003. The directives came after a petition by Mahmudur, currently facing several charges and remand for interrogation. The 2003 verdict had given a number of directives, including medical exams before and after interrogating anybody, approval of remand by the metropolitan sessions judge, not torturing the person in remand, not quizzing by anyone other than the investigating officer, presence of a lawyer during remand and presenting the suspect before a magistrate between two remands. Asim alleged that police were not following any of the directives. He said: "He [Mahmudur] was grilled at Cantonment Police Station instead of Tejgaon Police Station by persons other than the investigation officer." Mahmudur was taken to the Cantonment Police Station for torture, he added. "It would be contempt of court if Mahmudur's medical check-up is not done after presenting him before the court on Sunday." Miah alleged that Mahmudur was being subject to inhuman behaviour. "We found him lying with a book under his head when we visited him at the court's jail on Thursday. "He had no bed, no chair or table that he was supposed to be provided with," he said. Miah said, on the first day after his arrest early on June 2 Mahmudur had been kept in jail with alcoholics, drug addicts and killers. "He was tortured in a secret place the way politicians and businessmen were after 1/11," he added. Another counsel Masud Ahmed Tallukder was also present at the press conference. bdnews
