 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Angry locals at South Keraniganj blocked the Dhaka-Mawa highway for missing the inaugural match of the World Cup finals Friday evening. Traffic came to halt at 8pm due to the barricade, locals said. One 'Jabbar' told bdnews24.com that the area was facing blackouts since evening. And electricity had not returned even after the match got underway, which he said made the locals take to the streets. Sub-inspector Nurul Islam Mallick of Keraniganj Upazila traffic department said traffic movement was restored at 8:45pm as power supply resumed. One Babul, however, denied this, saying that power connection was cut off again after two minutes and that the blockade continued. Reports from a number of other places around the country mentioned similar incidents with locals laying siege to highways. bdnews24.c
