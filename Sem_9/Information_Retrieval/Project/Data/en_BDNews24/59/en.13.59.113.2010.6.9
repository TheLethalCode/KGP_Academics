 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)--Doctors who have passed written and oral examinations of the 28th Bangladesh Civil Service for the health cadre are taking to the streets on Thursday demanding cancellation of 'quotas' and their immediate appointment. They sought intervention of the prime minister in resolving the "quota problem" in government jobs. At a press conference at the National Press Club on Wednesday, Shah Md Zakir Hossain, a successful examinee, said they would submit memorandums to the prime minister and the health minister. They will also form a human chain in front of the Press Club on Thursday to press home their demand. He said about 480 doctors qualifying for heath cadre services are not getting appointment because of the quota system even though over 1550 posts are vacant. He said 724 doctors from the 28th BCS exams are being appointed to government hospitals and other health centres on an ad-hoc basis on recommendation of the health ministry. b
