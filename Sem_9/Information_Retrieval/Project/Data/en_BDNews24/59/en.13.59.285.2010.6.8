 Chittagong, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Former state minister Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin, on Tuesday campaigned in support of BNP-backed mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam ahead of the June 17 city corporation election. Also former president of Chittagong city BNP, Mir Nasir sought BNP nomination as Chittagong's mayoral candidate in this election but was rejected. He had run for the mayor's office in the last elections against the Awami League-backed candidate Mohiuddin Chowdhury, but lost. Mir Nasir lost the last city corporation election on May 9 in 2005. He lost by almost one lakh votes against Mohiuddin, who is seeking unprecedented fourth tenure as mayor backed by the ruling government. An advisor to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Mir Nasir announced to work for Manzur, the mayoral candidate from Chittagong Development Movement, after a meeting at his Chatteshwari house on Tuesday evening. Mir Nasir speaking at the meeting, "Manzur Alam will be elected mayor because he will change the people's lot but not his own." Nasir's comments referred to Mohiuddin allegedly turning the Chittagong City Corporation into a business entity for his personal gains. Nasir certified that Manzur was an honest and self-sufficient person. "He has no need of wealth." Nasir urged everyone to elect Manzur in light of the lessons from their previous mistakes. He also added that Mohiuddin had become frightened. "He will not be given any opportunity of vote ragging." Chaired by BNP's Chittagong joint secretary Arshad Ullah, Manzur Alam said he had nothing to gain. "I only want to serve the city dwellers." Manzur requested the people to elect him mayor in favour of change and give him the opportunity to serve them. Earlier in the morning, Manzur campaigned at ward 24 of the city with central BNP vice president Abdullah Al Noman. bdnew
