 Johnnesburg, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Germany have a strong chance of playing in the World Cup final despite a string of injuries which eliminated several top players, former winner Franz Beckenbauer said on Tuesday. Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup with West Germany as both a player and coach, said that while he was disappointed that captain Michael Ballack would not play, the tournament should be an opportunity for other players to shine. "I saw them playing recently against Hungary and Bosnia, very impressive. You know the Germans, the spirit, they always fight till the last minute ...

Beckenbauer said the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira would make the team strong after making a seamless transition from supporting actors under Ballack to playing leading roles. "Schweinsteiger and Khedira fit well together and I believe they will play a decisive role," he said. Germany play Australia in their first Group D match on June 13, before facing Serbia on June 18 and Ghana on June 23. Brazil and Spain are Beckenbauer's other favourites for the trophy this year. "You always have to count on Brazil because of their abilities, their qualities, their skills ... Spain at the moment is playing the most spectacular, organised football in Europe," he said. Beckenbauer said he hoped at least one of the six African teams would make it to the semi-finals, but hosts South Africa would have a tough challenge against Mexico in the opening game on Fri
