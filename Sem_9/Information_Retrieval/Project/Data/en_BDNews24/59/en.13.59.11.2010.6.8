 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)--Ministers do not keep their word, a ruling Awami League MP alleged on Tuesday and sought the speaker's help to get them live up to their promises. "When we raise a point during the question-answer session, the ministers make different promises. But they do not fulfil those even in a year," Abdul Mannan told deputy speaker Shawkat Ali in the parliament. Mannan, the MP from Bogra-1 constituency, said: "So we get embarrassed in our constituencies. So, can we seek your assistance if the works remain incomplete?" The MPs of the ruling party thumped the tables in his support. The deputy speaker told Mannan that MPs could inform the government's committee on public assurances if any minister did not keep his word. bdne
