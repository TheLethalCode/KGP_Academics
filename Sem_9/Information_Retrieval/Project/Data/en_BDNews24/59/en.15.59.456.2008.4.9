 HONG KONG, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks were flat and the dollar stayed weak on Wednesday as worries resurfaced about the US economy and a global financial crisis, but some shares gained on reports of potential deals such as Chinese interest in a stake in BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company. A week-long rally in Asian shares is seen under threat by some analysts, after US savings and loans firm Washington Mutual Inc warned on Tuesday of a large quarterly loss, while Federal Reserve minutes revived fears of a recession in the US economy. The dollar remained weak on concerns about the US economy, slightly pushing up oil and gold prices given that a falling US currency makes the commodities more attractively priced for buyers in other currencies. "This has been a bit of a reality check, with recent gains based entirely on hopes that the worst of the subprime crisis was over," said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments in Japan. The MSCI measure of Asian stocks outside Japan was up 0.7 percent by 0220 GMT. Asian shares had staged a promising start to the second quarter, with the MSCI index hitting a one-month high on Monday, though few see an end to the uncertainty about a U.S.-led slowdown in the global economy and the financial crisis that triggered steep losses in January-March. Those concerns were reinforced on Wednesday following Washington Mutual's quarterly loss warning and after minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting showed concerns about a nasty slide in the US economy at a time of rising inflation. and Japan's Nikkei average was flat, but JFE Holdings Inc rose after the steelmaker announced late on Tuesday it would join a blast furnace joint venture between South Korea's Dongkuk Steel and Brazil's Vale Australia's main index fell 0.4 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd jumped 4.5 percent after The Australian newspaper reported that China was planning to buy a more than 9 percent stake in the world's top miner. But BHP's gains were offset by weaker financial firms, with data on Wednesday showing Australian consumer sentiment has slipped to its lowest in 15 years, providing further evidence the economy is cooling. Shanghai's main index fell 1.1 percent, but shares in Taiwan gained 0.6 percent. Singapore and Hong Kong stocks were flat, and South Korean markets were closed for a general election. DOLLAR WEAK The dollar remained weak against the yen and euro, despite an early morning boost triggered by news that Citigroup Inc was close to a sale of leveraged loans to a group of private equity firms. The dollar had rebounded recently on the easing worries in global markets, though it remains significantly down against other currencies for the year. The US currency was trading at 102.62 to the yen, little changed from late US trade, although it had risen as high as 102.84 early in the session. The euro fetched $1.5723, also little changed from late in New York. The weakening US currency helped provide some gains to oil prices, with investors also betting that US government data will show another fall in gasoline stocks ahead of the coming driving season. US crude futures for May delivery gained 34 cents to $108.84 a barrel. Gold edged higher, trading at $913.90/914.70 an ounce. Prices of bullion had dropped more than 1 percent on Tuesday as investors booked profits from recent highs
