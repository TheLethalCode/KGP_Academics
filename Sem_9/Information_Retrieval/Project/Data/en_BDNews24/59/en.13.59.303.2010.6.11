 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)A mother and her two children were found dead on Friday at their home in Alambagh in Dhaka in a suspected case of suicide. The police believe Farzana Kabir Rita, 35, son Pavel, 13, and daughter Payel, 12, might have poisoned themselves to death over a family conflict. Kadamtali police chief Kazi Aiubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the house maid called in neighbours when she had got no response knocking on the door of their room. He said the neighbours informed the police after they broke down the door and saw the bodies. The police went to the scene and recovered the bodies from the bedroom of the first floor of the three- storey building at 229, Alambagh around 10am. Rita, before her death, had written various accusations and complaints on the walls regarding the conflict in her family. The police also recovered a chit signed by Rita that says that she had no objection to her husband's second marriage. The police official also said that Rita's husband remarried and stayed at another place with his second wife. "The cause for the deaths will be clear after the autopsy," the police officer added. bdnews
