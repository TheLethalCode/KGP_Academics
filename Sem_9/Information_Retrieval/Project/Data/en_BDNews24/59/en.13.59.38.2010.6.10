<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Thursday disposed of the plea to cancel Mahmudur Rahman's remand. The bench of justices Tariq ul Hakim and Soumendra Sarker asked the authorities to follow instructions of an Appellate Division verdict of 2003. The directives came following a petition by the closed newspaper Amar Desh's acting editor Mahmudur, currently facing several charges and in remand for interrogation. The police in the early hours of June 2 closed the BNP-leaning daily. They stormed the newspaper office and arrested Mahmudur on fraud charges brought by its publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu. Earlier the government closed Amar Desh and sealed off its press. Thursday's verdict reiterates the 2003 ruling that gives a number of directives including presence of a lawyer during remand, no torture, and medical exam before and after interrogation. Abdur Razzaque argued for Mahmudur, while attorney general Mahbubey Alam stood in for the prosecution. bdn
