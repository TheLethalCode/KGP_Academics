 Dhaka, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered five reporters of the recently shut down Bengali daily Amar Desh to surrender to the lower court within eight weeks, ordering the government and the police not to arrest or harass them in the meantime. The bench of justices Md Abdul Wahab Mia and JBM Hasan gave the order on Tuesday in response to a bail petition earlier that day by the newspaper's deputy editor Syed Abdal Ahmed, special correspondent Jahed Chowdhury, assistant editor Sanjeeb Chowdhury and staff reporters Alauddin Arif and Sayeed Islam. Deputy attorney general Bhismadeb Chakrabarty, counsel for the government, told bdnews24.com, "The court did not grant their bail petition, rather ordered them to surrender." "It, however, said the lower court could consider the petition after their surrender," he added. Tejgaon police filed the case on June 2 accusing more than a hundred Amar Desh staff of obstructing police duty during the arrest of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman. bdne
