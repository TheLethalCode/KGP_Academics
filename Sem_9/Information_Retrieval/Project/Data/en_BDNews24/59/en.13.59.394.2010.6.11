 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)More money will be spent than ever before to steer Bangladesh out of the debilitating power crisis, and defence will see a significant rise in allocation as the 78-year-old finance minister unveils a $19 billion budget. Twenty minutes into the speech, a frail finance minister took permission from the Speaker to sit down and read out the rest of his speech, much of it illustrated for the first time digitally on large screens hung inside the House shunned by the opposition. Power and energy sectors will receive Tk 61.15 billion in direct government spending. "The allocation," A M A Muhith boasted, "is 61.5 percent higher than the revised budget of the current fiscal year." However most of the increasewhich is a staggering 87.78 percent for the Power Division alonewould be spent on buying power from rental power plants. Defence services, with a 50 percent hike in allocation in just two years, will get over Tk 90.24 billion. The figure was Tk 61.24 billion two fiscals earlier. In the year ending this month, the services would end up getting an extra Tk 8 billion from what had been originally given. Agriculture or health or rural development will not get as much as the three services. However, the high levels of subsidy for agriculture will stay; Tk 40.00 billion is earmarked for the coming year-- up from the last year's original sum of Tk 36 billion. The revised 2009-10 figures however put the farm subsidy at a staggering Tk 49.50 billion. The social sectors will see large increases in their outlays with primary and mass education getting Tk 68.48 billion, a rise of 17.88 percent over the current allocation. The health sector will also see a jump of almost 19 percent to Tk 58.52 billion with plans to increase health infrastructure and hiring more health workers. Other sectors also billed to get high allocations for infrastructure include education, local government and rural development, and communications. Allocations for infrastructure development also includes mega projects like the second submarine internet cable, elevated expressway and other projects aimed at regional connectivity. Overall education allocation has risen by 13.5 percent to about Tk 18.96 billion. Social safety net and poverty alleviation programmes will see a 15 percent rise with large allocations for allowances to different disadvantaged groups including the disabled, poor lactating mothers, widowed, the elderly and insolvent freedom fighters. However, the much lauded employment generation scheme saw a 15 percent fall in allocation with Tk 10 billion. There has been substantial change in the government's plan for revenue collection with the income tax and corporate tax structures remaining mostly unchanged and making up for just about 70 percent of outlay. The finance minister did however mention widening the tax net without changing the rates, which was also what the opposition had demanded just a couple of days ago. Domestic borrowing, mostly from banks and foreign finance, are expected each to contribute about 12 percent of the outlay while the remaining 6 percent will be financed through government bonds. As for taxes, there appears a clear, and decidedly progressive, bias towards taxing the richer people as prices of many consumer goods and luxury items, particularly cars, cigarettes, imported refrigerators and freezers will become pricier. Apartments are set to become more expensive too as the finance minister proposed tax at source that realtors would have to pay at the time of constructing buildings or apartments based on square footage. Curiously, the only small bracket of cars that will see a fall in taxes are those between 1501cc and 1650cc where the supplementary duty of 100 percent goes down to just 45 percent. Two expenditure heads remained almost as they were proposed the last time around, because the government was unable to make much headway in either of the cases  public-private partnership and climate change adaptation funds. Another interesting change in this budget is the head of 'Miscellaneous Expenditure' which increased more than 2.5 times to receive 8.2 percent of the total outlay. Together with education and information technology, and health, the social sectors were allocated almost a fifth of the entire outla
