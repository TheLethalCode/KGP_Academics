<TITLE> S Korea votes for MPs, conservatives seek majority </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Koreans voted on Wednesday for a new parliament, widely expected to give conservatives the majority that new President Lee Myung-bak needs to push through sweeping reforms to boost the economy. Opinion polls suggested Lee's Grand National Party (GNP) will win at least 160 seats in the 299-seat assembly, with the left-of-centre United Democratic Party lucky to muster 100. If all goes as predicted, the conservatives would win an outright majority in a parliamentary election for the first time in more than 20 years. Lee, who took office in February, has pledged to boost economic growth this year to 6 percent from 5 percent last year, cut the red tape stifling business and make the economy more open and competitive. "I believe the opinion of the people will be well reflected in this election, which will help our nation's development," Lee told reporters at a voting station. Communist North Korea has turned up the heat, and on the eve of the election, branded Lee a traitor, saying his demands for the impoverished state to change its ways were pushing the Korean peninsula back to war. But voters, accustomed to years of anti-South rhetoric, appear to have ignored the latest barbs from its irritable neighbour in a campaign that has been largely devoid of debate on any serious issue. A National Election Commission poll showed turnout could be the lowest in the country's 20-year history of democratic elections with just half the electorate bothering to vote. Turnout halfway through the 12 hours of voting was at 23.8 percent, down from 31.5 percent at the same time in the last parliamentary election four years ago, the commission said. Polls close at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT). To lure voters to the polling booths, the commission has been running an advertising campaign featuring a popular song-and-dance group of teenage girls, and offering discounts to museums and parks. But the once-predicted victory of two-thirds of the parliamentary seats, enough to change the constitution, looks unlikely. Lee has seen his initial high support slip as his government stumbled out of the blocks and bungled personnel appointments. The damage from a global downturn began to look far more serious for South Korea just as he took office, with some analysts calling his economic growth target far too optimistic. Some analysts said party infighting in the run-up to the election could make the GNP, even with a majority in the new National Assembly from late-May, tricky for Lee to manage and harder to ensure his policy changes are turned into law
