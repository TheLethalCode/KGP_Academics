<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com)Treasury bench MPs on Tuesday termed Khaleda Zia's budget proposal a violation of the constitution and a demonstration of her disrespect to the parliament. In an unscheduled discussion, they questioned whether the BNP was an "opposition in the House" or the "opposition in the street". Mohiuddin Khan Badal of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, an ally of the ruling Awami League, first raised the legality of BNP chairperson's alternative budget proposal unveiled at Sheraton Hotel on Monday. "This sort of budget proposal outside the parliament is unconstitutional," Suranjit Sengupta, a senior Awami League MP said. "They (the BNP) should decide whether they are the opposition in the House or the opposition in the street. If they are opposition in the House, they cannot do it," said Sengupta. Seeking a ruling from the chair on the issue, he said the leader of the opposition should come to the parliament to present such a proposal. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was presiding over the session in absence of the BNP, however, did not give any ruling on the issue. Badal in his speech said, "The opposition has been repeatedly violating the Rules of Procedure. "She is the only leader of the opposition who does not turn up at the parliament. She should come to the parliament for making such a proposal," he said. "This is contempt of parliament," he said. "How can she talk on imposition of tax on items before the finance minister presents the national budget? "Is she an angel," said Fazle Rabbi Mian, an Awami League MP from Gaibandha. Khaleda had set a bad example in Bangladesh's parliamentary democratic history, said Awami League presidium member Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. "(General) Ziaur Rahman presented national budget in presence of the civil society and the journalists bypassing the parliament. "Her (Khaleda Zia) budget proposal is a legacy of the practice," said Alamgir. bd
