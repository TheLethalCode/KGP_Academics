 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)--The proposed budget will test the government's capacity to execute the even larger annual development outlay, analysts say. Otherwise, the proposed budget offers nothing new, according to former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan "It's simply the continuation of the current fiscal year's budget. Some programmes of the current budget have been consolidated through it," Khan told bdnews24.com in his reaction on Thursday. He endorsed the 35 percent increase in the annual development programme (ADP) saying: "Our demand is high and we're faced with many problems. These problems cannot be solved with a small-size ADP." But another economist and adviser to the caretaker government Wahiduddin Mahmud disapproved of the increase in the ADP size. "It's very clear from our past records that there will be no use of a larger ADP unless there has been a massive improvement in the economic system of the country," he told bdnews24.com. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith unveiled the Tk 1321.7 billion budget in the parliament on Thursday with a development expenditure outlay of Tk 385 billion, which is Tk 100 billion higher than the ADP of the current year. The two analysts laid emphasis on the government capacity-building to implementation the ADP . "The administration should be more active and dynamic for the ADP implementation," said Mahmud. Around 910 projects have been included in next FY's annual development outlay against 816 in the current fiscal year. Planning secretary Habibullah Mazumder recently said only 59 percent of the current ADP has been implemented in first 10 months of the ongoing financial year running up to the end of June. Bangladesh have never implemented the ADP in its entirety. Khan, also a former secretary and chairman of the National Board of Revenue, said the finance minister's budget speech demonstrated the government's increased dependence on private sector for power generation. "The prospect of progress in the sector is less in the next fiscal year for such dependence on private sector." On the increased allocation for defence sector, Khan said: "I don't know the reason. But it's not so much if you see it from the GDP perspective." The budget proposed to channel Tk 106.95 billion to the military--up Tk 15.12 billion from the current fiscal year's Tk 91.83 billion. The Centre for Policy Dialogue chief researcher Uttam Kumar Dev described the agriculture sector allocation as encouraging. b
