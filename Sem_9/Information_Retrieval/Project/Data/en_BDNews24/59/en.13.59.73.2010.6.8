 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Dwellers in old Dhaka's Mitford area are passing sleepless nights, fearing that disasters like June 3 Nimtali blaze could befall them because of the ubiquitous chemical warehouses in the area. Their fear emanates from the fact that it was the chemical warehouse in the ground floor of a building in Nimatali that caught fire and quickly turned into an inferno, claiming at least 119 lives. Local people said there are around 8,000 go-downs in 45 surgical, perfume and medicine markets in Mitford, characterised by dense population, narrow roads and lanes, and lack of adequate water supply. Bangladesh Druggist & Chemist Association (BDCA) general secretary Monir Hossain said there could be a big disaster any time as the go-downs store inflammable and explosive substances, including phosphorus and potash. Local people said inflammable chemicals go-downs exist in a number of residential buildings at Abul Hashmat road, Noor Box lane, Saat Rouza, Abul Khairat road and Bangshal road. They said similar go-downs are also there at Mamtaj Market, Yusuf Mansion, Mona Complex, MCC Tower, Armanian Street and Sayed Hossain Market in the area. Locals said many of the go-downs and chemical shops do not have the requisite clearance from the from the fire department. Rafiq, a Mitford resident, said: "Building owners provide spaces for chemical go-downs for higher rents. These have to be moved from the residential areas." Another resident, preferring anonymity, said there was a fire in the basement of MCC Tower last year. However, speedy and intelligent response of firemen helped douse the blaze. bdnews24.com correspondent on Tuesday visited Bangladesh Chemical Perfumery Merchant Association's office on Armanian Market's third floor and found no one other than the association's peon Ratan Das. On Monday, a mobile court sealed four go-downs and one electronic goods factory. The court also detained and fined two in this connection. bdnews24.
