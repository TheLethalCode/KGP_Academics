 MOSCOW/ISTANBUL, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme have been "completely agreed upon", a Russian source close to Security Council talks told reporters on Tuesday. Iran had earlier warned Russia on Tuesday against siding with Tehran's foes in supporting fresh UN sanctions over its nuclear dispute with the West. "The proposal on the sanctions against Iran has been completely agreed upon," said the source, who was speaking in Moscow on condition of anonymity. "We don't see any problems connected with this. And in my opinion there were never any," he added. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's admonishment of Moscow, until recently an ally, came in Istanbul a day before the Security Council could vote to impose a fourth round of sanctions, which Russia is expected to support. "There is no big problem, but they must be careful not to be on the side of the enemies of the Iranian people," Ahmadinejad told a news conference in Istanbul, where he was attending a summit along with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Tehran and Moscow recently clashed over Kremlin support for draft U.N. sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Putin, who said he expected to meet Ahmadinejad on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Istanbul, had said the Security Council resolution has been "practically agreed" but that sanctions should not be "excessive". "We will have an opportunity to discuss these problems if my Iranian colleague will have such a need," he said. "I hold the opinion that this resolution should not be excessive, should not put Iran's leadership, the Iranian people in a tricky situation that creates barriers on the way of development of Iran's peaceful nuclear energy." FUEL SWAP DEAL The Iranian president said a nuclear fuel swap deal agreed by Tehran with Turkey and Brazil was an opportunity that would not be repeated. The deal, which has been rejected by the West as too little too late, was intended to defuse the crisis. Turkey and Brazil last month resurrected parts of a UN-backed offer for Tehran to part with 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium -- which is potential nuclear weapons material -- in return for special fuel rods for a medical research reactor. Ahmadinejad said the swap deal was a one-time offer. "We hope and still hope they will be able to use this opportunity, but we say this opportunity will not be repeated," he said. The United States and other powers have rejected the deal and submitted extended sanctions to the Security Council last month for approval. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Turkey and Brazil, both in the 15-member Security Council, say their deal with Iran removes the need for sanctions, as it created a diplomatic opening to tackle larger issues surrounding Tehran's nuclear programme. Turkish President Abdullah Gul urged Ahmadinejad on Monday to tell the international community his government was ready to cooperate and solve the dispute over its nuclear progra
