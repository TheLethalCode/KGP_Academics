 VENICE, La./LONDON, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - BP Plc faced more US government and congressional scrutiny on Wednesday over its Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the struggle to contain it, and the British energy giant's stock price suffered renewed losses. BP shares fell more than 3 percent in London, following a 5 percent drop on Tuesday, on worries that the company will have to suspend its dividend payment under pressure from US politicians who say it should go to pay for legal claims and environmental damage in the Gulf. The cost of protecting BP debt against default also rose sharply, with the five-year credit default swap widening 55 basis points to 315 basis points, three times higher that at the end of May, a London trader said. The political drama in Washington and the drive in the Gulf to limit the environmental disaster were being watched closely by investors who have seen losses erase a third of BP's value. The disaster remains at the top of President Barack Obama's agenda, a point underscored by his strong comments and his plans to head back to the Gulf Coast next week to inspect operations to tackle the worst oil spill in US history. Obama said on Tuesday that he would have fired Tony Hayward if the BP chief executive had worked for him because of Hayward's statements minimizing the impact of the spill. The slick has fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama. It also has sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida. One-third of the Gulf's federal waters remains closed to fishing and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing. In Washington on Wednesday morning, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar was scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing on safety issues in off-shore oil development, a day after his department issued stronger safety requirements that companies must meet to drill in waters less than 500 feet deep. 'DEVASTATING IMPACT' In a further sign of the Obama administration's pressure on BP, the U.S. official commanding the oil spill response demanded that the London-based company provide more information and transparency on how it was meeting damages claims by individuals and businesses affected by the spill. "The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is having a devastating impact on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast states and their communities," Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said in a June 8 letter to BP. "The Federal Government and the public expects BP's claims process to fully address the needs of impacted individuals and businesses," Allen said. BP has paid out close to $50 million in damages claims so far along the Gulf Coast -- mostly to fishermen, shrimpers, oystermen and boat operators who say their livelihoods have been impacted by the spill. BP's total bill from the spill so far, including cleanup costs, has reached $1.25 billion. With tar balls ashore in northwest Florida, a state that has a $60 billion-a-year tourism industry, claims against BP for damages and lost business are expected to rise sharply. For the first time, northwest Florida officials warned the public not to swim on six miles of oil-hit beach on Perdido Key from the Alabama-Florida boundary to the Gulf Islands Seashore national park, local media reported. One preliminary study by Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist, estimated the economic impact of the Gulf oil spill could put nearly 195,000 Floridians out of work and cost the state $10.9 billion. On the corporate front, BP shareholders would prefer to sacrifice the company's Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg rather than CEO Hayward over the ongoing crisis, the Times of London reported in its Wednesday edition. Citing an unidentified person close to the British company, the Times said shareholders had more confidence in Hayward's ability to supervise BP's response to the crisis than Svanberg, who has been largely invisible. "The mood within the company and among shareholders is clear -- they are supportive of Tony, who they feel has done his best in a very bad situation, but they are unimpressed by Svanberg," the London newspaper reported the person as saying. A BP spokesman dismissed the claims that former Ericsson boss Svanberg, who took over the role of chairman in January, would consider stepping down. All of this is taking place against the backdrop of rising public anger and an unfolding ecological catastrophe. OIL BENEATH THE OCEAN SURFACE US weather forecasters gave their first confirmation on Tuesday that some of the oil leaking from BP's well has lingered beneath the surface rather than rising to the top. Undersea oil depletes the water's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels, clams, crabs, eels and shrimp. It was the first government confirmation of undersea oil near BP's one mile deep ruptured well. But a BP executive continued to play down the reports of subsurface oil. "We have not found any significant concentration of oil below the surface," BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told ABC's "Good Morning America." Scientists involved in the studies will testify before a House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee panel that is probing the spill -- one of the several being held on Wednesday's busy day of hearings. Meanwhile, BP will be striving to contain more of the oil spewing from the ocean floor. BP said on Tuesday it had collected 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking well on Monday, 33 percent more than the amount collected on Sunday and the highest capture rate since it installed a new system last week to contain the spill. Suttles said BP planned to add more undersea collection capacity next week "that will give us another 5,000-10,000 barrels a day." The company will deploy another containment system at the end of June or beginning of July that would be more resistant to hurricanes, he added. BP said it collected 7,850 barrels of oil in the 12-hour stretch ended at noon CDT on Tuesday. That brought the total collected since a containment cap was installed to 51,364 barrels. But the ultimate solution to the leak lies in the drilling of a relief well and that won't be completed before August, meaning there could be a long hot summer of public discontent ahead. BP faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits over the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and triggered the sp
