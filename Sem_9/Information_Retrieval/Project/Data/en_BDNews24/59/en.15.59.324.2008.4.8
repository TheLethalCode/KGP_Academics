 GENEVA, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the Red Cross will visit Afghanistan this week to examine conditions under which terrorism suspects are being held by U.S.-led forces, the agency said on Tuesday. Jakob Kellenberger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), will visit Bagram military airbase during his seven-day trip to Afghanistan. He will focus on the legal limbo of more than 600 security suspects detained there by U.S. forces, the ICRC said in a statement. "We see the need for more robust procedural safeguards in Bagram where -- to this day -- most detainees live in uncertainty about their fate," he said on Tuesday before leaving Geneva, where the humanitarian agency is based. "The detention of persons captured or arrested in connection with the fight against terrorism must take place within an appropriate legal framework." Kellenberger will hold talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Afghan ministers, as well as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) General Dan McNeill and Major General Jeffrey Schloesser who commands the 101st airborne division of the U.S. army. The ICRC also expressed concern the humanitarian situation had worsened as the conflict spread from the south to the east and west, driving more people from their homes. The committee has been working in Afghanistan since 1987 and began visiting detainees in Bagram in January 2002 after the U.S.-led invasion that drove Taliban rulers from power. It called on NATO last June to do more to prevent civilian casualties during military operations in Afghanistan after U.S.-led forces mistakenly killed seven policemen in an air strike in the east. The strike was intended to help Afghan forces which came under attack from the Taliban. The Taliban have vowed to step up their war to expel foreign troops and bring down Karzai's government. There has been intermittent fighting in recent weeks after a traditional winter lull. Afghan authorities are investigating a U.S.-led air attack in the east this week, but a government spokesman said on Tuesday it had no information on whether a wanted guerrilla leader was in the village that was hit. A provincial official said more than 20 civilians were killed in Sunday's bombing. Seventeen Afghan road workers were killed in an insurgent attack in the southern province of Zabul on Tuesday.
