<TITLE> Brazil and Portugal must survive 'Group of Death' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, June 9 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- A high-profile casualty is inevitable in the World Cup's Group G with Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast fighting for two places while North Korea concentrate on damage limitation. Brazil have lifted the trophy that symbolises global football supremacy a record five times, Portugal finished fourth at the last tournament in 2006 and many pundits consider Ivory Coast the best African bet for glory. And while North Korea are universally regarded as 'cannon fodder', none of the 32 challengers has prepared more thoroughly than the little-known squad from the reclusive nation. Superstars abound in the first-round 'Group of Death' as Brazil boast Real Madrid midfielder Kaka, while Portugal are inspired by his club teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. The Ivory Coast's Didier Drogba ranks alongside them in potential impact - but the striker's chances of playing in the first World Cup on African soil hang in the balance after an operation on a broken arm. Portugal also suffered an injury blow when in-form Manchester United winger Nani was ruled out of the tournament on Tuesday after severely bruising his collarbone in training. Brazil, the only country to compete at all 19 previous tournaments, are favoured to finish first and set up a possible last-16 showdown with fellow South Americans Chile. And the opening Group G clash on Tuesday between Ivory Coast and Portugal in Port Elizabeth could determine who else progresses with European champions Spain the probable second-round opponents for the second-placed finisher. North Korea will defend en masse and compete like tigers, but lack the firepower to emulate their countrymen of 1966, who defeated Italy in Middlesbrough to cause one of the great World Cup shocks. Coach Dunga has assembled a tactically astute squad that espouses the work ethic and plays as a team with no place for the prima-donna factor that cost Brazil dearly in the past. Dunga left out Ronaldinho, but Kaka is rounding into form after a poor debut season in Madrid. Many consider Julio Cesar of Inter Milan the best goalkeeper in the world, Lucio and Juan form a solid central defence barrier, Gilberto Silva does the midfield graft and Luis Fabiano has few peers as a goal poacher. Brazil also know South Africa well as they return with the stars who won the Confederations Cup last June, when they came from two goals behind to pip the United States 3-2 in Johannesburg. Portugal needed a playoff against Bosnia-Herzogovina to reach South Africa after a qualifying campaign in which midfielder-cum-striker Ronaldo failed to score in seven matches before being sidelined by injury. Where to play the 'golden boy' will occupy much of coach Carlos Queiroz's time with the options facing the former assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United including using him in a wide or central midfield role or as a lone striker. Portugal breezed through a 3-0 warm-up victory over Mozambique Tuesday, but the match was overshadowed by the loss of Nani following an injury in training. Queiroz though was pleased to see Real Madrid defensive midfielder Pepe back in action after six months out with a knee injury. "It's fantastic. With the help of Real Madrid's doctors, the Portuguese federation and the technical staff of the national team, we have done a meticulous job," said the coach. Fate has dealt Ivory Coast a cruel World Cup hand twice after getting the Netherlands and Argentina in Germany four years ago, and the late choice of former England supremo Sven Goran Eriksson as coach hardly boosts continuity. The Ivorians are desperate for Chelsea star Drogba to recover in time, but brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure and Salomon Kalou will want to show they are than just a support cast. Perhaps the safest prediction about the group is that Myong-Guk Ri, the 23-year-old North Korea goalkeeper who considers it his sacred duty to "safeguard the gates to the fatherland", faces an extremely busy June.
