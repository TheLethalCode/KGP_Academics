<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 10 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  BP shares collapsed by almost 16 percent Thursday as the US government tightened the screw on the British oil giant over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that has cost the company billions of pounds. BP shares slumped 15.7 percent in early London deals, mirroring the size of a fall Wednesday by the group's US traded-shares as the US government gave the company 72 hours to update plans for containing the spill. In initial deals BP's shares plunged 15.7 percent to 330 pence before pulling back to 370 pence, a drop of 5.50 percent. The latest movements came as BP said Thursday it had spent about 1.43 billion dollars (980 million pounds) on efforts to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and on compensation. But the group's market value has shed billions of extra dollars owing to the share price slumps since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that it operates sank on April 22 -- two days after an explosion killed 11 workers. US President Barack Obama has severely criticised BP and its chief executive Tony Hayward over its handling of the worst US oil spill and environmental disaster in history. London mayor Boris Johnson hit back on Thursday, claiming that BP was the victim of "anti-British rhetoric". "I do think there's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America," Johnson told BBC radio. "I would like to see a bit of cool heads rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling. "When you consider the huge exposure of British pension funds to BP it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the airwaves. "It was an accident that took place and BP is paying a very, very heavy price indeed," he added. Obama had said he was looking for some "ass to kick" as recriminations mount and the oil spill wreaks havoc on the fragile Gulf coastline. The president added this week that he would have sacked Hayward for flippant comments made about the impact of the disaster. Hayward had said that the spill would be "very, very modest" and described it as relatively "tiny". He has since apologised for the comments. BP meanwhile added on Thursday that it was "not aware of any reason which justifies" the near 16-percent drop in the group's share price in Wall Street trade on Wednesday, as it was making progress with containing the spill. BP is said to be collecting about 15,000 barrels a day from the leak. New York-traded shares in BP plunged 15.80 percent to 29.20 dollars overnight -- -- their lowest level in 14 years. A bemused BP hit back at the US share price slide, claiming it was a "strong" company financially and had "significant capacity and flexibility in dealing with the cost of responding to the incident, the environmental remediation and the payment of legitimate claims." BP's share price had already tumbled in London on Wednesday, as investors feared that intense political pressure from Washington over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could force the group to axe its prized shareholder dividend. BP's London share price has collapsed by more than 40 percent since the accident, which sparked an enormous oil spill from a leaking well head on the ocean floor. US disaster control chief Thad Allen said Wednesday that he had sent a letter to BP demanding records of reimbursement claims filed by individuals and businesses for damages stemming from the spill. Obama has warned BP that it must not short-change Gulf of Mexico disaster vict
