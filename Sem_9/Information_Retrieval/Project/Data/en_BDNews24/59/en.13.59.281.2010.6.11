<TITLE> In Islamist Mogadishu, watching World Cup is extreme sport </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOGADISHU, June 11(bdnews24.com/AFP) - In Mogadishu, there's no such thing as a boisterous boys' night of football and drinks. As millions of revelling football-mad supporters the world over gather around TV screens Friday for the kick-off of Africa's biggest party, watching the World Cup in Somalia's capital is a clandestine, life-threatening activity. The Shebab movement, an Al-Qaeda-inspired insurgent movement that controls most of the country, has banned cinemas, DVDs and, many would say, any form of entertainment, including playing and watching football. "The World Cup is an historic event but in Somalia very few people will get to see it because of the restrictions imposed by the Islamists," said Abdi Ali Yarisow, a resident in southern Mogadishu's Waberi district. "There will be no public cinemas nor gatherings where fans can have fun watching the games," he explained. The lucky few with the adequate satellite television set-up will not risk inviting friends over for the game and are likely to watch matches with one eye on the screen, the other on the door and the sound muted. "I have a TV in my house but I cannot let many people enter and watch the games, because if everybody becomes excited and starts shouting, I'll be in trouble," Yarisow said. "I can maybe allow a handful of people for the day-time games, we'll sit in my room and watch the game silently," he added. Mogadishu is widely considered one of the most dangerous places on the planet and Somalia was the only African country where the World Cup trophy did not stop during its tour of the continent. Somalia is ranked 173rd in the world by FIFA and never really stood a chance of qualifying for the World Cup but the war-battered country can claim some representation in South Africa in the shape of hip-hop singer K'naan. The Mogadishu-born artist, now a Canadian resident, sang his hit "Waving Flag" at the inaugural concert on Thursday evening. "It's very disappointing. We have our young rapper K'naan who is singing for the big event and us, his fellow citizens, cannot even watch him," said Kadro Alas, a 26-year-old woman from Mogadishu and dedicated Brazil supporter. As a hip-hop artist, a westernised Somali and football lover, K'naan combines just about all the "evils" that the Shebab's religious police is tracking down in the city's youth. "Football is nothing but a waste of time. Don't you know that when death presents you to him, Allah will ask you where you spent your time?," Shebab official Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim told AFP. "If you need to exercise, you can play on your own, but going to cinemas and watching games is forbidden in Islam," he said. "This game is intended to blind the young generations and prevent them from worshipping Allah by performing good deeds. Praise be upon Allah for enabling us to root out all the evils from this country," the cleric added. Two cinemas in Mogadishu plan to show the opening games nonetheless. They are located in the tiny perimetre of the capital controlled by the Western-backed transitional government, but watching the World Cup will be no risk-free affair. "We are going to air the World Cup games, we have a decoder and I am sure many young men from the area will come," said Abdi Mohamed, an employee at Cinema Mogadishu, in the Medina district. Most of the so-called cinemas shut down by the Shebab over the past two years were nothing more than a few chairs thrown in front of a large TV-screen on an open-air plot. Cinema Mogadishu, however, was a fully-fledged cinema under former dictator Siad Barre, before the country descended into chaos. The building still stands but the silver screen has been replaced by a scattering of TV sets in front of which spectators huddle in little clusters. "We've been attacked several times with hand grenades but this is the only cinema still operating in Medina, we have resisted intimidation," Mohamed said. For those living in adjacent neighbourhoods, moving across combat lines and militia checkpoints after dark would be too dangerous. But Kadro Alas is ready to risk her life to see Brazil play. "I'll do whatever it takes. I'll just keep looking for a place where I can watch the games. If I miss the Brazil, it'll be the worst thing that's happened to me," she s
