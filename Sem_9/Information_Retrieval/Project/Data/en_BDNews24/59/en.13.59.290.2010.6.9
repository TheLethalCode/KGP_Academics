<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)--Rajuk on Wednesday began knocking down unauthorised extensions to buildings on Wednesday. The workers of the capital's development authority started the drive by beginning to demolish the two illegal floors of a six-storey building at the capital's Mugdapara Bank Colony. Rajuk magistrate Rokon-Ud-Dowla informed journalists that workers had started tearing down the fourth and fifth floor of the 1/59 building in the morning. The owner had been given approval to only construct four storeys. He also revealed plans to demolish the illegal part of another four-storey building built alongside Malibagh rail-crossing and on Saturday to knock down the unauthorised section of a four-storey madrasa at Madhya Begunbari. Rajuk is, however, continuing to razing down the whole structure of those buildings considered unsafe. It is now tearing down a seven-storey building at middle Begunbari that was leaning to one side since June 4. "We are set to tear down on Thursday East Nakhalpara's five-storey building that tilted on June 5," Dowla said. The residents had left the building fearing a catastrophe like the one that had taken place on June 1 when at least 25 people were killed as a five-storey building with unauthorised extensions at Begunbari toppled over and fell onto tin-roofed slum houses below. The incident sparked large-scale awareness of the issue of unauthorised extensions leading to the city real estate regulators to initiate a long-awaited operation. bdnews24.co
