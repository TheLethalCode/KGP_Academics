<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Real estate regulator Rajuk Saturday began demolition of an illegal four-storey madrassa building at Begunbari in the capital. Around 35 workers of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkho (Rajuk) began knocking down the building at around 10:30am, said Rajuk magistrate Rokan-ud-Doula. The work will continue until 4pm, added Rajuk Mahakhali zone official Shafiqul Islam. Madarassa authorities sought another day to remove their effects but demolition still went ahead as they had been notified a week ago, Rokan said. He said the authorities had been asked to vacate the building two years ago as it was constructed illegally. Rajuk authorities decided to knock down the building last week as it was leaning towards the north side. Demolition of another tilted five-storey building near east Nakhalpara Samiti market and a seven-storey building at north Begubari are also underway. Rajuk started its drive to knock down illegal constructions in Begunbari after the death of 25 people, when a five-storey building in the area toppled and fell on tin-shed shanties on June 1. bdne
