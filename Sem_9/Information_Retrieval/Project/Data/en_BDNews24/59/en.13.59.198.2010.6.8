<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) Squabbling owners have decided to pull the plug on the long-suffering newspaper, The Bangladesh Observer. Publication of the English daily was stopped, at least for now, by its owners on Tuesday. Manzoor Ahmed Choudhury, chairman of Al Helal Printing and Publishing Company that owns Observer, confirmed to bdnews24.com that the publication of the 60-year-old daily has 'temporarily' stopped. "We have taken over the newspaper. The publication has been stopped temporarily. It will be published again after reorganisation" he said. Publisher Nargis Rahman and her husband Riaz Rahman, who advises BNP chief Khaleda Zia, came to office on Tuesday after a long period of absence, said Observer employees. They then paid 94 permanent and 20 part-time employees the money owed to them through cheques. The publisher then secured 'No demand' letters from the workers agreeing not to file any cases against them. But journalists working there said that they were not paid their full dues. They said the paper owed them salary and benefits of 92 months. "But the owners paid us only a third of the amount," senior sub-editor Tarun Tapan Chakrabarti told bdnews24.com. In addition, 31 journalists filed a writ petition with the High Court against four directors of the daily on June 3, demanding payment of their due salaries and benefits. The court ordered the directors to submit an explanation in four weeks. Former journalist of Observer, Ainy Illias, one of the petitioners, told bdnews24.com, "Some journalists and workers were paid a quarter of their dues on Tuesday. But 45 of us have payments of 92 months still due. We, 31 journalists, have filed a petition." "The mutual understanding was brokered through the (information) minister and the editor. Now we are concerned who got paid and who did not," said Manzoor regarding the allegations. The editor, Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, could not be reached for comments. "After the ruling government came to power, an agreement was reached through information minister Abul Kalam Azad and law minister Shafique Ahmed," said a journalist of the daily. "According to the agreement the owners would take over the newspaper after paying dues of Tk 100 million," said a journalist of the daily who did not want to be named. During the caretaker government's tenure, the journalists and workers contacted former army chief Moeen U Ahmed about the problems of the paper. Before that, information minister of the past BNP government Nazmul Huda tried to resolve the problems, but failed. An investigation report was published in bdnews24.com about the long-term problems of Observer on Mar 23, 2009. A former Observer journalist said that a particular 'quarter' had kept the Observer House problems alive, as the current arrangements served them well. That group has members both inside and outside the Observer House, he added. Most of the employees of the daily complained that the actions of Khaled Hamidul Haque Chowdhury, an owner, and Awami League-backed Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists leader Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury are the main factor for the drastic decline of this once popular newspaper. It all started in 1991, when newspapermen waged a movement demanding implementation of the fourth wage board and payment of the dues for those sacked or retired. Nazmul Huda, the information minister at that time, acted as the arbitrator, and it was decided that the owners would pay up Tk 50 million in accumulated salaries and allowances. Manzoor Ahmed Choudhury signed the agreement on behalf of the owners. But the money was never paid. Iqbal Sobhan was a senior reporter in 1991 and Dhaka University professor KMA Munim was acting editor. SM Ali, editor for a few months in 1989, left the paper and later launched The Daily Star. A large group of journalistsincluding special correspondent Reazuddin Ahmedalso left in 1990 to join the new venture. The departure of Reazuddin leader of one of the union factions, gave the other faction leader Iqbal greater control of the proceedings. So in 1991, when the journalists and workers took charge of running the paper, it was in fact Iqbal who was calling the shots. He brought Khaled Hamidul Haque Chowdhury, the founder-owner's only son, as the representative of the owners. Iqbal allegedly used Khaled as a shield to keep Hamidul Haque Chowdhury's daughters and sons-in-law at bay, though the daughters own nearly half of the paper's assets. Khaled began running all operations and soon appointed a new editor. He made Munim editor and finally, chief editor. A 1998 office order declared Iqbal Sobhan editor. Manzoor Ahmed Choudhury, the chairman, refused to accept Iqbal as the editor, and he said that there had never been an appointment letter issued. The court ordered an audit of the Al-Helal Printing Press and Publishing Company. The audit report said the salaries due to be paid to 259 Observer and Chitrali (sister publication) journalists and workers from Jan 1, 1992 to Dec 31, 2007 stood at over Tk 260 million. The arrears started from Oct, 2002. The report stated that during 2002-2007 the paper had received Tk 362.8 million in cash. Some Tk 17.6 million was said to be 'cash in hand' in 2007. bdnews24
