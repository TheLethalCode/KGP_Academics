 PMJOHANNESBURG , 11 June (bdnews24.com/AP/AFP) - From Johannesburg townships to Ghana's sprawling slums, millions of Africans danced in the streets and beamed with pride as the continent's first World Cup kicked off. But Johannesburg's celebration started with a grief by the death of Nelson Mandela's great granddaughter. grief-stricken Mandela stayed away after the tragic death of a great granddaughter. Fans wept as five planes swept over South Africa's Soccer City stadium at the start of a lavish opening ceremony before 1,500 performers piled on to the pitch for a dance routine which saw them create a map of the continent. And after brief turns from some of the biggest names in African music, it was left to South African President Jacob Zuma to declare the tournament open and the Uzbek referee Rashan Irmatov to blow the starting whistle. "The time for Africa has come. It has arrived," Zuma told 85,000 supporters packed into the stadium. "Allow me ladies and gentleman to say I am honoured and privileged to be given an opportunity to declare the 2010 FIFA soccer World Cup open."

In Uganda, thousands of large screens have been put up in fan parks. Taxis and buildings have been painted with World Cup logos, and betting men were playing the odds. Tens of thousands of fans flooded the streets and parks of Johannesburg, where the ubiquitous sound of vuvuzela horns created a carnival atmosphere from the morning hours across the city. In Rustenburg, where the United States-England match doesn't kick off until Saturday night, it looked like a game day. Almost everyone was dressed in Bafana Bafana T-shirts or jackets, and many people wore tall, fuzzy hats or puffy wigs in the colors of the South African flag. The blare of vuvuzelas provided a festive soundtrack to the crowded streets, where people smiled and traded handshakes, and most cars were decorated with South African flags. But Somalia's hard-line Islamic militants declared the tournament un-Islamic. "We ask them not to dare watch the World Cup matches," Sheikh Mohamed Abdi Aros, a spokesman for Hizbul Islam militant group, told The Associated Press. "It is a waste of money and time. "There is no benefit ... from watching mad men jumping up and down." Ahmed Santos used to live in an area of Somalia run by militants, but now is in a government-controlled are
