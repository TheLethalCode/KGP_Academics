 THE HAGUE, June 10 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The spectacular election breakthrough of the far-right anti-Muslim Party for Freedom shocked the Netherlands on Thursday as two mainstream parties braced for weeks of coalition haggling. The pro-business Liberal VVD party had 31 seats and the Labour party (PvdA) 30, with 99.6 percent of the vote counted after Wednesday's election. But far-right PVV leader Geert Wilders demanded a share of government after his party came third with 24 seats, more than doubling its current nine seats in the 150-member parliament. "Nobody in The Hague can bypass the PVV anymore," said Wilders, whose party wants to end immigration from Muslim countries as well as a ban on new mosques and the Koran. "We want to be part of the new government," declared Wilders, a distinctive figure with a shock of dyed blonde hair who is under 24-hour protection because of his controversial political stand. France's far-right National Front hailed the PVV's "great success", while the CMO Dutch Muslim organisation described it as "shameful". "One thing is clear: a group of people are against us. It is terrible," a 29-year-old Muslim who identified herself only as Aicha told AFP. The SMN, a group representing Dutch citizens of Moroccan descent, said Wilders' success was "a slap in the face". "Moroccan Dutch citizens ask themselves whether they still form part of Dutch society, whether their neighbours and colleagues see them as fellow citizens, whether there is a safe future here for them and their children," it said in a statement. The PVV pushed the Christian Democratic Action party of outgoing Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende into fourth place, prompting him to resign as party leader and MP after eight years as Dutch premier. Having been a part of nearly every Dutch government since World War II, the Christian Democrats lost 20 seats to end at 21. Balkenende's last centre-left coalition collapsed in February over the country's Afghanistan military mission. "A divided Netherlands," said the front page headline on the NRC Next newspaper, summing up the election results. With economic concerns dominating the campaign, the Liberal party led by Mark Rutte campaigned with a promise to cut public spending by about 45 billion euros (54 billion dollars) over the next four years. It also promised to eradicate the public deficit, which was 5.3 percent of GDP last year, to shrink the government and parliament, lower income taxes and cap civil servant pay rises while raising the retirement age by two years to 67. Labour, led by former Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen, had promised more "careful" savings, the retention of social benefits and higher taxes for the rich. It lost two seats. The election was the first in a eurozone country since the Greek financial crisis erupted and was closely watched to see how the public reacted to Europe's wave of austerity. Voter turnout was 74 percent, the lowest since 1998. Rutte has set a target date of July 1 to create a new government. "We do not exclude any party," he said ahead of the polls, asked about a possible coalition with the far right. Cohen has ruled out cooperation with the PVV. But the close outcome means Wilders, who calls Islam a fascist religion and likens the Koran to Hitler's "Mein Kampf", cannot be excluded from what observers have predicted to be long and complicated coalition talks. The maverick Wilders has earned notoriety with his campaign to "stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands." He is known abroad for his 17-minute commentary, "Fitna", which was termed "offensively anti-Islamic" by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Wilders goes on trial in the Netherlands in October on charges of inciting racial hatred against Muslims. He was barred from entering Britain last year to stop him spreading "hatred" Official election results are due next Tuesda
