<TITLE> Parreira to feature at record sixth World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, June 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira will become the first coach to feature in six World Cups when South Africa face Mexico in the opening match of the 2010 tournament on Friday. The 67-year-old grandfather overtakes Serb Bora Milutinovic, who is two years younger, with each coach having guided five countries at the four-yearly football spectacle. Parreira also coached Kuwait, in 1982, United Arab Emirates (1990), Brazil (1994 and 2006) and Saudi Arabia (1998) with a World Cup title the highlight and a sacking the low point. He steered Brazil to the 1994 title in the United States after a goalless, unmemorable final against Italy in baking Los Angeles heat settled by a penalty shootout during which the 'Divine Ponytail', Roberto Baggio, blazed over. But one World Cup later the native of Rio de Janeiro experienced the most humiliating moment of his 43-year coaching career when he was axed by Saudi officials furious at a four-goal drubbing from hosts France. His second spell in charge of Brazil was far less joyful than the first with the hot 2006 World Cup favourites surprisingly bowing out in the quarter-finals after defeat by eventual runners-up France. The French loom again on the horizon for Parreira this month as he hopes to lead automatic qualifiers Bafana Bafana (The Boys) past a demanding first round group completed by former world champions Uruguay and Les Bleus. No host nation has failed to make the second round since Uruguay staged the first World Cup 80 years ago, but local bookmakers have installed South Africa as favourites to finish bottom of the table. Parreira resigned as Bafana coach two years ago to comfort his ill wife in Rio only for Brazilian replacement Joel Santana to be fired last November following eight losses in nine matches. Amid a fierce media debate -- with many South Africans favouring a local coach - Parreira got the nod although his contentious salary in a country where poverty is rife was trimmed to a reported 200,000 dollars a month. After goalless draws against Japan and Jamaica in his first two friendlies, Parreira has developed a team which are unbeaten in 12 matches under his stewardship and never more popular among South Africans of all races. Football officials who struggled to give away free tickets to Bafana games less than a year ago saw Parreira create a combative team that will draw a capacity crowd to Soccer City for the World Cup op
