<TITLE> Rajuk faces obstruction from 'famous people' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) The state minister for housing and public works has told the parliament some so called 'famous' people side with the builders of illegal structures when Rajuk approached to demolish them. The land grabbers did not even spare public toilets, Abdul Mannan Khan said replying to a question on Wednesday. He appealed to the people to abide by the building construction rules. "Not only open spaces and fields, these culprits have even occupied public toilets," Khan said, answering Awami League MP K M Khalid. The MP had alleged that the minister did not keep his promises to recover a field in Uttara from the land grabbers. "We will certainly recover the land from the illegal occupiers. We will proceed in a concerted way so that we must not fail," he said. Khan, a lawyer by training, said the city development authority, Rajuk, in many cases could not take action against illegal structures because of court intervention. "I am forced to say that in many cases we cannot take actions due to stay orders from the court, the guardians of people," said the minister. He said some people misguide the court and submit wrong information, resulting in stay orders on the illegal structures. "Again, when we go for action against the illegal building owners, some famous people and NGOs become their sympathisers and side with them to stop Rajuk actions," said Khan. "The ministry has to work under these circumstances," he said, "violation of the building code has turned severe."
