<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 10 (bdnews24.com) The High Court has stayed for three months the government order stopping publication of the Bangla-language daily newspaper Amar Desh. The court also asked the government to explain within four weeks why the cancellation order, issued by Dhaka's Deputy Commissioner, should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif gave the orders on Thursday following a writ petition challenging the government order filed by Anwar-ur-Nabi, acting chairman of the recently shut down newspaper. Barrister Abdur Razzak acted for the petitioner in court while additional attorney general MK Rahman argued for the government. After the order was given, Razzak told bdnews24.com, that "in line with the order, there is now no barrier stopping the publication of Amar Desh. The newspaper can now be published whenever it wishes." Earlier on Wednesday, Razzak had told the court that section 39 of the constitution provides rights for freedom of thought, conscience and speech. It also ensures the freedom of newspapers. He alleged that the government has violated the constitution's fundamental rights by banning the publication of Amar Desh. Additional attorney general M K Rahman responded by saying that the newspaper was banned following legal process and by issuing legal notices "to show cause" why closure should not take place. He also said that publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu had resigned a long time ago but the publication's declaration remained in his name and the paper was therefore, since then, being published illegally. The newspaper's publication started on September 2004 with Hashu, the brother of Khaleda Zia's former political secretary Mossaddek Ali Falu, as the publisher. Former energy advisor to Khaleda, Mahmudur Rahman took over the paper's management in 2008. The government stopped its publication on June 1 claiming that it had no legal publisher. Mahmudur was arrested from its office in the early hours of June 2 after Hashu filed a fraud case against him the day before. The writ petition states that the daily's publication was banned for not having a legal publisher as Hashu resigned his post on Oct 11 last year. However, the petition says that on Sept 3, Mahmudur filed an application with the district magistrate to become the publisher. bdnews2
