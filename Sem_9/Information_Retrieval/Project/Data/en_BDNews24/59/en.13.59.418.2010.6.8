 Kishoreganj, June 8 (bdnews24.com)--Inter-district bus services have been halted between Kishoreganj and Mymensingh in a tripartite dispute among the bus owners of Kishoreganj, Bhairab and Mymensingh. The Kishoreganj bus owners on Tuesday morning stopped all Mymensingh and Bhairab buses from moving on the roads. The Kishoreganj Transport Owners' Association accused its Mymensingh counterpart of launching a joint bus service, 'Shyamal Chhaya', with the Bhairab Transport Owners' Association - defying an earlier agreement between them. As part of the new 'Shyamal Chhaya' bus service, a total of 30 buses were moving in Kishoreganj. In response to the new bus service, the Kishoreganj association decided to stop all buses on the Mymensingh-Bhairab route. In retaliation, the Mymensingh association obstructed the Kishoreganj buses which run in its district. Kishoreganj association leaders told bdnews24.com that according to a previous deal, the Mymensingh and Kishoreganj associations had agreed to divide between them the numbers of buses running between the two districts - but the 'Shyamal Chhaya' bus service was in conflict with the previous deal. Abdul Wadud, general secretary of the Kishoreganj association, told bdnews24.com, "Initiating a new service without informing us and without providing any quota for us is against the agreement. We cannot tolerate that." He said that his association had sent a letter to the Kishoreganj district authorities and that if the issue was not settled immediately, a tough movement would be declared. Kishoreganj deputy commissioner Md Siddiqur Rahman said the matter would soon be resolved after holding talks with all three associations. bdnews24.
