 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam has said the current government will finish a significant number of war crimes trials before its tenure ends. "Investigation into the activities of the alleged war criminals is underway. The prosecution will start after investigation," Ashraf, also Awami League general secretary, told a press conference on Wednesday at the party's headquarters. "I believe that the trial of a significant number of war criminals will finish before the tenure of the government ends," he said. The government on Mar 25 formed a war crimes tribunal, investigative agency and panel of prosecutors to hold the trials of those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1971 war of independence. Ashraf said opposition leader Khaleda Zia has not learnt any lessons from the past. "She has become blind with the obsession of power. Her present concern is to save war criminals. "To save them she is trying to destabilise the country by making the parliament ineffective and calling a hartal," he said. BNP is observing a mass sit-in on Wednesday as part of its anti-government movement. It will hold countrywide protest rallies on June 17 and has called a dawn-to-dusk general strike on June 27. The press conference was arranged to respond to opposition BNP's presentation of shadow budget on Monday. b
