 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)The BNP has rejected the prime minister's invitation to present its budget proposals before the parliament. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday invited opposition leader Khaleda Zia to come to the parliament with her budget proposals. Khaleda on Monday presented a first-ever shadow budget for the next fiscal year ahead of the budget proposal to be placed by the finance minister on June 10. Hasina said the proposals would be considered if they were acceptable. "The prime minister makes false comments against the opposition and invites it to parliament. This is only a strategy to confuse people," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told a briefing on Tuesday at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. He said there is no favourable environment to return to parliament. BNP joined the first day of the budget session but walked out twice and has not gone back since. "We are not allowed to speak in parliament. Our microphones are switched off when we start speaking." He said they hoped the prime minister would consider the opposition's budget proposals and make an effective budget for the next fiscal year. Delwar protested the prime minister's statement that BNP had called the June 27 strike to thwart the trial of war criminals. "This is a false statement. We are waging movement to ease the sufferings of the people." He claimed that the people endorsed their movement programme. He also warned that if the government hindered the movement it would have to take the responsibilities. Delwar demanded resumption of recently closed Amar Desh newspaper and release of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman by withdrawing all "false" cases against him. He alleged that the law enforcers were torturing Mahmudur on remand and trying to extract false statement from him. "This is violation of human rights." BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and joint secretary general Aman Ullah Aman were present, among others.
