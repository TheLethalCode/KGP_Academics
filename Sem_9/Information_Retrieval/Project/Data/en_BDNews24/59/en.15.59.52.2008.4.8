 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)The wife of former Awami League MP Kamal Ahmed Majumder turned herself in to a Dhaka court Tuesday in a case involving alleged acquirement of illegal wealth and suppression of information of his actual property. Her husband is the main accused in the case. Shahida Majumdar surrendered to the court of judge Tanjina Ismail. The court later rejected a bail prayer and sent Shahida to jail, pending trial. Shahida's lawyer Emdad Hossain argued in the court that she deserved bail since the case was under the emergency powers rules, and she was not the main accused. "There's no direct charge against her in the case. So she deserves bail," Hossain told the court. State counsel AFM Golam Fattah opposed the defence's move and said there was a specific charge against her and she might flee if allowed bail. "I urge the court not to approve bail to her," he told the court. The court reset April 10 to hear the arguments for chargeframing in the case. ACC deputy director Morshed Alam filed the case on Sept 24 last year, accusing Kamal and his wife of earning wealth beyond recognised sources of income. According to case details, Kamal allegedly amassed property of more than Tk 10.19 lakh. It said Kamal suppressed information of his property of more than Tk 7.19 crore. Shahida allegedly abetted her husband in amassing the illegal property, according to case documents. bdnew
