<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The High Court will give its verdict on the petition challenging the closure of Bengali-language newspaper Amar Desh on Thursday. The bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif set the date after hearing the petition on Wednesday. The hearing will continue on Thursday too before the judgement is delivered. Anwar-ur-Nabi, the acting chairman of the newspaper, filed the petition on Monday. At Wednesday's hearing, Abdur Razzaque, who argued for the petitioner, said the constitution's section 39 mentions about the freedom of thought, conscience and speech. It also ensures the freedom of newspapers. He alleged that the government has violated fundamental rights by banning the publication of Amar Desh. Additional attorney general M K Rahman said the newspaper was banned following legal process and by issuing legal notices to show causes. He also said that publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu had resigned a long time ago but the publication's declaration remained in his name and the paper was published by illegally using his name. The newspaper's publication started on September 2004 with Hashu, the brother of Khaleda Zia's former political secretary Mossaddek Ali Falu, as the publisher. Former energy advisor to Khaleda, Mahmudur Rahman took over the paper's management in 2008. The government cancelled the declaration of the daily and banned its publication on June 1 on the charges of having no legal publisher. Mahmudur was arrested from its office in the early hours of June 2 after Hashu filed a fraud case against him the day before. The writ petition states that the daily's publication was banned for not having a legal publisher as Hashu resigned his post on Oct 11 last year. However, on Sept 3, Mahmudur filed an application with the district magistrate to become the publisher. bdnews
