<TITLE> Dunga's pragmatic Brazil ready to dig for victory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, June 10 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Brazil coach Dunga may believe substance rather than a slavish devotion to style can deliver the World Cup, but his 1994 title-winning team-mate Branco worries about the team's cutting edge in South Africa. "From midfield back to the defence this is the best team in the world," says Branco, even if there are many who see a defensively-sound 'Selecao' as not very Brazilian. Branco does harbour doubts, however, up front. "I am a little worried about creativity up front as that can decide a game's outcome given that everyone plays a little bunched against Brazil." Dunga is determined to mould the team in his own tough image based on defensive solidity at least as much as attacking flair as he seeks to emulate Franz Beckenbauer in landing the World Cup as both player and coach. Twelve years ago Dunga held aloft the trophy as skipper of a side which squeezed home in a dour final after a penalty shootout against Italy. In 1994, the Brazilian defence conceded just three goals in the entire event and now Dunga is determined that, once again, opposing attackers shall not pass - even if that has the supporters of the "jogo bonito" (beautiful game) fuming. The midfield looks creative with Kaka saying he is ready to take the tournament by the throat despite a poor first season with Real Madrid. And if Robinho is let off the leash that will also give opposing defences cause for concern. Yet under Dunga's system, Robinho will also have to track back - almost unimaginable for a samba star playing in as far advanced a position. Dunga will also look to shield the back four with defensive midfielders Felipe Melo and Gilberto Silva, who was talking tough on Wednesday in language which would appeal to Dunga himself. "We are not here to have a good time - our message is we want to be champions," said the Panathinaikos veteran and former Arsenal man. "If I told you we shall be champions then I'll need a crystal ball. I cannot say that but since we started working three and a half years ago to get here that's what we have been working towards - to get to the final and win it." Striker Luis Fabiano adds for his part that winning can't always by synonymous with beauty. "If we have to play dirty to win then we will as what counts with a World Cup is winning it." There is little sign of anyone complaining about the Dunga method. "We never comment about what the press write or say about us," says reserve keeper Heurelho Gomes of Tottenham. "The most important thing is to pay Dunga back for the confidence he has in us. We are also going to play for the coach, who believes in us." In leaving out the aging Ronaldinho and Adriano, Dunga has sidelined two potential discordant voices although warm-up romps against Zimbabwe and Tanzania were sufficiently one-sided as not to provide any evidence of the effect their absence may have. Now Dunga's way is to be put to the test as Brazil open their campaign Tuesday against North Korea in Johannesburg and then face Portugal and Ivory Coast in Gro
