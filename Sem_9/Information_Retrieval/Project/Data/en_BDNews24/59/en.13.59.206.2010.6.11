<TITLE> Big guns misfiring as World Cup looms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, June 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- England, France and Italy may have six World Cup titles between them, but the trio of European football heavyweights enter the 2010 edition in less than convincing form with tempers fraying as the pressure of expectation grows. England's desperate quest to add a second world title to the one they so memorably won against West Germany in 1966 has taken a few knocks of late having serenely progressed through their qualifiers under the stern taskmaster Fabio Capello. Unconvincing wins over fellow qualifiers Mexico and Japan was followed by a none too impressive final run-out, ahead of Saturday's opener against the United States, was a 3-0 victory over South African league side Platinum Stars on Monday. The loss of captain Rio Ferdinand last week had already damaged 63-year-old Capello's finely-tuned build-up to the finals and that plus Monday's match appear to have pierced even the former AC Milan and Real Madrid coach's unflappable temperament. Twice this week Capello has given vent to his feelings with both players and photographers feeling the lash of his tongue. On Monday the Italian berated the players he was planning to introduce for the second half, some of whom appeared visibly shocked by the vehemence of the coach's outburst. On Wednesday Capello turned on some of the photographers following Wayne Rooney and co.'s every move at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Campus. However, midfielder Joe Cole believes that everything will be fine when the phoney war is over and they take to the pitch against the Americans. "This squad has got the experience of being in tournaments before, it's got a fit Wayne Rooney, a fit Steven Gerrard and everyone is coming to that right age," said Cole. "I believe we can do it, I'm convinced we can do it. I've got faith in the boys. If we can have that bit of luck that you are going to need, then we can go all the way." Capello's problems, though, pale into insignificance compared to those of his French counterpart Raymond Domenech, who was hailed as almost a miracle worker four years ago with France's unlikely arrival in the final but is now a widely reviled figure. A poor three match build-up reached its nadir with a 1-0 defeat by non-qualifiers China and having attracted his by now customary criticism from outside the camp, Domenech is having to cope with rising dissent from within. Chief sulker is temperamental defender William Gallas, who having already embarrassed himself by crashing a buggy at training-camp, is refusing to talk to the press because he is furious at Domenech for choosing Patrice Evra as captain. Senior players meanwhile are pressurising him to drop young midfielder Yoann Gourcuff and start with the patently out of form Thierry Henry. Gallas' Arsenal team-mate Bacary Sagna, though, is seeing the glass as being half-full as opposed to half-empty. "The pressure is mounting, but it's positive pressure, we have to impose from the opening match, it's for us to make our imprint on it," said Sagna. Domenech may have received a supportive phone call from President Nicolas Sarkozy, but many French people would not be upset to see his reign come to a suitably dire end. Italy coach Marcello Lippi may not have had an ideal preparation with a defeat to Mexico and a draw with the Swiss, but he can afford to be relaxed whatever the outcome as he delivered their fourth world title in 2006. And the ice-cool, cheroot-smoking Lippi is comfortable with the notion he has selected an ageing squad as they bid to equal Brazil's five titles. "I'm not nervous, I'm 62 years old and I've been doing this for 30 years. "I've never had tension, these are the best moments, it's great to prepare for such an important tournam
