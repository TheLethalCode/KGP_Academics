<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four new players were awarded contracts and test opener Chris Rogers has been dropped from Cricket Australia's list of contracted players for next season. David Hussey, Shaun Marsh, Doug Bollinger and Beau Casson were included on the 25-man list for the first time, while Simon Katich and Ashley Noffke were offered new contracts after failing to make the cut last season. Three places were available following the retirements of Adam Gilchrist, Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie while the remaining three came about through the ditching of Rogers, Cullen Bailey and Daniel Cullen. Chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said on Wednesday they had chosen a blend of experienced and emerging players. "The national selection panel has continued to recognise the outstanding performances of key players who have continually contributed to the Australian side while at the same time recognising the efforts of those in interstate cricket," Hilditch said in a statement. NOTABLE ABSENTEE Rogers was the most notable absentee after making his test debut against India in Perth in January. The left-handed opener failed to make a big score in his only appearance. "Simon Katich and Ashley Noffke have had outstanding seasons for New South Wales and Queensland respectively and have thoroughly deserved their selection," Hilditch said. "At the same time we have decided to add a young spinner to the list and Beau Casson has performed strongly for New South Wales throughout the summer. Fast bowler Shaun Tait was also included despite announcing last season he was taking a break because he was worn-out from playing professional cricket. "Shaun just encountered something which probably he's never had to deal with before and probably as a selection panel we haven't had to deal with before," Hilditch said. "We have had lengthy discussions, both coaches, players and fitness people, with Shaun, and we're really confident that it's going to be a good future in the next 12 months or so for Shaun." Australia's contracted players for 2008-09: Doug Bollinger, Nathan Bracken, Beau Casson, Stuart Clark, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Matthew Hayden, Ben Hilfenhaus, Brad Hodge, James Hopes, David Hussey, Mike Hussey, Phil Jaques, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Stuart MacGill, Shaun Marsh, Ashley Noffke, Ricky Ponting, Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait, Adam Voges, Shane Watson, Cameron White
