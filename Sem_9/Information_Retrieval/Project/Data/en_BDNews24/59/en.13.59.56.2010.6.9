 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh have left out top-order batsman Aftab Ahmed from their squad for the Asia Cup, while recalling the out-of-form Mohammad Ashraful for the June 15-24 tournament in Sri Lanka. The 15-man team, led by Shakib Al Hasan, also includes medium-pacer Syed Rasel, who missed the ODIs against England in March, reports Cricinfo. Ashraful was not part of the home ODI-series against England, but had made the cut for the ICC World Twenty20 in the Caribbean and the recently-completed Test series in England. He made a half-century and a duck in two innings in the West Indies and had a poor tour of England, averaging 12.50 in four Test innings. Aftab played all three ODIs against England but made only 52 runs at an average of 17.33. He got just one opportunity in the World Twenty20 but was dismissed for 1 against Australia. Nasir Hossain and Nazmul Hossain, both of whom were part of the ODI squad against England but didn't play a game, were left out. Squad: Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Jahurul Islam, Junaid Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Suhrawadi Shuvo. bdnews2
