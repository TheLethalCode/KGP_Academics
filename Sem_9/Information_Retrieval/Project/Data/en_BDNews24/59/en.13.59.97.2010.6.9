<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) Election Commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain has asked candidates of Chittagong City Corporation election not to entertain guests with 'mesbaan', a popular feast in Chittagong. He said, "We have information that mesbaans are being held slaughtering cows at some mayoral candidate's home or in the clubs." However, he did not take any names. Shakhawat made the comments when exchanging views with the June 17 polls candidates, civil society representatives and journalists at Chittagong Circuit House on Tuesday. Two major mayoral candidates ABM Mohiuddin Ahmed Chowdhury and M Manzur Alam were not present, however. The commissioner also said that the candidates would have to give detailed accounts of the cost of the feasts, including the number of guests entertained along with the amount of beef consumed. Otherwise, cases will be filed against the candidates, he said. As many as 1400 cases have been filed since the last national election against those who have not submitted their election expenditure, Hossain said. The same will happen with candidates who do not submit estimates of their polls spending, he warned. "We have banned large rallies and processions to reduce the influence of money and muscle power. Holding rallies require money and procession leads to violence," he said. Shakhawat said, "Those who have come to enjoy the political picnic ongoing for the polls, please leave Chittagong metropolitan area by the night of June 14." He took questions from candidates and their agents at the meeting. Chief returning officer Jasmin Tuli and district election officials were also present there. bdn
