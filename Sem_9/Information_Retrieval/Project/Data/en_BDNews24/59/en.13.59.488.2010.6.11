 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com) --The proposed budget offers nothing new, says former caretaker government advisor Akbar Ali Khan. "It's simply the continuation of the current fiscal year's budget. Some programmes of current budget have been consolidated through it," Khan told bdnews24.com in his reaction on Thursday. He endorsed the 35 percent increase in the annual development programme (ADP) saying: "Our demand is high and we're faced with many problems. These problems cannot be solved with a small-size ADP." But another economist and former advisor to the caretaker government Wahiduddin Mahmud disapproved of the increase in the ADP size. "It's very clear from our past records that there will be no use of a larger ADP unless there has been a massive improvement in the economic system of the country," he told bdnews24.com. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith unveiled the Tk 1321.7 billion budget in the parliament on Thursday with a development expenditure outlay of Tk 385 billion under the ADP, which is Tk 100 billion higher than that of the current FY. The two economists believe implementation of ADP will be the main challenge for the government. They laid emphasis on raising the government's execution capacity. "The administration should be more active and dynamic for the ADP implementation," said Mahmud. b
