 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  A young man has reportedly died in the custody of Rapid Action Battalion in the capital. Biplob Ali, 38, was declared dead after he was brought to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on Friday afternoon. A RAB spokesman said Biplob had committed suicide by hanging himself with a 'lungi' from the ventilator during the noon prayer time. He was arrested by RAB-1 on Thursday night from Paikpara in Mirpur and taken to the RAB office at Uttara. He was accused of collaborating in a kidnapping case. "We arrested Biplob on Thursday night from Paikpara while investigating a kidnap case," Lt Col Rashidul Alam, director of RAB-1, told bdews24.com. "There is accusation that he has taken money from the family of the kidnap victim by identifying himself as a Detective Branch officer. The family identified him on Friday morning," he added. "We planned to interrogate him about his other associates after the Juma prayers. But at around 2pm he was seen attempting suicide by hanging himself with a 'lungi' from the ventilator. "Our men quickly intervened and took him to DMCH. But the doctor there declared him dead," he said. Asked why Biplob committed suicide, he said, "We cannot understand this. He was not tortured in any way." A few days ago, another person had died in RAB- custody. RAB then claimed that he had died of heart disease. According to media reports, local and international human rights organisations, law enforcement officials were responsible for 154 deaths, 129 of which were attributed to the so-called 'crossfire' or 'shootout'. The RAB accounted for 38 crossfire killings; members of the police were responsible for 63; combined security units consisting of the RAB and police for 25; and the army committed three crossfire killings. Until Mar 31, the number of people dead in RAB custody was 654. They were killed in 'crossfire', a euphemism for extra judicial killings, since the formation of this elite force on March 26, 2004. Earlier, Amnesty International had criticised the incumbent government for not stopping extrajudicial killings as it had pledged. b
