 NEW YORK, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Latin pop star Ricky Martin will return to Broadway in 2012 to star in a revival of "Evita," opposite Argentine actress Elena Roger who will portray the title role, producers said on Wednesday. Martin will play Che in the musical based on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice that first appeared in London's West End in 1978 and on Broadway a year later. Martin, 38, who made headlines in March when he announced he was gay, was among the biggest teen idols in Latin America and a singer in the band Menudo before scoring a major English-language hit with "Livin' la Vida Loca" in 1999. Since then, the native of Puerto Rico has become a global superstar with numerous records. He previously worked on Broadway in a production of "Les Miserables." In a statement, Martin said that while he has played on many concert stages, "I've never lost my love for the intimacy of the theater." Roger returns in the role of Peron after rave reviews in a revival that played in London's West End in 2006. The musical has played in numerous productions around the world, and was made into Hollywood movie that starred Madonna
