 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Village Police held a human-chain demanding double salary. The human-chain was held at the capital's Muktangan on Tuesday morning. The participants demanded that Dafadar's salary be increased from Tk 1600 to Tk 3000 and village police salary from Tk 1400 to Tk 2800 given the recent price hike. LGRD and Co-operatives minister Syed Ashraful Islam had made an announcement of doubling their salary on June 28, 2009 at a seminar said the union's chairman Mostafa Kamal. The proposal was later approved in the parliament. But according to a joint secretary's proposal they would be given a raise of only 30 percent. "That has compelled us to initiate the programme," Mostafa Kamal said. Union's secretary general MA Alim had declared a programme on June 21, to launch a day-night hunger-strike wearing black badges. "If the government does not agree to our demand, we will take our campaign further," he said. bd
