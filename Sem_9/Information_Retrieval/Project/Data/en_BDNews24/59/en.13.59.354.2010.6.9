 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has thrown out allegations of breach of electoral code against ruling Awami League joint general secretary Mahbubul Haque Hanif. "The position (the special assistant to the prime minister) that Hanif holds is a political and ceremonial one. He is not enjoying any government status or salary for the post," Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told reporters on Wednesday, Therefore, he added, the objection that Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury had raised will not be considered. The chief polling agent of the BNP-backed mayoral contestant M Manzur Alam, Khosru on June 5 accused Hanif of violating polls codes by campaigning in favour of Awami League mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury in the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls. He said Hanif received special privilege as the special assistant to the prime minister and therefore, infringed section 14 of the electoral code of conduct. The section says the speaker and the deputy speaker of the parliament, chief whip, whip, ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers or any person enjoying government facilities equivalent to these posts cannot participate in the election campaign or any other polling activities. Nurul Islam Khan, joint secretary of the EC secretariat, told bdnews24.com, "Hanif is not a government beneficiary equivalent to any of the ministers, state minister or other such posts. As the charge against him is not lawful, the Election Commission will not take any action."
