<TEXT>
 LIMA, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peru striker Claudio Pizarro, banned playing for his country for 18 months for alleged indiscipline, said Tuesday that he was innocent and accused the country's federation of bad management. "I want the truth to see the light of day and I want to prove that I'm innoncent," the Chelsea player told RPP radio. "I want the public to realise that I haven't committed any breach of dIscipline, above all, to be aware of the bad management of this football federation." Pizarro has been suspended along with fellow strikers Jefferson Farfan and Andres Mendoza and defender Santiago Acasiete following alleged incidents at the team hotel in November after World Cup qualifier against Brazil. The bans were handed out last month but back-dated to November. The Peruvian federation has said that it's case was based on evidence provided by a television station and hotel employees. "They have done me terrible damage by involving my name in a party with women and alcohol," Pizarro added. "I did not take part in any of these incidents and I didn't have the slightest idea of what was happening." Peru drew 1-1 with Brazil but were hammered 5-1 by Ecuador three days later when Farfan was left out of the starting line-up. Peruvian football has been plagued by in-fighting among the directors for years and the country has not qualified for a World Cup since 1982. The players are often accused of indiscipline but in turn complain of harrassment by the country's tabloid newspapers and television stations
