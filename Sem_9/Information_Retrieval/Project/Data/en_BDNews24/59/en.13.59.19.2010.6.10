 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Wednesday rejected a bail petition by Mahmudur Rahman, the detained acting editor of the recently closed down Bengali daily Amar Desh. He was presented to Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in the afternoon, following a one-day grilling in a case filed for obstructing police duty. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate AHM Habibur Rahman Bhuiyan rejected Mahmudur's petition and ordered him into jail. The investigation officer, sub-inspector Mokhlesur Rahman, did not make any remand petition and asked the court to send him to jail. However, Mahmudur was kept in court custody. The remand report said that the suspect had technically side-stepped many questions during the grilling session. It also said that further remand might be needed and requested the court not to allow bail and to keep him in jail. However, Mahmudur's lawyers argued that the defendant was in police custody during the incident and that it was impossible to obstruct police duty in that situation. They also said that the first incident report (FIR) did not mention Mahmudur and that his name was included in the case only to harass him. b
