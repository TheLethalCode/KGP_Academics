<TITLE> Amar Desh resumes publication </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  After a High Court stay order on its closure on Thursday, the daily Amar Desh has published a four-page special bulletin for Friday. But the printer's line still mentions the same publisher, Hashmat Ali, and acting editor, Mahmudur Rahman. The publishing company, Amar Desh Publications Ltd, was mentioned to have the same address as before  446/C-446/D Tejgaon Industrial Area. The BNP-leaning newspaper's declaration was cancelled with the government sealing its press and suspending its publication on June 1. The High Court stayed the decision to close down the daily on Thursday which virtually lifted legal bars from the paper being published. Meanwhile, suspecting chaos, the police went to the press in the evening. The press employees who wanted resumption of operations got into an altercation with the law enforcers. But the police would have none of it as the court order had not reached them, they told the pressmen. Hashmat Ali was said to have filed a complaint accusing Mahmudur Rahman of fraud on the morning of June 1 when he was whisked off by intelligence officials. Mahmudur Rahman is a former energy adviser to the previous BNP-led government and has also been sued for sedition by the government. bd
