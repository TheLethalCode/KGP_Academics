<TITLE> Khaleda breached constitution: AL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League has accused opposition leader Khaleda Zia of violating the constitution by making her alternative budget proposals before the government presented the budget in the parliament. At a news conference on Wednesday, the ruling party's general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam cited articles 87 to 92 of the constitution relating to budget presentation. "It is not clear to us why the opposition leader presented her alternative budget violating the constitution, parliamentary regulations and democratic values," Ashraf, also the LGRD minister, said. "She has placed her budget proposals without coming to the parliament in such a place where the budget will not be passed and there will not be any discussions on budget there." On Tuesday, treasury bench MPs termed Khaleda's budget proposal a violation of the constitution and a demonstration of her disrespect for the parliament. They also sought a ruling from the speaker on the issue. Ashraf asked the opposition BNP to talk about its budget proposals after returning to the parliament. In a first-ever presentation of a shadow budget by the opposition on Monday, the BNP chief had said the budget recommendations were BNP's way of cooperating with the government to prevent further misery of the people. "Shun negative and conflicting politics. Come to the parliament and place your positive proposals," Ashraf said, addressing the BNP leaders. Ashraf said positive proposals would be accepted. His comments echo prime minister Sheikh Hasina's, who had invited the opposition chief to come to the parliament with her budget proposals. The BNP turned down the invite the next day. The ruling party organised the press conference to respond to opposition BNP's Monday's presentation of shadow budget. Terming the press conference unexpected, he said: "If the opposition leader gave her speech in the parliament we would not have to hold the press conference." The Awami League spokesman viewed that the opposition had no alternative to returning to the assembly. "They are depriving their voters by not coming to the parliament." "The main purpose of (Khaleda Zia) and her associates is to make the parliament ineffective. "When they need to protect their membership in the parliament they will return on some pretext." Ashraf alleged that Khaleda in her budget proposals had tried to confuse people by making a number of false comments about the government. "Economic growth does not come all of a sudden." He said it could only come from mid- and long-term investment, suitable policies and institutional efficiency. He said only the amount of deficit does not reflect the quality of budget. "It requires appropriate economic analysis. It requires a long-term vision for a sustainable development and high economic growth." Ashraf said such analysis is absent in the opposition leader's presentation. The local government minister said it would be in fact detrimental to the economy if one looks at merely budget deficit from surface instead of having proper knowledge of elementary economic theories. He was critical of the 1991-6 BNP government which, he said, had taken a lot of loan from the International Monetary Fund. Bangladesh will have to improve relations with India for its own sake, Ashraf said. India will pay Bangladesh for port and transportation service which will help reduce budget deficit. Transit and transhipment have been existent for a long time, he said. b
