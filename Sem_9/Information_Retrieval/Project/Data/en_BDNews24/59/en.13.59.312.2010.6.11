 Chittagong, Jun 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Trial of the country's first-ever electronic voting started on Friday in ward number 21 of Chittagong City Corporation. The two-day trial was organised for trouble-shooting before e-voting is formally introduced in the CCC elections scheduled for June 17. Votes will be cast through the electronic system at the 14 centres under ward number 21 in Jamalkhan area. In other wards, conventional system will be followed. Electorate of Jamalkhan area participated in the mock e-voting at Public Administration, National Primary School, Dr Khastagir Government High School and other polling centres. The trail will continue through to Saturday. Though a small number of voters partook in the trial, they were seen casting votes with great enthusiasm following the instructions from the polling officers. Rafiqul Islam, who cast a vote at the Public Administration centre, told bdnews24.com: "Though the electronic system is new, it will be much easier for voting than the previous manual one." Sukomal Das, assistant presiding officer of the centre, told bdnews24.com: "We are showing them (voters) how to do it and they are pressing the buttons." The process is easy, he added. Specialists from the Dhaka's BUET were working with polling officials at all the trial centres. After visiting a centre, Election Commission secretary Humayun Kabir told reporters: "We're introducing e-voting in only a ward of Chittagong. They system will be expanded gradually after review." To a question on the small turnout of voters, Kabir said only the heads of families came to get an idea about the new system. "Moreover, there is another day of the trial left on Saturday. That may be another reason," Kabir said. The EC has received 130 electronic voting machines (EVMs) from BUET, of which 37 were set aside for the trial and training of the staff. Names and symbols of the candidates were already installed in the remaining 93 EVMs, of which 79 would be set in booths and 14 kept standby. There would be 79 booths under 14 voting centres in the ward number 21, where there are 25,230 voters  12,879 males and 12,351 females. bdne
