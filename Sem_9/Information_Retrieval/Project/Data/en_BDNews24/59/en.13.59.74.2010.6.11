<TITLE> Police return to Proshika </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The police appear to have retaken control of the building of the large non-governmental organisation, Proshika, on Thursday evening just hours after the police had re-opened it earlier in the day after a three month period of closure. Proshika's chief executive officer Mahbub-ul-Karim told bdnews24.com that having handed over the keys of the building to its chief executive Mahbub-ul-Karim on Thursday afternoon, the policemen came to their building and threw out the security guards at around 10pm . "They [the police] said that the guards did not need to stay and took control of the building." A press release signed by Proshika's director Md Abdur Rob says that the police did not explain the reason for this, and the organisation's operations have become uncertain once again. The policemen were still at Proshika offices on Friday afternoon. The building had been locked by the police, for the second time on March 4 - and had been closed for three months and eight days. The police, however, appear to be giving contradictory statements about their role in the re-opening of the building on Thursday afternoon. On Thursday, Pallabi police chief Iqbal Hossain told bdnews24.com that they had handed over the keys to the present authorities on Thursday noon. "We had locked the building as the High Court stayed the case. We reopened the building soon after the end of the HC stay." However, on Friday, he told bdnews24.com that the police had not re-opened the Proshika building but that the NGO staff members had entered the building by themselves. "We re-locked the building to maintain discipline. The building will be handed over after the court 's decision." Rejecting the police version, Mahbub-ul-Karim said, "The policemen were patrolling the building. So we could not have simply walked in unless they had allowed us to do so." Proshika's governing body members removed its founding chairman Kazi Faruk Ahmed after a meeting in May last year. However, Kazi Faruk has claimed that he was re-elected chairman at a general meeting. bdnews24
