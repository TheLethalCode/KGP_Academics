 MEXICO CITY, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's government handed Congress a compromise energy reform plan on Tuesday that could attract foreign companies to a hunt for new oil reserves to rescue falling output in the world's No. 5 crude producer. After months of wrangling with the opposition over how much to lower barriers to private capital, Energy Minister Georgina Kessel gave the Senate a copy of a proposal that omits controversial risk-sharing alliances. But the plan by President Felipe Calderon lets state oil monopoly Pemex sweeten service contracts with private companies by adding performance-based incentives. The reform has been watered down to ensure a smooth passage through the divided Congress, but the government sees it as far-reaching enough to shore up the flagging oil industry, Deputy Energy Minister Jordy Herrera said. Calderon was due to give a television address later on Tuesday to explain his most ambitious reform attempt yet to a nation famously wary of private involvement in the cherished oil sector. "The central idea is to give Pemex more flexibility in working with outside companies," Herrera told a briefing with the foreign media. He said the conservative government was hopeful that backing from centrist lawmakers would give the bill the 50 percent of Congress plus one vote it needed to pass. Pemex blames its declining oil production and reserves on years of low spending under previous governments and the fact Mexico has some of the tightest restrictions in the world on private investment in oil. Mexico's oil production and reserves are both declining and Pemex lacks the technology and resources to explore for more crude deeper in Mexico's Gulf as fast as it needs to. BIG SUPPLIER Mexico is a top supplier of US crude, and oil exports provide some 40 percent of the government's fiscal income. Mexicans are highly sensitive to foreign involvement in the energy sector, which was nationalized in 1938. Although opposition parties would not back risk contracts to speed Mexico's entry to deep-sea oil fields, the compromise plan for incentive-based service contracts across Pemex's businesses might make it attractive and effective for private companies to work with Pemex in onshore and offshore oil. A top lawmaker from Calderon's party said the plan included letting Mexicans invest in "citizens' bonds" in Pemex. Pemex says teaming up with experienced foreign partners could get it producing from wells more than a kilometer deep in half the time it would take if it went alone. Risk contracts, like most oil-rich countries offer, would have been more attractive to private companies because they could win a share in crude deposits if oil were found in potentially huge deepwater fields. "There is nothing to do with privatization but the idea is that it will help Pemex have bigger resources," said Sen. Gustavo Madero, a member of Calderon's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, and on the upper house energy committee. Pemex's output is sliding from peaks in 2004 of 3.4 million barrels per day as its huge Cantarell field begins to dry up. As things stand, it says its crude output could drop by more than half over the next 13 years. Most deepwater-savvy oil majors are seen reluctant to share valuable know-how for less than a share in the oil discovered. The compromise oil reform could prompt small services companies to drill more wells rather than attract big deepwater players, analysts have said. Mexican left-wingers and many centrists oppose tampering with a clause in the Constitution giving Pemex sole rights to drill for Mexican oil, and leftists have threatened to scale up street protests once a reform was submitted. Calderon needs the help of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the third force in Congress which has backed earlier economic reforms but is more cautious this time around
