 Knysna, South Africa, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With heavy security everywhere, no public training sessions and a leading player refusing to talk to the press, the climate at France's World Cup base has suddenly deteriorated. Downpours on Wednesday, after days of gorgeous weather, provided a symbol for the brutal change of atmosphere at Knysna, Western Cape, where the former world champions are preparing for their first game, against Uruguay on Friday in Cape Town.

Another delicate subject was that the training sessions have been taking place on a pitch inside the boundaries of the team hotel, making it impossible for supporters to attend for security reasons. The FFF was not to blame for that either, Valentin said. "That pitch was not originally intended to become an official training pitch," he said. "The pitch we were planning to train on was allocated to Denmark, and we were then asked (by FIFA) to train on the pitch at the hotel." The players, too, have been blamed by media back home for their distant if not arrogant attitude. Some pointed out, however, that they were here to do a
