<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 11 (bdnews24.com) The Finance minister AMA Muhith made an angry outburst at a press conference on Friday, misinterpreting a question about the projected growth of the economy. He was speaking at a post-budget press conference at the National Economic Council on Friday. In response to a question on the apprehensions voiced by the Centre for Policy Dialogue about whether the country could achieve a 6.7 percent growth as projected in the budget, Muhith replied, "Those who believe that we should aspire for 8 or 9 percent growth are living in a fool's paradise." "Simply in a fool's paradise," he repeated. The reporter, however, had only referred to the Dhaka-based research organisation's doubts that the budgetary measures would not result in a 6.7 per cent level of growth as the finance minister had projected during his budget speech on Thursday. Muhith, however, admitted at the press conference that even 6.7 percent was a challenging target. "I myself expressed reservations about achieving the target." The finance minister betrayed his disappointment with the criticism when he spoke about the lagging tax-GDP ratio. "Sure it's low, but we have increased it by 0.7 percent and we target to increase it by another 0.5 percent in the next fiscal." Replying to a query on the over 16 percent increase in the defence budget, he said that the high allocation was made for the procurement of military hardware. "For years, there has been no such purchase and it has fallen upon our shoulders to make the purchase." On his suggestion that CNG prices be increased, the finance minister pointed out that currently natural gas was sold at a quarter of the price of octane. "The price structure is such that the situation is ripe for wastage of natural gas.
