 MOSCOW/ISTANBUL, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme have been "completely agreed upon," a Russian source said, and Washington said a resolution could be passed as early as Wednesday. Iran had earlier warned Russia on Tuesday against siding with Tehran's foes in supporting fresh sanctions. "The proposal on the sanctions against Iran has been completely agreed upon," said the Russian source close to Security Council talks, speaking in Moscow on condition of anonymity. Iran, meanwhile, summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran on and handed over documents it said showed a missing Iranian nuclear scientist had been kidnapped by the United States. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in London he was confident the Council would pass a resolution as early as Wednesday. "One of the many benefits of the resolution is that it will provide a legal platform for individual nations to then take additional actions that go well beyond the resolution itself. I believe that a number of nations are prepared to act pretty promptly," Gates added. "I do not think we have lost the opportunity to stop the Iranians from having nuclear weapons." A Western diplomat at the United Nations said a list of new Iranian individuals and firms to be blacklisted under a fourth round of sanctions had been agreed. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad admonished Russia at a news conference in Istanbul, where he was attending a summit along with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. "There is no big problem, but they must be careful not to be on the side of the enemies of the Iranian people," Ahmadinejad said. Putin, who said he expected to meet Ahmadinejad on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Istanbul, said the UN resolution had been "practically agreed" but that sanctions should not be "excessive." "We will have an opportunity to discuss these problems if my Iranian colleague will have such a need," he said. "I hold the opinion that this resolution should not be excessive, should not put Iran's leadership, the Iranian people in a tricky situation that creates barriers on the way of development of Iran's peaceful nuclear energy." FUEL SWAP DEAL The Iranian president said a nuclear fuel swap deal agreed by Tehran with Turkey and Brazil was an opportunity that would not be repeated. The deal, which has been rejected by the West as too little too late, was intended to defuse the crisis. Turkey and Brazil last month resurrected parts of a UN-backed offer for Tehran to part with 1,200 kg of low enriched uranium -- which is potential nuclear weapons material -- in return for special fuel rods for a medical research reactor. Ahmadinejad said the swap deal was a one-time offer. "We hope and still hope they will be able to use this opportunity, but we say this opportunity will not be repeated," he said. The United States and other powers have rejected the deal and submitted extended sanctions to the Security Council last month for approval. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Turkey and Brazil, both in the 15-member Security Council, say their deal with Iran removes the need for sanctions, as it created a diplomatic opening to tackle larger issues surrounding Tehran's nuclear programme. Turkish President Abdullah Gul urged Ahmadinejad on Monday to tell the international community his government was ready to cooperate and solve the dispute over its nuclear programme. The documents handed by Iran to the Swiss envoy in Tehran referred to Shahram Amiri, a researcher for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, who disappeared during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia a year ago. Tehran accused Riyadh of handing him over to the United States, a charge Saudi Arabia has denied. Iran's state television showed on Monday a video of a man it said was Amiri. In the footage Amiri said he had been kidnapped and taken to the United States where he was tortur
