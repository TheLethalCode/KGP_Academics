 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday issued an order asking the government to explain why 156 Bangladeshis should not be brought back home from Indian jails where they remain even after expiry of their prison terms. The bench comprising justices AHM Samsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin issued the rule on a petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Md Shahidul Islam on Feb 28. The secretaries for home and foreign affairs have been asked to answer the rule within two weeks. The date for the final hearing on the petition has been fixed for Mar 14. Referring to a report published in the daily Prothom Alo on Feb 12, which said 156 Bangladeshis are still in Bahrampur jail in India even after expiry of their prison terms, the petitioner pleaded for an order to bring them back. Deputy attorney general Akram Hossain Chowdhury appeared on behalf of the government during the hearing. bdnew
