Squad: Goalkeepers: Morgan De Sanctis (Napoli), Federico Marchetti (Cagliari), Salvatore Sirigu (Palermo) Defenders: Daniele Bonera (AC Milan), Leonardo Bonucci (Bari), Nicola Legrottaglie (Juventus), Fabio Cannavaro (Juventus), Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus), Mattia Cassani (Palermo), Christian Maggio (Napoli), Domenico Criscito (Genoa) Midfielders: Simone Pepe (Udinese), Riccardo Montolivo (Fiorentina), Angelo Palombo (Sampdoria), Andrea Pirlo (Milan), Claudio Marchisio (Juventus), Daniele De Rossi (AS Roma), Gennaro Gattuso (Milan), Andrea Cossu (Cagliari) Forwards: Marco Borriello (Milan), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Giampaolo Pazzini (Sampdoria), Fabio Quagliarella (Na
