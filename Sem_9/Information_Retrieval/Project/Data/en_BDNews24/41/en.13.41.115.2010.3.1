 MILAN, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A leaders Inter Milan shrugged off the suspensions of four players and conceding an early goal to win 3-2 at lowly Udinese on Sunday. Three straight draws had slashed their advantage at the top but their famed resilience coupled with some fantastic play kept the champions four points above second-placed AC Milan, who beat Atalanta 3-1. Inter were without the suspended Walter Samuel, Ivan Cordoba, Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari following last weekend's fiery 0-0 draw with Sampdoria and had coach Jose Mourinho banned from the bench. Midfielder Thiago Motta was forced to play in central defence and Kenya winger McDonald Mariga was handed a first start while struggling Samuel Eto'o was still only a substitute. Udinese, four points above the drop zone, had a great start when Simone Pepe rifled in after Antonio Di Natale's pass but Inter were soon level thanks to Mario Balotelli's angled shot from the edge of the area on six minutes.

Injury-hit AS Roma in third slipped seven points behind Inter after surrendering a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at Napoli, who equalised through Marek Hamsik's stoppage-time penalty. Fourth-placed Juventus, level with Napoli, host Palermo in Sunday's late game (1945 GMT) looking to open up a three-point gap in the race for the final Champions League qualifying spot with less than a third of the season to go. Genoa missed the chance to move level with Juve when they were beaten 4-3 at home by strugglers Bologna, who triumphed thanks to Adailton's hat-trick, while Sampdoria could have gone clear in fourth but for a 1-0 loss at Parma. Mid-table Chievo overcame Cagliari 2-1 while bottom side Siena boosted their outside hopes of avoiding the drop with a last-gasp 2-1 win at relegation rivals Livorno in the Tuscan d
