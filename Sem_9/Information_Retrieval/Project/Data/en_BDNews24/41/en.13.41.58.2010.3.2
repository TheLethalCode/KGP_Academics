 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday withdrew an arrest warrant against BNP senior vice president Tarique Rahman just a day after its issue. Lawyers of the BNP leader, who is currently residing in the UK, had earlier filed a petition on his behalf challenging an arrest warrant issued against him in an extortion case. Tarique's lawyer Sanaullah Miah told the court that his client was granted bail in the case in August 2008. The High Court also gave a stay order on the case proceedings, he said. He placed the copy of the High Court order before the court of Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mehdi Hasan Talukder. "Mistakes might happen; the arrest warrant has been issued but not made effective yet," Talukder said. The court gave a ruling later in the day, withdrawing the warrant, recording officer Ratan Sheikh told bdnews24.com. Petitions were also filed by two other accused in the case, including businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun, a close associate of Tarique. A Dhaka court issued warrants against Tarique and other accused on Monday in an extortion case filed in April 2007 by Khairul Bashar, general manager of construction firm Abdul Monem Ltd. The plaintiff Bashar accused Tarique and six associates of extorting Tk 20.31 crore from the construction company on different dates between 2001-2003. The court recorder had said Tarique and the other accused were due to appear on Monday. But they neither appeared nor did anyone submit a time petition on their behalf, on which the court issued warrants against the accused. Tarique, elder son of BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, is accused in over 10 corruption cases filed mostly during the past caretaker government. A Dhaka court on Monday also issued an arrest warrant against Tarique's younger brother Arafat Rahman Coco in a tax evasion case. Both Tarique and Coco have been out of the country since 2008. Jailed in corruption cases, they were released on bail separately by the past caretaker government to seek medical treatment in London and Bangkok respectively. b
