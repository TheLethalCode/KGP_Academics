<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 03 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Wednesday put a two-week freeze on a previous High Court order that had stayed a food ministry circular on food for work for the extreme poor. The circular was issued reassigning the power of carrying out the employment programmes for the extreme poor from the union councils to the upazila parishads. Appellate division chamber judge Md Mozammel Hossain issued the stay order upon a government petition. Justice Hossain also asked both parties to take initiative to hold the hearing on the petition in the HC within the two weeks of the SC injunction. Additional attorney general Murad Reza was present on behalf of the government while barrister Aminul Haque stood for the petitioners. The Food and Disaster Management ministry issued the circular on Feb 16. The HC on Feb 28 stayed the circular upon two writ petitions filed by Bangladesh Union Parishad Forum and Bangladesh Union Parishad Association. The HC also had asked the government to explain why the circular should not be declared illegal. bdne
