 Rangamati, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities on Monday lifted a nine-day Section 144 clampdown, imposed in the wake of bloody clashes between Bangali settlers and hill people, on Baghaihat and Baghaichhari upazila headquarters. Baghaichhari upazila nirbahi officer Bashir-ul Haq Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com that the clampdown was withdrawn at 10am following a decision made at an emergency meeting held with upazila chairman Sudarshan Chakma in the chair. Administrative officials and leaders of the indigenous and Bangali settler communities attended the meeting. Earlier on Feb 28, Section 144 clampdown was lifted from Khagrachhari district town. Local people, however, said indigenous villagers of Baghaihat have not yet retuned to their homes for living as they still feel insecure. They said though they are coming to their homes for receiving relief materials from different non-government organizations, they are not staying there. At least two persons were killed in the clashes at Baghaihat between indigenous and settler communities. Tribal leaders claimed at least six indigenous villagers were killed as the army opened fire on them during the clashes. The Section 144 clampdown was imposed on Baghaihat and Baghaichhari upazila headquarters, banning public gathering, following the clashes.
