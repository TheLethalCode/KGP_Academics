<TITLE> GAZIPUR FIRE : Probe seeks action against factory authorities </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  A probe report has found the managing director and the factory authorities responsible for the fire at Garib and Garib Sweaters Ltd, which claimed the lives of 21 workers on Feb 25, and strongly recommended legal action be taken against them. The report cited the main reason behind the deaths was attributed to lack of proper ventilation due to illegal structures of the factory. Gazipur district authorities formed a three-member probe committee the day after the fire. It submitted its report to the deputy commissioner on Tuesday. Gazipur deputy commissioner Md. Kamal Uddin Talukder presented the committee's findings to journalists. The report said unauthorised steel construction on the sixth floor, steel and glass enclosures around the stairs and closed windows blocked any path for toxic smoke to escape, leading to suffocation of the workers. It said the lack of fire training was also to blame as no one was able to use fire extinguishers, which were located on each floor, as the fire broke out. The report also highlighted the cut-off of the main and backup power supply following the outbreak of fire, which made it impossible for the workers on the sixth floor to escape as they could not find their way down in the dark. 'FACTORY AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATHS' The report held the factory's managing director and the management wholly responsible for the deaths as they failed to appoint capable workers to operate fire extinguishers, left no space for smoke to escape, in particular sealing ventilation routes with illegal construction on the sixth floor, and did not pay attention to safety of workers. The probe report made 19 recommendations including legal action against those responsible. It also recommended removing the unauthorised steel structure on the sixth floor, placing easily removable grills and glass for emergencies, putting fire escape device from the top floor to the ground, appointing trained fire fighters and electricians and putting battery-operated backup power supply at every floor. The probe report also gave a short description of the incident. It said fire erupted from a short circuit on the first floor switchboard, which quickly spread onto a stack of readymade acrylic sweaters stored on the floor. A security officer tried to douse flames with a hose pipe but failed. As the factory had closed for the day, most workers had left by the time the fire broke out. But the first, second and sixth floors were occupied. Eighteen workers stuck on the sixth floor and three on the second floor died from suffocation caused by the smoke from the fire. bdn
