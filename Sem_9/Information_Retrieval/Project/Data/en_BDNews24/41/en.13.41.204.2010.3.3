 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)A special Darbar of the BDR director general Md Mainul Islam began at Pilkhana on Wednesday morning, at an auditorium next to the Durbar Hall. Officials of all ranks, JCO and other designated officials were in attendance from 11am. The Darbar was held as part of the annual Bangladesh Rifles Week programmes, being curtailed into a single day this year, as a mark of respect for those who lost their lives in the BDR mutiny that was sparked during the annual event last February. It was not being held in the Darbar Hall where the armed uprising against officers began last year, as the hall itself is being used as the venue of the special court set up to try the mutineers. The Feb 25-26 Pilkhana tragedy began on the second day of the yearly occasion, which was inaugurated the day before by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. BDR spokesperson Muhsin Reza told bdnews24.com, "The week's programmes have been restricted to one day to show respect for those who were killed at Pilkhana." "Awards will be distributed among the border guards for their success in different fields," he said The government has approved a new name, , Border Guards Bangladesh, a new uniform, insignia and organogram for the border force as part of its reformation in wake of the mutiny last year in which nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the BDR, lost their lives. b
