 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has extended the deadline by six months for relocation of environmentally hazardous tanneries from Hazaribagh in the city centre to a special industrial zone near Savar on the outskirts. The bench of justice Mamtazuddin and justice Naima Haider gave the extension on a petition by the government and tanneries. On June 23 last year, the High Court ordered all tanneries in Hazaribagh to quit the area by Feb 28 2010 following a petition by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA) and Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB). The verdict last year also made it mandatory for installation of Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) for all industries, including the tanneries, by June 2010. The BSCIC, which is implementing the tanneries estate, petitioned the High Court for an extension for relocation on Feb 1 to complete construction of a Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) at the Savar estate before the tanneries start operation there. The High Court on Sunday ordered the government to submit a progress report of the under construction industrial estate near Savar within three months, HRPB lawyer Manzil Morshed told reporters after the ruling. The court also directed the office of the attorney general to deal with the demands for compensation by tannery owners for relocation of their industries and intervention in transferring bank liabilities of the tanners, Shaheen Ahmed, president of Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA) told bdnews24.com. Tanners at a views exchange meeting with the industries minister, state minister for law and BSCIC officials on Jan 25, called for the government to complete CETP. They also demanded compensation for their shifting costs. Shaheen on Sunday said, "We're asking for the proposed compensation of Tk 250 crore made by the industries secretary in 2006." There are 184 tanneries currently operating in Hazaribagh, Shaheen told bdnews24.com. The 200-acre Savar project, initiated in January 2003, was set to be complete by December 2005. However, the construction schedule was later extended to June 2010. BSCIC is implementing the project at a cost of around Tk 545 crore. The preliminary works at the estate with necessary infrastructure and utilities including roads, power and gas, purified water supply as well as security have already been installed, a BSCIC official said. Tender for the CETP was floated for a second time and the evaluation procedure is underway, deputy general manager of the estate Md Waliur Rahman told bdnews24.com last week. Thirteen proposals are being scrutinised. The government of Bangladesh will finance the CETP, for which the plot owners will pay in instalments, the official added. Industries minister Dilip Barua asked the tanneries last month to start moving parallel to the construction of the CETP. However, Shaheen, citing the MoU signed between the tanners and the government, said, "We're supposed to move after the CETP is built." During Sunday's High Court hearing Fazle Nur Taposh argued for the tanners, Iqbal Kabir Liton for BELA and Manzil Morshed for HRPB, while additional attorney general MK Rahman represented the government. bdnews
