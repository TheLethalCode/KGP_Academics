 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka stocks opened the week with a massive slide as the general index shed two percent with almost 80 percent of the traded scrips losing value. The prime bourse's general index or DGEN maintained a downward curve through the day. It fell by 123.36 points or 2.17 percent, after seeing a historic fall of 137 points the previous week (Feb 22). Brokerage house officials cited "uncertainty" as the key factor behind the fall. "Investors are kind of nervous over recent regulatory interventions and erratic market movements," said an official of brokerage firm Latif Securities. He added that most of their clients were on a "fund removing" approach. Meanwhile, institutional investors said they were totally on the dark of why the market is behaving in such a manner. "The banking sector is seeing sustained losses, which is an unusual phenomenon during this part of the year as it's the time to enjoy bonus shares and dividends," said an official of an institutional investment company. A top official of a merchant bank, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that he had "no explanations" behind the market behaviour. Meanwhile, the bourse authority shrugged-off "uncertainty among investors" as a factor behind the fall. "Price correction and profit-taking is the reason behind the fall," DSE president Rakibur Rahman told bdnews24.com. He, however, cited the fall in the price of Grameenphone shares as a major contributor to the slide in the index. "If GP loses just Tk 1 the index falls by 3 points." GP, the most weighted share on the bourse, fell by Tk 13.3 or 3.6 percent on Sunday. Of the 233 traded issues, 186 fell, 45 gained and two held steady. The daily turnover amounted to Tk 8.61 billion--the lowest in two months. Lanka Bangla Finance came out as the turnover leader with shares of Tk 938.478 million traded, gaining by 4.81 percent. Second-in-line Beximco fell 1.85 percent with a turnover of Tk 734.192 million. Market mover GP followed with shares of Tk 543.773 million changing hands. Bex Tex saw a turnover of Tk 413.961 million while AB Bank followed it with shares of Tk 405.461 million traded. Southeast Bank, Makson Spinning, Navana CNG, Summit Power and Titas Gas were the other turnover leaders.
