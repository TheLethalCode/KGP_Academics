 Dhaka, Mar 04 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a petition filed by the City Group of Industries seeking to appeal a previous High Court verdict. The High Court on Feb 23 quashed a petition by the group challenging a demolition order against illegal structures built on the Sitalakhya river. An Appellate Division bench, headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, on Thursday ordered City Group to file a regular leave to appeal against the High Court verdict. The High Court on Jan 24 this year had ordered authorities to begin demolishing all illegal structures built on the banks of the four rivers surrounding the capital from February. In line with the directive, the Narayanganj district administration on Feb 9 ordered the City Group of Industries to dismantle its jetties set up on the bank of the Sitalakhya at North Rupashi village in Rupganj. bdnew
