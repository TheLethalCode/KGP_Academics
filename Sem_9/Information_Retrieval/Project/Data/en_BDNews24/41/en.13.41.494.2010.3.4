<TITLE> 'Transit' debate simmers on </TITLE>

 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com)The "transit" debate was sparked again on Thursday as experts stressed continuing negotiations with New Delhi to maximise benefits of connectivity with India. Providing connectivity and use of port facilities should open up more export opportunities to India, according to discussants at a seminar on 'Advancing Bangladesh-India Economic Cooperation', hosted by Centre for Policy Dialogue and attended by foreign minister Dipu Moni. Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of CPD, a private think tank, said attracting investment from India, as well as targeting the Indian market, will be critical to realising Bangladesh's export opportunities in India. "Connectivity should significantly enhance Bangladeshi export to India," he said. Former foreign secretary Reaz Rahman, however, disagreed saying that the large trade gap between the two countries would not come down only by providing "transit". He came down hard on the joint communiqu announced during the prime minister's recent India visit. "It [the communiqu] says they will 'address' the issue of removing tariff and non-tariff barriers, but it does not actually say they will remove them." Rahman, now an adviser to BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, said that the concept of bilateral trade agreements helping to reduce trade gaps is controversial. "Rather, a UNESCAP and World Bank study of 2007 suggests that trade liberalisation would help." According to Rahman, India has also failed to clear its position yet on Bangladesh allowing Nepal and Bhutan to use its port facilities. The foreign minister dismissed the ex-secretary's comments, saying the communiqu signed in 1992 and 2006 during Khaleda Zia's visit to India as premier "had yielded nothing". "The recent communiqu has 50 clauses, but the one in 92 had 15 clauses and in 2006 it had only eight clauses." She told the discussion that the earlier communiqus did not address any vital issues like water sharing or border disputes. "It [the current communiqu] should be viewed as the first step of a good start." Dipu Moni also slammed the BNP government for not making any progress in connecting with the Asian Highway and submarine cable links. "Those wrong decisions have left us now trying to catching up with the rest of the world." She added that the prime outcome of the PM's recent India visit was the regaining of mutual trust and confidence between the countries, which fell short for years.
