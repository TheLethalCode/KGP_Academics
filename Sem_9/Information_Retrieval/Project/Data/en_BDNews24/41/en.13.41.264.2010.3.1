 Khulna, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  A massive section of a river embankment at Khulna's Dakope upazila collapsed Monday, flooding 18 villages. Approximately two thousand families have been affected by the flooding. Upazila chairman Abul Hossain said, "Nearly 25 square miles have been flooded. Water has risen to knee high in the flooded homes. Other than this, 50-60 ponds and fisheries have overflowed." Anwar Hossain, deputy assistant engineer of Khulna Water Development Board, said a 650-metre section of the embankment collapsed at Sutarkhali village of Sutarkhali union due to strong currents of the Shibsa river. "Due to the full moon, a heightened tide of 4-5 feet above normal levels caused strong currents to breach the embankment," he told bdnews24.com. Repairs are ongoing, he added. Upazila chairman Abul Hossain blamed poor upkeep of the embankment for the breach. "The embankment caved in to pressure of water during the tide due to long lack of maintenance," he said. The flooded villages are Nalian, Sutarkhali, Nalian Maddhyapara, Baintala,Gunari, Madhyam Gunari, Kalabogi, Uttarpara, Dakkhin Nalian, Purbogunari, Katabunia, Keuratala, Mazhipara, Golbunia, Jaliakhali, Bhitebhanga, Srinagar and Telirkona. bdnews
