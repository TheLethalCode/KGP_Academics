 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  A special judge's court on Wednesday deferred charge framing in the Zia Orphanage Trust case. Judge Mozammel Hossain set Apr 21 for a new hearing date following time motions by defence lawyers. Lawyers also told the court that a petition on staying proceedings of the case is now pending in the High Court. The High Court on Feb 3 ordered the trial court to take into cognisance the lawyers' appeal for time until the resolution of the petition. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and son Tarique Rahman, the two main accused in the case, petitioned to stay the case proceedings on Sept 15 last year. The case, filed on July 3 2008, accuses Khaleda, Tarique and four others of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed "only on paper". The charge sheet was submitted on Aug 5 that year. Others who were accused include late president Ziaur Rahman's nephew Mominur Rahman, former bureaucrat Dr Kamaludddin Siddiqui and former BNP MP Quazi Salimul Haq. Khaleda, leader of the opposition, and a two-time former prime minister, and Tarique, senior vice-chairman of BNP, have both received bail in the case. Tarique is currently residing in the UK. None of the accused were present in Wednesday's proceedings. b
