 Dhaka, Mar 2(bdnews24.com)The annual Bangladesh Rifles Week programmes are being condensed into a single day this year, as the event marks a year since the BDR mutiny last year. Durbar will not be held at the same hall where the bloody rebellion erupted last year. Peelkhana tragedy took place while congregation was going on at Durbar Hall during Rifles Week-2009. A special Durbar of the BDR director general will be held at 10am at a new venue as the previous hall is being used as special court to try the mutineers. Public relation officer of BDR Muhsin Reza told bdnews24.com, "Officials of all ranks, JCO and other designated officials will attend the special durbar." "Awards will be distributed among the selected members from different categories for their feat in different fields." The programmes have been squeezed into one day to show respect for those who were martyred at Peelkhana, he said Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated Rifles Week-2009 on Feb 24 last year. b
