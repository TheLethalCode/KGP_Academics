 Rajshahi, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  A Rajshsahi court sent 167 Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Chhatra Shibir activists, arrested for clashing with police in wake of campus violence at Rajshahi University last month, to jail on Wednesday. Of the accused, 162 were brought to Rajshahi Metropolitan Magistrate Court at noon. Five of the accused were not present in court due to exams. Metropolitan magistrate Amirul Islam ordered the accused to be sent to Rajshahi Central Jail after their lawyers failed to present required papers for their bail. He also fixed the next hearing for April 4. The 167 Jamaat-Shibir activists were arrested from different districts on a police complaint at Motihar Police Station for attack on police personnel and obstruction of duty. Shibir and pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed at the university on Feb 8. Shibir activists, allegedly instigated by Jamaat, attacked BCL members on campus. A student and BCL activist Faruk Hossain was killed during the attack. His body was recovered from a manhole next to Shah Makhdum Hall on Feb 9. As the government launched a countrywide drive to hunt down and arrest 'Shibir-Jamaat' cadres, their activists and supporters demonstrated at Rajshahi, clashing with police. OFFICIAL ARRESTED A university official was arrested from the campus premises on Wednesday on suspicion of being involved in the Jamaat-Shibir clash with police. The arrested official is a fourth-grade official of the university's pharmacy department. Tofazzal Hossain, in charge of Motihar Police Station, told journalist that the suspect was arrested from the campus around 12.30pm.
