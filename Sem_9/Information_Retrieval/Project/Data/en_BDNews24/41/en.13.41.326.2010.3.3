 Chittagong, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  Ship-breaking yards in Chittagong resumed full operations on Wednesday after 10 days of protests against stricter environmental regulations of the hazardous industry. Owners have led workers in protests from Feb 21 against a commerce ministry order requiring environmental clearance certificates for import of scrap ships. The protests ended following a "successful" discussion with the government, the ship breakers said. "We have decided to reopen the yards after a successful discussion with commerce ministry on the withdrawal of the order," said Jafar Alam, president of Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association. "We also considered the workers' interests," he said. Alam, however, threatened to shut their yards again if the government did not cancel its order. The High Court, on Jan 21, ordered authorities to ensure scrap ships are certified as free of toxic chemicals before entering Bangladesh territory. It also ordered closure of yards that could not provide certification for ships, which are in the process of being broken. The ship-breaking yards organised worker demonstrations in the port city, including blockades of the main Dhaka-Chittagong highway, rallies and submission of memoranda to the prime minister, to press for the reopening of the yards. Some 30,000 workers are employed by about a hundred ship-breaking yards along the Sitakunda coast of Chittagong district. bdne
