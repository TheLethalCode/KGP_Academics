 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)The government has hiked electricity prices, up by 4 to 7.6 percent for household consumers, effective from March 1. Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission made the announcement on Tuesday. Households consuming 0-100 kWh will now pay an increased tariff Tk 2.60 per unit, up by 4 percent from the previous charge. Domestic consumers under DESCO in the 101-400 kWh slab will now be charged Tk 3.30 per unit, up by 4.76 percent. Those consuming above 400 kWh will have to pay Tk 5.65 per unit, a rise of 7.62 percent. Prices for small industries in the flat rate, off peak and peak hour slabs have been hiked to Tk 4.35, Tk 3.50 and Tk 5.95 per kWh, rising by 8.21 percent, 9.38 percent and 5.87 percent respectively. Commercial consumers face hikes of 3.05 percent to Tk 8.45 per kWh during peak hours, 6.58 percent to Tk 4.05 kWh in off-peak hours or 5.28 percent to Tk 5.58 kWh as a flat rate. Tariff in the agriculture sector, Tk 1.94 per kWh, will remain unchanged. The government last increased tariffs for consumers in March 2007 and the bulk tariff for PDB's clients in October 2008. BERC decided on the new tariffs following requests by four state-run entitiesPower Development Board (PDB), Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC), Dhaka Electricity Supply Company Limited (DESCO) and West Zone Power Development Company Ltd (WZPDCL). The operators have been seeking to raise prices for some time on the grounds that they were suffering losses. Desco chairman Syed Yusuf Hossain addressed the briefing. He said the tariff hike would help cut wastage of power and improve quality of service. He said all government-run power companies, except Desco, are now incurring losses due to low electricity tariffs. The chairman said Desco posted a profit of Tk 57 crore last fiscal year while Power Development Board (PDB) incurred a loss of Tk 228 crore and Dhaka Power Distribution Co Ltd (DPDC) Tk 30 crore. He said PDB might earn a profit of Tk 114 crore and DPDC of Tk 132 crore next fiscal year thanks to the tariff hike. He did not offer a projection of Desco's profit following the hike.
