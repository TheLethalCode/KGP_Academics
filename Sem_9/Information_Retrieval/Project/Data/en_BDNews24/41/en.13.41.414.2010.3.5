<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  At least three workers died by inhaling toxic fumes at a tannery in capital's Hazaribagh area on Friday. Police said it appeared that the death was caused by toxic fumes created from a chemical reaction. Nine other workers also were affected by the toxic fumes accidentally created at the Apex Tannery around 7am, police said. Hazaribagh thana police chief Enamul Haque told bdnews24.com, "The three workers died on the spot after inhaling the toxic fumes." The dead workers have been identified as Md Solayman, 55, Shah Alam, 45, and Dulal Mia, 45. The other sick labourers were first rushed to Sikder Medical College and from there taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Apex Tannery executive director (production and marketing) MA Wajed told bdnews24.com, "The accident was caused by error of the workers. The workers in the night shift accidentally mixed chemicals in the wrong drum. The morning shift workers were instantly affected when they opened it." Md Ali, manager (Technical), said, "Leather is processed in three steps inside the wooden drums. The first step is soaking (leather is cleaned with salt), then liming (cleaned with lime) and then de-liming (soaked in sodium sulphate)." "The workers of the night shift accidentally mixed chemicals in the wrong drum leading to the production of carbon monoxide. When the morning shift workers activated the drum, they detected that something was amiss and opened it to check. The three standing there died instantly from the poisonous fumes. Other workers of the floor who rushed to help them were also affected." Wajed said that families of the deceased workers will be given as much compensation as possible from the organisation. Alamgir, a worker present during the accident said, "Initially we did not understand what happened. Nothing like this happened before. We rushed there seeing the three lying on the floor. But we collapsed after the fumes entered our nose. Others came and pulled us away." A case for unnatural death was filed at Hazaribagh Police Station for the incident. The High Court, on June 23 last year, ordered all tanneries in Hazaribagh to vacate the area by Feb 28, 2010. The court, however, extended the deadline by six months for the relocation of the environmentally hazardous industries on Feb 28. bdnews
