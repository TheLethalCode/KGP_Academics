<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)The astronomical price of hilsa fish can be halved if the influence of the middlemen in the supply chain could be drastically reduced, according to findings by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Research. Currently, the supply and marketing of hilsa accounts for nearly 53 percent of the cost of a fish. This was disclosed at a workshop on "The supply chain and prices of hilsa fish in Bangladesh" in Dhaka on Thursday. Presenting the findings, BIDS senior research fellow S.M. Zulfiker Ali said that there are eight layers of middlemen from the fisherman to the small fish seller. Of them, three are hoarders, two whole sellers, owners of boat and fishnet, retailers and fishermen. "Unfortunately, the fishermen who are directly involved in the catch get a puny 1.5 percent of the total price of a fish", Ali said. According to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the retail price of per kg hilsa in Dhaka on Thursday was between Tk 380/ and Tk 420/. A year ago the price was between Tk 280/ and Tk. 320/. In order to bring down the price of a hilsa to half, the BIDS has made some recommendations, which include enhancing credit facilities for the fishermen, infrastructure development and community-based fish marketing. Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas, who was the chief guest at the workshop, said the fishermen must be given adequate financial help and provided with equipments to cut the influence of the middlemen. "We're considering to provide the fishermen similar credit facilities and subsidies given to farmers", he said, but didn't specify as to when and how it would be given. At present, the ministry is conducting a survey to determine the actual number of fishermen in the country, an official of the fisheries ministry told bdnews24.co
