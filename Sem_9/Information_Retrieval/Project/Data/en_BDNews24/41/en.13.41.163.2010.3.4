<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The memoirs of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will appear in September, the Random House publishing group announced on Thursday. Blair, who swept to power as leader of the Labour party in 1997 before stepping down 10 years later, said in a statement that he had aimed to write about "the human as much as the political dimensions of life as prime minister". Gail Rebuck, chairman and chief executive of Random House, said "Tony Blair: The Journey" was frank, open, revealing and written in an intimate and accessible style. "As an account of the nature and uses of power, it will have a readership that extends well beyond politics, to all those who want to understand the challenge of leadership in today's world," Rebuck said. The terms of the deal, which was first announced in 2007, have not been disclosed. The book will appear in Britain in hardback on the Hutchinson imprint and cost 25 pounds. It will also be available as an eBook and audio, read by Blair himself. It will be published simultaneously in the United States by Knopf and in Canada by Knopf Can
