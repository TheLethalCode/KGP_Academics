 Dhaka, February 28 (bdnews24.com)Amid continued criticism by human rights organizations and disapproval shown by the court, another incident of alleged 'crossfire' left two killed in Keraniganj early on Sunday. The dead were identified as Bappi alias Pappu, 26, and Abdus Sattar, 25, both of whom faced more than one cases including murder charges, Keraniganj police said. South Keraniganj police chief Nilotpal Dey told bdnews24.com that Bappi had five cases filed against him, including one on charge of murder. RAB-10 official ABM Enamul Kabir said, "Tipped of about the presence of armed terrorists, a RAB contingent conducted a raid in South Keraniganj early on Sunday." "At around 1:30am, terrorists hiding near Oriental Textile Mills High School in Mirerbag opened fire on RAB personnel approaching the hideout and RAB retaliated." In course of the gunfight, the terrorists fled the scene, leaving the bodies of Bappi and Sattar on the spot, RAB said. RAB claimed that two of the miscreants got killed in the shootout, while the mother of one of the deceased alleged that RAB had arrested her son on Saturday morning. Enamul said they retrieved a foreign-made pistol, a revolver and 13 rounds of revolver ammunition from the scene. Two RAB members were also injured in the shootout, he added. The bodies were sent to Mitford Hospital for autopsy. Bappi, a resident of Mirpur 11, was from Kalakopa Bandura under Nawabganj police station, his mother Shaheena Begum told reporters. She said a RAB contingent had detained Bappi from Mirpur on Saturday morning. Bappi used to run a phone-fax shop in Mirpur, she said. His wife Champa Begum also lives in Mirpur. Sattar, who hailed from Khejurbagh in South Keraniganj, had two cases filed against him including one for murder. RAB claimed that Bappi and Sattar were involved in the killing two youths in Khejurbagh early this month. bdnew
