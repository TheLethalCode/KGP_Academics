<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High court has ordered the government and police to not arrest any women or girl for not wearing veils. The order was given Tuesday by the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and ATM Fazle Kabir based on a petition by three Supreme Court lawyers, KM Hafijul Alam, Mahbub Shafique and Imranul Hye. The petition referred to a report in the Dainik Amader Shomoy on Monday about Rangpur's Detective Branch police detaining 19 women in various areas of the city for "not wearing veils". The hearing was conducted by barrister Mahbub Shafique on behalf of the petitioners. After a short hearing, the court gave a ruling asking several government officials including the home secretary, IG police, and inspector Golam Minhaz of DB police, to explain why the case should not be investigated and legal actions taken against those involved in the detention of the women. The court also asked Minhaz to be present at the court on Apr 4.
