 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Police are on the hunt for the son of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Abdul Hamid Paban, who they say planned the recent blasts in front of the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office for his own ends. An associate of Paban's, Golam Sabbir Shovon, who was detained and questioned Saturday, told police of the 'plot', Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque told a press conference. "We are trying to arrest Paban," he said. He said they earlier confirmed Paban's connection with the incident but they did not have sufficient evidence against him for an arrest. Two bombs exploded on Feb 23 on the road in front of the political office of BNP chief and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. The handmade bombs, popularly called 'cocktails', were reportedly thrown from a car and a motorbike, witnesses said at the time. Deputy police commissioner of Gulshan zone Nurul Alam told bdnews24.com on the day that no one had been hurt in the attack. However, the opposition party claimed at least one person was hurt in the explosions, including Paban. DMP's Detective Branch that day arrested a local Chhatra Dal leader, Pradip Shaha, after he was spotted fleeing from the area on a motorbike and stopped by locals. A DB team police picked Shovon up Saturday night in front of Bashundhara City for questioning in connection with the bomb attack. Two cars were also impounded from Shovon's Kalabagan house. Shovon during the police press briefing Sunday, said Paban had taken him to Gulshan on Feb 23 and told him of the bomb attack plan. Paban told his friend that if news such as "the son of Delwar Hossain was attacked" was published that would help him to get a post in the BNP's metropolitan committee. Shovon said Paban got out of his (Shovon's) car a little way from Khaleda's office. Two other men got into the car at that time, he said. Paban then walked over and stood in front of the Gulshan office gate, said Shovon. After a while, they drove past the office gate. After the blasts the two men told him to drive away fast, Shovon said. Another man was following the car with a motorbike, he added. The two young men got down in Bijoy Sarani, Shovon said. The man on the motorcycle was Pradip Shaha, arrested from the area just after the blast, police said. Detectives picked Shovon up on info from Pradip during questioning, they said. bd
