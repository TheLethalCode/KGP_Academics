 MANILA, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian-led peace monitors from three Islamic states were beginning a mission to oversee a ceasefire agreement in the southern Philippines on Monday, paving the way for the resumption of stop-start peace talks this week. Since 2001, Malaysia has been brokering negotiations between Manila and the country's largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), to end 40 years of conflict that has killed more than 120,000 people.

"We're not rushing things because this may only create more trouble on the ground if we agree on a half-baked peace formula. We also realise that this government will end its term in June." Mohaqher Iqbal, the rebels' chief negotiator, told Reuters his panel would attend the meeting to find out if the government would make an attractive political offer. "We're not seeking to separate and create a new state," Iqbal said by phone from his hideout on Mindanao. "We're only asking the government to recognise our right for self-determination and we're not even trying to reclaim areas where Muslims have become a minorit
