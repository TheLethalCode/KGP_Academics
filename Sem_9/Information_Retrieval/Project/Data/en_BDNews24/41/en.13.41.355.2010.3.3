 DURBAN, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA president Sepp Blatter needed to put pressure on South Africa's World Cup organisers to increase the pace of preparations but the country was a good choice to host the 2010 finals, he said on Tuesday. Blatter used a news conference marking 100 days to the start of the tournament on June 11 to again round on those who doubted South Africa had the capacity to stage the 32-team event.

"There will be no ripping off of any of the passengers by artificially increasing the airline ticket prices," he said, although substantial increases having already taken place.
