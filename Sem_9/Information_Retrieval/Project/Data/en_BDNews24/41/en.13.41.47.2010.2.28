 (CORRECTION - Corrected in paras 1 and 2: three arbitrators appointed, including Rudiger Wolfrum; corrected in para 4: appointments made by ITLOS president) Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has appointed three arbitrators to settle the maritime disputes between Bangladesh and India, said a foreign ministry official. With the appointment of three arbitratorsRudiger Wolfrum of Germany, Tullio Treves of Italy and Ivan Shearer of Australiathe tribunal gets the required five-member panel, which will finalise the maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Foreign ministry officials hope the tribunal would bring an end to the long-standing disputes between Dhaka and New Delhi over the claim of 10 oil and gas blocks in the Bay of Bengal. "According to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ITLOS president has nominated three arbitrators," a senior foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com Sunday.

On the other hand, India and Myanmar press for "equi-distance" principle, which, Dhaka says, will deprive Bangladesh of 17 out of 28 sea blocks. India makes claim on 10 and Myanmar demands 7 sea blocks. India and Myanmar claim the Bay of Bengal in such a way, which would block Bangladesh's access to sea routes. In November 2008, Bangladesh and Myanmar was on the verge of getting into an armed conflict over oil and gas exploration in the disputed sea blocks. Tension also rose high in December 2008 as an Indian survey vessel intruded into the disputed waters. The problems, however, were resolved through diplomatic initiatives.
