<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has declared three corruption charges against prime minister Sheikh Hasina illegal. All three suits were in connection with the construction of Bangabandhu Novo Theatre accusing Hasina of corruption. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin and Borhanuddin gave the order on Thursday. The court in its ruling said that the cases were filed to harass Hasina. The now-defunct Bureau of Anti-corruption filed the cases with Tejgaon Police Station in March 2002, during the BNP-Jamaat alliance government's term. The cases were later handed to the Anti-corruption Commission. The former ACC chairman in August 2005 in a letter asked the police to submit charge-sheets in the cases. Hasina, then the opposition leader, filed three writ petitions challenging the letter. The court in its Thursday's ruling declared the letter illegal and the proceedings following the letter unlawful. bd
