 LONDON, Mar 1 (bdnews24com/Reuters) - Some 25,000 council jobs are likely to be cut across England in the next three to five years as central government spending is slashed to reduce the record budget deficit, a BBC survey said on Monday. The survey by BBC English Regions was based on answers from 49 councils with a combined workforce of 256,000 who were able to predict job losses in the wake of falling revenues. According to the Local Government Association (LGA) 75 percent of council funding comes from central government coffers and 25 percent from council tax revenue. LGA chairman Margaret Eaton said local authorities had been hit by a "perfect storm" of falling revenue which had to be managed. "Low interest rates mean councils are much less able to rely on their savings, plummeting house and land prices have hit hard and income from leisure centres and a range of other services has fallen," she said in a statement. Roads, libraries, the arts and leisure services were likely to be most at risk, the survey found, while children's social services, care for the homeless and planning were more likely to be protected. Eight authorities -- Kirklees, Leeds, City of Bradford, Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Surrey -- said 1,000 or more posts might have to go within five years. Birmingham City Council, Britain's largest authority, said last week that up to 2,000 jobs would have to go in the next financial year to save 69 million pounds. Communities Secretary John Denham said front-line budgets could be protected by making "efficiency savings" instead. He also said councils could not blame central government cuts to funding this year as spending had risen by an average of 4 percent. "In the medium term, finances are going to be tighter but I'm very clear -- councils should be able to protect and improve frontline services, the things that matter to the public, if they make the necessary efficiency savings behind the scenes," he told BBC television. Tony Travers, the director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, said frontline services would inevitably suffer. "Nothing like this has happened for a generation," he told BBC radio. "To minimise the impacts on the public would require massive efficiencies in all services, higher charges for many, and sharing back-office staff with other public bodies." Severe job losses are likely to be greeted by union opposition. Last week the Public and Commercial Services Union said 270,000 civil servants would go on strike this month in a dispute over redundancy p
