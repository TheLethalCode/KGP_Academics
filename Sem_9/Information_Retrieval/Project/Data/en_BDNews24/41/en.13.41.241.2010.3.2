 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)----State minister for environment and forest Hasan Mahmud sought the World Bank's cooperation in revamping the jute industry as demand for jute products grows worldwide. World Bank's South Asian director Pulock Chatterji called on the minister at his office on Tuesday. Ministry spokesperson Mustafa Kamal Pasha briefed reporters after the meeting. The minister said that jute production was environmentally sound as cultivation requires less use of fertiliser and pesticides compared to other crops, while jute products are biodegradable. Hasan Mahmud said the demand for jute products was growing worldwide precisely because the industry is seen as a green one with no little impact on the environment. The Bangladesh economy could experience a great boost if decommissioned jute mills are reopened, the minister said.

He said the World Bank would decide on a possible initiative soon. b
