<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with her family, moved into the Gana Bhaban on Friday. The Gana Bhaban at the capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area, and close to the parliament, will be Hasina's official residence from now on. Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, Hasina's only son, will also reside with her, a high official of the PM office told bdnews24.com. Wazed has recently become a primary member of the ruling Awami League. After becoming prime minister a little over a year ago, she moved to the State Guest House Jamuna from Sudha Sadan in Dhanmondi. She couldn't go directly to the Gono Bhaban, the official residence of the prime minister, as it was under renovation. Hasina is moving to the official residence after one year and two months since she took office in January 2009. She had moved into Gano Bhaban straight after being sworn in as head of government in 1996. Members of law enforcement agencies were seen patrolling the adjoining areas of the Gano Bhaban in the morning. Hasina shifted to Sudha Sadan before the 2001 election and remained there until her move to Jamuna in February last year. Gano Bhaban had been without any occupant from 2001 during the BNP and caretaker government tenures. bd
