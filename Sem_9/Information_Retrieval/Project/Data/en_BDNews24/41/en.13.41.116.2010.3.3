<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to take action against vehicles without fitness certificates, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told parliament on Wednesday. Replying to a query from Rajshahi-4 MP Enamul Haque he said there are about 80,000 vehicles without fitness certificates and they are operating illegally. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, each vehicle is issued a fitness certificate during registration, which must be renewed after expiration. Hossain said the BRTA has launched operations to identify the vehicles through mobile courts, which are being led by two magistrates in the Dhaka metropolitan area. Mobile courts are also operating across the country, he said. Replying to another query by Apu Ukil MP the minister said state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation is currently running 415 buses and 139 trucks. But BRTC would remain unprofitable if interests owed to the government and depreciations are taken into account, he said. The government is taking initiatives to make the BRTC a profitable organisation, the minister added. bdnew
