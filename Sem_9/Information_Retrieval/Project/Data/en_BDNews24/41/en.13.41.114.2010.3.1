 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  Two Dhaka courts issued arrest warrants Monday in separate cases against Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, the two sons of BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, both currently residing abroad. Metropolitan magistrate Mehedi Hasan Talukdar issued a warrant against Tarique in an extortion case filed in April 2007 by Khairul Bashar, general manager of construction firm Abdul Monem Ltd. "Today was the date for Tarique's appearance before the court. But he neither appeared nor did anyone submit a time petition on his behalf," court recorder Rokon Sheikh told bdnews24.com A warrant was also issued against businessman Giasuddin Al Mamoon, a close friend of Tarique, in the case. Tarique, the senior vice-president of BNP, is now in the UK. He is accused in 12 cases filed mostly during the past caretaker government. The same day, senior metropolitan judge ANM Bashirullah issued an arrest warrant against Tarique's younger brother in a tax dodge case. The court also issued an arrest warrant against former BNP state minister Fazlur Rahman Patal for tax evasion. Both Tarique and Coco have been out of the country since 2008. Jailed in corruption cases, they were released on bail separately by the past caretaker government to seek medical treatment in London and Bangkok respectively. bdne
