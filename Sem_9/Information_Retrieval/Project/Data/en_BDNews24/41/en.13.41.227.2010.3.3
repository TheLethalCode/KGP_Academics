 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)---The government is drafting a law to safeguard 'whistleblowers' or employees who divulge information about irregularities and corruption in the public or private sector, the law minister said on Wednesday. "Many people do not want to divulge such information for lack of protection from their company, seniors or fellow workers," the law minister told reporters after a meeting at the Secretariat. The meeting discussed formulation of the proposed 'Whistleblowers Protection Act', as the law is commonly named in countries as far spread as the US and Australia. The meeting chaired by the law minister was attended among others by state minister for law Kamrul Islam, chairman of the Law Commission justice Abdur Rashid and cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz. "We are moving to draft the law to encourage people to provide information on illegal activities," Shafique said. Different countries have laws to protect whistleblowers and Bangladesh should have one too, he said. "The law will protect any individual who wants to provide information on irregularities for the public good," he said. The identity of the whistleblower would be kept secret under the proposed law, and it would also have provision for punishing false informers. "The law will be applicable to employees of both government and non-government bodies and the draft of the law will be finalised within a month," the minister said. The meeting decided to receive public feedback on the draft law through e-mail and letters after posting it on the website. The minister expressed the hope that irregularities and corruption would be curbed once the law is enacted. "It will play an effective role in ensuring good governance," he said. bdnew
