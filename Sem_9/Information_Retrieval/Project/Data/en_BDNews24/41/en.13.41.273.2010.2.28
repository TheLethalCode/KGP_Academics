<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Shiekh Hasina said Sunday that not only border guards who took up arms and killed their military officers last year would stand in the dock, but those who plotted the bloody BDR mutiny would also be put on trial at any cost. "The persons involved in and plotted the killings will be identified. They must be tried. We've to ensure at any cost that such incidents do not recur in the country," she told families of the officers killed in the armed uprising at Pilkhana on Feb 25-26 last year. At least 57 army officers were killed during the carnage. The prime minister on Sunday handed over cheques for Tk 4.8 lakh to the family of each slain officer. The money was donated by Bangladesh Association of Bankers as part of its commitment immediately after the mutiny to provide Tk 40,000 a month to each bereaved family. "Money cannot bring back the dear ones, who have passed away," Hasina said. "But money is needed for living. My younger sister could not carry on her studies after the death of my father." She said she would try to ensure that the families of the officers did not face any hardship. "I'll be with you as long as I'm here." Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, the prime minister's advisers HT Imam and Tareque Ahmed Siddique, her principle secretary MA Karim and chiefs of the three services were present. bd
