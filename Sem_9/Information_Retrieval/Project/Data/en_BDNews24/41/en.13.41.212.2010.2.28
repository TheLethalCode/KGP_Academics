<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)Authorities on Sunday lifted a five-day long Section 144 clampdown on Khagrachhari district town, imposed last week in the wake of bloody clashes between Bangali settlers and hill people. Deputy commissioner Md Abdullah said the clampdown on public gatherings had been withdrawn from noon in the hill district headquarters. The town began returning to normal life. But security measures remained in force. Army troops and extra police patrols were seen at different points of the town. The district administration also made a list of victims of the clashes and distributed relief materials. Authorities imposed the clampdown on Feb 23 after hill people and settlers clashed in the district town, leaving one dead, dozens injured and houses torched. Residents of the town were also under curfew for three successive nights. The violence at Khagrachhari erupted just days after similar violence broke out in neighbouring Rangamati. At least two people were killed and indigenous villages set alight in the remote Baghaichhari upazila of Rangamati hill district on Feb 19 and 20. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and so-called Bangali settlers in the restive region where the army has also been deployed for decades to battle past insurgency among the hill tract population. Tensions have risen to the surface again recently with the government's move to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, including pull-out of army troops and restoration of indigenous land rights, after a long gap.
