<TITLE> Cook omitted from World Twenty20 squad </TITLE>

 London, March 1(bdnews24.com)  Alastair Cook, England's Test and ODI captain, has been omitted from England's 30-man provisional squad for the World Twenty20 that starts in April in the Caribbean. Cook's new ODI opening partner, Craig Kieswetter, has been included, alongside Peter Trego and Michael Lumb, after their success on the England Lions tour to UAE, reports Cricinfo. Cook's omission came as something of a snub after he was named in the recent Twenty20 party that played two matches against Pakistan in Dubai, and although his accumulatory style is not best suited to the cut and thrust of the 20-over format, he showed impressive form for Essex in last season's Twenty20 Cup, and was England's most fluent batsman with a brisk 64 in their 50-over victory against Bangladesh in Dhaka on Sunday. Cook himself had been unaware that the 30-man squad was imminent when asked about it after the first ODI, but said he hoped he had done enough to demonstrate that he has what it takes to succeed. However, according to Geoff Miller, the national selector, he is still some way short of meriting a place in the set-up. "We didn't think Alastair was a 20-over player so consequently he wasn't selected," said Miller. "He knows the decision and he's obviously very much improving in 50-overs, and that might develop his Twenty20 too. But there's a dramatic difference between 50-over cricket and Twenty20. We don't feel he has gone over that mark to be part of our Twenty20 squad, but that does not mean he's out of it [for good]." bd
