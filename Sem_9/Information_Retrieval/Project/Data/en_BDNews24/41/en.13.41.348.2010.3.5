<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP is going to initiate a 'mass communication tour' this month to meet the grassroot-level activists. "The tour will continue till April 17 aiming at strengthening organizational activities and preparing for a tough movement," BNP standing committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy said. He was talking to reporters at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters on Friday. Regarding BNP's preparation for movement, Roy said: "All the people across the country are at present depressed and agitated. They are well aware of the perilous situation of the country caused by price hike and collapse in law and order." "BNP will go for a movement in response to people's demand. We want to elicit public opinion on those government activities which go against the interest of the country." Roy also said the party chief Khaleda Zia will deliver speeches at assemblies in six divisional districts. BNP has decided to form 19 central teams under the leadership of standing committee members and vice-president-level leaders of the party to enhance and strengthen party activities, the BNP leader said. Responding to a query, Roy said: "BNP is a big party. There are competitions among its leaders to obtain the party's top leadership, but there's no infighting. Committee formation is an ongoing process. There is no scope for irritation on this." bd
