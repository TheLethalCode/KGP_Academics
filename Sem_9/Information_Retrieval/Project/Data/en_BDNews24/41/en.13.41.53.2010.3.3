 Dhaka, Mar 03 (bdnews24.com)  The parliamentary standing committee on the environment ministry formed a watchdog body on Wednesday to supervise expenses of the governmental allocation of Tk 400 crore to confront the consequences of the climate changes. The five-member sub-committee is headed by Md Ekabbar Hossain MP while the other members are Sohrab Ali Sana, Manaranjan Sheel Gopal, Md Golam Sabur and Giasuddin Ahmed. "The government has launched a Tk 400 crore programme to tackle the effects of climate change of which Tk 300 crore will be spent by different ministries," standing committee chairman Abdul Momin Talukder told reporters at parliament's media centre. "The rest will be spent thought different non-governmental organisations of the country." More than 5000 NGOs have applied for climate funds under the programme, he said. "The sub-committee was not formed to oversee the amount that will be expended under ministerial projects. Rather the committee will supervise the NGOs, especially which areas the money is being spent," Talukder said. "The sub-committee will submit its first report within the next two months," he said. Talukder also said that the standing committee had requested the home ministry to execute a joint operation consisting of RAB and police to control piracy in the country's forest areas. bdnews24.co
