 Dhaka, March 01 (bdnews24.com)  Five suspected members of Pakistan-based militant outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, including their Pakistani coordinator, were carrying out 'anti-state activities' from a city centre flat, police said Monday. Two Dhaka courts granted police seven and three days to interrogate the suspects arrested the day before. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court of judge Mehedi Hasan Talukder granted the remand upon a petition by New Market police sub-inspector Matlubur Rahman. Pakistan national Rezwan Ahmed along with his four Bangladeshi associates was arrested in the capital on Feb 28. Police officials Ratan Sheikh and Mafizur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the court remanded Rezwan to custody for seven days initially under the passport law on charges of illegal entry into Bangladesh. Others were remanded for three days. The petitioner, in his statement, said Rezwan, along with his aides, was carrying out anti-state terrorist activities from the Sukanya Tower flat where four of them were arrested. They were also accused of being involved in anti-state conspiracy and alleged of having connection with several militant outfits. RAB officials said Rezwan had confessed that he was JeM's regional coordinator and had recruited members in Bangladesh. Nannu Mia, one of the other detained militants, was reportedly arrested in India in 1999 for his role in hijacking an airplane in Kathmandu, Nepal. RAB said they had also learnt that Nannu was imprisoned in Guahati, India, for about 10 years, and that more than four militancy-related cases were pending against him in different Indian courts. JeM has been held responsible for the Dec 13, 2001 terrorist attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi. bdnews
