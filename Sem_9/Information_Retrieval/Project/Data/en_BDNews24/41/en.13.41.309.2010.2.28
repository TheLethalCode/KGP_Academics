<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross was called into the England squad for the first time on Saturday, hours after he had been sent off for a challenge that left Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey with a serious leg injury. Shawcross, 22, an under-21 international, was named in the 24-man squad by coach Fabio Capello for England's friendly against African champions Egypt at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday. Earlier, the Stoke player received a red card for his challenge on Wales midfielder Ramsey in Arsenal's 3-1 Premier League win. Wednesday's friendly will be England's last official warm-up match before Capello names his provisional squad in May for the World Cup finals. Stewart Downing is back for the first time in 11 months, having returned from injury, and is one of seven players who could potentially be involved in Sunday's League Cup final between his Aston Villa team and Manchester United. Villa team mate James Milner, who has five caps and usually plays in midfield, could feature in England's defence. Leighton Baines of Everton and Stephen Warnock of Villa are contenders for the left-back spot in the absence of Ashley Cole (broken ankle) and Wayne Bridge, who has asked not to be considered in the wake of media allegations over his private life. Rio Ferdinand, who was due to take over as captain following the demotion of John Terry as skipper for his alleged extra-marital affair with Bridge's former girlfriend, is out with a back injury. There is also no place for Chelsea's Joe Cole, who won the last of his 53 caps in September 2008. Namesake Carlton Cole is back after returning to the West Ham United team following injury. David Beckham, on loan at AC Milan from Los Angeles Galaxy, is included in the party and will win his 116th cap if he plays. David James, who would win his 50th cap if selected, is among a trio of goalkeepers along with West Ham's Robert Green and Birmingham City's Joe Hart. Squad: Goalkeepers: David James (Portsmouth), Robert Green (West Ham United), Joe Hart (Birmingham City). Defenders: Wes Brown (Manchester United), James Milner (Aston Villa), John Terry (Chelsea), Matthew Upson (West Ham United), Joleon Lescott (Manchester City), Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City), Leighton Baines (Everton), Stephen Warnock (Aston Villa) Midfielders: David Beckham (Los Angeles Galaxy), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Gareth Barry (Manchester City), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City), Stewart Downing (Aston Villa) Forwards: Emile Heskey (Aston Villa), Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspur), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Peter Crouch (Tottenham Hotspur), Carlton Cole (West Ham United)
