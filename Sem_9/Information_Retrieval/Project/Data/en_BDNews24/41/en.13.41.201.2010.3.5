<TITLE> Maliki set to struggle for second term as Iraq PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A year ago, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki looked unstoppable as a dramatic security turnaround and slowly improving services proved a formidable weapon for winning votes in January 2009 local polls. Now, people are asking if Maliki has turned that weapon on himself, as persistent violence, lingering sectarian tensions and growing impatience for public services and growth sow doubts about the Shi'ite leader's chances of winning a second term. Whether Maliki's State of Law coalition gets enough votes to lead Iraq's next government -- no party is expected to win an outright majority -- will shape Iraq's future as it seeks to solidify security gains ahead of the U.S. withdrawal and end the political bickering that undermines stability. His recent campaign speeches returned to well-worn themes: fighting terrorism, stamping out Saddam Hussein's Baath party and nationalism prevailing over post-2003 sectarian conflict. Dour, formal, and rarely seen cracking a smile, Maliki has more recently added a new theme: seeking to discredit rivals by casting himself as the candidate who gets things done. "We in the State of Law coalition don't say that we want to work, because we have worked. We don't say we want to succeed, because we have succeeded. We don't say we want to achieve sovereignty, because we achieved it. But now we want to complete what we have begun," he told tribal leaders this week. Things will not be as easy for Maliki, 59, as in 2006, when he emerged in lengthy government formation talks as a compromise pick who was not well known enough to be objected to. Maliki, who joined the Islamic Dawa party as a student and later spent years in exile, defeated Shi'ite militias in 2008. As incumbent, he is fending off attacks from former partners looking to recapture Shi'ite support and from the secularist Iraqiya List, which may grab the anti-establishment vote. Both hope to capitalise on erosion of Maliki's support after bloody attacks on ministries and other symbols of state power. Since Wednesday, at least 45 people have been killed. Even if Maliki can return to the premier's office, his power will depend on the size and nature of the coalition he leads. RECONCILIATION There is great debate about how willing Maliki, who was sentenced to death by Saddam in absentia and is said to have a deep hatred for Baathists, is to truly embrace minority Sunnis. Many Sunnis, dominant under Saddam, say the answer is not very. That perception was strengthened when judges, bowing to apparent government pressure, recently upheld a ban of candidates linked to Baathists, including top Sunni contenders. "We haven't seen anything but dismissal, marginalisation and revenge, which will bring nothing good to Iraq," said Mohammed Shakir, an engineer in Ramadi, capital of Sunni Anbar province. Such feelings may mean that a return for Maliki will bode poorly for Iraq's ability to achieve true reconciliation with Sunnis and other groups, and so threaten lasting stability. Another minority who may oppose another Maliki term are the Kurds, whose aspirations to take control of the disputed oil city of Kirkuk have been thwarted in part by the prime minister. But mindful perhaps that Kurds may prove kingmakers in post-election manoeuvring, Maliki hinted in a recent interview that the question of Kirkuk's future should be put to Iraq's presidency council, headed by President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd. While initially sceptical, American officials appear to have become Maliki converts, and his return would likely preclude hiccups in the US-Iraqi relationship as Washington prepares to quickly reduce its troop level this summer and withdraw by 2012. With neighbouring Iran, there are more questions. Maliki took heat last year for keeping a long silence after Iranian troops seized an oil well Baghdad claims belongs to Iraq. Maliki, like all Iraqis, has condemned foreign meddling. But he is mindful of Iraq's deep ties with the fellow Shi'ite nation and appears determined to keep the relationship on an even keel. For foreign investors, continuity may be a positive -- Maliki has lobbied hard to secure global business for Iraq. But oil executives, fresh from signing major oil deals with the government, signal that none of the potential replacements for Maliki are likely to pose a threat to their work in I
