 HAVANA, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cuba fired back against international criticism Saturday, saying in state-run press a prisoner who died of a hunger strike this week was a common criminal used by Cuba's enemies for political purposes. Communist Party newspaper Granma said dissidents and foreign countries encouraged Orlando Zapata Tamayo to fight against the Cuban system and to undertake the 85-day hunger strike that ended in his death Tuesday.

The Granma article echoed some of President Raul Castro's comments, who Wednesday regretted Zapata's death but blamed the United States for what Cuba views as subversive policies.
