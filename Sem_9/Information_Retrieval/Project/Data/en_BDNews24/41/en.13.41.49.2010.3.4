In addition to fighting al Qaeda, impoverished Yemen is also trying to bring an end to a northern Shi'ite insurgency and faces simmering separatist tension in the south. The past few weeks have seen an increase in violence in the south, where secessionists protesting against the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have clashed with police, resulting in deaths on both sides.
