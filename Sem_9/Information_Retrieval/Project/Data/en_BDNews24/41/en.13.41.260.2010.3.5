<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid threatened on Thursday to resign if the prevailing "misconduct of MPs" in parliament continued. He blasted members of both treasury and opposition benches just a day after lawmakers came near to blows in the house, terming their behaviour "shameful for the nation". "I have been elected by the votes of both government and opposition parties. I will conduct parliament my way. If you think it is not needed for me to stay, I am ready to go," he told MPs. Pandemonium broke out in parliament on Wednesday sparked by a remark of an opposition MP about Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, later expunged, followed with a reply from a ruling party member which was taken as uncomplimentary to Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia. At one point, a BNP MP charged threateningly towards a member of the treasury bench. The 10 minutes of total chaos ended with the main opposition party walking out of parliament for a third consecutive day. The speaker on Thursday criticised the MPs and urged them to be "more concerned with the hopes of the people who had elected [them]". "The mike will be switched off if unparliamentarily or attacking language is used. If you want to fight or wrestle, go to Paltan or the field outside parliament," the speaker said. He made the statement between a resolution by an MP and a thanksgiving proposal on the president's address. The speaker was strict from the start of Thursday's session. He refused BNP MP Moudud Ahmed's point of order at the start and said, "No point of order will be taken now. I have something to say first to all of you." Following the resolution, Moudud Ahmed and AL MPs Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta again wanted to raise points of order. Refusing them, the speaker said he had decided not to allow any points of order until after the discussion on the president's address. 'SHAMEFUL' Hamid went on to say: "The unwanted incident that occurred is saddening and shameful for the nation." He said it was "only natural" that the opposition will criticise the government and the government will criticise past governments. "However it is important to do that using parliamentary language and code of conduct," the speaker said. He drew attention of the MPs to the wide coverage in the media over Wednesday's incident, and said: "Your language, behaviour or actions on that day were unacceptable to the people." He said everyone had to be alert "in upholding the stature of and respect for parliament". "I did not expect to see such an incident. And the type of language used is in no way appropriate," the speaker said. The choice of language "reflects on the origins of a person," he added. 'ACT SO PEOPLE CAN KEEP FAITH' "Kindly, and for God's sake, act so the people can keep their faith in you. Many hard things can be said very nicely," the speaker said. Following his address, members of ruling and opposition parties welcomed the speaker's efforts to restore the peace in parliament by raising point of orders near the end of the session. Moudud Ahmed was the first to speak on the matter and praised the speaker's move. He also urged understanding instead of heated rows. "Let's not go into the competition to defame each other's leaders. Then parliament will run smoothly," the BNP MP said. PROMISES, PROMISES "No government is the last government. There is also no assurance that I will be elected next time. We assure that we will not make any derogatory remarks about your leader if you don't make any about ours," Moudud said. The speaker appreciated the speech by Moudud, but pointed out, "When a junior MP makes a negative comment during a speech, even senior members of the bench support it by clapping on the desk. It happens on both sides. It is very disheartening." Senior Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta next took the floor. He pointed out "the respect AL pays to Ziaur Rahman when referring to him". "We mention Bir Uttam as he participated in the Liberation War and deserves the title." But, he said, "The scenario is different with Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman). He is an incomparable leader and the father of the nation." BNP's MK Anwar raised a point of order following Suranjit's speech. "Despite Bangabandhu's achievements, people do differ with the way he ran the country in the post-war period." "But the disagreements should be presented without any show of disrespect. The same is true for our leader as his historic contributions cannot go unheeded." He then reaffirmed Moudud's assurance of not saying anything derogatory about Sheikh Mujib if the ruling party maintains the same about Ziaur Rahman. The next speaker was AL MP Tofail Ahmed, who revived memories of the "affectionate relations between Bangabandhu and Ziaur Rahman". "Let us not attack each other and only participate in constructive discussions as people's image of parliament is being tarnished day by day," Tofail said. "Yesterday's incident was not acceptable to anyone. So let's start afresh from today." He then drew parliament's attention to the agenda at hand. bdnew
