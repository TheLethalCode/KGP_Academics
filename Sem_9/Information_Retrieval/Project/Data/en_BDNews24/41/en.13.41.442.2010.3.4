 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)--Traffic on the Dhaka-Mawa stretch of the busy highway ground to a halt for two hours on Thursday due to a blockade by school students at south Keraniganj on the outskirts of capital Dhaka. Students of Baghapur High School and College blocked the highway from 10am protesting the death of a school teacher in a road accident the day before, police and locals said. The blockade was lifted after the midday, said Abul Kalam, sub-inspector of South Keraniganj Police Station. Teacher Ranu Begum, 33, was injured on Wednesday night as a bus hit her while she had been crossing road at Kadampur on her way home from school, Jainal Abedin, a student of the school, told bdnews24.com. She was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where she died. As the news of her death reached the school on Thursday morning, the students took to the streets. Police official Abul Kalam said students also vandalised a number of vehicles during the blockade programme.
