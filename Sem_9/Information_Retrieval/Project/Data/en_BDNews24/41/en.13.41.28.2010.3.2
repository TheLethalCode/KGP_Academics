 Dhaka, March 2 (bdnews24.com)  Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, the only son of prime minister Hasina, delivered a presentation Tuesday in Dhaka on the government's initiatives to build a digitised Bangladesh. Sajeeb who was introduced as a computer scientist and IT specialist based in the United States, said the plan had four areas: e-governance, IT education, IT industry and IT outsourcing. "All of these are rested on infrastructure that is telecommunication." Earlier in the day Sheikh Hasina launched her government's ambitious 'digital vision', Digital Bangladesh: Plan for Connecting People, at the Radisson Water Garden Hotel in Dhaka. The plan is based on the principal of building a Bangladesh, which is free from hunger, poverty and corruption, Sajeeb said. "We'll use technological advancement to achieve these goals," said Sajeeb while conducting the presentation containing video clips of his mother and grandfather Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The level of corruption will come down drastically once everything is digitised, he added. "Eventually, procurements, tenders, bidding everything would be digitised." Sajeeb stressed on the importance of cutting the cost of bandwidth in Bangladesh as it's one of the highest in the world. He told the audience that fibre optics cables are already there in 56 districts and 296 upazillas, but the problem is they are not connected with each other and often overlapped. Government entities, like the Bangladesh Railways and the mobile telephone operators, have fibre optic networks in several districts and upazillas. A committee has been formed to integrate these scattered networks, which would help to cut down the cots of accessing internet, according to Sajeeb. Citing examples of call centres, he said Bangladesh has a huge potential in terms of IT outsourcing as the English accent here is "neutral". "The ultimate goal is to make Bangladesh as the hub for IT outsourcing." He also said that Bangladesh has plans to launch a satellite. Meanwhile, the UN ICT chief Hamdoun Tour focused on the need of cyber-security in the wake of Bangladesh going digital. Tour, the secretary general of the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has arrived Dhaka on Monday for a four-day visit. Speaking as a special guest at the ceremony, he emphasised on the need of global cyber-security framework. "Because criminals know no bound...they can operate from anywhere and strike anyone," added the ITU chief. On the issue of launching a satellite, Tour affirmed his and the ITU's commitment to stand beside Bangladesh. "I am a satellite engineer and have worked in the satellite industry before joining the ITU." 'CONNECTING PEOPLE' More than a fifth of Bangladesh's union councils are set to be connected through a fibre optic network within a year, the prime minister said as she launched the initiative earlier in the day. In line with the ruling Awami League's vision, the government is set to bring 1000 union parishads, or councils, the lowest tier of local government, under a countrywide fibre optic network. "One hundred unions have been primarily selected, to connect by fibre optic cable," Hasina told the ceremony. The premier also said that every hospital and school would get computers and have internet connection. "Community e-centres will be set up at every upazila (sub-district) under the programme," she added. Hasina said the government plans to set up e-centres for the rural communities across Bangladesh at 8,500 post offices using the vast infrastructure of the postal department. The launching ceremony held at the Radisson Water Garden Hotel also heard from telecommunication minister Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju, secretary Sunil Kanti Bose and BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed
