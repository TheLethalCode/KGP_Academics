<TITLE> BDR chief: BSF intruding by force </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam has alleged that Indian border guards are intruding onto Bangladeshi territory "by force". "Despite the understanding reached between the political leaders of the two countries during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit, the lower level of the Indian border force is failing to comprehend the matter. And that is why they are firing 'irresponsibly' at the borders," he said. "If Bangladeshi border forces were as imprudent and revengeful as their Indian counterparts then the border situation would be horrifying", the BDR director general said. He emphasised the need for political and diplomatic solutions to settle disputes. The BDR chief made these remarks at a press briefing at the BDR headquarters in Sylhet on Tuesday following a visit to a growing trouble spot at the border between Bangladesh and India. The press briefing was attended by BDR Sylhet sector commander Col Niamul Islam Fatemi and commanding officer of 21st Rifles Battalion Lt Col Khandaker Zahirul Alam and others. His visit came in the wake of several border fire incidents between Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and India's Border Security Force (BSF) following intrusions of BSF into Bangladesh territory in Sylhet. BSF breached the Jaintapur border several times this month, in an ongoing dispute over a water body on the Bangladesh side, giving rise to exchanges of fire between the two border forces. Gen Mainul held talks with AK Vargon, BSF deputy inspector general of Shillong sector, at the Protappur border during the visit. He assured the BDR chief that there would be no further intrusion from the Indian side until the director general-level talks between the two border forces are held in Delhi on Mar 7. The BDR chief told reporters during his visit: "All border disputes will be settled politically." "Since the relation between Bangladesh and India are heading for the better, both parties will have to be patient in finding a peaceful solution to border disputes. Bullets cannot be a solution; the solution has to be found through discussions." He further said a joint border working group will soon meet to discuss the issue of illegally occupied land in accordance with the Land Boundary Agreement1974. The working group last met in 2006, which produced a list of illegally occupied land. The dispute would have been settled if the list were followed, Mainul said. But that was not possible because the BSF claimed that the whole disputed area was illegally occupied. Answering to a query about BDR's 'submissive' attitude towards BSF's intrusion, Mainul said, "It's BDR policy not to fire first." "However, they never failed to respond to any provocation. There is no question of weakness. Anyone has the right to retaliate if attacked." The BDR chief also said, "The density of our Border Out Posts (BOP) has never been defined. The de facto density of BOPs built during the Pakistan period was every nine kilometres, whereas it is only three kilometres for India. But according to the new outline we will have one BOP every five kilometres and they will be closer to the border." He expressed hope that the BDR will become a better and more organised force with a new name and uniform by next week. bdnews
