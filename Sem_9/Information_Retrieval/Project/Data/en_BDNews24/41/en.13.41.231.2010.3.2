 LONDON, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New opinion polls had mixed messages for Britain's main parties on Tuesday, but both suggested Britain might be heading for a hung parliament in an election just weeks away. The ComRes poll in the Independent newspaper had the Conservative Party's lead at 5 points, down two from last month's poll -- meaning ruling Labour could remain the largest party in parliament after the vote. But a separate YouGov poll in the Sun tabloid, which backs the Conservatives, had the party's lead extended to 7 points. ComRes put the Conservatives on 37 percent, Labour 32 and Britain's third-biggest party, the Liberal Democrats, on 19. If replicated in a general election, that has to be held before early June, Labour would have 17 more seats than the Conservatives under the constituency system, 32 short of an overall majority, the paper said. Recent polls suggest Prime Minister Gordon Brown could head a minority government, needing support from smaller parties to pass legislation. Uncertainty about the election outcome helped push sterling to a 10-month low against the dollar on Monday, as markets worried whether the next government would be able to tackle the growing debt burden effectively. The ComRes poll, carried out between February 26-28, coincided with a rallying call by Conservative leader David Cameron to party activists in which he said a fourth successive Labour election win would spell disaster for Britain. The YouGov/Sun poll suggested Cameron's speech might have had an impact, with the Conservatives up two points on 39 percent, Labour down three on 32 and the LibDems on 17. Voters' perceptions of Cameron and Brown on the economy were very similar in the ComRes poll, with 43 percent believing Cameron had the right skills to lead Britain back to economic health and 42 percent saying the same of Brown. Some 45 percent said they believed the Conservative leader would reduce Britain's debt if he won the election, while 37 percent thought Brown would. The Conservatives want to make quicker and deeper cuts to Britain's record budget deficit of more than 12 percent GDP, but Brown says swift spending cuts would kill off a fragile recovery from the worst recession since World World Two. The Conservative lead was in double figures late last year. Cameron told ITV television news he "always believed this election would be a close contest, it would be a close fight." He added that voters were wary of lawmakers after the parliamentary expenses scandal, which exposed many from all the main parties claiming trivial expenses. A recent allegation in a Sunday newspaper that suggested Brown bullied his staff does not appear to have damaged his personal ratings. Brown has denied the claims. Some 69 percent of ComRes respondents said they did not view him as an "unpleasant bully" compared with 20 percent who d
