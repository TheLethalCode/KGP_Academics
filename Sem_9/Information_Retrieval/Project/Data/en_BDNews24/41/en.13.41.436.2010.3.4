 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)--Climate change and corruption threaten poverty reduction in Bangladesh, the UK's Department for International Development Parliamentary Select Committee says in a report. The 64-page report on Bangladesh published on Thursday says Bangladesh has reduced poverty levels from 57 percent at the beginning of the 1990s to 40 percent in 2005 but much more needs to be done to help the country's poorest people. DFID announced an inquiry into DFID's programme in Bangladesh last year and members of the International Development Select Committee visited Bangladesh in November. They collected written evidence from 17 individuals and organisations in the UK and in Bangladesh including non-governmental organisations, academics, the private sector, members of the Bangladeshi community in the UK and the UK government. The committee also held three oral evidence sessions in British Parliament between October and December. The report says, despite a steadily growing economy, Bangladesh's potential to achieve more widespread poverty reduction is held back by its poor record on governance and high levels of corruption. Successive governments have failed to respond to the needs of poor and marginalised communities and instead state power has too often been used for personal and partisan ends. The chairman of the 11-member committee, Malcolm Bruce, a Liberal Democrat MP, said: "64 million people still live on less than $1 a day in Bangladesh. Of these 35 million are extremely poor and 15 million live on the equivalent of 20 pence per day. "These people have not benefitted from Bangladesh's economic growth and are disadvantaged by the way in which the political system works. DFID must ensure that its programmes help to raise the demand for accountability and strengthen the mechanisms which hold the Government to account, particularly the parliament. "Bangladesh has had a long relationship with the UK and is the fourth highest recipient of UK bilateral assistance. DFID's programme there in the current financial year is worth 125 million and will rise to 150 million in 2010-11, making the UK the largest bilateral donor. Continued the chairman: "There are 500,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK who make a significant contribution to Bangladesh through remittances and other forms of support. DFID must do more to engage with them. "They have significant capacity and a desire to contribute to the future prosperity of Bangladesh. The drive to improve governance and reduce poverty in Bangladesh could be enhanced with their cooperation." The report praises the innovative NGO community in Bangladesh which plays an important role in delivering basic services in areas where state provision is limited. An excellent example of the sector's pioneering approach is the BRAC Targeting the Ultra Poor programme. However, the contribution of non-governmental organisations to providing services should not mean that the state is released from its proper responsibility to meet the basic needs of its people. Donors must continue to build the capacity of the Government of Bangladesh to do this, it added. The chairman said, "NGOs in Bangladesh have developed novel ways of delivering services, especially in health, education, livelihoods and microfinance. DFID provides funding for both NGO and government systems and is working to build links between the two. This is important since it is the state which has primary responsibility for providing services. According to the report, gender inequality continues to be a significant problem in Bangladesh. Though there has been an increase in the number of girls attending primary school, progress in tackling maternal mortality is insufficient and women remain marginalised and excluded from key decision-making processes. More needs to be done to challenge the traditional role of women in Bangladesh, it said and suggested DFID should actively promote women in positions of power and apply gender targets for all its programmes, not just those in the social sectors. Bangladesh is likely to be adversely affected by climate change and the poorest people will be hardest hit. Large parts of the country are low-lying and susceptible to more frequent and intense floods and cyclones. Bangladesh will need assistance to cope with the effects of rises in sea levels and increased salinisation. Chairman Bruce said, "Helping the poorest adapt to the impacts of climate change is important. We saw an excellent DFID programme in the Chars islands which focused on both poverty reduction and resilience to climate change. "More work of this kind is necessary. Climate change could mean that 30 million people have to move from their homes. DFID should begin to consider the implications of this now. Donors must also provide adequate additional funding, earmarked for climate change, and not taken from the sums which they have already committed to poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Other International Select Committee members are John Battle MP (Lab), Hugh Bayley MP (Lab), Richard Burden MP (Lab), Nigel Evans MP (Con), Mark Hendrick MP (Lab/Co-op), Daniel Kawczynski MP (Con), Mark Lancaster MP (Con), Virendra Sharma (Lab), Marsha Singh MP (Lab), and Andrew Stunell MP (Lib D
