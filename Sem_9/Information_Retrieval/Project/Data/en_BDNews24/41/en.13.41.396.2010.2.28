<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has termed the European Union's statement alleging human rights abuses in the Chittagong Hill Tracts "unfortunate" and "not based on facts". The foreign ministry in a statement circulated Sunday said Bangladesh expected its friend the EU to behave "responsibly" and that "baseless" statements could lead to a deterioration of a volatile situation in the hill tracts. "The government of Bangladesh wishes to state that the issuance of such a statement is unfortunate considering that, prima facie, it is not based on any actual fact-finding exercise on the part of EU or any consultation with the government of Bangladesh," said the statement quoting Saida Muna Taseem, director general in-charge of external publicity. "As such, it does not offer any corroborating evidence in support of the allegations raised," she said. The EU two days ago expressed concerns at alleged violations of human rights in the violent incidents that took place on Feb 19 and 20 at Baghaichhari in Rangamati hill district. Catherine Ashton, high representative of EU foreign affairs and security policy, in a statement Friday, expressed the Union's worries over the reported involvement of armed forces in the incidents in Baghachhari sub district in Rangamati and Khagrachhari district town. "The EU strongly condemns the acts of violence that took place in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh on 19 and 20 February 2010," the EU's statement read. The EU said it was "aware of allegations" that the incident involved army personnel and labourers employed by the army. Thhe EU also said it had received reports that in a number of villages in Rangamati, and notably in Gangarmodor Baghaihat, indigenous people were killed, houses were set on fire and a number of indigenous people were displaced. The EU called for swift implementation of the CHT Peace Accord. The foreign ministry on Sunday said the Awami League government in 1997 signed the peace agreement with indigenous people to restore peace in the hill tracts. "The present (Awami League) government, after assuming office in January last year, made no delay in resuming the process of full implementation of the accord. "As part of this process, a good number of military camps were withdrawn from the hill districts, the functioning of the CHT Land Commission was reinvigorated, and more subjects were transferred to CHT local councils," said the foreign ministry director general. The statement said Bangladesh government wished to reiterate its commitment to 'zero tolerance' against impunity. Persons found responsible for instigating or committing acts of violence in the CHT will be brought to book, it said. "The government expects full understanding and cooperation from the friends of Bangladesh. "Baseless and unfounded statements do not help the process; they rather encourage those who chose to instigate instability," the foreign ministry statement said.
