 KABUL, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's defence ministry has averted various efforts by Taliban guerrillas trying to infiltrate into army ranks, a ministry spokesman said on Thursday, but he conceded some failures. A series of deadly attacks against NATO-led troops stationed in joint bases with Afghan forces has been carried out either by Taliban sympathisers or their infiltrators in Afghan army and police ranks in recent years.

In the deadliest such attack yet, an Afghan policeman killed five British soldiers in a training base in southern Halmand province last November. In December, an Afghan soldier shot dead a US servicemember and wounded two Italian soldiers in a joint NATO and Afghan base in northwestern Badghis.

Azimy also said the desertion rate among recruits was normal in the Afghan army, seen as the best hope for securing Afghanistan when and if the more than 110,000 foreign troops leave. US-led troops with the help of Afghan factions overthrew the Taliban government in late 2001 after it refused to hand over al Qaeda leaders wanted by Washington for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United Sta
