 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correpondent Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) ---- The Election Commission, for the first time, has set the limit for candidates on how much money they can spend in the election for union parishads scheduled to be held in May. The move is intended to cut the flow of black money into the campaign and make the process more transparent and straightforward. According to the new expenditure limit, a chairman candidate will be allowed to spend a maximum of Tk 5 lakh and a member Tk 1 lakh, Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com. The EC has not determined the expenditure limit in proportion to voters as it did in parliamentary and other local body elections. The commissioner, however, said it has formulated the regulation in accordance with the 'City Corporation, Upazila, Municipality and Union Parishad law' passed by the ninth parliament. "There was no fixed election and personal expenditure limit in UP election in the past, which encouraged flow of black money", he said, adding "We have finalised Local Government (Union Parishad) Election Regultions/Guidelines-2010 after fixing expenditure limit for the first time to ensure transparency in the election." To further streamline the process, "New proposals have been incorporated in the code of conduct." The proposed election regulations and code of conduct will be sent to the law ministry for approval before publishing it in the gazette. Of the total 4504 UPs, election to 4228 were held in 2003 and the remaining UPs will go to polls in May. Of them, 79 union parishads have been without election for nearly 15 years. The proposed election regulations stipulate that a UP candidate for chairman will be allowed to spend a maximum of Tk 5 lakh for election and Tk 50,000 for personal expenses; a member candidate, on the other hand, will not be allowed to exceed Tk 1 lakh for election and Tk 10,000 for personal expenses, it states. Under the new rule, a candidate will have to open a bank account to show election expenditure and the chairman candidate or his designated agent will have to submit expense statement to the commission. Expenditure statement of the chairman candidate will have to be submitted within 30 days after the publication of election result in the official gazette. The proposed regulation provides jail sentence for violators between two and seven years. Under the new regulation, the candidates need not submit any affidavit like national election but they have to mention their source of income and who they will appoint as polling agents. A chairman candidate will be allowed to install only one election camp in the entire UP area and a member a camp in the ward. No television, VCR and VCD will be allowed inside the camp. In addition, pasting black and white posters on the walls and fences has been prohibited and the candidates will not be allowed to hold public rallies. But street meeting (Path Sava) might be allowed but without erecting a stage, the commissioner said. "Violators of the code of conduct will face six-month sentence or Tk 10,000 or both". bd
