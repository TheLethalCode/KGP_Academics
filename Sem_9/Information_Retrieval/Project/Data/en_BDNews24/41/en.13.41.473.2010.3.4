 MADRID, March 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain, England and Argentina recorded morale-boosting victories in World Cup warm-up matches on Wednesday. European champions Spain comfortably saw off France 2-0 in Paris while a double from Peter Crouch helped England fight back to beat visiting Egypt 3-1. Gonzalo Higuain scored a stunning goal as Argentina won 1-0 in Germany and Netherlands beat United States 2-1 in Amsterdam. Uruguay were 3-1 winners in Switzerland but world champions Italy could only draw 0-0 with Cameroon in Monaco. First-half goals from David Villa and Sergio Ramos put a dominant Spain in charge against the 2006 World Cup runners-up and their hold on the game was rarely threatened. The hosts continued to look short on confidence after having qualified for the finals via a controversial playoff against Ireland and the crowd vented their frustration by whistling under-fire coach Raymond Domenech during and after the game. African champions Egypt outplayed Fabio Capello's men in the first-half at Wembley, a superb goal from Mohamed Zidan giving them a deserved lead. Crouch helped turn the game around for England after the break with a goal either side of a well-taken effort from Shaun Wright-Phillips. Argentina striker Higuain staked his claim for a place in Diego Maradona's starting line-up with a wonderfully taken goal against Germany, lifting the ball over the goalkeeper before finishing from 30 metres out. After some unimpressive displays Argentina were the better team against the Germans, who only came to life near the end. The Dutch needed a Dirk Kuyt penalty and a deflected shot from Klaas Jan Huntelaar to ease past the Americans while in-form Diego Forlan set Uruguay on their way to a 3-1 comeback win in Switzerland
