<TITLE> Pandemonium in parliament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 13(bdnews24.com)Pandemonium prevailed in parliament on Wednesday, with lawmakers coming near to blows, all sparked by a remark by an opposition MP about Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, later expunged, followed by a reply from a ruling party member on relations between Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia. At one point, BNP MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie charged threateningly towards a member of the treasury bench. The 10 minutes of total chaos ended with the main opposition party walking out of parliament for a third consecutive day. The row started with a comment by BNP MP Shammi Akhter about Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding president and father of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Chief whip Abdus Shahid wanted Akhter's comment expunged. However, deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was chairing the session, said: "We will examine it first." Nearly all the MPs of the ruling Awami League stood together and demanded the comment be wiped from the record. The speaker gave floor to AL MP Iqbalur Rahim following this, as two BNP MPs Moudud Ahmed and MK Anwar wanted to speak at the same time. All the opposition BNP MPs protested loudly at this. Amidst the chaos, Rahim remarked, "If the opposition leader (Khaleda Zia) was here then she would not have called Bangabandhu a pharaoh but rather an angel. Ziaur Rahman was not keen to accept Khaleda Zia as his wife..." Following this utterance, the BNP MPs became furious and started shouting at the deputy speaker. Opposition whip Jainul Abedin said, "We question your neutrality. You are completely biased toward Awami League." AL MP Jainal Abedin, seated just on the left of the opposition bench, stood and told the opposition members to "shut up". This was when BNP MP Annie left his seat and charged aggressively towards Abedin crying: "Grab him!" When Jainal also stepped out of his seat, Annie nearly did "grab him." He was followed by MPs Mahbub Uddin Khokon and Ashraf Uddin Nizan. At this point of mounting agitation, chief whip Abdus Shahid, opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque, MPs Nasim Osman, Shagufta Yasmeen Emily, Zahid Ahsan and others stepped into the midst of the near-tussle to try and defuse the situation. The speaker, who had been quiet for some time, called for order and told everyone to calm down. The women MPs of the opposition, however, began using derogatory language and hurled files and pens in protest. Following a seven-minute shouting session between the treasury and opposition benches, the BNP walked out at 8.05pm. Quiet through the chaos, Iqbalur Rahim resumed his speech and said, "...It was Bangabandhu who made Ziaur Rahman understand and continue family life with Khaleda Zia." The speaker later expunged the comment of BNP MP Shammi Akhter on Sheikh Mujib. The opposition has staged successive walkouts this session protesting "derogatory remarks" about Zia and Khaleda by ruling party MPs, forcing the speaker to appeal more than once for decorum in the House. bdnew
