 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)All police stations across Bangladesh will be brought under a single computer network, which will enable a police officer to get information from anywhere in the country by accessing his computer. "If we can bring all the police stations under a single network, it will make a huge impact on law and order and crime control," Md. Shah Alam, assistant inspector general of police, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. "This will particularly help police officials to share crime and case information, fingerprints and so on," he said. Initially, 105 police stations in 15 districts have been brought under the "computerisation of police stations" programme. The development of the programme's first phase is now underway. According to sources, the police headquarters has already sent a proposal to the home ministry for bringing the remaining police stations under the second phase, which will start subject to availability of budget allocation in the next financial year. The main beneficiary, however, will be the common people who will be able to do many things related to police without going to the police stations, he said. Under the Citizenship Help Request (CHR) project's "police my friend", Dhaka residents in 41 police stations can file general diary (GD) on any missing things sitting at home. Meanwhile, home minister Sahara Khatun inaugurated another new police initiative in Dhaka on Wednesday. Bangladeshis living abroad can now take advantage of the computerised program to file GD online. Besides, anyone including the foreigners can fill in immigration forms by downloading from its website, www.police.gov.bd. According to the police headquarters, efforts are underway for the last few years to modernise the police force through technological development. Under the e-police project, work to bring 73 units of the Dhaka metropolitan police under a single network is nearing completion. The project's second phase will bring all the 600 police stations under LAN (local area network) and all the 64 districts under WAN (wide area network). However, the project will be completed only after the required funding would be available. bd
