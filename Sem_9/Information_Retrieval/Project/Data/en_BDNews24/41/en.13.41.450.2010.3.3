<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina is set to move into the official prime minister's residence Gano Bhaban, after a gap of nearly a decade, following its renovation over the past year. Her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com she would be moving in Wednesday night. Hasina, after coming into power last year, moved from her Sudha Sadan home into the state guest house Jamuna, until Gano Bhaban was renovated and readied for her use. She had moved into Gano Bhaban straight after being sworn in for her last tenure as head of government in 1996. Hasina shifted to Sudha Sadan before the 2001 election and was based there until her move to Jamuna in February last year. "Hasina wanted to shift straight to Gano Bhaban this time too, but it was not possible as the official prime minister's residence had remained unused for seven years, rendering the facility unlivable before its renovation," said Azad. Ganao Bhaban had remained uninhabited from 2001 on, during the BNP and caretaker government tenures.
