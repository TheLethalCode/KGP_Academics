<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's move to her official residence Gano Bhaban was postponed at the last hour on Wednesday after daylong preparations. Earlier in the day, press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com she would be moving in Wednesday night, after a gap of nearly a decade, following its renovation over the past year. Hasina, after coming into power last year, moved from her Sudha Sadan home into the state guest house Jamuna, until Gano Bhaban was renovated and readied for her use. She had moved into Gano Bhaban straight after being sworn in for her last tenure as head of government in 1996. Hasina shifted to Sudha Sadan before the 2001 election and was based there until her move to Jamuna in February last year. "The prime minister after coming to power this time too wanted to shift straight to Gano Bhaban, but it was not possible as the official prime minister's residence had remained unused for seven years, rendering the facility unliveable before its renovation," Azad said. Ganao Bhaban had remained uninhabited from 2001 on, during the BNP and caretaker government tenures. Security personnel were seen at the official residence at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar from noon. Jamuna sources said the prime minister's belongings were being shifted through the day. But after a late-ending parliament session Wednesday night, the move was put off. b
