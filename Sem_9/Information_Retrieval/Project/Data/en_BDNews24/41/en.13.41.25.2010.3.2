 MUMBAI, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday ruled out rolling back a price hike in motor fuel prices despite pressure from his main allies, saying populist policies would hurt the economy in the long-term. Petrol prices rose about 6 percent and diesel prices by 7.75 percent after the government increased factory-gate taxes and import duties on the fuels as part of last week's 2010/11 federal budget, which stressed fiscal prudence to cut a wide deficit.

"The increase in fuel prices, the direct effect on Wholesale Price Index will be no more than 0.40 percent," he said. High food prices helped push wholesale price inflation to 8.56 percent in January. "My hope now is that with the Rabi (winter sown) crop coming into the market, prices which have caused a great degree of concern in areas like wheat, sugar, oilseeds and pulses, will see some moderation," Singh was quoted as saying. Following populist policies indefinitely, Singh said, would harm the economy in the long run, eroding the investment climate and the capacity to create new jobs as well as the government's ability to invest in welfare schemes, Singh said.
