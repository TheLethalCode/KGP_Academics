<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy on Friday expressed his satisfaction over the resolution of all three cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina in court. Talking to reporters at the Naya Paltan headquarters of BNP, he said, "We congratulate the apex court for this decision. All the cases were decided through a legal process." He, however, said, that there is a rumour that the courts perform in line with the directives of the party in power. "We want to think that no such thing happened in this case," the senior BNP leader said. The High Court, on Mar 04 declared three corruption charges against prime minister Sheikh Hasina illegal. All the three cases were filed in connection with the construction of Bangabandhu Novo Theatre accusing Hasina of corruption. Roy also demanded withdrawal or rapid decision of the 'politically motivated' cases filed against the opposition leaders. "The prime minister is the executive head of the country. Cases filed against her party leaders are being withdrawn. But the government is not withdrawing any cases filed against the BNP leaders by the last interim government. People want the same methods to work in case of BNP too."
