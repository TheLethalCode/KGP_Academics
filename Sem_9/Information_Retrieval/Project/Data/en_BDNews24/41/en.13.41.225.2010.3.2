<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Lawyers for BNP senior vice president Tarique Rahman, who is currently residing in the UK, have filed a motion seeking to challenge an arrest warrant issued against him in an extortion case. Tarique's lawyers submitted the petition with Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, recording officer Ratan Sheikh told bdnews24.com. Petitions were also filed by two other accused in the case, including businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun, a close associate of Tarique. A hearing could be held later in the day, Sheikh said. A Dhaka court on Monday issued arrest warrant against Tarique in an extortion case filed in April 2007 by Khairul Bashar, general manager of construction firm Abdul Monem Ltd. The plaintiff Bashar accused Tarique and six associates of extorting Tk 20.31 crore from the construction company on different dates between 2001-2003. Tarique and the other accused were reportedly due to appear before the court Monday. But they neither appeared nor did anyone submit a time petition on their behalf. Warrants were issued against all the accused. However, Tuesday's petition challenging the arrest warrant against Tarique, stated that he was granted bail in the case in August 2008. The High Court also gave a stay order on the case, it said. Tarique, elder son of BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, is accused in over 10 corruption cases filed mostly during the past caretaker government. A Dhaka court on Monday also issued an arrest warrant against Tarique's younger brother Arafat Rahman Coco in a tax evasion case. Both Tarique and Coco have been out of the country since 2008. Jailed in corruption cases, they were released on bail separately by the past caretaker government to seek medical treatment in London and Bangkok respectively. b
