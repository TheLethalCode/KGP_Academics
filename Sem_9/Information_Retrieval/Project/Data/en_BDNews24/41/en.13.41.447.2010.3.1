<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  India's Border Security Force have again reportedly breached the Jaintapur border in Sylhet in an ongoing dispute over a water body on the Bangladesh side, giving rise to an exchange of fire between the two border forces on Sunday, the latest in a spate of similar incidents this month. The latest shoot out occurred as Indian Khashia fishermen crossed the border with an escort of BSF soldiers, a Bangladesh Rifles official said. BDR Sylhet sector's deputy chief Maj Kohinoor Alam told bdnews24.com: "The Indian fishermen crossed Pillar 1284 and entered 1200 feet into Bangladesh to fish in Dibir Haor along with nine BSF men at around 9am." Six BDR guards on duty patrol during the time warned them to stop, said the major. "But BSF did not heed the warning and took position on the banks of the haor." "The BDR members, not wishing to engage with the BSF, returned to their camp after a while." Following their return the BSF members crossed back over the border at around 11am and took watchful positions on the other side, Alam said. "The Khashia fishermen continued fishing until 3pm under watch of the BSF from the other side. After the fishermen crossed over to India, the BSF suddenly opened fire. At this time BDR also returned fire." Alam said the exchange of fire lasted for nearly two hours with the BSF firing continuously till 5pm and BDR firing back sporadically. Locals said the the firing between the two border forces frightened villagers within 5-6 kilometres of the border and many even fled their homes to 'safer locations'. Similar instances of border breach at Jaintapur, with Indian fishermen entering Bangladesh with BSF escorts to fish in the Dibir Haor water body, have occurred at least four times this month. On Feb 4, a group of 15-20 members of BSF entered about 50 metres inside Bangladesh territory at Jaintapur at around 10 am and opened fire. They also abducted a BDR member, who was returned after a flag meeting that evening where BSF promised that no such encroachment would occur in the future. However the Indian border guards again entered into Bangladesh on the morning of Feb 14 leading to a shootout that left three Bangladeshi injured. A high level flag meeting was held on Feb 17 to settle the matter, which apparently failed as a similar incident occurred again on Feb 19. A fishing trip of Indian Khashia fishermen led to BDR-BSF facing off again and the Indian fishermen were chased of Bangladeshi soil by villagers. bdn
