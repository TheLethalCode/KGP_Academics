<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam said Wednesday the border force had fought and overcome many of the difficulties it faced since the bloody mutiny erupted during Rifles Week a year ago. The BDR director general was addressing the annual BDR Durbar on Wednesday, which began at around 11am, at an auditorium next to the Darbar Hall. The Darbar was held as part of the annual Bangladesh Rifles Week programme, which has been curtailed to a single day this year, as a mark of respect for those who lost their lives in the BDR mutiny that was sparked during the annual event last February. It was not being held in the Darbar Hall where the armed uprising against officers began last year, as the hall itself is being used as the venue of the special court set up to try the mutineers. Paying tribute to the officers who lost their lives in the Pilkhana carnage, he said: "The criminals will not be spared. We should be careful as well so that innocent people are not framed." He also said if the border guards who were present in last year's Durbar had taken action such tragedy may not have occurred. The Feb 25-26 Pilkhana tragedy, that claimed the lives of nearly 60 army officers deputed to the BDR, began on the second day of Rifles Week last year, which had been inaugurated the day before by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Unlike previous years, this year's Durbar has borne no extravaganza. "We are paying for a tragedy. There is no grandeur this year," The BDR chief said. Hinting at recent troubles in the border areas, Gen Mainul said: "Many may think that the border force has become weak. But this is not true. We are able to fight back again. People have begun to have faith is us again." The government has approved a new name, Border Guards Bangladesh, a new uniform, insignia and organogram for the border force as part of its reformation in wake of the mutiny. Islam asked the border guards to work hard so that they could regain their previous reputation. Officers of all ranks, JCOs and other designated officials attended the Durbar. Awards were distributed among the border guards for their success in different fields. Addressing them, he said: "We have to take oath anew. We have to work with courage and spirit." The BDR chief vowed to hold a fair trial of the mutiny. "No innocent person will be punished." He said arms and firearms were recovered from many residences after the mutiny, but no witness was coming forward to give testimony on the matter. Regarding the "demands" of the border guards, which the mutineers had expressed last year, the general said: "Demands cannot be realised by terrorism, committing so many killings." He said the criminals must be punished. "How can anyone be spared?" "The jawans who were present in last year's Durbar were weak hearted. If they had taken action such tragedy would not have taken place." The BDR chief lauded the prime minister for her prompt performance to deal with the mutiny. b
