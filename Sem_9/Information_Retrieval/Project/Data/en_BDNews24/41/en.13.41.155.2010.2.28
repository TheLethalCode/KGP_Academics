<TITLE> Muhith blames businesses, red tape for PPP 'flop' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Sunday came down heavily on the business community, for their attitude of "always depending on government help", and partially blamed such a stance for the abortive public-private partnership initiative. He also blamed bureaucratic tangles for the "failure of PPP". "The private sector has flourished in the last few decades. But they have remained too dependent on the government," the minister told a views exchange meeting with members of Economic Reporters Forum at his secretariat office. The incumbent government announced the PPP initiative under the current budget, to bring together public and private sector investments for major development projects. In the past, there have been public-private initiatives in certain sectors such as telecommunications and development of land ports. But no government had previously earmarked a sizeable allocation in the national budget before, specifically for mega PPP projects. Muhith made a provision of Tk 2500 crore for PPP projects in this year's budget to promote investment in infrastructure such as mass transit and large-scale power production. But the much-vaunted PPP concept, seen as critical to economic growth, has been slow off the ground. The government has taken time to finalise guidelines on the initiative, while confusion still reigns as to whether the Ministry of Finance or Board of Investment has the authority to administer PPP-related projects in certain sectors. Muhith said on Sunday: ""Bureaucracy, by its nature, doesn't encourage change." He also said he undertook the PPP initiative this financial year "seeing a large number of rich people in the country". "But they haven't come forward. They are instead dependent on the government." Muhith said leaders of the readymade garment industry have sought incentives from the government one after another, "though they do not pay the government anything other than income tax." He, however, appreciated their contribution to employment generation and foreign exchange earning of the country. To a question, Muhith replied the government would provide incentives in the next budget if needed. He said Tk 3500 crore of the Tk 5000 crore earmarked for incentives to export sectors has already been disbursed and the remaining amount would be released by June. The minister said the government this year cannot prepare a district-wise budget as announced earlier. "We had announced that the next budget would be district-wise. But we cannot do it," he said. The minister added that the revised budget for the current financial year would be placed before parliament in March. bdn
