 LONDON, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) missed expectations with a $7.1 billion (4.69 billion pound) annual pretax profit as accounting losses masked record investment bank earnings and improvement in bad debts at its troubled US business. Profits for Europe's biggest bank in 2009 were down from $9.3 billion in 2008, missing an expected pretax profit of $11.4 billion, according to the average forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. By 9:49 a.m. HSBC's London-listed shares were down 3.28 percent at 696 pence. Profits were dented by a $6.3 billion technical accounting loss on the value of its own debt, more than the $5 billion expected by analysts. Underlying profit before that loss was $13.3 billion, up 56 percent. HSBC said bad debt impairments rose 9 percent to $26.5 billion, broadly in line with expectations.

US losses have reduced as the bank runs off its US loan portfolio and the impact of rising unemployment has been less than expected. Asked if US bad debts had peaked, Finance Director Douglas Flint said: "That would be a reasonable expectation." HSBC's Global Banking and Markets investment banking arm's pretax profit rose to a record $10.5 billion from $3 billion a year earlier as it benefited from buoyant capital markets.

HSBC said there was "understandable public anger" in some countries about excessive pay for bankers so soon after the financial crisis, but said bonuses were a "legitimate and proper element of reward" and remuneration "must be market-based." Flint said compensation at GBM as a ratio of revenue was about 25 percent for 2009. The bank said it would pay bonuses to executives but defer them over three years. CEO Michael Geoghegan said he would give his bonus of up to 4 million pounds to charities. HSBC said it remains in talks to be one of the first overseas companies to list its shares in Shanghai, and will look to raise between $3 billion and $7 billion as part of the listing, sources have said. "It's something we're very interested in doing but the timing is in the hands of the Chinese authorities," he sa
