 TAIPEI, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan is hoping "cultural diplomacy" will win it a higher global profile and give its $390 billion economy a boost without upsetting growing business ties with arch-rival China. The push consists mainly in promoting Taiwanese arts overseas and subsidising higher education in Taiwan for foreigners, areas unlikely to draw the ire of China. The plan will cost some T$1 billion ($30 million) this year. "It's never going to be recognised as Big China, but it may be recognised as a small, non-threatening, cooperative global player," said Shelley Rigger, a political scientist at Davidson College in the United States. "Anything Taiwan can do to avoid becoming invisible is valuable." The island, isolated diplomatically and viewed by its giant neighbour as a renegade province to be recovered, has pursued a policy of making peace with China under President Ma Ying-jeou. This has buffered the island from the worst of the global financial crisis and paid dividends as business links with its mainland rival strengthen. With its traditional export markets in the United States and Europe struggling with steep downturns, Taiwan hopes its diplomatic efforts will boost its economy and global position without either provoking China or allowing it to push reunification through economic control. "I think there is potential for Taiwan to benefit from these kinds of gestures," Rigger said. A major benefit could be long-sought free trade agreements with major countries or trading blocs, said Ralph Cossa, president of the US think tank, Pacific Forum CSIS. Taiwan has been seeking FTAs with the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), among others. It could also gain a role in international agencies such as the World Health Organisation, where China blocks its membership, Cossa added. But the push could upset Taiwan's opposition, which seeks the island's formal independence from China and prefers a more hardline approach to Beijing. "You look at recent election results and can see that voters are dissatisfied with the Ma government's getting too close to China," said opposition law-maker Tsai Huang-lang. "What is cultural diplomacy? I don't know of any results." The opposition has gained parliamentary seats this year due to discontent with the ruling party over a series of domestic problems, and the two face off again in year-end local polls. Any further opposition gains could pressure Ma to moderate his pro-China policies. But the soft diplomacy may also be timely for Taiwan as ties between the United States and China sour over issues including trade, currency quarrels and cyber security. "Of course Taiwan is pressured by a fear of economic isolation," said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong. "From Ma's point of view, Taiwan certainly wants to seek a good understanding with the worl
