<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia urged her party and supporters on Wednesday to prepare for a movement against what she termed the "grand failure" of the Grand Alliance government. "People are threatened from all sides. They are frustrated," she said. "The Grand Alliance government has suffered a grand failure. The people should free themselves from the situation by rising up against it," she told a gathering of pro-BNP lawyers at her Gulshan office. Khaleda once again slammed the government for its failure to curb price hikes and to address the crises of power, gas and water. She also reiterated the opposition's criticisms against the government for deteriorating law and order. She also said false propaganda had been spread against BNP linking it with corruption, claiming that the public "realised that BNP was not involved in corruption". "If BNP had been involved in corruption, such massive development would not have been possible during our tenure," she also claimed. She also alleged that politicisation was rampant everywhere including public administration. "It has been proved that the government cannot run the country." Terming it a government of "grand thieves", she said," The country will lose its sovereignty if they stay in power." "The people are looking to BNP. We have to be prepared for a mass movement." Khaleda had earlier greeted the newly elected president of the Dhaka Bar Association Sanaullah Miah with a bouquet at her office. The pro-BNP lawyers, of the Jatiyatabadi Panel, bagged seven posts including president in the DBA election the week before. Khaleda hoped that BNP-backed lawyers would snatch victory in the Supreme Court Bar Association polls too, due on Mar 23-24. A 15-member pro-BNP panel led by senior lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Hossain will run in the election. Khaleda urged the lawyers to be united ignoring all differences. The gathering was also attended among others by BNP standing committee members Jamiruddin Sircar, Rafiqul Islam Mian and advisory council member Shajahan Omar. bdne
