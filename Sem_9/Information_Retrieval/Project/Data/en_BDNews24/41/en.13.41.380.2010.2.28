 MADRID, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona restored their two-point lead at the top of La Liga when Lionel Messi finished a slick move to fire the champions to a hard-fought 2-1 home win over Malaga on Saturday. Pep Guardiola's side were under pressure after Real Madrid's in-form striker Gonzalo Higuain had struck twice to lead them to a 5-1 win at Tenerife in the earlier kickoff. Real's sixth straight victory briefly sent them a point clear at the top on 59 points from 24 matches before Barca replied by seeing off stubborn Malaga. The Andalucians were pinned back from the start at the Nou Camp where Argentina forward Messi and Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic having early chances. Ibrahimovic flashed a long-range freekick just wide of the post in the 24th minute and Messi shot wastefully over the bar five minutes later.

Central defender Ezequiel Garay made a rare foray forward to set up Real's second in the 42nd, Higuain timing his run perfectly to sweep his compatriot's centre into the net from the edge of the penalty area. Higuain's double gave him 16 league goals this season, one short of top marksmen Messi and David Villa of Valencia. Midfielder Ayoze pulled one back for Tenerife a minute after the break before Brazilian playmaker Kaka restored Real's two-goal advantage two minutes later. Cristiano Ronaldo netted a penalty, his 13th league goal of the season, with 10 minutes remaining and substitute Raul glanced in Real's fifth in added time.
