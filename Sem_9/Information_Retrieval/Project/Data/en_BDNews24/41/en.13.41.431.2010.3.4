<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)  A common brand low-cost car will be manufactured for the D-8 member countries as well as for export to other countries of the world, industries minister Dilip Barua has said. The decision was made at the first meeting of the industries ministries of the member countries held on Mar 1-3, where an automotive specialised working group was also formed, the minster told reporters at a press conference at his office on Thursday. "In the meeting, D-8 agreed to jointly produce a car under a common brand name". "Since Iran, Turkey and Malaysia are the only member countries that have car manufacturing factories, the common brand car will be designed by these three," he said. The D-8 member states currently produce cars, which account for only 5 percent of the total global production. The D-8 was founded by Necmettin Erbakan, former Turkish Prime Minister and Islamist, after an announcement in Istanbul, Turkey on June 15, 1997. The two-member Bangladesh delegation visited Sipa, automobile manufacturer of Iran, and asked them for joint-investment or for establishing a car manufacturing plant in Bangladesh, the minister said. The meeting also discussed some other areas of cooperation among the members, which include energy, environment, technology transfer, petrochemicals, textile, standards and copyrights, small- and medium-sized industries, food, cement, electronics and IT. Bangladesh pressed Malaysia, Iran and Turkey to share its technological know-how with the other members, the minister added. "We stressed on developing bilateral cooperation beside the existing regional groups," Barua said. Additional secretary ABM Khorshed Alam, who accompanied the minister in the three-day meeting, said 11 technical groups have been formed during the meeting. The groups will finalise the outcome of the just-concluded meeting when they meet in Turkey next year, Alam said. The ministers also stressed on increasing intra-trade cooperation, where the specialised products of the member countries will be given preference, he added. The meeting also talked about the possibility of introducing a common standardisation method. Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia and Egypt are the other members of D-8.
