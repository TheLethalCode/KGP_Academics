 WASHINGTON, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States chastised Afghanistan's government on Tuesday for planned curbs on media freedom and for blocking foreign observers from a UN-backed electoral group, but stopped far short of threatening to withhold aid. US Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke said he and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would raise their concerns with the Afghan government after restrictions were proposed this week on news coverage of Taliban strikes. "It is pretty obvious that we support a free press. We don't like restrictions on the press," Holbrooke told reporters when asked about new media guidelines to be announced by Afghanistan's government soon. In another irritant to Washington, President Hamid Karzai recently issued a decree that foreign observers would be removed from the five-member Electoral Complaints Commission, a watchdog group responsible for reviewing voter fraud. That body previously had three foreign members appointed by the United Nations and last year it nullified a third of Karzai's votes in the presidential election as fraudulent. The electoral watchdog decree discouraged Western donors who said previously they would not fund Sept. 18 parliamentary elections unless there were electoral reforms. Holbrooke dismissed the idea Washington might withhold aid as punishment for Karzai's latest actions. "I am not going to speculate on hypotheticals," he said. The Obama administration has been careful not to snipe publicly at Karzai, wanting to show U.S. backing for the new government, particularly as U.S. and NATO forces began a military offensive last month to defeat the Taliban. STEPPING CAREFULLY But US officials have privately pressed the Afghan leader to follow through on promises to tackle corruption and govern more effectively and transparently, saying good governance and delivering services to the local population were crucial to the success of the new counterinsurgency plan. Holbrooke said the US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, had raised "legitimate concerns" over the electoral issue with Karzai. "The integrity of the elections in the eyes of the Afghan people and the international community is very important," said Holbrooke. "It is a legitimate concern of the international community that with all the troops that are there and with all the international assistance, that there be a process which is transparent, free and fair," he added. But he said Washington had its eye on the big picture, which was to help Afghanistan defeat the Taliban and its allies. "We are not going to take our eye off that goal, but to get there, we want to encourage policies that give the broadest possible support to the government from the Afghan people." NATO forces along with Afghan troops are in their third week of an offensive to regain control of the southern town of Marjah, the first test of President Barack Obama's new strategy in Afghanis
