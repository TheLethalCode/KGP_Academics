 Dhaka, Mar 04 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Thursday urged foreign development partners and donor agencies to step forward with the government to eradicate poverty and create food security. He said the foremost priority of the government is to slash poverty by 2021. The government has previously announced its target is to cut the poverty rate to just 15 percent by that time from the current 37 percent. Ashraf also called for more foreign aid to fight poverty just a day after the UK's Department for International Development Parliamentary Select Committee in a 64-page report said that corruption is the key threat in poverty reduction in Bangladesh. The minister was talking at a seminar entitled 'Advantage of food security programmes in Bangladesh', jointly organised by the LGRD ministry, CARE Bangladesh, Save the Children USA and USAID in the capital. Ashraf said the present government wants non-governmental organisations to work independently. He also said a powerful local government system is a prerequisite for establishing a democratic society. "The government has already started several training programmes for the elected people's representatives in local government," Ashraf said. Regarding activities of NGOs, the minister said: "Save the Children is working in collaboration with the food and disaster management ministry to ensure food security for the starving people of 13 upazila of three coastal districts in Bangladesh." Food minister Abdur Razzaque said Bangladesh was moving toward self-sufficiency in rice production and other crops. Razzaque said the poverty level fell from 58 percent to 37 percent in two decades due to the actions taken for the destitute. However, he said, despite these actions there are about 37 million extreme poor people living in Bangladesh. "The present government is concerned about the best utilisation of its wealth. This year 18 percent of the national budget was allocated to the social security sector compared to only 12 percent in the last fiscal year," Razzaque said. US ambassador James F Moriarty and USAID mission chief Denis Rollins also spoke at the seminar. bdn
