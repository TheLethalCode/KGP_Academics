 SAN FRANCISCO, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Freescale Semiconductor says its newest chip will help drive down prices in the next generation of electronic readers, which analysts say is key to the devices gaining mass adoption.

But Burchers said the main demographic for e-readers -- users in their 40s for whom reading is the main leisure activity -- ensure that there will always be a market for a dedicated device. He said Freescale's new chip will be in e-readers on store shelves by the end of the ye
