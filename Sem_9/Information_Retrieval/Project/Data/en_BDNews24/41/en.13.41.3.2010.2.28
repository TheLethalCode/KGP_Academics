Everton, who came from 2-0 down at home to draw 2-2 with Spurs at Goodison Park in December, should have done the same 12 minutes from time when substitute Landon Donovan missed a sitter.

Liverpool, sixth on 45, host Blackburn Rovers later on Sunday. Chelsea, shocked 4-2 at home by Manchester City on Saturday, lead the way with 61 points, one ahead of Manchester United, who were playing Aston Villa in the League Cup final later on Sunday. Arsenal, 3-1 winners at Stoke City, are third on 58 po
