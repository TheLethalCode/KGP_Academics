<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun on Tuesday blamed 'anti-CHT Peace Accord campaigners' for the recent violence in Chittagong Hill Tracts. "Those who cannot accept the peace accord, those who claimed that Bangladesh territory up to Feni district would be gobbled up by India are now trying to create unrest in the hill tracts. They're trying to gain advantage by instigating conflicts between the tribal people and the settlers," she said in an oblique reference to opposition BNP and its allies. She was talking to reporters after a meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order at the Secretariat. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had claimed that a large part of Bangladesh from the CHT to Feni would become Indian territory if the government signed the peace accord. The previous Awami League government signed the accord in 1997 with Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti amid protests by BNP and its allies, including Jamaat-e-Islam. Khatun said: "The plotters are trying to put the government into trouble in different ways." "They are carrying out repeated subversive activities after failing to topple the two-month old government through instigating BDR mutiny last year," she said. The mutiny occurred on February 25-26 last year, less than two months after the government assumed office in January. The identity of the plotters would be divulged after investigation, the minister said when asked for the names. Asked who are the plotters, she said: "Those who do not want pro-liberation forces to remain in power." Claiming that BNP people themselves hurled bombs at party chairperson's office, Khatun said they are now blaming the government for the incident.
