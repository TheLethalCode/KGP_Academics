<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  BDR director general Md Mainul Islam visited the trouble spot at the border between Bangladesh and India in Sylhet on Tuesday. His visit came in the wake of several border fire incidents between Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and India's Border Security Force (BSF) over a dispute at the Jaintapur border in Sylhet in the past one month. Gen Mainul held talks with AK Vargon, BSF deputy inspector general of Shillong sector, at the Protappur border. He assured the BDR chief that there would be no further intrusion from the Indian side until the director general-level talks between the two border forces are held in Delhi on Mar 7. India's Border Security Force have reportedly breached the Jaintapur border in Sylhet several times this month, in an ongoing dispute over a water body on the Bangladesh side, giving rise to exchanges of fire between the two border forces. The BDR chief told reporters during his visit: "All border disputes will be settled politically." "Since the relation between Bangladesh and India are heading for the better, both parties will have to be patient in finding a peaceful solution to border disputes. Bullets cannot be a solution; the solution has to be found through discussions." He further said a joint border working group will soon meet to discuss the issue of illegally occupied land in accordance with the Land Boundary Agreement,1974. The working group last met in 2006, which produced a list of illegally occupied land. The dispute would have been settled if the list were followed, Mainul said. But that was not possible because the BSF claimed that the whole disputed area was illegally occupied. Answering to a query about BDR's submissive attitude towards BSF's intrusion, Mainul said, "It's BDR policy not to fire first. However, they never failed to respond to any provocation. There is no question of weakness. Anyone has the right to retaliate if attacked." The BDR chief also said, "The density of our Border Out Posts (BOP) has never been defined. The density of BOP built during the Pakistan period was nine kilometres, whereas it is only three kilometres for India. But according to the new outline the density will be five kilometres and will be further closer to the border." He expressed hope that the BDR will become a better and more organised organisation with new name and uniform by next week. bd
