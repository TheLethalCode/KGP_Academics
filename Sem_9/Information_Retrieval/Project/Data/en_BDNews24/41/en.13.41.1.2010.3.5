 Rangpur, March 4 (bdnews24.com)  Four days after allegedly forcing women to wear veils while going out, detective branch police sub-inspector Menhazuddin was closed Friday. The order came from the office of Rajshahi divisional deputy inspector general of police Thursday night, said Rangpur detective branch police chief Amjad Hossain Sarkar. Menhaz is asked to report in Rajshahi within Friday, he said. A team of detective police led by Menhaz detained nine young women without veil from Surabhi Udyan and zoo in Rangpur town. Menhaz allegedly ordered women not to go out without veils. Different women organisations and political parties protested the incident. After a writ petition the High Court asked for an explanation from the government and gave an order not to harass any woman without veil. bdnew
