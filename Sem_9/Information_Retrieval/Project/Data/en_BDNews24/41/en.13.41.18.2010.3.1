<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown will Monday urge local authorities to match the central government's pledge to protect police funding in a bid to reduce crime and rid the streets of louts. In December Brown's Labour party, facing severe public spending cuts to tackle a record budget deficit, promised that funding for health, education and policing would be protected, rising over and above inflation after 2010-11. With funding from central government likely to be reduced and access to borrowing still limited, Britain's local councils are also under pressure to find cost savings, but Brown will say these cuts should not hit policing. "My challenge to local authorities and police authorities around the country is to match our commitment to protecting front line policing," he will say, according to extracts from his speech. "Or else explain to their communities why they are not prepared to do so and explain what else is more important than keeping their streets safe and continuing to drive down crime and anti-social behaviour and drive down fear." Brown will also say that from next week, performance records for each police force will be published online to provide details such as how many patrols are being carried out and how quickly police respond to calls from the public. POLICY BLITZ Buoyed by an opinion poll suggesting Labour's pre-election strategy has all but destroyed the Conservative once sizeable lead, Brown's team are keen to sustain the pace of a pre-election policy blitz ranging from the economy to crime. An election is expected on May 6 and David Cameron's Conservatives no longer look a sure bet to win. Cameron says his party would fix what he calls "broken Britain," accusing Labour of failing to win the war against crime. "I greatly resent those who seek to talk down what has been achieved in our communities," Brown will say. "A society in which not just crime and anti-social behaviour but also child poverty, illiteracy, and ill health have all fallen cannot be called a broken society." Anti-social behaviour has raced up the list of voters' concerns in recent years, with many families feeling trapped and intimidated by local bullies or noisy, late night drunks. Brown will acknowledge that "people are still worried about anti-social behaviour." "So that means stepping up our fight against those who terrorise our neighbourhoods; intimidate decent people on our streets; and seek to make us fearful in our own homes," he will say. Government sources said Brown's speech would be followed by a ministerial meeting Tuesday which would look at how to push through further measures such as introducing minimum standards for police responses to complaints of anti-social behaviour. Before the party came to power in 1997, then Labour leader Tony Blair impressed many middle ground voters with his mantra "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime." Citing figures from the British Crime Survey, the government says crime has dropped by more than a third since 19
