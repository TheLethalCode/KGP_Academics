<TITLE> Popular Japan lawmaker eyes new party to fight PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's most popular politician said on Monday he could start a new party to challenge Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's ruling Democrats, as support for the premier slips ahead of an election expected in July. Yoichi Masuzoe, a former health and welfare minister, has topped recent voter polls ahead of Hatoyama, despite being in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost power in an election for parliament's powerful lower house last August. A new party under Masuzoe could pose a threat to Hatoyama's Democratic Party, which needs to win an outright majority in the mid-year upper house poll to avoid policy deadlock. Masuzoe, popular for his straight talk and image as a battler of bureaucrats, said he was weighing whether to stay in the LDP to revive its fortunes from within, or to bolt from the party to start a new group that embraced economic reforms. "I am exploring both of these options," the multilingual former academic told a news conference in English. "Naturally, I also have in mind the possibility of a political realignment involving members of other parties such as the DPJ (Democratic Party of Japan)." The LDP, accused of squandering taxpayers' money and failing to fix Japan's tattered pensions system during more than 50 years of almost unbroken rule, faces a tough fight to woo back voters. Although support for Hatoyama's five-month-old government has slipped due to political funding scandals and doubts about the premier's leadership, the LDP has made up no ground. FRUSTRATED VOTERS A survey by the Nikkei business daily on Monday showed support for Hatoyama's Democrats down one point at 41 percent, but the LDP's score was unchanged at 24 percent. Analysts say frustrations with the two parties could prompt voters to flock to minor opposition parties in the upcoming vote. Masuzoe said the decision of whether to start a new party would depend on the LDP making gains in opinion polls and whether top party officials backed his calls for economic and structural reforms, including cuts in corporate tax rates. "The problem is that this school of thought remains a minority in our party," Masuzoe said of his ideas for reform. "We need ... an overwhelming majority in our party. If not, it is really impossible for our party to get power back," he said, joking that for many voters, the party's acronym now stood for "lousy dumb party." Hatoyama has his own headaches after aides to his party's No. 2 leader were charged for misreporting political funds. He also faces a self-imposed May deadline to resolve a feud with Washington over a US military base in southern Japan. Masuzoe echoed some analysts who say the prime minister could be forced to resign before the election if he fails to mend fences with Washington, Japan's top security ally, over where to relocate the airbase. Adding to Hatoyama's woes, Kyodo news agency reported on Monday that prosecutors had arrested four people, including a senior member of a teachers' union, on suspicion of providing illegal donations to a Democratic lawmaker. "After budget debates end in March, I think April will be a season of huge political storm," Masuzoe sa
