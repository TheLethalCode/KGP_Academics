 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Target for revenue collection for the first half of the current fiscal year has been achieved, according to the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry. "The government's revenue collection from July to January amounted to Tk 311.25 billion , which is 99.97 percent of the targeted Tk 311.35 billion for the period," AHM Mustafa Kamal, the standing committee chairman, told reporters Sunday after a meeting with the National Board of Revenue. Income tax collections amounted to Tk 70.23 billion against the targeted Tk 67.78 billion, which is 22.56 percent of the total revenue collected, a half percent increase from the same period of the previous fiscal. Meanwhile, revenue from VAT stood at Tk 114.83 billion, which is Tk 3 million more than the projection. It constitutes 36.98 percent of the total revenue collection, almost a 2 percent rise from the last fiscal. Revenue from import duties during the July-Jan period amounted to Tk 123.97 billion against the targeted Tk 126.30 billion. Collection of other revenue sources such as excise and travel taxes, however, fell short of the projected figures. It amounted to Tk 2.21 billion against the targeted Tk 2.73 billion. Kamal pointed out that the NBR achieved this with a limited manpower. To overcome this, he stressed on removing obstacles to fresh appointments including tax inspectors. "The NBR cannot fill its vacant positions as there is a lawsuit in the High Court regarding the matter," he said. Some former NBR inspectors had filed cases with the High Court about 20 years ago, protesting their removal from the job. The Court subsequently directed NBR to refrain from appointing new inspectors till the matter is resolved. The committee has already asked the finance ministry to resolve the legal disputes on appointments, added Kamal. "The manpower strength of the NBR remained the same for decades though the activities of the board had increased manifold," Kamal told the media briefing.
