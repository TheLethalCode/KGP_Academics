<TITLE> Parliament will be more efficient: Speaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid has expressed hope that the parliament will become more efficient in the future with the cooperation of government and opposition parties. His hope came in response to a journalist's query after inaugurating a children's drawing competition in the parliament's yard on Friday. "The parliament will be more efficient if the government and opposition parties become more cordial. Tolerance of other's opinions is essential for democracy. I hope that they will make the parliament more efficient through help and tolerance for each other," the speaker said. Hamid inaugurated the children's drawing competition titled "Science, Technology and Society". It was jointly organised by the parliament secretariat and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The Speaker on Thursday threatened to resign if the prevailing "misconduct of MPs" in parliament continued. He blasted members of both treasury and opposition benches just a day after lawmakers came near to blows in the house, terming their behaviour "shameful for the nation". Pandemonium broke out in parliament on Wednesday sparked by a remark of an opposition MP about Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, later expunged. It was followed by a reply from a ruling party member, which was uncomplimentary to Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia. The speaker on Thursday criticised the MPs and urged them to be "more concerned with the hopes and aspirations of the people who had elected [them]". Members of both ruling and opposition parties welcomed the speaker's efforts to restore the sanctity of the parliament. They also promised to be less confrontational to each other
