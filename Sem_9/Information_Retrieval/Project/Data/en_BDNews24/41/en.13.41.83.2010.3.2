 Bbaria, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Export-import activities in Brahmanbaria's Akhaura land port was halted from Tuesday morning due to a transport strike in India's Tripura state. The transport strike was called protesting against fuel price hikes in India. Monir Hossain Babul, general secretary of Akhaura land port exporters-importers association, said the government would be deprived of revenue of at least $60,000 if business at the port were suspended for a day. Petrol prices rose about 6 percent and diesel by 7.75 percent in India last week.
