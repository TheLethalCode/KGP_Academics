 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government has approved the tender proposal for a flyover that would eventually connect Purbachal, an under-development satellite town, to Dhaka's main road network by linking it with the Kuril-Biswa Road. The cabinet purchase committee gave the green light on Monday in a meeting chaired by finance minister AMA Muhith. The cost of construction has been estimated at Tk 153 crore, said Md Nurul Karim, joint secretary of the cabinet division. The proposed flyover will be built on 12.6 acres of land above the Joar-Sahara rail crossing. Bangladesh Railway will provide 10 acres of land and the rest will be locally acquired. The purchase committee also approved the procurement and import of 1 lakh tonnes of wheat to increase food stocks. The cost has been estimated at Tk 162 crore. Of the import, 60 percent shipment will be done through Chittagong port while the rest will come through Mongla port. This was the fourth meeting of the purchase committee after the government took office in January 2009. b
