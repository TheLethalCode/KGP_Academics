 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Legendary Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who has the highest number of Test wickets under his belt, is planning to quit cricket's longer version after the tour of West Indies in October, reports PTI. The spin wizard has already announced that he will quit all forms of the game after the 2011 50-over World Cup. The 37-year-old off-spinner is just eight wickets shy of becoming first player to touch the magical 800-wicket mark in Test cricket. "Maybe I will play one or two Test matches, that's it, and then retire. The Tests against the West Indies will be the last ones I will play," Muralitharan said. "My future is all about playing one-dayers until the World Cup. If I am fit and good I will play until the World Cup and the World Cup will be the end of the road," he said. Muralitharan said his aim was to reach the 800 Test wicket mark before retiring. Muralitharan is currently playing for Sri Lankan domestic side Kandurata in the inter-provincial Twenty20 tournament to decide the country's representatives at the Twenty20 Champions League. He also confirmed that he will play in third edition of the Indian Premier League despite a threat by terror outfit al-Qaeda and also urged his team-mates to go and play in India. "All the Sri Lankans will go. If you don't go it is bad because there will be no cricket on the subcontinent at all. It is a difficult question," he said. Cricinfo adds: Muralitharan says he has forgiven John Howard for publicly deciding in 2004 that he was a chucker but remained unconvinced of the former Australian prime minister's ability to woo the powerful Asian bloc. Howard was on Tuesday nominated by the boards of Australia and New Zealand as their candidate for the post of ICC president from 2012 but the champion spinner felt he would have to do plenty of convincing to do outside his home territory. Muralitharan had boycotted Sri Lanka's Test tour in 2004 after Howard copied the view of many of his subjects by questioning his action. "At the time I thought it was wrong - that was my opinion and he had his," he told the Age. "It was not appropriate at the time but it's all [in the] past. We've got to think about the future: how is he going to handle things in cricket? It won't be an easy job. He has to convince the subcontinent - that's going to be a tough challenge for him." Murali was subjected to crowd taunts during that visit to Australia but the reception he received during the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal in 2005, as well as a meeting with Howard afterward, changed his mind and he visited as part of the World XI later that year as well as during his country's tour in 200
