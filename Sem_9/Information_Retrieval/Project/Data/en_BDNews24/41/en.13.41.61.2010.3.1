<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  A list of suspected war criminals will be made public after completion of investigation for trial of 1971 war crimes, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Monday. "It will be known through the investigation who are the war criminals and who will be tried. The list will be published after the investigation," he told reporters after a meeting with a European Union delegation. When his attention was drawn to certain newspaper reports that had named persons "identified by the government as war criminals", the minister said he knew nothing about such "identification". "I know nothing about it and had no discussion with anyone on the matter." To a question, he said the process is under way to appoint investigators, lawyers and take other necessary measures for the trials. "The government will finalise everything as early as it can." A three-member delegation, led by EU counter-terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove, proposed setting up a training institute in Bangladesh to tackle terrorism and militancy, Shafique said. The minister said they would act on the proposal once it is formally submitted to the government. bd
