 SARGODHA, Pakistan, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police submitted on Tuesday charges of plotting terrorism against five young Americans detained last year, a lawyer said. The students, in their 20s and from the US state of Virginia, were detained in December in the town of Sargodha, 190 km (120 miles) southeast of Islamabad, and accused of contacting militants over the Internet and plotting attacks.

The case has raised alarm over the danger posed by militants using the Internet to evade tighter international security measures and plan attacks. The five, who earlier told the court they only wanted to provide fellow Muslims in Afghanistan with medical and financial help, face life imprisonment if convicted, Dastagir said.

Police have said emails showed they contacted Pakistani militants who had planned to use them for attacks in Pakistan, a front-line state in the US-led war against militancy. The five have accused the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Pakistani police of torturing them and trying to frame them. Pakistani authorities deny the accusations of mistreatment.
