 Kishoreganj, Mar 03 (bdnews24.com)  The daily Janakanto's Kishoreganj correspondent filed a general diary complaint on Wednesday against the paper's editor Atikullah Khan Masud for malpractice. Correspondent Shah Azizul Haque, who is also an acting public prosecutor of the district judge's court, said: "The editor was putting pressure on me to do unethical things, which is illegal. As this is related to my security and honour, I have filed a general diary." Haque, in his complaint filed with Kishoreganj police, said that the editor was pressing him to do such things as "spreading influence at government offices" to increase circulation of the paper. As he refused to do such "disgraceful" work, Haque said in his complaint, the editor phoned him twice from a number, which was cited in the document, with threats. Kishoreganj model thana police chief, Meer Mosharraf Hossain, said they had received such a complaint and "necessary actions" would be taken. bdnew
