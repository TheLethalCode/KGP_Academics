 NEW DELHI, Feb 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government will raise retail motor fuel prices by close to 3 rupees (up to 7.75 percent) from midnight on Friday, the first hike since July, a move that will add to already high headline inflation and risks sparking political protests. Petrol prices will rise about 6 percent and diesel prices by 7.75 percent, the oil ministry said, hours after the finance minister increased factory-gate taxes and import duties on the fuels as part of the federal budget for the next fiscal year. The budget announced by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee also restored a 5 percent import tax on crude oil, which was removed in 2008 when global prices were at record highs, as part of a broader effort to raise revenue and cut the fiscal deficit. "The philosophy of this year's budget is that we have to live with high inflation. It's not a local issue, it's because of international factors, and the cost of containing inflation is higher," said N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think tank. Beginning at midnight, petrol prices will rise by 2.71 rupees (6 US cents) a litre while diesel prices will rise by 2.55 rupees, a move the government said will add to inflation. "We are forced to pass on the burden to consumers," said Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan, referring to the tax hikes. In his budget, Mukherjee outlined an import tax of 5 percent on crude oil and 7.5 percent on diesel and petrol. He also said factory gate taxes on the fuels would go up by 1 rupee a litre. The tax hikes on refined fuel and crude in the budget prompted opposition protests in parliament, with lawmakers walking out on the finance minister's speech. SUBSIDY BURDEN India sets retail prices for fuel below market rates to protect its citizens from higher prices and manage inflation, a subsidy that adds to New Delhi's fiscal burden. A recent government panel report urged the freeing of controls over automotive fuels, although the government has not taken any action as yet on the politically charged issue. Friday's budget proposals would add 0.42-0.43 percent to wholesale price inflation, which touched an annual 8.56 percent in January, said the finance ministry's chief economic adviser, Kaushik Basu. State oil marketing firms, which are partially compensated for selling fuel at subsidised rates, said prices had to be increased for them to protect their profits. Mukherjee said oil companies will continue to receive subsidies in cash instead of oil bonds, but slashed the petroleum subsidy for the fiscal year starting April 1 to 31.08 billion rupees from a revised estimate of 149.54 billion rupees for the current fiscal. STANDALONE REFINERS SQUEEZED The new taxes may put pressure on margins for standalone refiners such as MRPL and Chennai Petroleum, said Deepak Pareek, an oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking. Reliance Industries, last year shifted its focus from exports to selling domestically from its 660,000 barrels per day refinery as global demand fell, and could also see its refining margins squeezed as a result of the tax, Pareek said. Its other large refinery sells products entirely for export. Shares in Reliance, India's biggest private company, ended the day up 1.42 percent, outpacing the 1.08 percent gain in the market, encouraged by a budget that included measures to lift private consumption. "Restoration of the import duty on crude will negatively impact private refiners like Reliance, which export the bulk of their products as they do not get compensation from the government," Pareek said.
