 Dhaka, Mar 03 (bdnews24.com)  Lawmakers on Wednesday passed two bills designed to streamline and develop the insurance sector. The bills - Insurance Bill 2010 and Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority Bill 2010, will be helpful to better regulate the industry and protect customers' interests, policy makers claimed. The current Directorate of Insurance will cease to exist after the bills become laws. The laws would renew and update Insurance Ordinance 2008 and Insurance Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2008 of the past caretaker government. A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Mar 30 last year, approved the draft of these two bills. Finance minister AMA Muhith placed the bills in parliament. Describing the necessity of the bills, Muhith said: "These bills are being moved to develop the insurance industries. They will serve the interests of the policyholders and beneficiaries from insurances." The Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority will be constituted with a chairman and four members. The chairman, as the chief executive of the institution, will be in charge of running the authority. The headquarters of the institution will be established in Dhaka. Insurance Bill 2010 said the bill was moved aiming at modernising and updating the old Act and to reduce the risks of investment in trade and commerce. Under the new insurance law, maximum penalty for any violation will be Tk 10 lakh in fine while the minimum fine will be Tk 50,000. If the violation continues, an additional fine of Tk 5,000 per day will be imposed. bdn
