<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  Amnesty International on Monday called on the government of Bangladesh to conduct a 'prompt, independent and impartial' probe in to death of two indigenous hill people claimed to have been killed when army opened fire at Baghaichhari between Feb 19-20. An Amnesty statement dated Feb 26, 2010 urges the government to find out whether law enforcers at Baghaichhari used excessive force and breached UN principles. The statement also quotes extracts from the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials outlining the principles that law enforcers "may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty" and "intentional lethal use of firearms" is only to be made "when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life". Amnesty International urged 'prompt, impartial, and independent' probe into 'these attacks and killings' for 'identifying individuals' responsible for torching houses and 'army personnel' who have used 'excessive force' and bring them to justice in fair trial without resorting to death penalty. They also asked the government to ensure that the 'detainees have access to lawyers of their own choice, can challenge the legality of their detention, have access to family visits and medical treatment, and are not at risk of torture'. The government was also asked to compensate 'the victims and survivors of the attacks, rehabilitate the people who have lost their homes and belonging and provide them with medical treatment for their injuries'. Finally the international rights organisation asked the government to 'allow independent observers to visit the sites of the violence, and ensure the security of the Jumma indigenous people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
