 Dhaka, March 1 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh should focus on cyber-security as it is entering the digital era, the UN's ICT chief, Hamadoun Tour, said in Dhaka on Monday. "As we are entering the age of Internet, we need to ensure that it's safe," Tour, secretary general of the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU), told media at the airport on his arrival for a four-day tour. Citing the spread of hacking, fraud and child pornography over the Internet, he said it was important to ensure security before giving internet access to the general people especially children. "We also have to make sure that cyber space is not misused by criminals and terrorists," he said. ITU, the UN agency for information and communication technology affairs, works in collaboration with governments in matters like regulatory and policy framework, infrastructure, spectrum management and capacity building, said Tour. Touching on the topical issue of climate change, the ITU chief said that they were working to integrate ICT for facing and mitigating impacts of global warming.
