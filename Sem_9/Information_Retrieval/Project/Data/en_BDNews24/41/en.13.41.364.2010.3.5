 Rajshahi, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) A month-long international trade fair has begun Friday at the Rajshahi Collectorate field. Organised by the local chamber of commerce and industry, the fair was inaugurated by commerce minister Faruk Khan. Speaking at a meeting on the occasion presided by Chamber president Abu Bakar, the minister said that the greater Rajshahi division has been neglected in the past, creating a huge disparity with other regions. "We'll bring an end to this disparity", Khan said. Rajshahi will be supplied with natural gas through pipeline within the next year and a meter gauge rail line will be constructed from Abdulpur to Rohanpur, he said. The minister also promised to initiate steps for setting up two power plants after consultation with the power minister and the prime minister. City mayor AHM Khairuzzaman Liton, Fazle Hossain Badsha MP, Enamul Haque MP, metropolitan police commissioner Nawsher Ali and deputy commissioner Shefaul Karim attended the inauguration. The fair has 118 stalls, 11 pavilions, two food corners and one tower.
