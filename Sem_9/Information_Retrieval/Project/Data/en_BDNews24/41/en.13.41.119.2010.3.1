 Gazipur, March 1 (bdnews24.com)  Another Bangladesh Rifles member, who was arrested after the mutiny last year, died at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur Monday morning. Havilder Md Enamul Haque, 52, belonged to BDR's 2nd Battalion and was from Chhoto Rajapur village in Companyganj upazila, Noakhali. This is the second death of a BDR member in the same jail in the space of just two weeks. Another suspected mutineer, nayek subedar Golam Mostafa, 47, died on Feb 17. Enamul was arrested in the wake of the mutiny and was sent to Dhaka Central Jail on March 23, 2009. He was later transferred to Kashimpur Jail on May 29. He complained of a severe headache after taking his breakfast Monday morning and was promptly sent to the jail hospital, Md Forman Ali, Kashimpur jailor, told bdnews24.com. Later he was sent to the Gazipur General Hospital where he was pronounced dead, the jailor said. Ali Hayder Khan, on-duty doctor at the Gazipur hospital, said Enamul was already dead when he was brought to the hospital. Deputy jailor Mushfiqur Rahman said Enamul's body will be handed over to relatives after the post mortem. Seventy-three men and women, including more than fifty army officers, were killed during the mutiny at Pilkhana BDR headquarters in February last year. The authorities have charged over three thousand BDR men for their alleged involvement in the mutiny. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, have voiced concerns that detained BDR members are being tortured following custodial deaths of mutiny suspects over the past year. bdnew
