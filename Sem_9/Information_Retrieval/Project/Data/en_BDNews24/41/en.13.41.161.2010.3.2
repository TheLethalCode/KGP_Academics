 LOS ANGELES, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Actress Pamela Anderson and 80-year-old former astronaut Buzz Aldrin were on Monday named among a line-up of celebrities for the latest series of hit TV show "Dancing With The Stars." Kate Gosselin, who rose to fame through the reality TV show "Jon and Kate plus 8," will also feature in the ABC network's highest-rated show, in which famous personalities pair with professional dancers in a knockout ballroom dancing contest. The 10th season of the series starts on March 22. "Dancing With The Stars" is the second most watched show on US television after "American Idol" which is on Fox, and is based on the British TV show "Strictly Come Dancing." Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, "Beverly Hills 90210" star Shannen Doherty, ESPN host Erin Andrews, comedienne Niecy Nash and British soap star Aiden Turner will also be put through their paces on the show. The line-up also includes some sporty participants such as Olympic gold medalist figure skater Evan Lysacek and NFL star Chad Ochocinco. "These actors, athletes, musicians, reality stars, astronauts(!!) and where-are-they-now personalities start out as lumbering Frankensteins with two left feet, and they slowly transform (we hope) into graceful twinkle-toed Baryshnikovs," the production team said on the show's website. Last season was won by singer Donny Osmond, who was the oldest winner of the dancing contest at the age of 52. The final last November attracted an audience of 19.2 million but this was the lowest rated ending in the show's four-year history. Walt Disney Co's ABC is the second-most-watched US network with an average audience of 9.1 million overall after CBS Corp's CBS wit h11.6 million. Previous winners of "Dancing With The Stars" include Olympic gold medal gymnast Shawn Johnson, model and TV host Brooke Burke, Olympic gold medal figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, and Brazilian auto racing driver Helio Castronev
