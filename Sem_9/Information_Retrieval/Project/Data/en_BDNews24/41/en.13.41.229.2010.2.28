<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  Filling station owners have threatened a countrywide shutdown of their pumps unless the government meets certain demands, including raising their commission from 2 to 7 percent, within the next two weeks. Announcing the 13-point charter of demands and the ultimatum to the government on Sunday, they said pumps would be closed for six hours from 6am to noon on Mar 14 if their demands were not met by March 13. "All transport and sales of fuel will remain suspended during the period," said Md Nazmul Haq, convener of Bangladesh Petrol Pump and Tanker Owners and Workers Unity Council. Tanker lorries and pumps distribute and sell fuel throughout the country from three oil companiesMeghna, Jamuna and Padmaunder the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation on a commission basis. Their other demands include formulation of a policy for petrol pump operations, establishment of testing laboratories at every depot, a raise in fares for petrol tankers, and stopping police harassment in the name of "examining documents". He said they have been compelled to announce the programme as the government did not respond to any of their demands submitted in writing on Feb 13. Mentioning that the government in 1990 had cut down the commission for fuel sale from 5 percent to 2 percent, he said: "Since then we've been demanding a raise in the commission. But no government has paid any heed to our demand." He said fuel traders have been heavily indebted as the government has not raised the commission during the past two decades, when commodity prices, employees' salary and other costs have risen substantially. Nazmul said a total anarchic situation is prevailing in the fuel distribution system. "We've not got any policy for setting up petrol pumps in last 38 years. Permissions were given to ministers, MPs and other influential persons to set up around 400 filling stations during the (four-party) alliance government, thanks to the lack of such a policy." Alleging that police frequently harass the tank lorry drivers and workers in the name of checking documents, he said: "Papers should be examined at depot gates." Council leaders Md Akter Hossain, Shajahan Bhuiyan and Mizanur Rahman Ratan were present at the press conference. bd
