 Dhaka, March 03 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University syndicate Tuesday night suspended 10 students for their involvement in the violence on the campus on Feb 2-3 in which Abu Bakar, a DU student was killed. The syndicate approved the suspension following recommendations of the probe committee, which was formed to investigate the incident. They would not be able to attend any classes or examinations, DU vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said after briefing the press about the syndicate decision Wednesday noon. The university authorities also decided to serve notices to the suspended students within two weeks asking them to explain as to why they should not be permanently expelled. The suspended students are: Sayeduzzaman Faruk (Arabic), Mansur Ahmed Roni (Education Research Institute), Asaduzzaman Jony (Philosophy), Alam-e-Julhas Jewel ( Accounting), Abu Zafar Md Salam (Library Management), Enamul Haque (Law), Mashidul Islam Khan Tapu (Economics), Rakibuddin (Accounting) and Mehedi Hasan Milon (in Bangla). Among the suspended, Faruk is a former president of A F Rahman hall of the pro-government student organisation Bangladesh Chhatra League. Roni and Salam were members of the last hall committee of pro-BNP organisation Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal. They joined BCL after the Awami League-led grand alliance government came to power. The probe committee report said that Bakar was hit by hard materials like brick, rods, or iron pipes. It also presumed that this hard material might be tear gas shell, the DU VC said. The report recommended to form another high-powered committee comprising of specialists to find out the real reason behind Bakar's death. It also asked the concerned law enforcement authorities to form a probe committee to investigate the role of police on that day. Pro-VC Harunur Rashid, also the head of the nine-member probe committee, and proctor KM Saiful were also present at the briefing. Abu Bakar, a third year student of Islamic Studies and Culture department, was injured on Feb 02 in a clash between two BCL fractions. He died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital on the following day. bdne
