 Savar, March 01 (bdnews24.com)  A team of the Rapid Action Battalion on Monday arrested a woman with eight powerful bombs and a gun from Savar in Dhaka. The detained woman has been identified as Julie Begum, 20. RAB-4 Savar camp commander, squadron leader Mizan-ul-Haque, told bdnews24.com that at around 3.00pm they raided an abandoned house of drug dealer Munna, in the Mazidpur area, which is known as 'drug spot' at Savar. Noticing the presence of RAB members, everyone other than Julie managed to escape, he said. RAB searched the entire house and recovered a gun and eight bombs from a heap of garbage, RAB officials said. The law enforcers also recovered five pairs of specially made shoes which can conceal heroine worth Tk 30,000, they claimed. Haque said that the house had been under RAB's observation for last three days. The entire house was electrified to prevent strangers from entering and the elite crimebusters had to disconnect the power lines before going in. The RAB members had raided that house several times earlier and suspected that the electrification measure was essentially to prevent further raids, said the official. Julie, arrested for her alleged connection with the drug dealers, told reporters that her job was to supply heroine. She also claimed that she started doing the work only on Monday. She also claimed that an Alamgir, assistant of Munna, had brought her to this house and assured a salary of Tk 100 per day. She was later given a mobile phone to communicate with customers. Julie confessed to reporters that her father Shukur Ali and elder sister Jesmin Akhter were involved in selling Phencidyl. Arrested by RAB, they were in jail, she said. RAB officials said a case would be lodged. bdn
