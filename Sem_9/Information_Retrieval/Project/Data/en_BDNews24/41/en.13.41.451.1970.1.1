 GENEVA, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea called on North Korea on Tuesday to return to six-party talks on Pyongyang's nuclear programme, saying a nuclear North Korea is unacceptable. Cho Hyun, South Korea's deputy minister for multilateral and global affairs, said his government would pursue a two-track approach to North Korea, combining dialogue and sanctions in parallel. "The Republic of Korea maintains the firm position that a nuclear North Korea will not be tolerated," Cho said in a speech to the United Nations-backed Conference on Disarmament. North Korea and South Korea are both members of the 65-nation body. Six-party talks are the most viable framework for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, he said, adding: "We urge North Korea to promptly return to the six-party talks and show a sincere attitude towards denuclearisation." South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak has proposed a "Grand Bargain" demonstrating Seoul's willingness to resolve the issue, according to the deputy foreign minister. The policy aims to capture in a single agreement all steps related to North Korea's "irreversible and complete denuclearisation" and involves corresponding measures by the five other parties, he said. UN sanctions and a botched currency move that nearly halted commerce late last year have increased pressure on the destitute North. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last Friday that she was encouraged by signs that North Korea may be preparing to return to stalled talks on its nuclear programme. The United States would keep working to pull North Korea back into the negotiations it abandoned a year ago, which increased uncertainty across the region, she said. Two senior US envoys on the North Korea issue wrapped up a tour to the region for talks with South Korea, Japan and China, which along with the United States are pushing to resume dialogue with Pyongya
