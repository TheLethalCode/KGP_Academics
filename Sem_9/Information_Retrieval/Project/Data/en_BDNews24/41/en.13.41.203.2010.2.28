 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com)  England cantered to a six-wicket win against Bangladesh in the first of the three-match Beximco ODI series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. Vice-captain Paul Collingwood led the way with an unbeaten 75 off 100 balls with seven fours as England reached their target scoring 229-4 in 46 overs. He featured in an 88-run fourth-wicket stand with Eoin Morgan who contributed 33 before being caught at extra cover. The tourists made a solid start putting on 73 runs before debutant Craig Kieswetter was stumped for 19 off Naeem Islam in the 13th over. Star batsman Kevin Pietersen's batting blues continued when he was caught in the slips for only one off Shakib Al Hasan in the next over. Naeem then sent back skipper Alastair Cook lbw for 64 off 68 balls with six fours. But TV replays showed the ball missing the stumps. Naeem was the pick of the bowlers with 3-49. The next match is on Tuesday at the same venue. Earlier, a magnificent century from Tamim Iqbal helped Bangladesh to reach 228 all out in 45.4 overs. Tamim was bowled by Stuart Broad. He smashed 13 fours and three sixes in his 120-ball knock. The left-hander departed shortly after Mashrafe Bin Mortaza's comeback lasted just one run before he was adjudged lbw off spinner Graeme Swann, who finished with 3-32. Bangladesh made a flying start after being asked to bat adding 63 runs in nine overs before Imrul Kayes (15) was caught at mid-on after being deceived by slower delivery from Tim Bresnan and then Junaid Siddique (0) joined him eight runs later after he clipped a leg-stump half-volley straight to square leg off Broad. Aftab Ahmed was run out for two by Kevin Pietersen to make the Tigers 82-3 after 12 overs. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan was the next to go caught behind off Swann after adding 30 runs in a fourth partnership with Tamim Iqbal. England then struck a double blow in the 30th over to leave the hosts reeling on 147-6. First vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim needlessly ran himself out and then Mahmudullah was dismissed first-ball off Swann for a duck. Naeem Islam (25 of 31 balls) was caught off Luke Wright's first delivery. He added 63 valuable runs with Tamim. England gave Kieswetter a debut as a specialist batsman at the top of the order with Matt Prior keeping wicket after Cook's first ODI in charge started tidily, winning the toss and choosing to field. Bangladesh included Mashrafe, their most experienced paceman, who returned from in
