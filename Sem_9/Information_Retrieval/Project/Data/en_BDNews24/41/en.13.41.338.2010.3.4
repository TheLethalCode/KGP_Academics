 Dhaka, Mar 04 (bdnews24.com)  HBM Iqbal, former Awmai League MP and Premier Bank chairman, currently in jail, secured bail in an illegal wealth case filed by the Anticorruption Commission in 2007. A High Court bench of justices M Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddique granted the bail on Thursday upon a petition by Iqbal. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud stood for the petitioner. His bail was granted just three days after a lower court sent him to jail on Feb 28 when he surrendered to the court for the first since his conviction two years ago. Iqbal was sentenced in absentia to 13 years in jail on March 11, 2008. He became a fugitive since then but resurfaced after the Awami League government came to power last year. Iqbal was found guilty of concealing his assets worth Tk 22.9 crore in the wealth statement submitted to the ACC. His wife Momtaz Begum and two sons Moyeen Iqbal and Ikram Iqbal were also convicted in the case. Iqbal's lawyers, however, said that a High Court verdict has stayed their convictions. bdne
