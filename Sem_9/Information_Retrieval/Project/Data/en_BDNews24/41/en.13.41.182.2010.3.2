 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangabandhu fellowship is going to be reintroduced to help students pursue post-graduate studies and researches in science and technology. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) Tuesday endorsed the Tk 60 crore 'Bangabandhu Fellowship on Science and Information and Communication Technology Project' at a meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Planning secretary Habibullah Majumder told reporters after the meeting at NEC Bhaban that 200 students would be given the fellowship in five years to help pursue their MS, M Phil and PhD studies and researches at home and abroad. The previous Awami League government in 1999 introduced the fellowship, which was shelved after BNP-led four-party alliance government came to power in 2001. The meeting approved five other projects -- agriculture assistance programme-2 (Tk 426 crore), rehabilitation and augmentation of distribution network of DPDC (Tk 169 crore), upgrading and expanding distribution system in Gulshan Circle-first revised (Tk 595 crore), and upgrade of Pabna Textile Institute to textile engineering collage (Tk 45 crore), and building six district complexes of Bangladesh Shishu Academy (Tk 64 crore)
