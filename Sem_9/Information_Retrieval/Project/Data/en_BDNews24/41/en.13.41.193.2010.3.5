 LONDON, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The wife of the British ringleader of a suspected al Qaeda plot to blow up transatlantic airliners in midflight using liquid bombs was found not guilty on Friday of failing to alert police. Cossor Ali's husband Abdulla Ahmed Ali and two others were jailed last September for the attempt in August 2006, known as the "liquid bomb plot" which was described as being on the scale of the Sept. 11 2001 attacks.

Militant Islamic books were also found in their one-bedroom flat in Walthamstow, east London, as was her husband's will.
