<TITLE> Hamilton to replace father as manager </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton is looking for a new manager after he and his father Anthony decided to call time on one of the closest partnerships in Formula One. McLaren's 2008 world champion, whose career has been guided by his father since he started out in karting at eight years old, told reporters Tuesday that both felt the moment had come for the relationship to change.

Hamilton said he would still benefit from his father's advice but looked forward to being able to just having a beer with him or going on holiday together.
