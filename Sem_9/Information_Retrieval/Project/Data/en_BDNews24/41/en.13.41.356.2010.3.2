 DUBAI, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paceman Brett Lee, who retired from Test cricket last week, said he hoped to spearhead Australia's attack at the World Twenty20 tournament to be staged in the Caribbean from April 30. "I am working very hard on my fitness. My arm is coming along very nicely and if everything goes well, I will hopefully take that new ball for Australia and lead the attack for couple more years," Lee told Reuters on Monday. Lee, 33, played his last Test for his country against South Africa in late 2008 and has since struggled with foot, side and ankle injuries, with the side strain robbing him of the chance to take part in last year's Ashes series against England. The fast bowler was in Dubai on Monday to unveil a new cricket facility along with other international players, including India's Yuvraj Singh and Irfan Pathan. Lee said he was keen on fine-tuning his fitness in the upcoming Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament for his team, the Kings XI Punjab. "To me this is my first opportunity after a long time to play cricket. I will be out there and I will be looking forward to it. Definitely, I love it," he said. Lee reiterated that retiring from Test cricket meant he could focus on extending his international career in shorter forms of the game. "I want to make it very clear that I haven't finished cricket. I still have Australian cricket that I want to play, fifty overs, Twenty20, my IPL which I want to play for a long time, provided that my body can stack it up and I am confident that I can continue," Lee said. "I have a lot of other interests. With the retirement, I have more time to chase other dreams and aspirations and still play cricket for Australia and still play on the big scene which is what I want to do." Lee, one of the fastest bowlers of the modern era, made his debut in 1999 and racked up 310 wickets at 30.81 in 76 Tests, the fourth highest Australian wicket-taker of all time behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillie. When asked about the best Test batsman he had bowled to, Lee picked out India's Sachin Tendulkar. "There are probably 20 good players whom I bowled against but Sachin Tendulkar, he just had everything. I am a big fan of his and it's been a big pleasure to bowl to him," Lee
