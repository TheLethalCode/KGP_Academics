 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com) ---- Three union parishads, Matuail, Shyampur and Dania, under the Tejgaon circle of Dhaka, last went to polls in 1988, their terms expiring in 1993. Not only in Dhaka, a total of 79 union parishads of 31 upazilas in 26 districts across the country have been without elections for 15 years or more because of legal barriers. The Election Commission urgently wants to hold polls to these union parishads this year after resolving the cases. The EC secretariat has written to the local government division asking it to take a speedy decision to this effect. "We have urged the local government division to move to resolve the impending cases on an emergency basis," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com this week. "They will inform us after taking necessary measures in consultation with the law ministry," he said. The commissioner said the EC would arrange elections to the 79 union parishads as soon as the cases have been resolved. Formulation of election regulations and code of conduct in line with the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act 2009 is near completion, he added. Out of 4504, union parishads, the lowest tier of local government in Bangladesh, the terms of most have already expired. The last lot of union parishad polls were held between January and March in 2003. 'SPURIOUS CASES' But polls to 79 remain longest overdue because of all kinds of "spurious cases". "We have information that the union parishad representatives or their people file lawsuits in a deliberate bid to prolong their power," Sakhawat said. These include five union parishads in Narayanganj district that have not been to polls since 1990; another four in Narayanganj and one in Rangamati since 1992. Eleven union parishads in Noakhali, Bandarban and Feni districts last went to polls in 1995. Eighteen in Cox's Bazar, Khagrachari, Comilla, Laxmipur, Narsingdi, Gazipur, Sylhet; Bogra; Sariakandi and Pabna districts last saw elections in 1997. Another ten in Natore, Dinajpur, Lalmonirhat, Jessore, Magura, and Kushtia went to polls for the last time in 1998. Nine union parishads in Chandpur, nine in Manikganj and eight in Rajshahi have not seen elections since 2003. 'POLLS IN MAY' Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has said union parishad elections would begin again from this May. "Union parishad elections throughout the country used to span over three months in the past but we want to hold the polls in different phases in the different regions," Sakhawat told bdnews24.com. "Union parishads in 15 coastal districts under Barisal, Khulna and Chittagong divisions will go into polls at first phase." The election commissioner said overdue polls cause sufferings to the local inhabitants. "I hope that all complexities will be removed with the cooperation of the government," Sakhawat said. bdn
