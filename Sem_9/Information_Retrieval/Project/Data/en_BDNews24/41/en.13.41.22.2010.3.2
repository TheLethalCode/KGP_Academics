 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh let England off the hook as the tourists posted an exciting two-wicket victory at the floodlit Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday to clinch the Beximco ODI series. England now lead the three-match series 2-0. The third match is in Chittagong on Friday. Chasing 261 for victory, England's lower-order capitulated and only a brilliant century from Eoin Morgan (104-ball 110) carried the side home with seven balls to spare after skipper Alastair Cook made a 61-ball 60. From a relatively comfortable score of 223-6 they slumped to 229-8 and were in danger of losing their first ever limited-overs game against the Tigers after Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan captured 3-32 and fellow left-spinner Abdur Razzak took 3-43. But Morgan held his nerve and fittingly hit the winning runs with a six off Shariful Islam. Earlier, half-centuries from Mushfiqur Rahim and Imrul Kayes steered Bangladesh to their highest ODI score (260-6 in 50 overs) against their opponents, who won the first match at the same venue by six wickets.

Towards the end of the innings debutant Sohrawordi Shuvo delighted the crowd with with some lusty blows that carried the team past 250-mark. His six-ball blitz yielded 14 runs. Bangladesh lost two wickets in the first 15 overs. Tamim Iqbal (30 off 25 balls) and Aftab Ahmed (4) both to irresponsible shots. Tamim had just slammed Stuart Broad for a boundary and tried to repeat the shot with the score on 46 in the 10th over and Aftab departed an over later (56-2) trying to swipe to midwicket but only managed to see his stumps rattled. Both teams made changes with spinner James Tredwell making his debut after being handed his England cap during practice. He came in for Ryan Sidebottom, who picked up a thigh strain in the first match. Bangladesh dropped Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who is struggling to regain fitness after returning from a long lay off with chronic knee injuries, and Junaid Siddique. They were replaced by slingy right-arm seamer Rubel Hossain and Sohrawordi Shuvo, a left-handed spinning all-rou
