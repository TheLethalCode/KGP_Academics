 Dhaka, Feb 28 (bdnews24.com) -- New Zealand won a thrilling game against Australia on Sunday in a Super Over after Brendon McCullum hammered the second-highest international Twenty20 score, reported BBC Sport. Tim Southee took 6-1 in Australia's Super Over - the equivalent of extra-time - after the two sides tied on 214. Shaun Tait then fired down two wides as man-of-the-match McCullum and Martin Guptill made 9-0 in New Zealand's over.

Gareth Hopkins weighed in with a 17-ball 36 before Nathan McCullum (14 not out) joined his brother to hoist New Zealand past the 200-run mark for the first time in the shortest form of the game. Australia's top order all contributed, with David Warner getting them off to a flyer with 20 off only 10 balls. Brad Haddin, with 47 off 36 deliveries, kept the Aussies rattling along before Michael Clarke and Cameron White nearly took Australia to victory. White blazed his way to an unbeaten 64 off only 26 balls while Clarke, who made 67 off 45 deliveries, was run out off the final ball of the regular overs going for a third run which would have given Australia vic
