<TITLE> Spending in focus as Brown faces Iraq inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown will appear before an inquiry examining the country's role in the Iraq War on Friday, seeking to avoid any political fallout which could damage him with an election just weeks away. Brown will be the most prominent figure to give evidence before the five-person panel since his predecessor Tony Blair made a highly-publicised appearance in January. While a far less vocal advocate of the war than Blair, critics have accused Brown, who was chancellor at the time of the 2003 US-led invasion, of failing to provide enough funding for military chiefs to equip troops properly. Some relatives of the 179 British soldiers killed in Iraq say this failure led to unnecessary deaths and are demanding that the inquiry team, headed by former civil servant John Chilcot, press Brown for answers on the issue. The issue of support for Britain's military remains contentious because 10,000 troops are fighting in Afghanistan and face a similar threat from insurgents. Anti-war protesters plan to demonstrate outside the hearing venue in central London, criticising Brown for signing off 8.5 billion pounds spent on the war in Iraq. The invasion of Iraq has been one of the most damaging episodes during the Labour Party's 13 years in power, provoking internal divisions and huge public protests. With an election due by June 3 and polls indicating that Britain is on course for a hung parliament, Brown will be anxious to avoid any embarrassment. UNCOMFORTABLE HEADLINES "My sense is they'll be pleased to get this out of the way, there will be uncomfortable headlines over the weekend, but there'll be another story by Monday," said Mark Wickham-Jones, professor of political science at the University of Bristol. "Given that thus far the questioning hasn't been particularly hostile, I wouldn't think it would be a particular problem for Brown. "He'll have been coached extensively, they will have spent a lot of time considering what kind of line he'll take." Initially the inquiry, which Brown himself set up last year following long-standing calls from opposition politicians and bereaved families, said it would not call any government ministers until after the election. But in January Brown said he would appear whenever the inquiry asked him after opponents challenged him to give evidence before the poll. The most difficult questions for him will revolve around whether he was to blame for any funding cuts at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) which impacted on the military's ability to adequately equip forces before and after the invasion. Several witnesses, including a former defence secretary, have already said a lack of finances had led to shortages, particularly of helicopters, while Britain's defence chief has said troops were deployed without adequate equipment. A lack of helicopters is blamed for an over reliance on lightly armoured Snatch Land Rovers which critics said failed to provide enough protection for troops against insurgents' roadside bombs, resulting in dozens of fatalities. Jocelyn Cockburn, a lawyer representing the families of some British soldiers killed in Snatch Land Rovers, has written to Chilcot asking him to quiz Brown on the issue. "Gordon Brown was in the Treasury during the whole period and allegations have been made that funding wasn't forthcoming," she told Reuters. "It's important to identify whether it was the Treasury refusing funding or whether the proper questions weren't being put by the army or the M
