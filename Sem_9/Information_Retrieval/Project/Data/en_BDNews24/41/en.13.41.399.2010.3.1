<TITLE> Tigers aim to bounce back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will be aiming to bounce back from their six-wicket defeat on Sunday when they meet England in the second match of the Beximco ODI series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday. The second game of the three-match series begins at 2:00pm Bangladesh time. Despite a valiant century from Tamim Iqbal it was not enough to rescue the hosts. Though coach Jamie Siddons was full of praise for Tamim's innings of 125 from 120 balls, he felt the player's performance could have set the tourists a stiffer had he applied himself. "It's great to see one of the boys stepping up, and they do it regularly now," Siddons told Cricinfo. "Hundreds used to be very rare, but in the last few months we've put together six or seven, so that's amazing stuff for individuals. But it probably needed one guy to make 50 or 60 with Tamim, and then who knows? I've seen it happen to better sides as well, but it's disappointing. It was a very flat wicket and we got first use of it, but no-one [but Tamim] went on." The manner in which Tamim reined his innings in, from a 32-ball fifty to a 94-ball hundred, was especially pleasing for Siddons, who claimed it was a sign that his message was finally getting through to a talented but temperamental squad. "Team rules warranted him pulling his horns in a bit and batting through the innings, and he was six overs away from doing that," Siddons said. "So he stuck to the rules. He knows how to dominate, but when we lose a few wickets, he knows how to back off and work the innings around. "Right from the time I got here, my philosophy was that we were going to get some world-class cricketers here, because I don't believe we've got any," he said. "And now I think we've got two or three. Tamim is proving to me that with the hundreds he's getting against the better sides, and the way that he is making them, that he is world-class. He's capable of taking on any player in the world and having some success." England spinner Graeme Swann also reserved particular praise for Tamim. "He certainly seems a good prospect. He came out all guns blazing and fair play to him, he smashed it everywhere. We kept getting wickets at the other end, so it put a lot of pressure on him, but the way he responded and tempered down his innings was very impressive. It was a good knock." But Swann was not willing to admit the series was over after just one match. "It is nice, having won the first match, to know that this next game could potentially wrap up the series, but on the other hand, if you're the team that's 1-0 down, you only need to win tomorrow to be right back in it. It's good for the game."
