 Dhaka, Feb 28 ( bdnews24.com)  HBM Iqbal, former Awami League MP and Premier Bank chairman, convicted in an illegal wealth case, was sent to jail on Sunday, two years after his conviction. The court of Dhaka special judge ASM Aminul Islam ordered Iqbal to jail on his surrender in the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission on June 25, 2007. Iqbal was sentenced to 13 years in jail on March 11, 2008. He has been shown fugitive since the case was filed. Iqbal was found to have assets worth Tk 22.9 crore that were not declared in a wealth statement to the ACC.

His wife Momtaz Begum and two sons Moyeen Iqbal and Ikram Iqbal were also convicted in the case. Iqbal's lawyers, however, said that a High Court verdict has stayed their convictions.
