 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Zimbabwe recovered from a disastrous start to pull off a remarkable win over the West Indies in their Twenty20 international in Port of Spain on Sunday, reports BBC Sport. The visitors could not have made a worst start to their innings as they slumped to 0-3 but Hamilton Masakadza hit 44 to help them to 105 all out. Zimbabwe then bowled 18 overs of stifling spin to leave the home side no hope of getting close to their target. They were left needing 33 off the final over and fell 26 runs short on 79-7. The match was the first ever Twenty20 meeting between the teams, and was important for Zimbabwe as another step on their hoped-for return to Test status - but even they would not have expected quite such a remarkable match. The West Indies looked well in control as Zimbabwe got off to a disastrous start and Darren Sammy (5-26) and Sulieman Benn (4-6) produced the third and fourth best bowling figures in Twenty20 history. Benn bowled Vusi Sibanda with the first ball of the match, then claimed Tatenda Taibu lbw and had Stuart Matsikenyeri caught behind in his second over. Brendan Taylor became the fourth duck of the innings before Masakadza and Greg Lamb put on 40 for the fifth wicket. Sammy claimed both their wickets, Lamb for 11 and Masakadza for 44, before removing Chigumbura, Shingirai Masakadza and Prosper Utseya. Ravi Rampaul claimed the one wicket not taken by Sammy or Benn, bowling Graeme Cremer for two. Masakadza saved Zimbabwe's innings from complete collapse and Elton Chigumbura's late knock of 34 from 19 balls gave them some hope, but a West Indies' victory seemed likely as they made a steady if not inspiring start. Openers Adrian Barath and Shivnarine Chanderpaul did not seem troubled as they scored 21 off the opening six overs, but once Barath was out for eight, the rot set in. Cremer (3-11) and Lamb (2-14) did much of the damage, with their spin strangling the West Indies middle order. Chanderpaul did his best to keep the innings going, but once he was out for 20, the writing was on the wall, and not even Dinesh Ramdin's 23 could save the West Indies from a shock de
