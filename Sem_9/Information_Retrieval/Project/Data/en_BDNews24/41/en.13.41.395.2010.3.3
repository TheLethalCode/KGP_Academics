 Dhaka, Mar 3 (bdnews24.com)  Police detained seven activists of Islamic Chhatra Shibir from a Dhaka University hall early Wednesday. Residents of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall said they had caught the seven Shibir activists while they were holding a "clandestine meeting" in the hall roof at around 2am. They were handed to police at around 3am. Of the detainees, all were DU students, six were residents of Bangabandhu Hall, said hall provost Dr Baituallah Quadri.
