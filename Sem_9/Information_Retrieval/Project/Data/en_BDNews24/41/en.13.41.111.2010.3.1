 Dhaka, Mar 1 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to announce a hike in electricity prices for domestic and commercial users. Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission secretary Khurshid Alam told bdnews24.com that it will announce the new power tariffs of four providers at a press briefing to be held at 4pm Tuesday. The increase in tariff for different categories would be around 5 percent on average, Mohammad Hossain, power cell director, told bdnews24.com on Monday. "The hike will vary according to category, especially among the domestic consumers," he said. BERC decided on the new tariffs following requests by four state-run entitiesPower Development Board (PDB), Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC), Dhaka Electricity Supply Company Limited (DESCO) and West Zone Power Development Company Ltd (WZPDCL). The operators have been seeking to raise prices for some time on the grounds that they are incurring losses. The Rural Electrification Board (REB) also requested the same, but its application was not accepted since it did not follow the official procedure correctly. They have to resubmit the application, a BERC official said. The government last increased tariffs for consumers in March 2007 and the bulk tariff for PDB's clients in October 2008. Domestic consumers under DESCO, consuming 100~400 kWh units every month, are currently paying Tk 3.25, while PDB consumers are paying Tk 3.50. Meanwhile, the commercial consumers are paying Tk 5.30 as a flat rate. Tariff in the agriculture sector stands at Tk 1.94 per kWh, according to PDB.
