 Dhaka, Mar 05 (bdnews24.com)  At least three workers died of toxic gas inhalation at a tannery in capital's Hazaribagh on Friday. Police said it appears that the death was caused by toxic gases created by chemical reaction. Nine others also became sick in the explosion at the Apex Tannery at around 7am, police said. Hazaribagh thana police chief Enamul Haque told bdnews24.com, "Those three were dead on the spot from toxic gas" The dead workers have been identified as Md Solayman, 55, Shah Alam, 45, and Dulal Mia, 45. The sick labourers were admitted to hospital. The High Court, on June 23 last year, ordered all tanneries in Hazaribagh to vacate the area by Feb 28, 2010. The court, however, extended the deadline by six months for the relocation of the environmentally hazardous industries on Feb 28. bdn
