 Dhaka, Mar 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Former Australian prime minister John Howard has finally been nominated by the boards of Australia and New Zealand as their candidate for the post of ICC president from 2012, reports Cricinfo. Howard, who led the country from 1996 to 2007, will have the position rubber stamped in June and will succeed India's Sharad Pawar in two years. The decision ends a long-running dispute over the preferred Australasian candidate.

"It was an extremely difficult decision and ultimately relied on the input of Sir Rod Eddington, whom both cricket boards respect enormously," Clarke and Isaac said. "The ICC faces significant and complex internal and external challenges in its quest for cricket to become a genuinely global sport. Australia and New Zealand considered a number of distinguished candidates of global stature before deciding to invite John Howard to consider the role." The ICC presidency is given to countries by rotation and the incumbent David Morgan, the ECB's representative, will hand the responsibility to Pawar in June. Howard will then act as vice-president and take over after Pawar's two-year tenure ends. His nomination will be approved at the ICC's executive board meeting in April and the position will be finalised at the annual conference in the middle of the
