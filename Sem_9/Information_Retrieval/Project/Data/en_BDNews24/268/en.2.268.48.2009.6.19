 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Younus Khan dedicated his team's Twenty20 World Cup semi-final win over South Africa on Thursday to the long-suffering fans afflicted by militant violence back home. Pakistan did not play a single test last year and last March six Sri Lanka players were wounded by a group of armed militants who fired on the team bus in Lahore. Six Pakistani policemen and the driver of the bus carrying the match officials were killed. "We know it will give a big lift to everyone back home if we can win this competition," Younus told a news conference. "This World Cup is everything to us. "We are suffering from everything in Pakistan and everyone knows about all the fighting, a lot of fighting. If we can lift the Cup, it will provide great cheer for the people." Younus and South African captain Graeme Smith paid a special tribute to all-rounder Shahid Afridi, whose 51 from 34 balls propelled Pakistan to 149 for four. His figures of two for 16 from four overs then made it difficult for South Africa to sustain a successful run chase. Smith denied South Africa had "choked" after losing the 1999 and 2007 World Cup 50 overs semi-finals. "Every time we lose an important game, that word, chokers, is thrown around," Smith said. "But we have played great cricket and I am proud of the way the guys have performed. "Afridi was the difference. His four overs brought Pakistan back into the game. We lost our way and never got back into it.
