 BUENOS AIRES, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's Estudiantes beat Defensor Sporting of Uruguay 1-0 in La Plata on Thursday to reach the Libertadores Cup semi-finals. Estudiantes, South American champions from 1968-70, won the tie 2-0 on aggregate and will meet another Uruguayan side, three-times winners Nacional, in the last four. Striker Leandro Benitez scored in the 13th minute from Juan Salgueiro's cross following a good move down the right started by captain Juan Sebastian Veron, whose father Juan Ramon played for the title-winning side. Estudiantes and Defensor, who upset favourites Boca Juniors in the previous round, began the tournament as outsiders and Veron said: "It's nearly 40 years since we had a semi-final. "It's great for the club, in La Plata," he added, referring to the first leg to be played at home on June 24. Towards the end of the first half, Estudiantes defender Christian Cellay cleared off the line from Diego Vera after Argentina goalkeeper Mariano Andujar came out badly to a high ball into his area. Uruguayan Salgueiro could have increased the home side's lead but his low shot came back off the far post. Benitez spoilt a good chance to score a second goal in the 78th minute when he shot straight at Defensor goalkeeper Martin Silva in a solo breakaway. Nacional qualified on Wednesday, becoming the first Uruguayan team to reach the last four since 1988, the year they won the third of their three titles
