 Brahmanbaria, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered a cache of forty cocktail bombs from Brahmanbaria town on Saturday, just a day after two bombs exploded on Akhaura rail tracks. The hand-made devices were found at north Mourail graveyard early on Saturday, said Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan, officer-in-charge of Sadar Police Station. "The bombs have been neutralised by soaking in buckets," he said. Police suspect the cache of explosives might be linked to an organised group. No arrests have been made yet, said Bhuiyan. A general diary has been filed at the Sadar Police Station. Two bombs exploded at the Durgapur rail crossing at Akhaura on Friday. Two unexploded devices were also recovered from the spot. Nine bombs were recovered from Brahmanbaria's Eidgah grounds a few days ago. The people of the town have expressed concern at so many bomb-related incidents within a few days. bdnews
