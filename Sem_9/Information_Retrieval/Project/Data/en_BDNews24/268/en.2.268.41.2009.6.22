<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Feni Soccer Club and Shuktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj lock horns on Tuesday in the final of the inaugural Champions Club Cup football tournament at Cox's Bazar Stadium. Both sides first emerged unbeaten regional champions with three wins and a draw to qualify for the 12-team finals where they also won their respective two group matches to advance to the semi-finals. The Narayanganj outfit stormed into the final with an emphatic 3-1 win against Pabna Brothers Union while the Feni outfit struggled against Shaheed Muktijoddha Moeen Smriti Sangsad of Jessore 3-2 in a tiebreaker. Shuktara Jubo Sangsad are likely start favourites as they stayed almost two weeks in Cox's Bazar while Feni Soccer Club reached the venue a coupe of days ago after having played their matches in Jessore. At a pre-match press conference in Cox's Bazar, both coaches sounded confident of bringing the title home. Shuktara coach Rezaul Karim Liton promised to put up a spirited show. "The attacking department of Feni Soccer is pretty good, but all of our players are equal in term of standard and I think they are capable of clinching the title," said Liton, a midfielder of the professional league team Brothers Union. Liton said that he would play in a 4-4-2 formation against Feni soccer's 3-5-2. "We are more organised side in the tournament and I am happy in the way the boys fought in the previous matches and we will certainly play for win," said Feni coach Mir M Faruque. Faruque is also banking on three players Rana, Rashed and Rezaul, who were picked for the provisional national squad. bd
