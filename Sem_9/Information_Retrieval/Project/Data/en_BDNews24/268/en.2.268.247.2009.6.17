 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)The Human Rights Commission has called for urgent passage of the HRC law in parliament that will allow it to function. "Our hands and feet are tied and we are unable to perform our tasks for lack of the law," said HRC member Munira Khan. "We want to do meaningful and constructive work, but the rules and regulations of the HRC are yet to be formulated." The commission's chairman and two members called on the law minister Shafique Ahmed at the secretariat on Wednesday. The law minister said, "The National Human Rights Commission Bill was placed in the last session of parliament and I hope it will be passed in the current session." Asked about the recent 'crossfire' controversies involving elite security force RAB, the commission's chairman Amirul Kabir Chowdhury said, "We have given a statement protesting extrajudicial killings." "We want each and every incident be investigated separately and the perpetrators be brought to book," said the former justice. In limbo On his discussion with the minister, the Chowdhury said, "We spoke about past activities of the commission, future planning and many problems." The National Human Rights Commission Ordinance was passed in 2007 under the past caretaker government. A chairman and two commissioners were appointed on Dec 1, 2008 for three years. But the 2007 ordinance has yet to be ratified by the present parliament that convened under an elected government in January this year. The commission's proposed work includes investigation of any allegation against government agencies of violation, or instigation to violate, human rights. It would also dispose of accusations through mediation or other resolutions. The commission's duties would include monitoring human rights in prisons, correction centres and other forms of custody. It will also report to the government on its activities and make recommendations on ratification or signing of international human rights documents. The commission will not be entitled to deal with any cases pending trial in court or matters being considered by any ombudsman. Nor will it deal with the actions of in-service government employees that can be tried under the Administrative Tribunal Act 1980. bdn
