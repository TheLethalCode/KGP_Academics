 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  At least ten people have been injured as management and workers of a readymade garment factory clashed at Malibagh in the capital on Saturday. Workers of Noman Fashion, near Malibagh level crossing, clashed with the owners over the sacking of co-workers, Ramna police chief Shibli Noman said. The clashes sparked off at around 8am. Later the workers blocked the DIT road for an hour. They were seen massing by the road until about 11:30am. Runa Begum, an injured worker admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said a superviser assaulted a female worker a few days ago. "As she complained and sought justice, she was fired," said Runa. "She went to the factory on Saturday to ask for her job back. But the owners' people attacked the workers." Khilgaon police chief Nobojyoti Khisa said they were trying to reach a resolution between the two parties. He said the workers claimed the owners attacked them first, while the owners claimed the opposite. bd
