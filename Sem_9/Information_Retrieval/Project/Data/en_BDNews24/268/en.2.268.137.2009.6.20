<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  After making "significant progress" in recent interrogations of former NSI and CUFL officials in the 2004 Chittagong 10-truck arms case, the Criminal Investigation Department is now turning its investigations towards tracing the source of the weapons consignment. Following interrogations, CID says it has evidence of the involvement of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, Pakistan-based firm ARY and Indian separatist organisation Ulfa. But the source of arms was yet to be unearthed. Investigation officer Moniruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com last week: "The toughest phase of investigation is over. It will take some more time to reach the final stage." "We have identified and arrested many people involved in the transport of the arms from before and after the unloading (at Chittagong's CUFL jetty)." "But we haven't got any specific information about the source of the arms. We are trying to find that out," he said. Other CID officials concerned with the case said it was now clear who were involved inside the country but they had no clear idea yet about the people outside. A CID official, preferring not to be named, said they were also investigating whether they needed to arrest or interrogate anybody else in Bangladesh. Since its third fresh investigation into the case, since 2004, began in January, CID has made significant progress, said officials. Moniruzzaman said former and serving officials of National Security Intelligence and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited gave important information during grilling and affidavits in court. The investigation team also went to shipping companies and managed to obtain papers regarding the ship used for transporting the arms. "We are now examining that information," he said. "We will also quiz the seven accused who have been bailed n the case and set our next strategy at the directions of our top officers," the investigation officer said. CID started its third phase investigation prioritising the issues of source and destination of the arms and those at the top of the arms smuggling chain. The earlier investigations got no further than identifying those involved with the transportation of the arms consignment once it had reached Bangladesh. After a new IO was assigned in January this year, a number of former and serving NSI and CUFL officials were detained, including ex-CUFL managing director Mohsin Talukder and ex-manager Enamul Haque, two former NSI chiefs Abdur Rahim and Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former NS director Shahab Uddin Ahmed, former deputy director Liakat Hossain and field officer Akbar Hossain Khan. Of them Shahab Uddin has given two recorded statements in court, while Talukder, Khan and Rahim have given one each. Two trucking contractors Hafizuddin and Deen Mohammad, who were arrested earlier, also gave statements. CID officials said they were considering the two statements provided by Shahab Uddin as their main evidence. The former NSI official's first statement "played it safe", said CID officials. But on June 13, in a second 10-hour statement, he revealed significant information of the smuggling process, they said. CID special superintendent for Chittagong zone, Mohammad Muslim, told bdnews24.com they were nearng the end of the investigation. Chittagong police seized the 10-truckloads of weapons and ammunition on April 2, 2004 as they were being unloaded at the port city's CUFL jetty. Karnaphuli police chief Ahadur Rahman filed two cases that night. bdnews24
