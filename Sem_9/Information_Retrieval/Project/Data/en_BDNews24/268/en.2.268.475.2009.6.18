 LONDON, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Flintoff suffered another batting failure on Thursday but England's team director said the all-rounder is a certainty for the first Ashes test against Australia if he does not suffer any more injury setbacks. The Lancashire player is back in first-class action with his county after a knee operation and is expected to be selected by Andy Flower for England's three-day practise match against Warwickshire which starts on July 1. Flintoff took six wickets for Lancashire against Durham last week although scores of nought and three with the bat, together with a meagre 12 on Thursday against Hampshire, will not be causing alarm in the Australian ranks. "It is very good news that Andrew is back playing again and apparently recovered from his operation," Flower was quoted in The Sun on Thursday. "Getting first-class cricket under his belt is very important for his readiness for the Ashes series. "I'd think Flintoff would be in the squad for the match against Warwickshire. He is a shoo-in for the first test if he is fit and firing." Flintoff was the outstanding bowler for England when they won the Ashes series in 2005 although he has been plagued by ankle problems since then. The first test begins in Cardiff on July 8
