 TOKYO, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan captain Yuji Nakazawa has admitted that defeat to "pizza-eating" Australia in their final World Cup qualifier stung badly. The Yokohama defender missed Wednesday's 2-1 loss in Melbourne with a migraine but did not pull his punches after analysing a tape of the game upon returning to Japan. "We were beaten by pizza eaters," Nakazawa told Japan's Fuji newspaper. "They were on a different level to us."

Japan coach Takeshi Okada is scheduled to leave for South Africa on Saturday. Okada plans to arrange warm-up games against Spain, Brazil and Italy before the 2010 finals
