<TITLE> Democracy at work despite budget session boycott: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)The work of parliament is continuing even though the main opposition has been absent in the budget session, the finance minister has said. "The treasury MPs are giving their opinions on tax structure, offer on whitening back money and other issues in the proposed budget. It proves that democratic processes are at work in parliament though the main opposition is absent," AMA Muhith said on Thursday. He spoke to reporters after a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh Auto Biscuit and Bread Manufacturers Association at the Secretariat. "Even though I want they attend the session and give their views on budget," he said. Muhith was asked whether he would take an initiative to get the opposition join the budget session. "I must want they join the session. But I think they are not attending for three reasonsseating arrangement dispute, the opposition chief's house-related problem and her security issue." The government did not enforce any new law for the security of the opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia. The law the BNP-led government had enforced during their regime was in force now, the finance minister added. "They should not mix the housing-related problem with the budget," Muhith observed. "But it is indeed their 'prestige issue'. It is also a reflection of their greedy mentality. This tendency should be given up. On the row over seating arrangement in parliament, he said: "Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar did not do the right thing. What is being done now is right. "The incumbent speaker is continuing with his initiative on the matter." The former speaker allocated the main opposition eight seats but the current speaker reserved only four for the main opposition on the front row. On the budget provision of legalising both legally and illegally earned undisclosed income, the minister said many government MPs had expressed their reservations about the offer. "The time to take any decision has not come yet." The budget discussion will continue until June 29 and a final decision will be made on June 30, he said. On June 16, Muhith said the government may review the terms for whitening black money on basis of discussion in parliament. In an unprecedented measure, the government has proposed in the budget for FY 2009-10 a lengthy three-year amnesty to draw 'black money' into the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. bdnew
