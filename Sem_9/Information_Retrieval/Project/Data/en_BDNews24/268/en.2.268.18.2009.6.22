 LONDON, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Maria Sharapova gathered her poise after a poor start to claim a 7-5 6-4 victory over Ukrainian qualifier Viktoriya Kutuzova and a place in the second round at Wimbledon on Monday. Sharapova, ranked 60th in the world but given a special seeding of 24, slumped to a quick 4-1 deficit in the opening set but saved a set point and bounced back to seal the opener. Kutuzova, the world number 79, pushed Sharapova hard in their first tour meeting but the Russian prevailed on her first match point when the Ukrainian netted a forehand. Sharapova, the 2004 winner, will face Argentina's Gisela Dulko for a place in the third round
