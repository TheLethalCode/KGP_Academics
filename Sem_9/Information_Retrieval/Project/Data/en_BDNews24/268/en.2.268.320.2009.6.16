 Dhaka, June 16 (bdnews24.com)Officials have cited two laws, the RPO and MP Act, to back the Election Commission's demand to have Salauddin Qader Chowdhury's seat cancelled after the opposition MP claimed neither the EC nor the Speaker had the power to strip him of the right to represent his electorate. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said on Tuesday the EC was recommending to the Speaker that the senior BNP leader stands disqualified as MP from Chittagong-2 for submitting false info in his nomination papers and defying a court order to rectify it. Sakhawat referred to section 12 of the Representation of the People Order, which states an MP will lose membership if he provides false information in his affidavit to the EC, amounting to perjury. Sakhawat added: "The Speaker will take necessary steps according to parliamentary laws." "The Member of Parliament Act can be followed in this case," he said. "We will send a letter to the Parliament Secretariat on Wednesday to request cancellation of Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's parliamentary seat," EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com. AKM Salimullah, deputy secretary at the Election Commission Secretariat told bdnews24.com that seven attachments will go with the letter, including a copy of Chowdhury's affidavit and the verdict of an EC hearing on an appeal against his nomination last December. bd
