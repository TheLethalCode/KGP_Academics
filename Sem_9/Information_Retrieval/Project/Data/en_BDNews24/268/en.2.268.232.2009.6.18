 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)The global downturn offers a golden opportunity as Bangladesh remains recession-proof for five specific reasons, industry minister Dilip Barua said on Thursday. "Firstly, we have gained surplus in food because of bumper production of crops," he said Secondly, the western countries will not be setting up garments industries anew and expenses in garment industries will rise in our rival countries such as India and China, he said Thirdly, there is a sound in-flow of remittance, said Barua. Fourthly, despite the recession's impact in a few sectors, most of our native industries are developing and exporting more products. Finally, there is little risk for our banks to collapse as borrowing is less common among the public compared to developed countries, said the minister. The minister was speaking at a 'Post-budget discussion', organised by the Women Entrepreuners Association of Bangladesh and the WEAB Foundation. The minister stressed the need for setting up an SME bank for development of small and medium enterprises, many of which are run by women. He also focused on the need to reduce interest rates to single digits along with industry-friendly reforms in the banking sector.
