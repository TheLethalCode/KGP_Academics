 PRETORIA, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champions Brazil strode confidently towards the Confederations Cup semi-finals with a 3-0 win over the United States at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Thursday. Two goals inside the opening 20 minutes meant the Brazilians were able to cruise through the encounter in contrast to their last-gasp win over Egypt in their first Group B match on Monday. Defender Felipe Melo delivered a back post header for the first goal after seven minutes and a quick breakaway was finished by Robinho 13 minutes later. But the best was saved for the 62nd minute when an intricate move ended with Maicon scoring from an acute angle. Brazil will be sure of a semi-final place later on Thursday if Egypt fail to beat Italy in the other Group B match in Johannesburg
