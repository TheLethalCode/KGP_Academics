 TEHRAN, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran began three days of airforce exercises on Monday in the Gulf and the Sea of Oman to raise operational and support capability, Iranian media said. "Long-distance flights of around 3,600 km (2,237 miles) along with aerial refuelling from tanker to fighter jet and from fighter jet to fighter jet will be part of this exercise," state broadcaster IRIB's website reported. "Low altitude flights over the waters of the ... Gulf and the Sea of Oman by Iranian fighter jets over distances of 700 km will also be tested.," it said. The military exercise plans were announced last month. IRIB, which did not mention Iran's disputed presidential election in its report, said the exercises were also aimed at raising the force's ability to use intelligence aircraft "to send signals and analyse threats". Iran often holds war games or tests weapons to show its determination to counter any attack by the United States or Israel on sites where they believe nuclear weapons are made.
