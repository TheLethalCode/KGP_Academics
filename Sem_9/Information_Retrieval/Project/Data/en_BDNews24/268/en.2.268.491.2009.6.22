 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed has announced that a free, neutral and powerful Information Commission will be formed within the next few days. "The Information Commission will be formed soon according to the law passed in the parliament," he said at the closing ceremony of a two-day seminar titled 'Right to Information: Law, Institution and Citizens' at a hotel in the capital Monday. "The commission will be able to ask for any information from any government ministry or institution, where government pressure ( to suppress information) will not work," he added. The minister said a committee, headed by the chief justice, is working to pick the commission chairman and the commissioners. "The government will ensure transparency of the commission and this is why even the opposition has representatives in the committee." The law was passed in the parliament on March 26, making it mandatory for all but eight intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to provide information on demand. The eight agencies beyond the purview of the new law are National Security Intelligence (NSI), Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), the Military Intelligence Directorate, Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Police, Special Security Force (SSF), Central Intelligence Cell of National Board of Revenue (NBR), Special Branch (SB) of Police and Intelligence Cell of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). But these eight agencies or departments must publish information on corruption and violation of human rights. The Centre for Policy Dialogue chairman Professor Rehman Sobhan, chief commissioner of RTI India Shoilash Gandhi and Cabinet Division joint secretary Khandaker Anwarul Islam participated in the discussions. bd
