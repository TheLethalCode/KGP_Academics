 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber rammed a car in a convoy of Afghan troops in southern Kandahar province on Monday, killing three soldiers, a provincial official said. Five other soldiers and two pedestrians were wounded, he said. A spokesman for Taliban guerrillas, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location, claimed responsibility for the strike. Violence has been rising in Afghanistan in recent years despite an increasing number of foreign troops. U.S. forces say the number of insurgent attacks is at its highest since the Taliban were driven out of Kabul in 2001. Washington is in the process of more than doubling its forces in Afghanistan from 32,000 at the end of last year to an expected 68,000 by the end of this year. More than 30,000 troops from other Western countries are also part of a NATO force.
