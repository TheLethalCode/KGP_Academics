 JOHANNESBURG, Jun 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of the Southern African Development Community met on Saturday to try to help restore political order in Madagascar after internationally mediated talks on the island collapsed earlier this week. SADC mediators sent to the island will report to the heads of state and governments after the African Union and United Nations suspended talks indefinitely citing a lack of political will. Southern African leaders suspended Madagascar from the SADC regional grouping in March, saying they would not recognize Andry Rajoelina, who took power in a move condemned as a coup by the international community. SADC chairman, South African President Jacob Zuma, said on Saturday the grouping was hopeful of a resolution to the political turmoil, which has wrought havoc on the Indian Ocean island's $390-million-a-year tourism sector and unnerved foreign companies investing in its booming oil and mineral sectors. "We believe that peace will be achieved if all parties to the conflict are committed to the process," Zuma said. "It is crucial that there be an inclusive political dialogue, where all the relevant parties and stakeholders have an opportunity to be part of finding a resolution." Rajoelina, 35, a former disc jockey, came to power in March when President Marc Ravalomanana stepped aside after intense pressure from the opposition and army chiefs. Ravalomanana, who fled to southern Africa, insists he remains the legitimate leader of the Indian Ocean island and has rejected sharing power with Rajoelina. Ravalomanana was to attend the SADC meeting. Foreign leaders branded the transition a coup and have called for a quick election to restore constitutional order. SADC Executive Secretary Tomaz Salomao said the various parties were close to reaching a breakthrough, but differences on major issues like a possible election remained. "If we move to elections, if Mr. Rajoelina and President Ravalomanana will stand ... those are some of the issues that are of major concern," he said at a news conference on Friday. The African economic bloc COMESA said earlier this month a military intervention to restore constitutional order on the island could be an option. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was also to attend the SADC meeting
