 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Zia International Airport customs on Sunday seized 6,118 mobile phone sets and computer accessories worth Tk 5 crore, a top customs official said. "The mobile sets were flown in from Hong Kong," additional customs commissioner Humayun Kabir told reporters. The flight from Hong Kong had landed at ZIA at 10:45pm on Friday and 22 pieces of luggage remained unclaimed at the departure transit lounge after all the passengers had left. "As nobody claimed the abandoned bags until Saturday morning, the customs officials opened them in the presence of security personnel," Kabir said. The proposed budget for the next fiscal recommended a 25 percent tax on imported mobile phone sets. The shipment came at a time when the budget is yet to be passed. The officials also got 1,018 pieces of mp4 players and 12 computer mother boards in the luggage. bdnews2
