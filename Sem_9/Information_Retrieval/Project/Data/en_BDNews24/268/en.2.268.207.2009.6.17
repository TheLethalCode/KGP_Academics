 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Over 6.50 lakh people in Bangladesh are suffering from blindness that could be prevented through simple cataract surgery, say experts. Experts working in the field, at a seminar on Wednesday, stressed the need for community ophthalmology to eliminate avoidable blindness from the country. They also laid importance on more research on the subject. Bangladesh Community Ophthalmology Society (BCOS) organised the seminar on 'research methodology' at National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO). Former deputy prime minister and eye expert Prof MA Matin said medical knowledge was not enough to treat even common diseases. A knowledge of epidemiology, origins of diseases or how common a disease is, was also needed.

Chaired by professor Ava Hossain, the inaugural session was addressed by Prof Matin, former adviser of the caretaker government and editor of the Independent Mahbubul Alam and Prof Akma Muktadir, chairman of the scientific sub-committee of the seminar. Prof M Abu Sayeed and Prof Md Shafiqul Islam presented two scientific papers in the seminars. Prof Huq and Dr Sharfuddin Ahmed, secretary general of the Ophthalmological Society of Bangladesh, also attended among others.
