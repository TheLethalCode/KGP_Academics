<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)A new regional forum comprising five countries including Bangladesh will be formed 'soon' to combat ongoing global financial crunch, the food minister has said. Abdur Razzaq made the announcement on Monday while briefing reporters at his office about the declarations of two international conferences on building social security around finance, food and energy he had recently attended. Two separate delegations led by the food minister took part in the two conferences held during June 16-19 in Cairo and Geneva. On the conference decisions, Razzaq said the SAARC countries will take joint actions to face the global economic downturn. The joint programme will include ensuring children's nutritional security, food security and women empowerment as key concerns. The five-country forum will raise an information exchange programme primarily among its members, he said. The World Bank has already committed to invest sizeable funds in implementing Bangladesh's expanded social security programmes. The government this year is taking up a new project to generate employment for the poor, which is funded by the WB and modelled on the 100-day employment creation programme, he said. Besides, the bank has agreed to provide long-term incentives-based assistance in the food and energy sectors. The Bangladesh delegations sought international assistance in large-scale countrywide river dredging and construction of cyclone shelters and repairing the dams and embankments in aid of the recent cyclone -affected coastal populations, the minister said. b
