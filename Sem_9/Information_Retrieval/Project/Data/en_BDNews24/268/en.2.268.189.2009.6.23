<TITLE> BNP wants 'meddling' Indian envoy removed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary party of the main opposition BNP has demanded that Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty be withdrawn for what it said was his meddling in the internal affairs of Bangladesh. Opposition chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque made the demand on Tuesday on the grounds that Chakravarty had meddled in Bangladesh's internal affairs and made statements in breach of diplomatic etiquette. "We want his immediate withdrawal as the envoy has been making comments for long violating diplomatic etiquette," Farrouque told reporters at a briefing at the media centre at parliament building. Chakravarty on June 21 at a seminar on South Asian connectivity had called the Bangladeshi water experts who opposed the controversial Tipaimukh dam 'so called experts' in the presence of foreign minister Dipu Moni. The whip alleged that the Indian envoy overstepped the line in his manners and comments after the Awami League government had assumed power. Farrouque said Chakravarty made such comments in presence of the foreign minister and accused her of 'unpardonable crime' for 'failing' to safeguard sovereignty. It has been proved that the minister cannot uphold the country's dignity, he said. Replying to a question, Farrouque said they would return to parliament if they were provided 'respectable' numbers of front bench seats, opposition chief Khaleda Zia got adequate security and party adherents were allowed to enter her cantonment house. MPs Barkatullah Bulu, Mahbubuddin Khokan, Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anny and Nazimuddin Ahmed were, among others, present at the briefing. b
