 BANGALORE, Thu Jun 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian mobile users will jump more than 90 percent to 771 million by 2013 as companies expand networks to rural areas in the world's fastest growing wireless market, research firm Gartner said. India had 403.66 million wireless users at the end of April, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India figures showed earlier this month, second only to China that has more than 600 million wireless subscribers.

The research firm said voice tariffs would fall substantially in 2009 as new operators join the market. The telecoms unit of Indian developer Unitech Ltd will launch mobile services with Norway's Telenor in the December quarter this year, a top company official said on Tuesday.
