<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  The national booters left the capital on Saturday morning for Cox's Bazar for a three-week conditional training in a bid to increase their fitness as well as stamina ahead of this year's SAFF Championship and next year's SA Games. The players will enjoy a day's rest on Sunday before starting the camp on Monday, national team manager Hasanuzzaman Khan Bablu told bdnews24.com on way to the world's longest beach. Bablu said that the training of each week has been designed with the players toiling hard on sand for two sessions in five days and the rest two days will be a recovery period involving swimming and light gym. Midfielder Arman Aziz joined the team from Chittagong while other 29 members of the provisional squad started their journey from BFF House in Dhaka. Uncapped players Rana, Rezaul and Rashed who have also been playing in the ongoing Bashundhara Champions Club Cup are also in the team. The trio are members of Feni Soccer Club who play Shuktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj in the Champions Club Cup final on June 23 at Cox's Bazar Stadium. "I have had a discussion with Dido, who told me that he would do light practice with the trio so that they could perform in the final. They will also come under the same training later on," said the former national footballer. Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido last month picked nine rookies in his the 30-member provisional squad and dropped five players like Motiur Munna, Mohammad Robin, Enamul Haq Sharif. After returning from Cox's Bazar, the players will start the residential training at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan for nine weeks. bd
