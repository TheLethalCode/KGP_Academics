 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange crossed the Tk 8 billion mark on the opening day of the week to touch a new high. The country's prime bourse witnessed shares worth Tk 8.34 billion changing hand on Sunday, surpassing the previous high of Tk 7.81 billion on June 7. This is the third time this month that the daily transactions have leapt to a new height. On June 4 and 11, turnover on the bourse touched Tk 6.72 billion. Chittagong Stock Exchange also saw a higher turnover at Tk 963.634 million. The total turnover of the country's twin bourses reached Tk 9.30 billion, which is also a new record. The previous high was at Tk 8.64 billion on June 7. Experts said that the higher turnover was the outcome of the government's decision to let "black money" pour into the market. Finance minister AMA Muhith, in his maiden budget on June 11 kept provisions for "acceptance of undisclosed money without any questioning" in to shares of listed companies. "Turnover shot up as more and more funds, mainly black money are coming the market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Khan, who now teaches finance at the University of Dhaka, however, warned of market overheating in the wake of increased liquidity. Market operators said that the increased confidence of investors was the reason behind the buoyant market. "The decision to allow invest black money has created a wave of confidence which caused the turnover to surge," DSE president Rakibur Rahman told bdnews24.com.
