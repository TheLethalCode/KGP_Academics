<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champion Rafael Nadal pulled out of Wimbledon on Friday after losing his battle to recover from a knee injury. Here is what other players had to say about his withdrawal: Venus Williams, five-times champion who most recently won the title in 2008: "All the fans will miss him. He will be back and hopefully he'll have a chance to win another one." Pat Cash, champion in 1987: "He's an incredible athlete. He can perform miracles we didn't think were possible for a human to do  in Australia he played a five-set match in five hours then backed it up with another five-setter, that was incredible. I've never seen anything like that in my life." Cedric Pioline, Wimbledon runner-up in 1997: "I think it's a big loss. But I think the tournament is stronger than the players so it will be a nice tournament anyway, even if he's not there." Mikael Pernfors, French Open runner-up in 1986: "Of course he's important, he's part of one of the bigger rivalries in tennis. He's got to get healthy. He can't have a career based on a different game that what he's good at." Henri Leconte, French Open runner-up in 1988: "It's sad if he's not there, he's the winner. (But his knees) will get better again. He has played so much in the past few years (and) he had an extraordinary year last year.
