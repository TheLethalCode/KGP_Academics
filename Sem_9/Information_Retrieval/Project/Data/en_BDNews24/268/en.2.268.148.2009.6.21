 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary body is set to investigate all departments under the LGRD ministry for alleged corrupt practices "over the past seven years", which covers the last BNP-led government and the subsequent two-year caretaker term. The standing committee on the LGRD (local government, rural development and cooperatives) ministry formed a four-member probe body at a meeting on Sunday, the committee chairman Rahmat Ali told bdnews24.com after the meeting. The probe will be headed by Awami League MP Monowar, with members Hossain Chowdhury, Md Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru, AKM Mostafizur Rahman and the BNP's Abul Khayer Bhuyian. "It will investigate the activities of WASA, Milk Vita, the cooperatives department, Bangladesh rural development board, local government engineering department, public health engineering department and other agencies over the last seven years," said Ali. It will also probe all city corporations, he said. CC bill Ali said Sunday's meeting had discussed the delayed city corporation bill. "We expect to finalise the recommendations at our next meeting on July 1." The bill was likely to be passed in the current session of parliament, said Ali. The Election Commission has been unable to prepare for the long overdue polls to city corporations as the bill is yet to pass in parliament.
