 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) Awami League MP Imaz Uddin Pramanik has told the parliament that he will only accept government plot in Dhaka when all people of his constituency would get plot in the capital. "I have been elected MP five times. But I come by rickshaw to attend parliament session. "I don't have any flat on plot of my own in Dhaka. "I do not want any plot in Dhaka. I will only accept plot when the poor people in my constituency Manda will get plots," Pramanik said in his speech on the proposed national budget for 2009-10 fiscal year. The MPs appreciated his speech by thumbing desks. State minister for public works Abdul Mannan said all MPs would get plot in Dhaka if they apply for the same. Pramanik is the MP of Naogaon's impoverished Manda constituency. He was also elected MP in the 1970 elections. He bitterly criticised corruption in the country. "Bangabandhu (independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) gave me money. But I did not take it. "Bangabandhu put his hand on my head, blessed me and said,' you love your people so much!. Almighty Allah will love you'," said an emotion-charged Pramanik, also a freedom fighter. He also urged the finance minister to introduce pension for the freedom fighters. Another MP Rafiqul Islam, a retired major, urged the finance minister to revoke the facility to whiten black money. Hafiz Uddin Ahmmad, A K M Bahar Uddin, Rowshan Jahan Shati, Sukumar Ranjan Ghosh, Shafiqur Rahman Chowdhury, Reza Ali, Mostaq Ahmed Ruhi, Golam Khondker Prince, Golam Sabur, Mostofa Faruk Mohammad, S K Abu Baker and Abul Hasan Mahmud Ali also spoke on the proposed budget. bd
