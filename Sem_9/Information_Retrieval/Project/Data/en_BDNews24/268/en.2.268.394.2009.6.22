 Dhaka, Jun 22 (bdnews24.com)Rail chief Belayet Hossain said authorities were primarily assuming signal failure caused two trains to collide head-on at Kamalapur Station on Monday. The Mahanagar Probhati Intercity, coming from Chittagong, ran into the Mymensingh-bound Isha Kha Express at around 2.30pm, as the latter was waiting to pull out of the capital's busy central terminus, Hossain told bdnews24.com. Rail officials also told bdnews24.com the Isha Kha was due to leave the station at 11.10am, but did not leave until 2.30pm, while the Mahanagar was expected to arrive at 1.55 pm but came in at 2.30pm. The two engines collided near Signal 3/144, at relatively low speed. bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider, reporting from the spot, said the Mahanagar's power car compartment had risen off the tracks as it rammed into the engine car in front. The engine of Isha Kha was also rammed into by the compartment behind. Railway authorities have formed a four-member committee to investigate exact cause of the accident. Several people were injured but no deaths were immediately reported. bdn
