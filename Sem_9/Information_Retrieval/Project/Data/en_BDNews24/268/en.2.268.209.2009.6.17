 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) - The main opposition BNP does not want any change to caretaker government system, a senior party leader said on Wednesday. "The caretaker government system is needed as long as political culture does not change in our country," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said. "It is out of the question of canceling the caretaker government system as the Election Commission is not neutral in our country," said Khandaker, whose party suffered a massive defeat in the December 2008 elections. The former BNP chief whip was speaking to reporters at the party's central office following calls by ruling party MPs in recent days for cancelling the caretaker government system. "All caretaker governments will not be like this last one," Delwar said of the unprecedented two-year rule of the immediate past interim administration. "The charge of a caretaker government is to hold an election within three months. But, the army-backed caretaker government abused its power by violating the constitution." "They declared a state of emergency as part of a 'blue-print'," said the BNP leader. Pressing for trial of the '1/11 masterminds', including the just-retired army chief Moeen U Ahmed, he said, "Either the government try them or they will someday be tried in the very soil of the country." Delwar also had harsh words for the present Awami League-led government. He claimed the government was forcing confessions from suspects in the Chittagong ten-truck arms case as part of a plot to involve BNP figures, including the party chief's son and party leader Tareque Rahman. "The people want the government to realise its pledges, and to shift away from anarchic, vengeful and misruling ways." He demanded the government take steps against India's construction of the controversial Tipaimukh Dam, and tackle national crises of power and prices. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, former MP Selim Reza Habib, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and others were present at the press conference. b
