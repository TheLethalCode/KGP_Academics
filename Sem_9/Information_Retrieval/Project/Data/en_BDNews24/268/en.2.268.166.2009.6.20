<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's jet made a "quick, steep, but safe" emergency landing in Los Angeles on Friday after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit's instrument panel, his office said. Although there was no visible fire, the pilot diverted the jet to the Van Nuys airport 10 minutes before he was due to land at Santa Monica, near the former actor's home, spokesman Aaron McLear said in a statement. Fire crews met the jet on the runway. "Upon landing the Governor exited the jet and traveled to his house," McLear said. "The NetJets crew did an outstanding job and everyone aboard landed safely and unharmed."
