 Dhaka, Jun 22 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia on Monday wrote a letter to the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh informing him of Bangladeshi people's concern over the proposed Tipaimukh dam on cross-border river Borak.

"[Khaleda] has informed the Indian prime minister about the possible environmental degradation if the dam is built and the Bangladeshi people's concern over the issue," Rizvi said. Decision on writing to the Indian prime minister was taken recently in a meeting of the party's highest policymaking forum.
