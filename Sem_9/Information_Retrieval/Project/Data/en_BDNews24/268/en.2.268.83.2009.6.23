<TITLE> India labels Maoist party as terrorist group </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Indian government on Monday banned and formally labelled Maoist insurgents a terrorist group, hoping it would give security forces more enforcement powers after the rebels briefly created a "liberated zone" in West Bengal. The banning of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) comes only a month after the Congress-led government won a resounding re-election without the need of support from communist parties that have opposed any ban. "The home ministry has specifically banned the CPI Maoist as a militant group and has added it to the list of banned groups," said Onkar Kedia, a home ministry spokesman. The move will allow authorities to arrest members of the Maoist party even if they have not been involved in rebel violence. Beleaguered state police will still be the main agency battling the rebels. There is little sign of India calling in the army to fight the insurgents, who have been spreading across eastern, central and southern India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoists as the biggest internal security challenge since independence. Hundreds of Maoists, who are expanding their influence in India had declared the town of Lalgarh about 170 km (100 miles) from Kolkata, as a "liberated zone" last week before they fled in face of heavy police deployment. India's JSW Steel Ltd, the country's third largest steel producer, is setting up a $7-billion, 10-million tonne steel plant near Lalgarh, and the growing presence of Maoists across swathes of rural India has worried many investors. Some experts said the ban would have little impact in the battle against an estimated 22,000 Maoist combatants. "There will be a marginal advantage, if at all," said Ajai Sahni of the Institute of Conflict Management, a New Delhi-based think-tank. "More people can be arrested and they (government) can take action against frontal organisations, but it is the same police force which will be taking them on," Sahni said. The rebels called a two-day strike in east and central India to protest against police action in West Bengal. Transport to rural areas was hit in states like Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal, but life was normal in big towns and cities.
