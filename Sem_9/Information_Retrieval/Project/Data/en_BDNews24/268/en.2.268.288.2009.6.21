 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  A special judge's court ordered senior Awami League leader Abul Hasanat Abdullah, convicted of twin charges of tax dodge and hiding assets information, into jail on surrender on Sunday. Dhaka metropolitan special judge Amar Kumar Roy made the order after the former chief whip turned himself in at midday. He also ordered the jail authorities to arrange special medical treatment for Abdullah in jail. A Special Judge's Court in 2007 had sentenced him to nine years in a tax dodge case and 13 years in another case in 2008 for suppression of wealth-related information. bdne
