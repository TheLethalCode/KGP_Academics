 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Stock Exchange on Wednesday asked the law minister to form a special court on capital market to deal with irregularities. "We have asked for the special court to get rid of irregularities," DSE chairman Raquibur Rahman told reporters after a meeting with law minister Shafiq Ahmed at the Secretariat. The irregularities Raquib pointed out are harassment of investors due to internal feud of boards of directors of companies, indecision in providing dividend on the mutual funds and deliberately bracketing the good companies in poorly-performing 'z' category shares. The special court can play a crucial role in strengthening the capital market by amending and changing related laws, said the DSE chief, who led a 12-member delegation. "The law minister has assured us of providing assistance in this regard. "The minister suggested that the parties may benefit if they resolve the disputes through discussions instead of moving to court," he said. bdne
