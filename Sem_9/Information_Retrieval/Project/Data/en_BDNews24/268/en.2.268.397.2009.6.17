 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet committee on economic affairs on Wednesday gave the communications ministry the go-ahead to start the construction of an 'elevated expressway' to rid capital Dhaka of traffic gridlock. "We have asked the communications ministry to construct elevated expressway after completing the formalities of examining feasibility and inviting tender," finance minister AMA Muhith, who heads the committee, told reporters after a meeting. The $1.23 billion expressway project, the first scheme under the private-public partnership initiative, on Gazipur-Tongi-Narayanganj route will be implemented in three phases, he said. The proposed route will be from Zia International Airport through Jatrabari. The ministry will have to construct a subway from Gazipur to Kamalapur and examine the feasibility of constructing elevated expressway, Muhith added. The meeting also assigned the bridge department of the communications ministry to hand over the army the responsibilities of realising toll and maintenance of Bangabandhu Bridge. The deal with Marganet International, appointed for maintenance and realising toll of the bridge, expired in May, the minister said. "We did not get any interested company even after floating tender," he said. The meeting returned two proposals for setting up two jetties in Mongla port for further scrutiny. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, law minister Shafiq Ahmed, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, planning minister AK Khandaker and cabinet secretary MA Aziz, among others, were present in the meeting. bdne
