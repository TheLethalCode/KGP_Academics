 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) - GE Healthcare is set to launch a new health programme in Bangladesh, along with three low cost and innovative 'targeted technologies', in a bid to deliver better health care to the poor. Under the programme, called 'Healthymagination', three comparatively cost-effective clinics will be set up in cooperation with Grameen Healthcare, said V Raj, president and CEO of GE Healthcare in South Asia on Saturday. Omar Ishrak, president & CEO of GE Clinical Systems, says, "GE Healthcare wants to play a pioneering role in preventing deaths from complications in childbirth and pregnancy by working with Grameen in Bangladesh." The three low-cost technological innovations are a portable electrocardiogram, ultrasound system and a baby warmer, Raj told a press conference at a hotel in the city on Saturday. The MAC 400 is a cheap but sophisticated battery-powered electrocardiogram, easily portable for carrying to even the remotest villages, he said. The Lullaby Baby Warmer is a bed with an overhead heater that helps reduce infant deaths from asphyxia. LOGIQ P3 is a simple to use yet powerful ultrasound imaging system that can help clinicians delivered advanced imaging in multiple care areas. GE Healthcare is the UK-based healthcare business of US company General Electric Company. bd
