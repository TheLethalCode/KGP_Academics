<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Sun Jun 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian authorities on Sunday blamed "terrorists" and rioters for clashes in which at least 10 people were killed and state media suggested only the West stood to gain from a week of unrest sparked by a disputed election. Iran state television said 10 people were killed and more than 100 others injured in protests held in Tehran on Saturday in defiance of a stern warning by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A separate report put the number of deaths at 13. State television said the violence included the torching of a mosque, which it blamed on "rioters". "In the unrest leading to clashes 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded," it said. "The presence of terrorists ... in yesterday's event in Enghelab and Azadi avenues was tangible." The disputed June 12 election handed an overwhelming victory to hardline anti-Western President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparking the biggest protests and most violent unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution which ousted the U.S.-backed shah. Opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi, who came second to Ahmadinejad in the poll and whose followers have spearheaded protests, says the election was fraudulent and must be annulled. There were no immediate reports of street protests on Sunday. Government restrictions prevent correspondents working for foreign media from attending demonstrations to report. State TV earlier announced the arrests of members of the Mujahideen Khalq Organisation (MKO), an exiled opposition group which it accused of "terrorist activities" including setting buses on fire and destroying public property. CRITICISM OF WEST Iran's foreign minister sharply criticised Britain and other Western countries for their statements on the election. In an address to foreign diplomats in Tehran, Manouchehr Mottaki denounced what he described as "interfering remarks" by British officials regarding the vote. He said Britain for a long time had "targeted elections" in Iran and suggested that people linked to British intelligence had travelled to the country prior to this month's election. On Saturday, state television aired interviews with critics of the protests, urging Iranians to unite behind the government and suggesting only the West gained from Iran's troubles. Helicopters criss-crossed Tehran on Saturday and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied Khamenei's warning against further demonstrations. Riot police were deployed in force, firing teargas and using batons and water cannon to disperse groups of several hundred Iranians who had gathered across the city. Mousavi on Saturday said the Islamic Republic must be purged of "lies and deviations" and told supporters he was "ready for martyrdom", according to an ally. But he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities. "We are not against the Islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it," he said in a statement on his website. He said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the "consequences" -- an apparent rejoinder to Khamenei's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests. "The people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ... The Islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be," Mousavi said. POLICE WARNING Iran's police chief Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam has issued a warning to Mousavi's supporters that his men will "decisively confront" any further unrest. U.S. President Barack Obama, in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to halt an Iranian nuclear programme the West fears could yield atomic weapons, urged Tehran to "stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people". "The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching. We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost," Obama said in a statement. The authorities reject charges of election fraud. But the highest legislative body said it was ready to recount a random 10 percent of the votes cast in the election to meet the complaints of Mousavi and two other candid
