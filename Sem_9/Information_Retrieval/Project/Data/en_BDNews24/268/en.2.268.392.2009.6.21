<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Business leaders of 11 trade bodies expressed continuing concerns on Sunday over the budget provision for legalising 'black money', despite the offer's aim to boost investment in crucial sectors. "The businesses are very much concerned about ... legalising black money on a nominal 10 percent concessional tax over the next three years," said a joint press statement signed by presidents of the country's foremost trade bodies, with the notable exception of FBCCI. The business leaders asked that the proposal be considered for withdrawal. They said that the opportunity should only be offered to those who have earned money legally and should only be allowed on payment of regular tax in full, plus a penalty for default. Otherwise, the move would not only discourage and demoralise genuine taxpayers but also act as a "disincentive for honest citizens", said the statement. Debate has been spurred among the trade bodies, and in public, over the offer of 'whitening black money'. While FBCCI, the country's apex trade federation, has welcomed the provision to legalise undisclosed income for three years in a row, other top business bodies including the MCCI, BGMEA, BKMEA and FICCI have all separately criticised it. FBCCI president Annisul Huq thanked the government for the move on June 13, two days after the budget was unveiled, saying it would result in "elimination" of black money, boost investment and job creation. The 11 trade bodies, in their statement Sunday, welcomed instead the finance minister's proposal for a budget allocation of Tk 25 billion for Public Private Partnership initiatives. They stressed the need for an appropriate framework and development of an effective and transparent institution for dealing with the projects to be financed under PPP. The statement was signed by presidents of the international (ICCB), metropolitan chamber (MCCI), Dhaka chamber (DCCI), foreign chamber (FICCI), garment manufacturers association (BGMEA), knitwear manufacturers association (BKMEA), textile owners association (BTMA), Bangladesh Insurance Association (BIA), Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), Association of Bankers Bangladesh Ltd (ABBL) and Bangladesh Employer's Federation (BEF).
