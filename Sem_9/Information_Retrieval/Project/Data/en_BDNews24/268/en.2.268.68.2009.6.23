 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)The government is going to formulate law to ensure the security of the family of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the home minister said on Tuesday. "We will formulate Bangabandhu Family Security Act-2009 soon," Sahara Khatun told reporters at the Secretariat. The act will be placed at the cabinet meeting, she said. Sahara said many attempts had been made on the lives of Awami League chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina and sister Sheikh Rehana, daughters of Bangabandhu, as Sheikh Mujib is fondly referred to. The government has taken the move as 'people think there should be a law to ensure their security', the minister said. The minister added that the previous 1996-2001 Awami League-led government had taken the initiative but the coalition government headed by the BNP scuttled it. Earlier, she had meetings with BDR chief major general Moinul Islam and intelligence agencies and ministry officials. The government decided to shore up measures to stop intrusion on Bangladesh-Myanmar border, Sahara said. bdnew
