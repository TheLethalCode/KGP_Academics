<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP is staying off parliament not because of the row over seating arrangement but because of serious internal strife, the chief whip of ruling Awami League has said. "On suggestion by the BNP's chief whip, we have offered Moudud Ahmed a front-row seat. But they are still saying this and that," Abdus Shaheed said on Friday at the end of celebrations marking the seventh founding anniversary of Bangabandhu Shishu Academy. "Besides, we read in newspapers that BNP is avoiding the parliament because they have not yet been able to resolve their internal differences." Awami League has not kept even one of the ten seats on the speaker's left, said Shaheed. "As the opposition demanded, they now have six front-row seats. No AL member sits there." "Our ministers are now sitting in the fourth and fifth rows." He urged the opposition to join the ongoing budget session of the parliament. "We also boycotted parliament sessions in the past. But we returned to the parliament as well in the interest of the people." The opposition has been staying away over the seat row since the first session. b
