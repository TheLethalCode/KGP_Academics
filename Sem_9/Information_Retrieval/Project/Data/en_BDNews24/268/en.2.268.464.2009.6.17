<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary team to visit the Tipaimukh dam site in India will have no representative of the main opposition BNP, who have voiced loud objections to the controversial hydropower project that will span one of Bangladesh's joint rivers with its neighbour. But other groups may follow the parliemantary one, the water resource minister said on Wednesday. The standing committee on water resources will go to view the dam site some time this month, Ramesh Chandra Sen told bdnews24.com. "But the date is yet to be finalised." Former water resources minister Abdur Razzaque, chairman of the standing committee, will lead the ten-member team to the Indian state of Manipur, at Delhi's invitation. Sen himself will not be part of the team. "There will be no member of the main opposition BNP," he told bdnews24.com at his office Wednesday. "BNP has no representative on the parliamentary standing committee on water resources. The opposition alliance's representative is Jamaat-e-Islami's AHM Hamidur Rahman Azad." "Only members of the parliamentary standing body will be on the team." "That is why no BNP lawmaker is a member." Sen also said would be no media representative in the Tipaimukh delegation. But the minister said there would be two experts on the team, who were not members of parliament. He did not name the experts in the delegation. He named six MPs in the team: Awami League's Abdur Razzaque, Abdur Rahman, AKM Fazlul Huq and Abdullah Al-Jacob, ABM Ruhul Amin Howlader of Jatiya Party and Hamidur Rahman Azad of Jamaat. "During its tour, the Bangladesh delegation will hold a meeting with representatives of the Indian government and submit a report on its return to Dhaka." Sen said he would give a statement in parliament on the basis of the panel's report. "If need be, more observation teams that will include representatives from different groups including the media will be sent over." He said the length of the trip had not yet been fixed. "The probable tour, entering India through Amalsid in Sylhet, may last four to six days," he said. The minister said the team was formed at the invitation India "to come and visit the site". The foreign ministry will finalise details of the visit from this end, and the Indian government will decide the itinerary at the other end, said Sen. b
