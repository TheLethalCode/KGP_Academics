<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India have named a depleted squad without Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan for the one-day tour of West Indies starting later this month, just days after the holders were knocked out of the Twenty20 World Cup. Batsman Tendulkar has opted out of the four-match series while pace bowler Zaheer, who has been struggling with a shoulder injury, has been rested, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a news release on Wednesday. Opener Virender Sehwag will miss the series due to the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the Twenty20 World Cup while left-hander Suresh Raina has been advised to rest for two weeks to recover from a hairline fracture in his thumb. The four matches against West Indies will be played from June 26 to July 5 in Jamaica and St. Lucia. Coach Gary Kirsten has blamed fatigue for India's exit from the Twenty20 World Cup in England at the Super Eight stage, saying the lack of rest after the Indian Premier League season had left the players tired and carrying injuries. Zaheer's absence sees the return of fellow left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra who played the last of his 72 ODIs in September 2005. The selectors also included uncapped all-rounder Abhishek Nayar who has put in some solid domestic performances. Squad Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Yusuf Pathan, Murali Vijay, Subramaniam Badrinath, Rudra Pratap Singh, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Abhishek Nayar, Ashish Nehra, Ravindra Jadeja, Dinesh Kart
