 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh players met with a senior member of the national board (BCB) on Saturday to clear the air after unflattering comments were made about their performance at the Twenty20 World Cup. Bangladesh lost to India and Ireland and were eliminated in the first round of the tournament in England. The players threatened to boycott a tour of West Indies starting later this month after some senior officials castigated their performance. "We have discussed everything amicably and removed whatever the misunderstanding we had with the Board. Now we will be focusing on upcoming West Indies tour," opener Zunaed Siddique told reporters after the meeting. Bangladesh will leave on June 29 for West Indies to play two tests and three one-day internationals. "Those present at the meeting acknowledged that the situation had risen from simple misunderstanding and communication dysfunction," said BCB spokesman Rabeed Imam. "The discussion was open and everyone emphasised on focusing the upcoming tour of West Indies. The outcome has been very positive."
