 LONDON, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Vaughan and Steve Harmison saw their hopes of playing in this year's Test series against Australia fade when they were left out of a 16-man pre-Ashes squad named by England on Monday. Vaughan was captain in 2005 and fast bowler Harmison also played a key role as England won the Ashes on home soil. As expected, recovering all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was included in the squad, along with bowler Ryan Sidebottom. Flintoff, making his way back after a knee operation, will return for England in a warm-up match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham from July 1 to 3. National selector Geoff Miller said Vaughan would need to score more heavily for Yorkshire to stand a chance of being recalled. "I met with Michael recently and he understands that he needs to make runs consistently in County cricket if he is to force his way back into the squad," Miller said in a England Cricket Board statement. The Ashes series starts on July 8 in Cardiff. England pre-Ashes camp squad: Andrew Strauss (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Adil Rashid, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann
