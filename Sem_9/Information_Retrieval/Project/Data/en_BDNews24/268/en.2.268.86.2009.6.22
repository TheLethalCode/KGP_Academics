 KARACHI, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan selectors recalled senior batsman Mohammad Yousuf on Monday for the test tour of Sri Lanka but ignored fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Yousuf, 33, was named in a 15-member squad after the prolific batsman, who shocked Pakistan cricket circles by joining the Indian Cricket League (ICL) last year, quit the unofficial competition to take advantage of a player amnesty scheme. The selectors also recalled all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, who was rushed to the World Twenty20 after snapping ties with the ICL and played a key role in Sunday's final win over Sri Lanka at Lord's. Shoaib Akhtar was ignored although he has resumed training after recovering from a skin infection that ruled him out of the World Twenty20 squad. Yousuf, who has played 79 tests, was delighted to be back. "I have a few years of cricket left in me and I wanted to accomplish more feats for my country. I have been training hard for this tour," he told Reuters. An interim committee headed by former test captain Wasim Bari picked the squad after chief selector Abdul Qadir quit this month accusing the board chairman of interfering in the panel's work. The Pakistan squad leave on Saturday to play three tests followed by five one-dayers and a Twenty20 international. The squad: Younis Khan (captain), Salman Butt, Khurrum Manzoor, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal (wicketkeeper), Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad Aamir, Danish Kaneria, Abdul Razzaq, Abdul Rauf, Faisal Iqbal, Fawad Alam
