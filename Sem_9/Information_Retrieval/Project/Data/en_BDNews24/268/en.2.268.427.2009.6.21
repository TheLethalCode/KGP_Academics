 SEOUL, Jun 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A North Korean ship that the United States is shadowing is likely headed for Myanmar, South Korean television reported on Sunday. YTN channel quoted a South Korean intelligence source as saying the final destination of the Kang Nam looks to be Myanmar after leaving a North Korean port on Wednesday. US officials have declined to say what the ship might be carrying but said it was "a subject of interest". North Korea has five similar ships used for weapons trade. Fox News quoted a senior US military source as saying the ship appeared to be heading toward Singapore and that the navy destroyer USS John McCain was positioning itself in case it gets orders to intercept, according to a story on its website. Singapore, a US ally, said it would act "appropriately" if the vessel heads to its port with a cargo of weapons. Singapore has the world's busiest shipping port and is also the world's top ship refuelling hub. The Kang Nam is the first North Korean ship to be monitored under the new sanctions, adopted this month in response to Pyongyang's May 25 nuclear test. The resolution authorised UN member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo
