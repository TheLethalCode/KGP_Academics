 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) A day after collision between a train and a minibus at a city-centre rail crossing, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told parliament on Thursday that seven overpasses would be built in Dhaka, six of them at busy rail crossings of the capital. In answer to a question from Nazma Akhtar MP, Hossain said the overpasses would be constructed at Pragati Sarani, Banani Staff Quarter gate, Moghbazar, FDC gate, Malibagh, Sayedabad and Jurain. Four cars were flattened as the Jamuna Express ploughed into a minibus at Moghbazar level crossing, one of the capital's busiest intersections, during rush hour on Wednesday. bdnews24
