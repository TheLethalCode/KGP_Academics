<TITLE> Indonesia coal mine blast kills 17, traps 23 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A coal mine explosion on Indonesia's Sumatra island killed 17 miners and has trapped 23 others underground, officials said Wednesday. The explosion Tuesday may have been caused by a build-up of methane gas in the mine in the Parambahan area of West Sumatra province, a local government official said. The miners have been trapped underground for more than 30 hours. "The chance of survival is slim because most of the victims we have found up till the early morning were dead," said local police chief Jasman, who like many Indonesians uses one name. Rustam Pakaya, the head of the health ministry's disaster center, said in a telephone text message that nine people survived the accident, of whom eight were being treated at a local hospital. Indonesia has rich mineral resources with many coal and other mines, but tends to use open-pit mining rather than underground mining.
