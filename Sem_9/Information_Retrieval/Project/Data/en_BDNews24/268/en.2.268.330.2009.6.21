 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of a murdered BNP leader Manjur Morshed Shipu filed a case with Mohammadpur Police Station on Saturday. The 41 year old Shipu, a ward-level party man, was taken by unknown gunmen from his Mohammadpur home in the capital and shot dead after being tortured in the early hours of Friday, said police. Mohammadpur Police sub inspector Aminul Islam said Shipu's wife Hasina Morshed Kakoli filed the murder case against some "five to six unknown attackers". Police have not yet found any clue to the murder, but investigation is ongoing, they said. "Shipu was on a list of local gangsters made by us," Mohammadpur police sub inspector Afzal Hossain told bdnews24.com on Friday. Another local BNP leader in the Mohammadpur area, Anwar Hossain, told bdnews24.com that Shipu was the general secretary of Ward 44's BNP unit, who aspired to be elected ward commissioner. Anwar Hossain, however, could not say who might have killed Shipu. Police said Shipu's body was found with a bullet in the head and assault marks on his body at 4am on the eastern edge of the local Eidgah ground. They put the time of death at around 3am. On his return home at around 11pm Thursday night, while Shipu was parking his car, around six gunmen got out of a nearby microbus, dragged him forcibly into their vehicle and drove away, Shipu's elder brother, Alamgir Morshed, told bdnews24.com. The security guards at both Shipu's house and his neighbour's saw the abductors were carrying arms. AKM Shafiuzzaman Khair, forensic specialist at Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue, declined to perform an autopsy on Shipu's corpse without an inquest conducted by a magistrate.
