<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)Weak monsoon winds, with energy sapping humidity and heat, are responsible for the extreme sultry weather sweeping the country, says the weather office. "This season the monsoon began blowing a little earlier but it did not produce the expected rainfall," meteorologist Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "The heat is being felt more because of the high humidity," said Mannan. Continuing power outages are also worsening the situation for people. A "mild heat wave" has been sweeping across Khulna division, Rajshahi, Dhaka, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Comilla, Sitakunda and Rangamati for the past two days, said the Met office. The highest temperature in Dhaka was 36.5 Celsius on Thursday. The highest temperature in the country registered in Rajshahi was 38.8 degrees Celsius. The air humidity was 54 percent in the morning and went up to 56 percent in the evening. "The air is very humid. The monsoons blowing over the country are rather feeble. So the end effect is sultry heat," said assistant meteorologist Bazlur Rahman. "The monsoon actually started blowing early with cyclone Aila but failed to gather sufficient strength as the storm fizzled out," said Rahman. "They are taking time now to be fully activated," he said. The forecast predicted light to medium rainfall at some places in Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Dhaka, Khulna and Barisal divisions, the day temperature remaining unchanged across the country. bdnews24.
