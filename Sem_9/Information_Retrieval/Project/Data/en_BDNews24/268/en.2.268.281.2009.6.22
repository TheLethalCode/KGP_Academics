 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)The Rapid Action Battalion arrested four suspected members of the banned militant outfit Jama'tul Mujahideen Bangladesh, including a BUET graduate, a RAB officer said on Monday. "This incident has highlighted the militant presence in prominent higher education institutions of the country," Lt Col Mizanur Rahman told reporters at a press briefing. "It also marks the first JMB suspect caught with such a highly educated background," he said. BUET graduate Emranul Haq Rajib, 30, brought in front of reporters, told them, "I used to download information on explosives and bomb making from the Internet, translate it, and pass it on to Bashar, the son of JMB leader Saidur Rahman." RAB, claiming him to be JMB's "IT chief", said Rajib himself had been testing the mechanism of a special type of bomb, and was linked with the outlawed organisation through Saidur's son. "Rajib was caught with explosives, an electric detonator, a laptop computer, passports and jihad literature at his Dhaka residence," said Lt Col Mizanur. He said the other suspects, arrested in two separate drives Sunday night, were an 18-year old girl Shirin Shapla, Abu Bakar Siddique, 20, and Saiful Islam, 28. Siddique was caught in Dhaka with Rajib; Shirin and Saiful were arrested in Muktagacha, Mymensingh, said Mizanur. He added that RAB teams had acted on tip-offs to close in on the suspects. "As RAB closed in, Rajib tried to escape by climbing down a drainpipe from the seventh floor of a building in Pallabi." "Siddique was later arrested from the same Pallabi address," said Mizanur. Rajib said he got his BSc in civil engineering from BUET in 2003, and worked for the Water Resources Department as a research associate for several years. bdnews24
