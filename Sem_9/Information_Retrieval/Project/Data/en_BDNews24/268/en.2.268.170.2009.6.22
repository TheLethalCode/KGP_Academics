 MARSEILLE, France, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Marseille have named Jean-Claude Dassier, former head of news at French TV channel TF1, as their new chairman. The Ligue 1 club announced the appointment on their website (www.om.net) on Monday without giving further details. The 67-year-old Dassier is taking over over from Pape Diouf, who left the job last week over differences of opinion with the club's main shareholder Robert Louis-Dreyfus. Marseille, who finished second in Ligue 1 last season, have not won any major silverware since their Champions League success in 1993. Dassier's first task will be to avert a management crisis after sports director Jose Anigo threatened to quit following Diouf's departure. New coach Didier Deschamps hinted he could leave before the start of the season if he was not happy with the club's replacement for Diouf
