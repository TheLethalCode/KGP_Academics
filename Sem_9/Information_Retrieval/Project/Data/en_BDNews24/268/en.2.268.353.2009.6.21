 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)The scrutiny committee on withdrawing political harassment cases has decided to withdraw 46 more cases, the committee chief said on Sunday. "We have decided to withdraw 46 cases filed to persecute politicians," state minister for law Kamrul Islam, also committee president, told reporters after the second meeting of the committee. The committee on June 10 withdrew 62 including 12 cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Of the 46 cases to be quashed, 18 cases were filed by the Anticorruption Commission and 28 under Bangladesh Penal Code. Kamrul said: "Today's meeting has discussed withdrawal of 58 cases, of them 23 filed by Anticorruption Commission and 35 under Bangladesh Penal Code. "We decided on 46 cases. Of the remaining 11 cases, eight cases could not be withdrawn and have been sent back to the home ministry and four cases would be discussed in the next meeting, he said. "Steps will be taken in phases against those who harassed political leaders after the changeover of 1/11," the junior minister said while replying to a question. No recommendations for BNP came from the district committees on withdrawing cases, he said. "We will consider on recommendation." "The BNP government laundered thousand of crores of money abroad and filed cases against the opposition, (Awami League). "The caretaker government filed cases by using the Anticorruption Commission against Sheikh Hasina as a parallel as it filed case against BNP chief Khaleda Zia," Kamrul said. If any BNP leader is harassed in cases filed by the ACC it would be considered, he said. The home ministry has received as many as 824 applications so far, the minister said. After scrutiny of 113 cases the first meeting of the committee considered 62 cases to be withdrawn, of which 36 were filed under the Bangladesh Penal Code and 26 by the ACC. The government formed the seven-member scrutiny committee on Feb 22 with the state minister for law as head and formed four-member district level committees with district magistrates as chiefs. The deadline for submitting applications to the district magistrates was May 31. The date was later extended to June 30. b
