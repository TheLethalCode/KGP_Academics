<TITLE> Sri Lanka storm to final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)Sri Lanka defeated West Indies by 57 runs in the semi-final to face Pakistan in the all-Asia World Twenty20 final at Lord's on Sunday. Chasing 159 for a place in final was never going to be easy for the West Indians and all eyes were on skipper Chris Gayle. But they got off to a disastrous start courtesy Angelo Mathews who conceded one run and picked up three wickets in the first over of the innings. Every second ball of the first over saw a wicket fall, however. Gayle, 63 not out off 50 balls, was watching proceedings calmly from the non-strikers end. He knew that all he needed was a partner and he could achieve this target alone, if he had to. Spinners Muttiah Muralitharan (3 for 29) and Ajantha Mendis (2 for 9) were too much for the clueless West Indians. Friday was just not West Indies' day. Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara kept the lid on West Indies by making some good bowling changes at the right time. From the first over the West Indies had their backs to the wall and the Lankan captain capitalised on that. He utilised his spinners well. All the other West Indian batsmen fell in single digits. Half-centurion Gayle stood alone but as his partners ran out the scoring rate climbed to an almost unachievable rate. Earlier, a scintillating unbeaten 96-run knock from Tillakaratne Dilshan helped Sri Lanka to 158 for five wickets. Run-machine Dilshan, the Man of the Match, prolonged his purple patch with a sublime unbeaten 57-ball knock, bejewelled with two sixes and 12 fours. His innings was the cornerstone of the Lankan innings as the right-hander went on to eclipse Jacques Kallis as the leading scorer in the tournament. Dilshan's knock was not only the highest individual score of the tournament but also the highest by a Lankan in a Twenty20 International. Incidentally with the ball not exactly coming to the bat as they would have liked, Sri Lanka had a rather quiet start after West Indies captain Chris Gayle put them in. Sanath Jayasuriya (24) struggled to time the ball and Dilshan, clearly the more fluent of the duo, did not get enough strike. Jayasuriya hit Darren Sammy and Suleiman Benn for boundaries but still could not find the meat of the bat and even changing the willow did not help. Dilshan, however, looked in silken touch and could not be stymied. He tickled a Jerome Taylor delivery over the wicket-keeper for a four and paddled the next one, a low full toss, for a stunning six to break free. Dwayne Bravo did not go unscathed either as Dilshan hit him for three fours in the same over. He edged Chris Gayle for a four and followed it up with a more convincing shot, a slog-sweep to send the ball into the stands behind the mid-wicket region. Sri Lanka had cruised to 73 runs in 10-odd overs without a setback when Bravo triggered a batting collapse that left the Lankans reeling at 77 for three. Jayasuriya hit Bravo's third ball of the over straight to Taylor and two balls later, Kieron Pollard took a blinder to return the scoreless Kumar Sangakkara. Pollard then returned to remove Mahela Jayawardene (2) and suddenly Sri Lanka found themselves staring at abyss. Not that it had much of an effect on Dilshan who hit Bravo for three fours on the trot. Chamara Silva (11) and Jehan Mubarak (7) could not shine but Angelo Matthews (12 not out off 4 balls) made his presence count as the Lankans crossed the 150-mark quite comforta
