<TITLE> Nadal withdrawal hands Federer his golden chance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lady Luck appears to be siding with Roger Federer and he will never have a better chance of a record 15th grand slam title than at this year's Wimbledon after Rafael Nadal was removed from the equation on Friday. Earlier this month Swede Robin Soderling snapped Nadal's 31-match winning streak at the French Open, paving the way for Federer to claim the only major title missing from his collection. Now, a year after his hopes of a sixth consecutive Wimbledon title were shredded by Nadal in a breathtaking five-set final, the Swiss has again been spared the task of toppling his nemesis by virtue of the Spaniard's battered knees. Once the shockwaves have receded and the draw re-jigged, world number two Federer will surely believe the cards are falling in his favour. Federer was ashen-faced 12 months ago when Nadal beat him in near-darkness and hysterical after another defeat by the Spaniard at the Australian Open. Sport, like the British summer, is notoriously unpredictable though, and the Swiss maestro will breeze through the All England Club gates on Monday as the man to beat once again. After finally claiming the French crown and completing his career grand slam, Federer said he could now play without pressure. "Now, going into the grasscourt season, and Wimbledon, and being on top of the world, it's a fantastic feeling," said the Swiss, newly-married and with a baby on the way. It was all different last year when Nadal, having humiliated Federer in the final at Roland Garros, swept to the Queen's Club grasscourt title and then pole-axed the Swiss in the place he calls his own backyard. A month later, Nadal took Federer's world number one ranking and, although the Swiss hit back to win the U.S. Open, it seemed that a seismic shift had occurred in the sport. ACHING KNEES Nadal looked set to dominate men's tennis when he won this year's Australian Open but the Mallorcan powerhouse cannot function without his explosive movement around the court. His aching knees forced him out of the Queen's Club warm-up event and after two defeats at the Hurlingham exhibition tournament this week, he made the painful decision to withdraw. "Not to play Wimbledon is one of the toughest decisions in my career but the decision was made easier because I don't feel ready to compete at 100 percent for two weeks," said Nadal. While weather and sporting fortunes are fickle, one thing is nailed on this yearMurray-Mania. It has taken British fans a while to warm to Andy Murray but his U.S. Open final appearance last year, his rise to number three in the world and last week's title at Queen's have raised expectations that he can become the first home men's champion at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936. Apart from a blip at the Australian Open, the Scot's progress has been spectacular. He reached consecutive Masters Series finals, losing to Nadal in Indian Wells and beating Djokovic in Miami, then reached the last eight for the first time in Paris. Gone are the days when he would suffer mental and physical lapses. The 22 year old has always had an uncanny ability to control a tennis ball but those skills are now backed up with a steely resolve, stamina and power when required. GOOD BENCHMARK "I think I could win against either of them (Federer and Nadal) on grass," Murray said before Nadal's pull-out left him as the second highest seed in the draw. "Normally Queen's is a good benchmark to see where all the other players are at. For me it was perfect preparation," added Murray, who cannot meet Federer until the final. Of the other contenders, Novak Djokovic appears to be suffering a dip in form just at the wrong time, losing early in Paris and then to Tommy Haas in the Halle final. Slimmed-down American Andy Roddick, twice defeated in Wimbledon finals by Federer, will bring his rocket-powered serve to the party once again and will be dangerous if he has fully recovered from the ankle injury he sustained at Queen's Club. There will also be a few bets placed on Argentina's world number five Juan Martin del Potro, who now sits at the top of the draw in the place where Nadal should have been. The gangly 20 year old might not yet be quite ready to emulate Nadal's performances on grass but with a huge serve and a sledgehammer forehand he poses a threat to all in his path
