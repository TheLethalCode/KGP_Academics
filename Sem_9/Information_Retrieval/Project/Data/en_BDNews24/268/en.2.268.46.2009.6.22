<TITLE> Power outages testing public patience: Menon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)Workers' Party President Rashed Khan Menon has told the parliament that the power outages are testing the people's patience with the government failing to guarantee electricity supply. Menon, an MP elected from the Awami League-led alliance, said the prime minister's adviser on power was more powerful than the state minister for power. He said the government should include the BNP's representative in the parliamentary delegation for the visit to Tipaimukh dam in India. "Six months have passed since the present government took office. We cannot provide electricity to people. "On an average, electricity goes out at least five times a day. People are getting impatient," Menon said in his speech on 2009-10 budget. He said the energy ministry was under the prime minister and the ministry had a state minister. "I don't know whether the state minister (Shamsul Haque) Tuku has any power. It seems that the adviser exercises all power," said Menon. He said the government was planning to resuscitate Garai river and construct barrage. But the Tipaimukh (dam) may stop water flow, he said. "Tipaimukh will bring disaster for the country. But we are speaking with muted voice," said Menon. "I think the BNP's representatives should be included in the parliamentary team, which will visit Tipaimukh dam, to make it an all-party team," said Menon. He also criticised the BNP for not talking against Tipaimukh while in power. The MP opposed the offer in the proposed budget to whiten the black money. "I propose that the black money holders should pay at least 30 percent tax to whiten their money," said Motiur Rahman, an Awami League MP. Kamal Ahmed Majumder, another Awami League MP, made similar proposal. "The black money whitening offer should not continue for three years as proposed by the finance minister," Meher Afroze Chumki said. "If they get it, they would sit idle for two years and whiten money in the third year paying 10 percent tax. "Therefore, I propose that the money whitening offer should go for one year."
