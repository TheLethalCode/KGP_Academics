<TITLE> D-Day for South Africa and Iraq, Spain chase records </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts South Africa or Asian champions Iraq will join Spain in the semi-finals when Group A of the Confederations Cup is decided on Saturday. Spain are already assured of a place in the last four after two wins from two games, but still have targets. If they beat South Africa in Bloemfontein (1830 GMT), they will equal Brazil's FIFA-recognised world record of 35 successive unbeaten matches and also set a world record of 15 straight victories, edging past France, Brazil and Australia. Though chasing those targets, Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque also told a media conference: "This is an ideal situation to make some changes, giving some (players) a break because we are not bothered about who we play in the semi-finals." South Africa have four points from their two games and Iraq just one, but Iraq can still finish second on goal difference if they beat New Zealand in Johannesburg (1830 GMT) by a decent score and South Africa lose to Spain. However, if the pair were to end up equal on goal difference, the final positions would be decided on the toss of a coin because they drew 0-0 with each other in their opening match
