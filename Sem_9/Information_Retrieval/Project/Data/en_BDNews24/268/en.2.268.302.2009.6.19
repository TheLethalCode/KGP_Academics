<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)The proposed budget offers little real support to small industries, having overlooked the urgent need to create a specialised SME bank, women entrepreuners said on Thursday. "The proposed budget fails to reflect the importance of SMEs," chairperson of the WEAB Foundation Nasrin Awal Mintoo said on Thursday. "It would have been more fruitful to establish an SME development bank instead of a small rise in budgetary support to the sector," she said at a 'Post-budget discussion', organised by the Women Entrepreuners Association of Bangladesh. Cottage, small and medium industries received only two percent of the total loans disbursed by government, private and specialised banks between 2005 and 2008, she said. Of the loan recipients, only five percent were women, she said. Industries minister Dilip Barua, attending as special guest, also stressed the need for setting up an SME bank for development of small and medium enterprises, many of which are run by women. He focused too on the need to reduce interest rates to single digits along with industry-friendly reforms in the banking sector. He termed the new budget as 'pro-industry' overall, however. "Our economy has been dependent on trade and commerce in past years and the country was a foreigners' market." "But the new budget shields local industries for the first time," he said. Former finance adviser to the immediate past care-taker government AB Mirza Azizul Islam urged all present to support women entrepreneurs. He also urged women entrepreneurs to support each other through sub-contracting. "It is also necessary to offer women entrepreneurs technical assistance so that they can better develop their projects," he said. "Bangladesh Bank and WEAB can play key roles in this," he said. b
