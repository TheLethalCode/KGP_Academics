<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will lodge a diplomatic protest to the United Nations against the sea territory claims of India and Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Wednesday. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have long-standing disputes over their sea boundaries, preventing oil-gas exploration in the Bay for all three countries. Asked about sea border demarcation, she said Bangladesh had already mapped its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. July 27, 2011, is the deadline for Bangladesh to claim an extra 150 nautical miles of continental shelf, Hasina told parliament during prime minister's question time. She said the government has taken all preparation to make the claim before the United Nations Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf within the deadline. She also said her government is still pressing on with its effort to resolve sea border issues through bilateral talks with India and Myanmar. According to UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on Laws of Sea 1982, a country's EEZ should extend up to 200 nautical miles, with the further 150 nautical miles of extended continental shelf falling within its maritime boundary. But two neighbouring countries are making sea border claims in such ways that entry of vessels to Bangladesh's Chittagong and Mongla ports would be blocked, say foreign ministry officials. Myanmar has already submitted the map of its sea boundary to the UN without resolving disputes with Bangladesh India has to submit its sea boundary map to the UN by June this year. If Delhi submits its sea boundary map without resolving disputes by June, Bangladesh will be entitled to lodge a protest. Indian barrages BNP MP Zafrul Islam Chowdhury in a written query asked about erection of barrages by India upstream of joint rivers. Bangladesh and India share 54 rivers, of which India has so far erected barrages on the Ganges, Mohananda, Teesta, Manu, Khoai, Gomti, the prime minister said. The neighbouring country also has an under construction barrage on the Mohuri river, she said. AHN link awaiting ESCAP nod Bangladesh's link to the Asian Highway Network will get off to a start as soon as UN ESCAP approves the routes, said Hasina. "The government has taken the decision in principle to link Bangladesh with the Asian Highway Network." "The motion, subject to the cabinet's final approval, will be sent to ESCAP," Hasina told parliament. Replying to a query from MP Mohammad Shahiduzzaman for Naogaon-2, Hasina said that three possible routes have been selected for the AHN in Bangladesh. b
