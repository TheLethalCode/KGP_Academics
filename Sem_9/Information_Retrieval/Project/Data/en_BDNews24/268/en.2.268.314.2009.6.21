<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 21 (bdnews24.com)The government has failed to start evaluation of pre-qualification proposals for the proposed 450-megawatt Bibiyana independent power plant even two months into their submission. Seven applicants filed their proposals in late April and an evaluation committee headed by the director general of Power Cell under the Power Division was given two weeks to evaluate the documents and announce the evaluation results. "We are yet to start evaluating the applications for the proposed power plant, as we did not get any decision from the government on the matter," Md Abdul Mannan, director general of the Power Cell, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Officials in the Power Cell on condition of anonymity said that the government might be waiting for the donor's advice before starting the evaluation process. The World Bank group member International Finance Corporation is the adviser to the government on the IPP project. The applicants for the proposed project are YTL Power International Berhad, Malaysia; a consortium of Summit Industrial and Mercantile Corporation Ltd and GE energy LLC, Bangladesh; Independent Power Corporation PLC, England; Ranhill Berhad, Malaysia; a consortium of China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC), Shenzen Shenwan Power Gas Turbine Engineering Technique Company Ltd and Asian Entech Power Corp and OTOBI Ltd; Globeleq Advisors Limited, Englend; and a consortium of MPC Consortium of Meiya Power Company Limited and Shasha Denis Limited Bangladesh. Those applicants who will meet the pre-qualification criteria will be allowed to participate in the final round bidding. Last year, the ministry asked the Power Cell to re-tender for the Bibiyana power plant due to high price proposed by the Malaysia-based Powertek Consortium. Powertek was the lone bidder, which proposed 4.399 cent for per unit power. Power Cell officials said on completion of the primary process of Bibiyana power plant, proposals will also be asked for another 450-MW independent power plant at Sirajganj. bdn
