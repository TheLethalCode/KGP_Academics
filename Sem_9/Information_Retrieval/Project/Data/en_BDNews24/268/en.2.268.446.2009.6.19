 BHIMPUR, India, Fri Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fearful of landmines and under fire from rebels, police struggled on Friday to enter a Maoist "liberated zone" close to Kolkata.

"Investors are waiting and watching the situation unfold. It is going to delay industrialisation (in West Bengal)," Sandipan Chakraborty, Managing Director of Tata Ryerson Ltd, owned by Tata Steel and the US-based Ryerson Inc.
