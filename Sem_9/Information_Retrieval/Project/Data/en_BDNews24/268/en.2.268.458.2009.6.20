<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)The three-year no-questions-asked provision for whitening black money will be "modified", the finance minister AMA Muhith said on Saturday, following days of debate and criticism over the scheme offered in the proposed budget. He did not specify what type of change would be brought in the provision that allows previously undeclared income to be legalised through a flat-rate 10 percent tax and investment in at least one of 42 sectors. He was speaking at a dialogue, on 'The Current Economic Situation of Bangladesh and Budget Reaction:2009-10', hosted by private think tank Centre for Policy Dialogue at the Dhaka Sheraton. Those present were mainly critical of the money whitening scheme. Former agriculture minister MK Anwar was against its lengthy term. "Every organisation will be covered by a blanket of black money, capitalising on the three-year scope," he said. "The real taxpayers will be discouraged." Former finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam was concerned about the 'no questions asked' element. He said the provision must absolutely not allow illegally-earned money to be whitened, only previously untaxed income. Their comments echoed criticism that has been levelled from all quartersincluding MPs, business groups, economists, public and mediasince Muhith laid out his proposed budget on June 11. Most critics have said the provision was unfair for ordinary taxpayers. Some have said the scheme 'condones corruption'. Others suggested that the number of investment sectors should be reduced. "Much debate has arisen centring on the provision," Muhith noted on Saturday. "Some have criticised it on the grounds of its long duration, proposing it be reduced to one year instead of three." He said "all criticisms" would carry weight in further deliberations. "It will be considered what modification might be made," said the finance minister. Investment purposes "No foreign investment will flow into the country unless we can revamp our economy by enhancing local investment," said Muhith. Raising local investment, and job creation with it, is the main aim of the money whitening scheme, the finance minister said in his budget speech, which he stressed again on Saturday. He said the government would pay special attention to major infrastructure projects in a bid to boost foreign investment. Regarding public-private partnerships, he said," We are taking on this big challenge for the development of the country and we expect we will come out successful." Major projects, including gas and power, would be executed through PPP, said Muhith. "Steps for constructing the elevated expressway stretching from the airport to Jatrabari have already been initiated," he added. "I am saying now as I have said before, the government will make all efforts to fully implement its budget proposals as it is pledge bound to the people." Asked how budgetary allocation of Tk 5000 crore for export sectors would be utilised, the minister said an incentive package was announced on April 19 in the light of taskforce recommendations. He said the taskforce, appointed earlier this year to formulate measures for minimising recession fallout, was scheduled to meet again next month. Growth target In reply to the criticism that he set too low a target for economic growth in the coming year, Muhith said, "It has been set keeping the global recession in perspective." "Some have misquoted the GDP growth target as 5.5 percent but in my budget speech I said it would range from 5.5 to 6.0 percent." He said the target would be revised if the world economy showed signs of recovery with little impact on Bangladesh. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman presented the key note address in the dialogue chaired by CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan bdn
