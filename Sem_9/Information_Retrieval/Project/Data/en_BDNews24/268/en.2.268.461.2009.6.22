<TITLE> Federer starts campaign with military precision </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer turned up at Wimbledon on Monday resembling an army general ready to conduct his latest campaign and he soon disarmed the opposition on the opening day of the grasscourt championships. The Swiss strolled on court in a white monogrammed military-style outfit, complete with a waistcoat underneath, and was soon firing winners past Taiwan's Lu Yen-Hsun to secure a 7-5 6-3 6-2 win in the first round. The 27-year-old had the honour of opening Centre Court proceedings, a privilege usually reserved for the champion, after his great rival Rafael Nadal pulled out of the grasscourt major with a knee injury before a ball had been struck. Although Federer's five-year Wimbledon reign ended last year in a heart-stopping five-set final, it was not long before he was acting every inch a champion by swatting aside Asia's only contender in the men's draw with a glorious forehand winner. "Rafa obviously deserves this spot (to open the play) on Monday but I feel very privileged and honoured they gave me the chance," the French Open champion said after beginning his pursuit of a record 15th grand slam title. Asked about his fashion statement, he added: "I went for a modern military look, hope people like it." UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE Maria Sharapova has often raised eyebrows with her Wimbledon wardrobe. But a year after turning up in a tuxedo-inspired ensemble, she opted for understated elegance in a classic white dress as she tried to improve on her 2008 second-round showing. The Russian, bumped up to 24th seed despite being 60th in the world as she continues her comeback from a nine-month layoff after shoulder surgery, recovered from 4-1 down in the first to claim a 7-5 6-4 win over Ukrainian qualifier Viktoriya Kutuzova. "It's really enjoyable and I'm so glad today I pulled it out against a difficult opponent," Sharapova said just after walking off Court One. "I was just trying to hold in there. I was only down two breaks and I thought, 'It's not over till it's over'." Joining her in the second round will be Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova who ended the hopes of Britain's golden girl Laura Robson 3-6 6-4 6-2. The 15-year-old Robson, the youngest player in the main draw since Martina Hingis in 1995, had the distinction of winning the first ever point on the new Court Two when she fired an ace. A booming male voice promptly urged the junior champion to "Go on Laura" but after a promising start the teenager faded and it seemed inevitable when she bowed out with a double fault. Robson, a wildcard ranked 488th in the world, hung her head as she trudged off the court waving farewell to the crowd. Although the young Briton's defeat was no surprise, given that she faced an opponent ranked 456 places above her, American James Blake's first round exit did raise some eyebrows. The 17th seed had contested the Queen's Club final just eight days ago, when he lost to Briton Andy Murray, but slumped to a 7-5 6-4 7-6 defeat by Italy's Andreas Seppi
