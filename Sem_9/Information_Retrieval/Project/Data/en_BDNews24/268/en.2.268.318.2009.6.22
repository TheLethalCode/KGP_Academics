 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh national hockey team leave for Moscow on Monday night to take part in a four-nation international hockey tournament involving hosts Russia, South Africa, Canada and Bangladesh. Bangladesh, who recently finished seventh in the Asia Cup hockey and the lowest ranked side in the four-nation meet, will begin their campaign on Wednesday taking on the 16th-ranked South Africa and the next day they will face hosts Russia, 25th in world ranking. Then 34th-ranked Bangladesh will play against 11th-ranked Canada on June 27 before playing a place-deciding match on June 28 in Moscow. "It is a preparatory tournament for Bangladesh ahead of the 2010 South Asian (SA) Games in Bangladesh," said Bangladesh Hockey Federation general secretary Khondokar Jamiluddin at a press conference on Monday. "Though the team could not get good results in the Asia Cup, but I must say that a change has come in the play and this time the target will be reducing the defeat margin against the superior sides," said Jamil. Meanwhile, Bangladesh under the supervision of German coach Gerhard Peter Rach and Oliver Kurtz conceded 32 goals in four matches in the Asia Cup in Malaysia. Forward Jahidul Islam Rajon has been named captain for the assignment while defender Moshiur Rahman Biplob will be his deputy in four matches. Rajon said that they were looking forward to showing better performance rather than concentrating on results compared to what happened in the Asia Cup. The BHF also declared a 16-member squad naming two rookies Abdus Sajjad John and Golam Mostafa Manik. Besides, it also recalled goalkeeper Mehrab Hossain Kiron and defender Khondokar Hasan Ahmed while midfielders Ashiquzzaman and Shamsuddin Tuhin, striker Iqbal Nader Prince, Rimon Kumar, Krishna Kumar, and goalkeeper Ferdous Golandas, members of the Asia Cup squad, were dropped. The BHF general secretary said that they were planning to introduce school hockey, youth under-21 hockey, tribal hockey and six-a-side hockey from this year apart from regular domestic competitions. Jamil also said that they had a plan to hold the Premier Minister Cup involving foreign teams as he initially had a discussion with the sports minister, but the time and date would be finalised consulting with different federations, who were also going to hold international tournaments this year. After returning from Russia, the players will be released from the SA Games camp for the upcoming Premier Hockey League and afterwards the national players will travel to Germany for a two-and-a-half month period to be prepared for the SA Games. And Jamil urged the clubs to accept the players' transfer scheduled of July 8-10 and complete the league before the third week of August when the national team would leave for Germany. "In the greater interest of hockey, I am urging the clubs to complete the league on time," Jamil said. "If we cannot complete the league before the third week of August, it will be difficult for the national players to travel to Germany because their (German) domestic competition will start in the same time." Jamil also informed that the hosts would bear all expenditure of the hockey team even the players would also get pocket money during their two-and-a-half month stay there. However, questions were raised whether the federation would be able to complete the league within five weeks as well as whether the clubs would be interested to spend huge money for just only five weeks, Jamil said that they were planning to play three matches on each day. Squad: Sheikh Mohammad Nannu, Mamun Ur Rashid Chayan, Musharraf Hossain Kuti, Rasel Mahmud Jimmy, Zahidul Islam Rajon, Pushkor Khisa, Zahid Bin Talib Shuvo, Moshiur Rahman Biplob, AHM Kamaruzzaman, Asaduzzaman Chandan, ASM Mahbub Ullah Chowdhury Shakil, Taposh Kumar Barmon, Khondokar Hasan Ahmed, Abdus Sajjad John, Golam Mostafa Manik and Mehrab Hossain Kiron. bd
