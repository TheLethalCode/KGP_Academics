<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - Commerce minister Faruq Khan said Sunday the government intends to stabilise the price of essentials during Ramadan by importing goods through the Trade Corporation of Bangladesh. "We have already taken steps to import lentils, sugar, refined palm and soya bean oil to keep the prices of essentials stable over Ramadan," said Khan in reply to a question in parliament. Work-orders would be provided soon, he said. Responding to another question from the floor, the commerce minister said Bangladesh still maintains a huge trade deficit with India, although he added that the government has ongoing diplomatic initiatives to reduce the gap. These include allowing export of more products through regional trade agreements, overcoming trade obstacles and developing land ports and roads, said Khan. He also mentioned greater participation in Indian trade fairs, dispatching commerce missions to the neighbouring country and taking initiatives to increase exports to nearby north-eastern India. The minister said initiatives are underway to exploit new labour markets in Korea, Romania, Australia, Canada, Russia, South Africa and Sudan. He added that the government is currently debating whether to send Bangladeshi workers to Iraq following the cessation of major hostilities there. bdnews24.
