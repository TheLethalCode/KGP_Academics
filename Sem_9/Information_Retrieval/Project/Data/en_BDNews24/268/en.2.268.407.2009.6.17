 GUWAHATI, June 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 12 people have been killed in a raid on a village in Assam, in one of the worst incidents of ethnic conflict in the troubled region in recent years, officials said on Wednesday. Heavily armed tribal militants attacked the village of a rival tribe late on Tuesday and set ablaze more than 20 houses, mostly made of bamboo and straw, and then opened indiscriminate fire on villagers working in nearby paddy fields. A land dispute provoked the killing in the oil- and tea-rich state of Assam's remote mountains, officials said, adding the militants fled the scene to a nearby thick forest. India's northeast, made up of eight states, has been plagued by separatist and tribal insurgencies for more than 60 years.
