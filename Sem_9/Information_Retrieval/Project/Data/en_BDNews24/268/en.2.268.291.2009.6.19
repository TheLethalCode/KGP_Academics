 TOKYO, Fri Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq is confident its security forces can manage alone after US soldiers pull out of towns and cities this month, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Friday. Concerns have arisen about Iraqi security forces' ability to combat increasing violence ahead of parliamentary elections due next January. "The Iraqi government, about the security forces, are confident (they) are capable of taking over its full responsibility after the withdrawal of American forces" from cities, Zebari told a news conference on a visit to Tokyo.

He also played down the tension between Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities over oil resources and the future of the disputed city of Kirkuk, claimed by the Kurds as their ancestral capital, saying that "there is no breakdown" in ties between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities. Zebari, in Japan on a six-day trip ending on Monday, will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso later on Friday to discuss Iraq's security and business environment in the hope of attracting more Japanese invest
