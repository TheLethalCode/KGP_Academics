 NAZRAN, Russia, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Russia's troubled southern region of Ingushetia was wounded in an assassination attempt on Monday, a law enforcement source said. The source gave no further details. Itar-Tass news agency said that local leader Yunus-Bek Yevkurov had been wounded when his convoy was rocked by a blast. Tass said he had been taken to hospital. The news agency said four of his bodyguards were killed and five others were wounded. RIA news agency also said Yevkurov leader had been wounded, along with his brother and a bodyguard. Over the past few years Ingushetia, neighbor of restive Chechnya, has been rocked by attacks on officials and troops blamed by officials on Islamic radicals. In October, President Dmitry Medvedev appointed ex-paratroop officer Yevkurov as the regional president replacing former secret police officer Murat Zyazikov, blamed by critics of mishandling the crisis.
