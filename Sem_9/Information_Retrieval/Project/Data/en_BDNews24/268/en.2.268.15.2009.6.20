 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary probe committee investigating parliament's past expenditures has summoned former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, former deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to defend themselves against graft charges on June 27, a committee member said on Saturday. The committee had earlier decided to ask them to appear on June 10, Shahjahan Khan told bdnews24.com. But parliament's budget session began on June 4. "With the parliament secretariat busy preparing for the budget speech on June 11, we had to postpone," said Khan. Meanwhile, three sub-committee have submitted their findings to the main committee, he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of strong demands by MPs of the ninth parlaiment, formed an 11-member probe body on March 19 to investigate allegations of corruption and irregularities during the eighth parliament by the former speaker Sircar and other high officials. The standing committee formed the three sub-committees to thoroughly examine the allegations. One has reported that Sircar drew over Tk 28 lakh illegally for medical treatment abroad. Another found that former chief whip and BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain took Tk 18 lakh from the MP Club's fund also for overseas treatment. It also found that present chief whip Abdus Shahid and former whip Wahidul Alam received Tk 1 lakh and Tk 4 lakh respectively from the fund for the same purpose. bd
