<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Residential flats will be less pricey once the government provides the builders land at the government fixed fair prices, the ShelTech managing director on Wednesday said. "The soaring prices of flats are directly linked to the escalating land prices. If the government sells us land at rates fixed by the government, the prices of flats must come down," Toufique M Seraj said at a press conference on 'post-budget deliberations and actions' hosted at ShelTech Tower. A six-day ShelTech 'Budgetary Investment Fair' will be launched on Thursday, it was declared at the briefing. At the 'expo' held at 55, west Panthapath through to June 23, there will be attractive concessions, incentives and rebates for the clients. "The government, for example, is allotting land plots in Uttara at Tk 5 lakh a katha and anyone buying the same plot from a private party has to pay manifold. "If the government allots us, developers, plots at its usual selling price, we should be able to offer people flats at a much reduced prices. For example, the price per square foot space of a flat would be 1,500-2,000 taka less." Seraj sought government assistance in combating the adverse impacts of the ongoing economic crunch. "During the emergency, people had no interest in buying homes." "After democracy was restored, this new menace of a global meltdown is threatening us again. "Bulk of our buyer are NRBs who are also under pressure from many directions." He said prices of flats will not be upped with the government opening opportunities to legalise black money through investing in real estate. Seraj urged the policymakers to formulate business-friendly policies. bd
