<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies demanded sub-agents, popularly known as 'dalals' and who play a vital role in export of manpower, be brought under the law. At a press briefing on Wednesday, BAIRA president Golam Mustafa said, "We have proposed to the government that the sub-agents be issued identity cards." "If necessary, provision for security money from them can be introduced," he said. Countless dalals, who operate across the country, face widespread allegations of overcharging for their services or even swindling people of their life-savings. Mustafa said, "We advertise directly to potential workers in the dailies, but do not get them. Rather they prefer to go through local sub-agents." Asked why their offices are not being set up at rural levels to recruit workers at the local level, he said, "We have asked recruiting agencies to open branches outside Dhaka city." Mustafa said, manpower exports had slowed because of global recession. Some 3.78 lakh workers were exported from January 1 to May 30, 2008, while it dropped to some 2.12 lakh during the same period in 2009, he said On potential new job markets, the BAIRA president said, "We have proposed to the government to open a Bangladesh mission in Iraq as they will need many foreign workers to assist in restoration of peace and stability there." He also said they had proposed an expatriate welfare bank through joint partnership of BAIRA and the expatriate welfare fund. But the government moved to make it a specialised bank, he said. bd
