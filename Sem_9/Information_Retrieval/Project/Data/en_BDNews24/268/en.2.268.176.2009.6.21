 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Brazil captain Ricardo Gomes has take over as coach of Sao Paulo, the Brazilian club announced on Saturday. Ricardo, who coached Monaco in the French Ligue 1 for the past two seasons, has signed a one-year contract and replaces Muricy Ramalho, who was sacked on Friday. He will be formally presented to the media on Tuesday. "The agreement with the new Sao Paulo trainer came about this Saturday morning after progress in talks the previous night," the club said on its website (www.spfc.com.br). Ricardo, 44, was a central defender who captained Brazil at the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He led his country to victory in the 1989 Copa America in Brazil. He has spent a good part of his career in France, first as a player for Paris St Germain, then as coach of PSG and Girondins Bordeaux before Monaco. He has also trained several Brazilian sides including Flamengo. Ramalho, who steered Sao Paulo to three successive Brazilian league titles after taking charge in January 2006, paid the price for Libertadores Cup failure. Sao Paulo lost 2-0 at home to fellow Brazilian side Cruzeiro on Thursday, going out 4-1 on aggregate in the competition's quarter-finals. The Libertadores is a priority for Sao Paulo, who won their third Cup in 2005
