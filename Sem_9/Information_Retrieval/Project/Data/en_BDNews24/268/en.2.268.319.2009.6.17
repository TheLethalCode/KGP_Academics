 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)Former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui was released from jail in Naogaon on Wednesday afternoon after securing bail in all cases filed against him. He was freed around 5pm Wednesday after all papers regarding his bail had reached jail authorities. BNP leaders and activists greeted him with flowers at the jail gate. He set out for Dhaka directly after his release. A Naogaon court granted former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui bail in a sedition case, earlier in the day, clearing way for his release from jail, his lawyer said. "Hamid has secured bail in all cases against him," Khairul Alam Helal said. He earlier secured bail in two fraud cases and an abduction case from the same Naogaon court of district and sessions judge Habibur Rahman. Hamid was arrested and detained under the Special Powers Act on March 21 from his Mahadebpur house in Naogaon. The High Court ordered the detention illegal, his lawyers said. bdnews24.c
