 DUBAI, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Abu Dhabi billionaire Sulaiman al-Fahim insists there is "no link" between his bid for English Premier League club Portsmouth and the reported purchase of a majority stake in another team by a UAE investor. A member of a ruling family in the United Arab Emirates has bought a majority stake in an unnamed English Premier League soccer club, the official WAM news agency reported on Sunday. WAM did not specify but said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saqr al-Qassimi had bought a 60 percent stake and the details of the deal would be announced in a few days.
