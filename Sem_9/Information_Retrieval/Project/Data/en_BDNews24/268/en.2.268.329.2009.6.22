<TITLE> Rafsanjani daughter released: Iranian state TV </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A daughter of former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a rival of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has been released from detention, state television said on Monday. Iran's English-language Press TV had reported that Faezeh Rafsanjani and four other relatives of the former president were detained during an unauthorized protest in Tehran on Saturday. The four other relatives were freed earlier. "Rafsanjani's daughter released after brief arrest," Press TV said in a headline without giving details. Last week, the semi-official Fars News Agency said Faezeh and her brother Mehdi had been barred from leaving Iran. Faezeh addressed supporters of defeated presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi last Tuesday when they gathered near the state television building in Tehran in defiance of a ban on opposition protests. Her father, who remains a powerful figure in Iran, supported Mousavi in the June 12 election. Official results showed Ahmadinejad won by a landslide but Mousavi says the vote was rigged, a charge the authorities reject. Rafsanjani reacted furiously when Ahmadinejad during the election campaign accused him on television of corruption, publicly urging Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to rein in the president.
