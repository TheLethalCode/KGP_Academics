 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.comn)  The government will stipulate different timings for educational institutions, government and non-government offices, banks and financial institutions, in a bid to ease morning traffic chaos, a top government official has said Sunday. The establishment ministry has already sent letters to all ministries and divisions to initiate a trial run of the new timings and send in recommendations, which will forward the suggestions to the Cabinet Division for finally approving of new and varying, if necessary schedules. Cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz confirmed the initialisation of the procedure to bdnews24.com and a private TV channel on Sunday. He said with taking the clock an hour forward, the government has started working on three categories of office timings. The schools and colleges, government and non-government offices, banks and financial institutions having similar schedules should result in creating heavy traffic gridlock in the capital and other big cities, Aziz said. That was the thinking behind the government's move to have three separate office timings to ease stress on the available road networks, the secretary said. Under the new regulation, all government and private offices would start at 9am, educational institutions 30 minutes or an hour earlier while banks and financial institutions half an hour later. Despite the government intimating the educational institutions the new timings, some are still sticking to their previous routines, resulting in continued chaos, officials at the Cabinet Division and establishment ministry informed bdnews24.com. The cabinet secretary said, the government was happy to see government officials adjusting to the new office timings. Ten of the 30 ministries and 11 of the 64 districts have reported satisfactory presence of government officials on the first day of the changeover. People will get gradually adjusted to the daylight saving time phenomenon "for their own good", he added. "Most of the work will be done by the first half of the day. People will be back home early." He also said that the government was happy with the positive response from the people to the time switch enforced Friday night. bdnews24.
