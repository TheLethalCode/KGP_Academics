<TITLE> India fans must become better losers, says Tendulkar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's cricket-crazy fans are putting more pressure on the team with their emotional reaction to defeat and need to get behind the players in tough times, said batsman Sachin Tendulkar. Surprise winners of the Twenty20 World Cup two years ago, India were installed as one of the favourites to repeat the triumph this time but a three-run loss to England consigned them to a second straight Super Eights defeat, leaving them with no chance of reaching the semis. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni bore the brunt of fan anger and security at his home in the eastern city of Ranchi had to be beefed up after scores of fans burnt his effigy, shouted slogans and accused him of underestimating England in a must-win game. India went on to lose three Super Eights games in a row and were dumped out of the tournament on Sunday. "I feel there is very high emotion among the people when they react. But do these reactions help us to play better? Not really," Indian media quoted Tendulkar as saying on Thursday. "These actually put more pressure on the players. We have got to be mature and be with the team," he was quoted as telling Times Now channel. "No one can change the past but always can learn from it and do better in future. I think we should react to the success and failures with lot of responsibility and balance. If we do that it becomes easier for everyone." "I am also disappointed along with the nation. I am sure that the guys planned and tried well, but things sometimes don't click," added Tendulkar, who does not play in Twenty20 internationals
