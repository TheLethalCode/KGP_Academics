 BLOEMFONTEIN, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champions Italy face Brazil in the Confederations Cup on Sunday knowing that even a win might not be enough to prevent an early exit. The Italians are in a precarious position in Group B after a surprise defeat at the hands of Egypt on Thursday and the 2006 World Cup winners now face Brazil at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. "We've simply got to win," coach Marcello Lippi told reporters. "We will try to take the initiative." Brazil, on six points, need just one more to secure top spot but could still fail to qualify for the semi-finals. All four teams in the group can still make the last four. Egypt face the United States and victory for the African champions in Rustenburg on Sunday could deliver an unexpected spot in the last four. Italy and Egypt are on three points, with the Italians holding a slightly better goal difference. The United States have yet to score a point but could still qualify by thrashing Egypt and a defeat for Italy. Egypt came off second best to Brazil in a seven-goal thriller before beating Italy 1-0 in Johannesburg. Defender Wael Gomaa told Reuters the match against the United States would be hard but Egypt were "so close now we can feel the semi-finals"
