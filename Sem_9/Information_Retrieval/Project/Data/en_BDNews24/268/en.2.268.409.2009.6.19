 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) - Army officers at 14 out of 54 BDR battalions and sectors outside Dhaka continue to spend nights away from their stations, almost four months after a bloody mutiny at the border force's headquarters that spread rebellion to other parts of the country. "Confidence has not yet returned to a level so that officers feel they can remain through the night at their workplaces," Col Md Jahangir Kabir, BDR director (operations), told a press briefing at the BDR headquarters on Thursday. "At present, the officers remain at their posts from 6am up to 6pm, then spend the nights at nearby rest houses of the district administrations," said Talukder. "This is happening in about 14 of 54 command posts across the country, including Jessore, Khulna, Satkhira, Teknaf." "But it should not take too long to overcome this situation," he added. Some 55 army officers, deputed to the Bangladesh Rifles, were killed in the massacre at the force's Peelkhana headquarters between Feb 25-26. Army officers posted at battalions and sectors beyond the capital fled their posts in fear of their lives during the two days as incidents of armed rebellion spread through their ranks. Talukder said the BDR command chain had broken down in the wake of the mutiny. "But the border was always protected as the rebellion did not spread to the border operation posts," he said. He said the border posts had even undertaken a special anti-smuggling drive. "BDR seized smuggled goods valued at Tk 60 crore between March and May, compared to Tk 15 crore worth during the corresponding period last year," said Kabir. The seized goods included sarees, readymade garments, cigarettes, phensidyl, alcohol, ganja, heroin and fertiliser as well as live cows. b
