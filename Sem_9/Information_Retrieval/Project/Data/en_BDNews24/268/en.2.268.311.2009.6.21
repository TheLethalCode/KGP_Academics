 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq has asked the non-governmental organisations running microcredit programmes in the coastal regions to stop chasing people affected by cyclone 'Aila for loan repayments and interests. The government has directed the scheduled banks to stop realising loan instalments and interest from the affected people in the cyclone-ravaged districts, the minister told reporters at his office in the Secretariat. "Likewise, the NGOs too has been asked to halt their similar activities. Despite the instruction, some NGOs have been chasing the cyclone-affected for the loan repayment." He asked the NGOs not to behave like loan sharks and wait until the next harvest to realise their dues. "Those who'll not heed the government's advice and continue to bother the coastal grassroots will be seriously dealt with," Razzak warned. The cyclone inundated the coasts on May 25, killed more than 150 people and wrought widespread devastation to crops and properties. Razzaq said agriculture and fish 'ghers' or enclosures meade for shrimp farming sustained extensive damages in the cyclone-affected areas. It will take at least a year for the survivors to regain their habitual tempo, he observed. "That's why the banks have been instructed to halt their loan recovery campaigns up to December." The government will continue to intensely run its Vulnerable Group Feeding and Vulnerable Group Development programmes in the coastal belt, the minister added. "The government has also taken up extensive programmes for the rehabilitation of the poor in the region. The government will stand by the people until they recover from the shock of the calamitous experience. About the FY 2009-10 budget, Razzaq said, "To bring the hardcore poor under the food security tent, the proposed budget allocates Tk 1,176 crore." "Starting in October in the 'manga' afflicted northern districts, the food security enhancement programme will be activated and in phases the rest of the country will be brought under its cover." To save electricity, the government has advanced the clock by an hour so that an additional hour's work which would be done after dusk could be accomplished by daylight, the minister said. "I welcome this very much as the sun now rises at five in the morning and sets at seven. We can easily utilise more of our daylight for essential activities and reduce work by nighttime." b
