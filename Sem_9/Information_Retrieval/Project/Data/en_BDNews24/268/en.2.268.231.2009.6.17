 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission on Wednesday sent a letter addressed to speaker Abdul Hamid recommending that BNP MP Salauddin Qader Chowdhury is stripped of the right to represent his electorate. AKM Salimullah, deputy secretary at the EC secretariat, told bdnews24.com that the letter has been sent to the parliament secretariat. Copies of Chowdhury's nomination affidavit, appeal verdict and five other documents have been enclosed with the letter, he added. EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir said on Tuesday that the letter would be sent Wednesday. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said on Tuesday that the EC was of the opinion that the senior BNP leader be disqualified as MP from Chittagong-2 for submitting false information in his nomination papers and defying a court order to rectify it. Sakhawat referred to section 12 of the Representation of the People Order, which states an MP will lose membership if he provides false information in his affidavit to the EC, amounting to perjury. The speaker will take necessary steps according to parliamentary laws and the Member of Parliament (determination of dispute) Act-1980 can be followed in this case, he said. Sakhawat said appropriate steps to be taken by the EC after the speaker's disposal of the matter will be decided when required. Asked what proofs there are about false information, Sakhawat said, "Whatever we have said should be enough." EC alleged that Chowdhury provided the EC with 'false' information about his educational qualification. Challenging the EC, the MP told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the commission should prove that he had lied or furnished 'untrue' information. Speaking to bdnews24.com by phone from Singapore, he claimed that he had not provided any false information in the nomination affidavit about his educational credentials. "Both the commission and the speaker know that they don't have the power to do anything due to legal drawback." He went to Singapore on Monday night for medical treatment. Chowdhury said: "I have said in the affidavit that I don't have education qualification. If there is any wrong let the commission prove it and collect my certificates." "Then I will say what is true and what is false." On providing two types of information about his SCC exam, Chowdhury said: "I didn't submit any biography to the commission. It might have collected it from the parliament secretariat. bdnew
