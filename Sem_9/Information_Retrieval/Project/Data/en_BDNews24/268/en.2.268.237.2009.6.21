 Rangpur, June 21 (bdnews24.com)HM Ershad, Jatiya Party chairman and ruling party ally, claimed Saturday that he will soon be made a 'special ambassador', with equal status to the president. Addressing the party faithful in his home district of Rangpur, Gen Ershad cautioned: "Do not say anything against the Awami League. They have not put a foot wrong so far." "We are with the grand alliance now and will be in the future," said Ershad, a former president and military ruler. "The BNP has been wiped out. Over the last five years they looted the country, illegally transferred the nation's resources abroad and cultivated violence," he said. "The people of Bangladesh have turned away from BNP. They have no future and will never again be able to hold their heads up." Commenting on local affairs, Ershad said all pledges would be met for the people of his home district. "Construction of the new Begum Rokeya University campus, a new gas pipeline supply, all will be done. "I and my 'younger sister' Sheikh Hasina are working for the development of Rangpur," he said. "Making Rangpur a division is a commitment of the prime minister." bdnews24.com/correspond
