<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation is cutting the price of its LPG, by Tk 150 per 12kg cylinder, to compete with private companies. Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission approved the move on Wednesday. BERC chairman Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com,"The price of each 12kg cylinder of LPG has been cut to Tk 700 from Tk 850." The new price would come into effect from Wednesday midnight, he said. BPC officials said its LPG sales meet 25 percent of the market demand but sales were waning because of its high price compared to private companies such as Basundhara and Total. BPC dealers recently demanded LPG price cuts in a meeting with energy adviser Dr Toufiq-e- Elahi and state minister for energy Shamsul Haq Tuku. According to BPC, 14,800 metric tonnes of LPG was sold during FY 2007-08. Consumption is estimated to be 16,000 metric tonnes for the outgoing fiscal year. bdne
