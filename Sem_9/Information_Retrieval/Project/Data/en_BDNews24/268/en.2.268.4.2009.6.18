 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir has called two budgetary proposals made by the finance minister "unconstitutional". "The finance minister has proposed separating the revenue and the development expenditure," he said, addressing a budget session in the House on Thursday. "This is against the constitutional guidelines." Alamgir, a former state minister for planning, also criticised a proposal for allocating district-wise budgets. "According to the constitution, Bangladesh has a unitary form of government. So, this too is not consistent with the constitutional guideline," he said. . The MP supported the finance minister's proposal for whitening the black money. But he said the finance minister should slash the allocation for the Anticorruption Commission which "misused" public funds. "The Anticorruption Commission was given Tk 7 crore in the last fiscal year, hiked to Tk 21 crore. "They paid their lawyers salaries higher than those of the president and the chief justice," said Alamgir, who was jailed by the ACC on charges of corruption. Regarding other allocations, he said development expenditure set in the proposed budget was not any higher than that of a decade ago. "Over the last 10 years, non-development expenditure like administrative and military expenditure has gone up while the development budget has come down," said Alamgir, an economics graduate. He also said the government must set the GDP target at 7 percent. "We will never be able to break the cycle of poverty with a proposed target of 5.5 percent," he said. Another Awami League MP, Khan Md Tipu Sultan, in his budget speech proposed forming an economic intelligence unit to be run with defence fund, while Fazle Rabbi Mian favoured higher tax for allowing undisclosed money to be legalised. "The genuine taxpayers pay 25 percent while the black money holders will pay only 10 percent money," said Mian. "This is immoral and I think the tax should be 25 percent," he said. Unlike other days of the current session, MPs on Thursday restricted their speeches to the proposed budget for 2009-10 fiscal year, though most made "free style" deliberations in the name of speeches on the supplementary budget for 2008-09 fiscal and the proposed budget for 2009-10 fiscal. The Jatiya Sangsad has been hearing speeches on the two budgets since June 14. Khaledur Rahman Tito, Sarah Begum Kobori, Enamul Haq, Jubeda Khanam, Ashrafunnesa Mosharraf, M A Mannan and Mir Shawkat Ali Badsha also delivered their budget speeches on Thursday. bdnews
