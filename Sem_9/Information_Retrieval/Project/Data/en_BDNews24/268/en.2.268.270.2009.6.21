<TITLE> Speaker should decide on SQ Chy's seat: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 21 (bdnews24.com)The law minister said Sunday the speaker must decide the fate of BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's seat in the House, rather than the Election Commission, giving rise to further debate on who is authorised to settle the matter. In line with a court ruling, the EC sent a letter to speaker Abdul Hamid last week asking him to take measures against opposition MP Chowdhury for supplying 'false information' about his educational credentials. "I think it is the Speaker who should take action, if any, against [Chowdhury]," law minister Shafique Ahmed said. However, just a day after the EC sent its letter, ruling party MP Suranjit Sengupta said the EC, not the speaker should decide. Suranjit, who also heads the parliamentary standing committee on law, said last Thursday, "The Election Commission must come up with a decision. The speaker has nothing to do in this matter." Shafiq said on Sunday, "The MPs are sworn in by the speaker. If anyone of them falsifies, then I think the speaker is the one who should take measures against them." Suranjit, however, had cited constitution saying the speaker could not decide on cancellation of MPs' seats, it was the EC's jurisdiction. Speaker Hamid himself has said only that he would consider the matter after reading the letter. The EC accuses Chowdhury of violating Section 12 3 (b) of the Representation of the People Order by concealing information about his qualifications. According to the RPO, a candidate for parliamentary elections must divulge specific information, including education, in an affidavit along with nomination papers. Flouting of the rules give grounds for cancellation of candidacy even after election to parliament, says the law. The EC says Chowdhury, a graduate, submitted that he had no degree, and failed to correct the information given despite an extended deadline and a High Court order. Chowdhury, however, has argued that supplying educational credentials is only "a matter of disclosure" and failure to do so does not amount to grounds for dismissal as a sitting MP, according to constitutional law. bdnews2
