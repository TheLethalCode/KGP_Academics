<TITLE> Rich nations must take on climate change onus: UK </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)The global recession must not relegate the need for rich nations to help protect vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh against climate change risks, UK climate envoy Robin Gwynn said on a recent visit to Dhaka. Britain is committed to helping Bangladesh build its defences against those risks, including a focus on "climate resilient livelihoods", said Gwynn in an interview last week. The government's budget proposal on June 11, with a Tk 700 crore allocation for managing climate change risk, coincided with Gwynn's visit as UK climate security envoy for vulnerable countries. He was full of praise for Bangladesh's commitment on tackling climate change impacts. "People, while talking about climate change from the perspective of Bangladesh, usually point to the problems but I want to highlight the strengths, which are, a long term commitment and a proper strategy," observed Gwynn. But the envoy also knows that for vulnerable countries like Bangladesh and many others, the challenges and the dangers remain high and a helping hand is needed. "The UK is committed to helping Bangladesh build cyclone shelters, develop early warning systems and carry out more research,' said the envoy. "We would also like to help in developing and sustaining climate resilient livelihoods." Ahead of the much-discussed Copenhagen Summit later this year, Gwynn is very much optimistic that despite the world recession taking the top spot in the agenda of governments, the importance of tackling climate change will not lose steam. The stakes in Copenhagen are high, he says, with transfer of green technology and reduction of green house gases getting the top spots in discussions. There is also some skepticism over the outcome of the year-end summit since many are of the opinion that a solid agreement, with the global economic downturn still holding sway, is going to be impractical. But Gwynn is more hopeful. "We may not come to a clear agreement but there is always room to work outside negotiations." Role of rich countries Time and again, Robin Gwynn points out that the most vulnerable countries are least responsible for climate change. "And therefore, the responsibility is on the big economies of the world to ensure that potential problems arising from climate change are minimised." Gwynn also points to the unambiguous fact that rich countries, dependent on raw materials that they import from vulnerable countries, also stand to lose if the climate change risks are not dealt with expediently. "The UK believes that since the vulnerable countries did not cause the problem they can unite and exert pressure for concrete steps," he adds. Referring to the necessity of innovative technology, he mentioned 'floating gardens' as are seen in Bangladesh, but also reiterated the need to carry on more research to come up with groundbreaking innovations. "'In the UK, a  1.4 billion initiative looks towards low energy insulation of houses which will not only reduce carbon emissions but will also generate much needed employment during this time of economic hardships." No longer a 'distant threat' Talking about a visible lethargy and apathy shown by many in dealing with the issue, Robin Gwynn said, "For a long time, many countries regarded climate change problem as a 'distant threathappening to someone else'." "On the contrary, it's an immediate problem." Gwynn said he draws hope from the recent G-20 summit where a clear commitment was made to move towards measures that would result in low carbon emitting econom
