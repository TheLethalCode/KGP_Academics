 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)Top-level officials of government departments will be held accountable for public sector corruption, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Saturday. "Corruption tends to take place at lower levels due to negligence of seniors." "There will be less scope for corruption if those at the top monitor properly and remain vigilant," the minister told reporters after a workshop on implementation of the UN anticorruption charter. The top tiers of the administration would be given directives and guidelines to check all forms of corruption in respective departments, said Shafique. The minister was forced to admit, however, that the dire picture of public sector corruption includes graft at the highest levels. "Many high profile officials including engineers, forest conservators, and so on, have been convicted or confessed to the Truth Commission, its true." But these senior public servants must be held accountable for all incidents of corruption that take place in their departments, not just their own, said the minister. Regarding the argument that better pay could also reduce graft among public officials, Shafique said, "A change in mentality, not just a salary hike, is needed to really check corruption." He said, the active cooperation of all would be needed as the law cannot work alone. The workshop on 'Implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)' was jointly hosted by the law ministry BRAC University's Institute of Governance Studies. State minister for home Kamrul Islam, German envoy to Bangladesh Frank Mayke, BRAC University vice chancellor Saleh Uddin Ahmed also spoke. b
