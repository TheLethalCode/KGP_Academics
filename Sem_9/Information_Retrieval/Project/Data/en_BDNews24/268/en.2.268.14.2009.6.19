 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)It seems the West Indies will not fly home wondering if they are to fall at the semi-final stage. Sri Lanka's spin pair of 'Magic' Ajantha Mendis and wily Muttiah Muralitharan may have taken a grip on the World Twenty20, but their opponents at the Brit Oval on Friday have little intention of poking around in deference. "We want to get on top of them early so that their captain has to take them off and bring them back later," Denesh Ramdin, the West Indies vice-captain, was quoted as saying by the media. "It is very rare you get two world-class slow bowlers in the same side, but our plan is to get on top of them as soon as they come on." The contest mirrors the first semi-final at Trent Bridge on Thursday, with one side (Sri Lanka) unbeaten to date and the other defying the odds to get this far. They met in the first phase, when Tillekeratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya put on 124 for the first wicket in a winning total of 192. But West Indies have happy memories of the Oval, where Chris Gayle  who did not play in that first match  hit 88 not out from 50 balls in the game against Australia. It was at the Oval, too, that West Indies won the Champions Trophy in near darkness in September 2004. The head-to-head between Gayle and Dilshan, whose "Dilscoop" shot, flipped straight over his head, has been the biggest innovation of the tournament, will capture the imagination. But the task of the Sri Lanka openers will be easier if Fidel Edwards, who missed training yesterday, fails to recover from a back injury.
