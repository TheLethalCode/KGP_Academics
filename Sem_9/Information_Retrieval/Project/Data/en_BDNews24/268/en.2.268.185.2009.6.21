 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar said he will consider whether to appear before a parliamentary body investigating graft allegations against him "after receiving the letter". "I am yet to receive the letter. I will decide after receiving it," Sircar told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Speaker Abdul Hamid formed the all-party parliamentary probe committee, on Mar 19, in the face of demands made by sitting MPs to investigate alleged corruption during the eighth parliament. Fazle Rabbi Mian, heading the probe body, has accused Sircar of corruption including embezzlement of money. The committee decided to summon Sircar, his deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to appear before it on June 27. Officials of the parliament secretariat said the letter was sent to Sircar on Sunday by special messenger. Sircar said he would consider appearing before the committee "if the tone of the letter was proper". "I have the highest regard for parliamentary democracy and the parliamentary committee system. But they should keep in view that the image of parliament and the speaker should not be tarnished," said Sircar. "They should not act in any manner which would be detrimental to the prestige of parliament and the speaker." bd
