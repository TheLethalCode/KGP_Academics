 Dhaka, June 17 (bdnews24.com)A Naogaon court on Wednesday granted former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui bail in a sedition case, clearing way for his release from jail, his lawyer said. There is no legal bar in his release from jail now as Hamid secured bail in all the cases, Khairul Alam Helal said. He earlier secured bail in two fraud and an abduction cases from the same court of district and sessions judge Habibur Rahman. The High Court ordered the detention order under Special Powers Act against the ex-deputy speaker illegal, his lawyers said. Hamid was arrested on March 21 at his Mahadebpur house in Naogaon.
