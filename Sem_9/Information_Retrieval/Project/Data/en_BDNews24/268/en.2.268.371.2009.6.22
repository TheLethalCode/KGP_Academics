 RUSTENBURG, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. came from a near impossible position to claim a Confederations Cup semi-final berth on Sunday, hammering Egypt 3-0 and profiting from an equally heavy defeat for Italy at the end of the group matches. In a dramatic finale to Group B, the U.S. went through in second place on more goals scored than world champions Italy, who lost 3-0 to Brazil in Pretoria. The U.S. finished with a goal difference of minus two along with the Italians but scored four goals in the group to Italy's three. The Americans now play Spain in the first semi-final on Wednesday. Egypt were last in the standings with a goal difference of minus three. It was an amazing comeback by the U.S., made almost surreal by a crowd seemingly oblivious of the unfolding permutations.

A scrambled goal by Charlie Davies in the 21st minute gave the U.S. a deserved half-time lead after a busy opening period but they entered the field for the second half with extra vigour, having learnt that Brazil were 3-0 up on Italy. The Americans, who suffered two harsh dismissals in their two previous matches, must have thought their hard luck was continuing when the New Zealand referee Michael Hester waved away appeals after a shot from Jozy Altidore was clearly handled off the line by Hani Said six minutes into the second half. But they continued to press forward and captain Landon Donovan dragged a square pass into the path of Michael Bradley for the second goal, at the culmination of a move that the Americans had started in their half. The 63rd-minute strike was followed eight minutes later by a third and decisive goal as Clint Dempsey got his head to a cross from Jonathan Spector. Egypt threatened rarely after that and looked a pale shadow of the team that had beaten Italy on Thursday and narrowly lost to Brazil in a seven-goal thriller last Monday. The absence of injured striker Mohamed Zidan proved costly although the African champions did have the early initiative, including a bizarre goalmouth scramble in the 13th minute when the ball ricocheted around as if in a pinball mach
