 BISHKEK, Jun 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Kyrgyzstan have signed a deal for US forces to continue using an air base which Washington considers vital for its operations in Afghanistan, a Kyrgyz parliamentarian said Tuesday. Kyrgyzstan's parliament, dominated by deputies loyal to President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, would start reviewing the deal on the Manas air base near the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek later on Tuesday, said the deputy, Kabai Karabekov. "The agreement was signed yesterday," he said. In February, former-Soviet Kyrgyzstan said it would shut the base outside the capital Bishkek by August after securing pledges of $2 billion in aid and credit from Russia, which operates its own air base in the mainly Muslim Central Asian country. Bakiyev said at the time that the US refused to pay a higher rent for using the air base. A government source told Reuters earlier Tuesday that under the new deal, annual rent for using Manas will increase to $60 million from $17.4 million. Bakiyev has also said Kyrgyzstan was ready to transit non-military cargo to Afghanistan but it was unclear if the new deal imposed any limitations on the type of cargo. Manas is home to about 1,000 US personnel and serves as a key refuelling point for aircraft used in military operations in nearby Afghanistan
