 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - The courts should not be involved with the issue of the 1971 independence proclamation, BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed said Sunday, terming it a "sensitive issue". "Where there are politics and emotion involved, in such a sensitive issue, nothing should be said," Moudud stated in reaction to a High Court ruling that said Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, not Ziaur Rahman, proclaimed Bangladesh's independence in 1971. The court also ordered the annulment of the third volume of Bangladesher Swadhinata Juddho Dalilpatra Bangladesh (Liberation War Documents) that presents Ziaur Rahman, a major in the Pakistan army at the time, as the "declarer of independence". The verdict, given on a public interest litigation by freedom fighter MA Salam, said those who were involved in such distortion of history had violated the constitution and the government could take punitive measures against them. It directed the government to ensure "true history" in textbooks at all levels. "By reviewing national and international newspapers and other documents, the court has established the truth that it was Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who proclaimed independence," additional attorney general M Inayetur Rahim told bdnews24.com after the verdict. "This verdict has washed away the long time plot to distort history by anti-liberation groups," he said. The writ petitioner Salam said, "The truth has won. Now the next generation will know the true history of the proclamation of independence." Moudud said after the verdict: "BNP believes Ziaur Rahman did proclaim independence." "The beliefs and emotions of BNP leaders and supporters have to be taken into account," he said. b
