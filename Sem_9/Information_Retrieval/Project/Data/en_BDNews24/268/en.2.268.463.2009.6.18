"He has been very good for us throughout the tournament," said captain Chris Gayle. "He's the sort of bowler who can actually win you games, he can get crucial wickets at crucial times." West Indies have traditionally performed well at the Oval where they can usually count on a large contingent of enthusiastic supporters. Gayle struck 88 from 50 balls in the opening match of their campaign when they defeated Australia. "It's a good wicket and a fast outfield and the environment has been really brilliant with the supporters," Gayle said.
