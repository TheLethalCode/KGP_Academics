<TITLE> Undisclosed does not mean black: FBCCI chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 22 (bdnews24.com)In the face of volleys of criticism for backing the government's proposed 'money whitening' scheme, the head of the country's top trade body attempted to draw a line on Monday between 'black money' and 'undisclosed income". "Police chase criminal money whereas the revenue board chases undisclosed income. We have never advocated for whitening black money, but we back the legalising of undisclosed income," Annisul Huq, the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries president, told reporters, "Black money is generated through the black-market, smuggling, kickbacks, corruption and criminal activities, while undisclosed income is money earned legally but untaxed," Huq said. In an unprecedented measure, the government in its proposed budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year has proposed a lengthy three-year amnesty to draw previously undisclosed income into 42 crucial investment sectors, setting only a 10 percent tax. Finance minister AMA Muhith, however, said in his budget speech that "no questions would be asked" about the source of any undisclosed income, giving rise to concerns about illegal earnings. The proposal as a whole has sparked heated debate among the country's business community, economists, public and media. While the FBCCI has welcomed the move, other leading business groupings, including stock exchanges, chambers, industry bodies and associations of bankers have opposed it. On Sunday, 11 trade bodies in a joint statement said such move would frustrate over seven lakh honest tax payers. Huq on Monday termed black money "sin money". He said business leaders, in pre-budget discussions with the government, had proposed allowing undisclosed income to be legalised by giving scope to invest in specific productive sectors or through purchase of government bonds. Huq said 42 sectors may be excessive, however, and could be revised down to 20 to 25 sectors. He also proposed three categories of seven-year bonds at 7 percent interest as an "alternate solution" for resolving the problem of legalising undisclosed income. bdnews2
