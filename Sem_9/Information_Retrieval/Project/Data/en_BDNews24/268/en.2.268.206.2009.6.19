<TITLE> Vast crowd gathers for Khamenei sermon in Tehran </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Fri Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Iranians streamed toward Tehran University on Friday to hear Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei address the nation for the first time since a disputed election result sparked the biggest street protests in the Islamic Republic's 30-year history. (EDITORS' NOTE: Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to report, film or take pictures in Tehran.) Khamenei has urged Iranians to unite behind hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but supporters of defeated candidate Mirhossein Mousavi have so far ignored the call, holding huge rallies in defiance of an official ban. People chanting slogans and holding posters of Khamenei, Ahmadinejad, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, the father of the 1979 Islamic revolution, packed streets outside the university where the supreme leader was to deliver a Friday prayer sermon. At least one police helicopter hovered overhead. "Ahmadinejad has been our president for four years, and during this time he has always told the truth to our people," said Javid Abbasirad, 48, outside the university gates. At the same venue, hundreds of university students had demonstrated in support of Mousavi on Sunday, hurling stones are riot police trying to disperse protesters outside the gates. ANTI-WESTERN SLOGANS Some of the crowd waiting to hear Khamenei were draped in Iranian flags. Others held placards with anti-Western slogans. "Don't let the history of Iran be written with the pen of foreigners," one flyer said, reflecting official Iranian anger at international criticism of the post-election violence. A group of clerics and citizens left the holy city of Qom for a 150 km (100 mile) walk to Tehran in a show of support for Khamenei, state radio and television reported. Khamenei's speech follows six days of protests by Mousavi supporters. On Thursday, tens of thousands of black-clad marchers bore candles to mourn those killed in earlier rallies. The protests are the largest and most widespread since the revolution in Iran, the world's fifth biggest oil exporter, which is also at odds with the West over its nuclear program. Iranian state media has reported seven or eight people killed in protests since the election results were published on June 13. Scores of reformists have been arrested and authorities have cracked down on both foreign and domestic media. Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi said about 500 people had been arrested in the last week, and called for their unconditional release. She said Iran should hold new elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Opposition politician Ebrahim Yazdi, who was detained while in hospital on Wednesday for medical checks, was released the next day, a source close to him said. Yazdi, who heads the banned Freedom Movement, was foreign minister in a transitional government after the revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah, but was sidelined by hardliners. Mousavi, a moderate who advocates better ties with the West, has also called for the election to be annulled, saying pledges by the country's top legislative body, the Guardian Council, to recount some disputed ballot boxes did not go far enough. The 12-man council of clerics has invited Mousavi and two other defeated candidates to talks on Saturday, and says it has begun "careful examination" of 646 complaints. Objections include a shortage of ballot papers, pressure on voters to support a particular candidate, and the barring of candidates' representatives from polling stations. Iran has denounced foreign criticism of the election, although U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has muted its comments to keep the door ajar for possible dialogue. BLOODIED FACES At Thursday's rally, protesters packed a Tehran square, responding to Mousavi's call for people to gather in mosques or demonstrate peacefully to show solidarity with the families of those killed or wounded in earlier protests. They held photographs of those killed, some showing bloodied faces, apparently taken after they died. "Our martyred brothers we will take back your votes," read one placard. "Why did you kill our brothers?" said another. Other banners told protesters to stay home on Friday, when Ahmadinejad supporters are expected to show their strength at Khamenei's Friday prayers, but to gather again the next day. Mousavi supporters say he will be joined on Saturday by reformist former President Mohammad Khatami and another defeated candidate, liberal cleric Mehdi Karoubi. Ahmadinejad has defended the legitimacy of the vote, telling a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that 25 million of 40 million voters had approved the way he was running the country. The semi-official Fars news agency said two children of powerful cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who backs Mousavi and clashed with Ahmadinejad during campaigning, had been barred from leaving Iran. Rafsanjani's daughter Faezeh addressed Mousavi supporters on Tuesday. Hardline students called for her and her brother, Mehdi, to be arre
