<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP has proposed that the government include five independent experts in its team to visit the Tipaimukh dam site in India this month. "If the government accepts the proposal we will join the parliamentary team," opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farrouque said at a media briefing on Sunday at the parliament building. The government has formed a 10-member parliamentary delegation headed by ruling Awami League MP and former water resources minister Abdur Razzak. The five experts proposed by BNP are Dr Ainun Nishat, Dr Mustafizur Rahman Tarafder, Dr MA Rob, former water resources secretary M Asafuddoula and Dhaka University law professor Asif Nazrul. "The visit will be fruitless without experts in the delegation," he said. "It is not possible on our part to join the delegation without the inclusion of experts," the opposition chief whip said. "The dam will be a death trap for Bangladesh just like the Farakka dam. The northeastern region will turn into desert if the dam is constructed," Farroque observed. He was unhappy with the government for not protesting against the construction of the dam. The parliamentary standing committee on water resources sent BNP a letter seeking a representative to the delegation. Farrouque said, "We want to assist the government on rational issues. We agree to join the delegation if a neutral expert team is there." Among others BNP MPs Nazrul Islam Manju, Shahiduddin CHowdhury Anny and Mahbubuddin Khokan were present. b
