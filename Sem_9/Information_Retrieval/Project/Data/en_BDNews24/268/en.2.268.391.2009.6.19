 NEW DELHI, Fri Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is failing to enforce a ban on child labour, with not a single conviction almost three years after the law came into effect, leading child rights activists said on Friday. More than 12 million children below the age of 14 are working as domestic servants or other jobs such as in stone quarries, embroidery units, mining, carpet-weaving, tea stalls, restaurants and hotels, according to government data.

Priya Subramanian, communications manager for Save the Children India, said problems in identifying the age of children was another reason why there were no convictions. "Many of the children are from rural areas and have no formal identification and so the onus is often not on the employers as they just plead innocent," said Subramanian. Authorities say results from the recent ban will not come overnight.
