 Grahame Lucas Head of South Asia service, Deutsche Welle Singapore, June 19 (bdnews24.com)BroadcastAsia has been a trade fair of superlatives since it was established in Singapore back in 1996. It is the showcase of the region's digital multimedia and entertainment technology industry and a magnet for companies and investors alike. But the downturn in the world economy  triggered by the collapse of the subprime mortgage business in the U.S. last autumn  has left its mark on this year's three-day show The usual marketing hype that surrounds trade fairs of the magnitude of BroadcastAsia cannot be overheard or ignored at the Singapore Expo with its impressive futuristic buildings just outside the city's busy international airport. The press handouts are full of optimistic analyses about the future of the world economy and the media industry in particular. Anyone who doesn't seize the opportunity offered by the digital revolution, risks missing the boat. That's the core message. But enough of marketing-speak. The reality of this year's BroadcastAsia is different. Although the organizers can boast 647 exhibiting companies with 85 percent of them coming from abroad, including Germany, there has been a 16 percent drop in exhibition space sold compared with last year. Around 10,000 media professionals have come, but that is also lower than in previous years. For many the trip to Singapore this year was just too expensive, the chance of closing deals just too small. At the German stand Michael Henkel from S4M, a specialist company providing state-of-the-art technical solutions such as video systems for TV stations, says the downturn in the world economy has hurt the media industry badly. But he points out that it is vital for his company to be here to show the flag and to speak with potential buyers. If a company stays away from the Asian market for too long, he says, people will lose interest in its products. His company is confident 2010 will be better. A view shared incidentally by one of Germany's leading research organizations, the Fraunhofer Institute. They have come to BroadcastAsia for the first time this year. Stephan Gick, is looking for license partners for a so-called point of view high definition camera developed by Fraunhofer. His expectations are low, but he is encouraged by the interest that the camera, which is used on-board in racing cars, is creating in Asia. By the way, Fraunhofer is the organization that gave the world MP3 technology, now the worldwide standard for audio. At most of the other stands the mood is similar. Sales may be sluggish, but the pace of innovation remains high. Rosemary Tan of the giant Sony Corporation underlined that point when she announced that her company expects entertainment media technology to converge rapidly in the next five years. Sony plans to start making Hollywood blockbusters available for mobile TV and online. Classic movies, now known as retro-content, would also be on offer. Consumers, she says, will be able to choose episodes ranging for instance from 3-5 minutes up to full-length depending on the time they have available. On-demand, she told media experts, was key. Sony aims to provide entertainment content to consumers whenever they want it, wherever they are. Sony expects massive sales of a new generation of mobile TV devices in the near future. It sounds great, but will it happen? At the moment that is anyone's guess. As far as radio is concerned, experts in Singapore continued to discuss the merits of digital radio, especially those of the DAB and DRM format with the opportunities it offers to provide a broad range of digital content. But the high price of sets and receivers continues to hold back a technology that everyone agrees has a great deal of promise but has yet to show real signs of sweeping analogue radio off the market. Not surprisingly therefore everyone wants an answer to the million dollar question. Where will the media industry be in five or ten years' time? The conventional wisdom here among the experts is that the overall size of the media market will remain constant with traditional broadcasters continuing to lose market share. Markets will fragment more and more with new niches opening up for specialist content. Competition will increase because of the low cost of market entry via the internet in the digital age. TV, radio and mobile will increasingly look to the internet as a platform or an access point for their services. And there will be more consumer-generated content and consumer interaction via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. David Astley of the Asia Broadcasting Union comments that traditional broadcasters have to face up to this challenge. Broadcasters would, he said, have to provide many new services to increasing numbers of niche markets, a phenomenon he terms "narrowcasting". Across the road at the Expo in Singapore CommunicAsia is the shop window trade fair for consumer electronics in Asia. There the mood is somewhat brighter as young people flocking in to see the latest in handheld phone technology. And Yahoo is right on cue. The internet giant has created a stir here with a webportal for mobile telephone users which allows consumers easy access to a wide range of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The promise of new mobile phones with larger screens and better powerpacks, with ability to use the internet or view movies over longer periods of time is pulling in the crowds. Judging by the interest here, for a lot of people, the recession cannot end fast eno
