<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta has said the speaker cannot determine if the BNP's Salauddin Quader Chowdhury will lose his parliament membership. He said the Election Commission must settle the dispute on the Chowdhury's membership as per its rules. "The Election Commission must come up with a decision. The speaker has nothing to do with this matter," Sengupta told reporters at the media centre of the Jatiya Sangsad on Thursday. The commission on Wednesday sent a letter to the parliament secretariat seeking speaker's opinion on vacating the parliamentary seat of Chowdhury for allegedly hiding academic qualification in the affidavit filed with his nomination paper for the Dec 29 general elections. "The commission must go by its rules as the law has clear direction in this regard." He said all the MPs but one had abided by the law. "The Election Commission should take measures for violation of the law," he said. According to the Representation of the People Order, a contestant must file eight personal information, including his educational qualifications in the affidavit along with the nomination papers. Flouting of the rule amounts to cancellation of the membership even if the contestant wins in the polls, stipulates the law. Election Commission says Chowdhury, a graduate, has mentioned that he had no educational qualification.
