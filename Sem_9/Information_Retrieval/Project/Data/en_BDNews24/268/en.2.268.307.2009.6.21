 Jenaidah, June 20 (bdnews24.com)An ousted student activist was arrested after an attack on the home of Abdul Hai MP at his Jenaidah-1 constituency on Saturday night, said police. Two groups of a local Chhatro League unit were involved in clashes earlier in the day, said district superintendent of police Rezaul Karim. One of those involved, Ripon, who was previously expelled from the Awami League-backed student wing, was picked up in connection with the attack on Hai's Arappur residence, said Karim. The attackers threw bricks at the house and vandalised three motorbikes parked in front at around 10.30pm, said the superintendent. Hai could not be reached for comment. bdn
