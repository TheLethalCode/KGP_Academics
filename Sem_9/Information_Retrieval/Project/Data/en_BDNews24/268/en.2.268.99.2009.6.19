 Savar, June 19 (bdnews24.com)A man was reportedly burnt to death as a blaze engulfed a sweater factory at Gonokbari in Savar early on Friday. The dead, 32-year old Mamunur Rashid, was an assistant manager at Intraco Sweaters Ltd. Mamun was the son of Sirjul Islam of Kabla village under Kachua Upazila in Chandpur. Ashulia police chief Monowar Hossain told bdnews24.com, "The charred body of Mamun was recovered after the fire had been brought under control." Production manager Yunus Miah said Mamun was the nephew of the factory owner Mujibur Rahman. No-one in the factory knew about Mamun's stay in the factory at night, he added. Goods and machinery worth Tk 10 crore were damaged, Yunus claimed. The flames ensued from the finishing section on the second floor of Intraco Sweaters Ltd at around 5am, on-duty security guard Abdul Matin told bdnews24.com. Around 11,000 machinery, readymade sweaters and goods including furniture were burnt in the fire, said Yunus. Twelve firefighting units from Savar, Dhaka Export Processing Zone, Dhaka, Tongi and Gazipur rushed to the scene. "No one called us, we came out seeing the bellowing smoke," said Apurba Bal, station officer of DEPZ Fire Service. The damage was greater because of scarce supply of water, he said. The factory was working until 12am and Tk 1.5 crore goods were supposed to be delivered within one or two days, said Mia, the factory production manager. Abdur Rashid, deputy director of Dhaka division of Fire Service and Civil Defence, said that it could be a short-circuit or some workers might have forgotten to unplug the electric line to iron clothes after work. Other installations did not catch fire, said Matiur Rahman, president of the shop-owners association of Hashem Plaza that houses the sweater factory. Traffic on Dhaka-Tangail highway remained blocked for two hours from 5 to 7am because of the incident, said Monwar Hossain, officer-in-charge of Ashulia Police Station. bdnews
