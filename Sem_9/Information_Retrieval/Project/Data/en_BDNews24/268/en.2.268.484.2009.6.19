<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)Unknown gunmen picked a ward-level BNP leader from his Mohammedpur home in the capital before killing him early on Friday. Sub-inspector Afzal Hossain of Mohammadpur Police Station told bdnews24.com that the body of Manjur Morshed Shipu, 41, with a bullet in the head was found at 4am on the eastern fringe of the Eidgah ground. Shipu was a resident at house 24/8, block 'F', Mohammadpur Joint Quarters. On return home Thursday night at 11pm, while Shipu was parking his car, some unknown men got down from a microbus waiting outside, dragged him forcibly on to their vehicle and drove away, Hossain said. He said they assumed that Shipu might have been murdered at around 3am. His family has not lodged any complaint until 11am. Shipu is on the list of gangsters made by the Mohammadpur police, he added. Anwar Hossain, a BNP leader of Mohammadpur, told bdnews24.com that Shipu, an active member of BNP, was the general secretary of ward 44 BNP unit, who aspired to be elected ward commissioner. Hossain, however, could not say who might have killed Shipu. "My brother returned on Thursday night around 10:45pm with his wife," Alamgir Morshed, Shipu's elder brother, told bdnews24.com. "While he was parking his car, some six or seven armed persons approached him and said they'd like to have a word. "Then they forcibly dragged him along, onto their microbus and drove away." The security guards of both Shipu's house and those at his neighbour's saw that the strange abductors, a mix of young and middle-aged persons, were carrying arms. The gang had closely cropped hair on top, Morshed added. Shipu's body bore marks of assault and his left forehead a bullet wound. AKM Shafiuzzaman Khair, forensic expert at Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue, declined to perform the autopsy of Shipu's corpse without an inquest conducted by a magistrate. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and others went to the hospital at noon to pay their respects. bdnew
