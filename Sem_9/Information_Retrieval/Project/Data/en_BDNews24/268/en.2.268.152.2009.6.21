The arrests of members of the Mujahideen Khalq Organisation (MKO) were announced after unrest across Tehran on Saturday as demonstrators protesting against the official results of Iran's June 12 election clashed with riot police. Police had deployed in force, firing teargas, using batons and water cannon to disperse groups of several hundred Iranians who had gathered across the capital on Saturday. Sunday's television report, which did not directly mention the election or the unrest, said the arrested MKO members entered Iran after receiving training in neighbouring Iraq. It said they were guided by the MKO's "operation room" in Britain.

It did not say how many people were arrested or when
