 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)The government plans to operate high-speed electric trains between Dhaka and Chittagong, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told parliament on Thursday. He said the government would launch the high-speed train service on a priority basis on completion of a project feasibility study. The government also had plans for Bangladesh's inclusion in the Trans Asian Railway, said Hossain. The cabinet last week also gave the nod to Bangladesh's long-debated link to the Asian Highway Network. A March 9 cabinet meeting approved the proposal for ratifying the 'Inter Governmental Agreement on the Trans Asian Railway Network', said the minister. Three rail routes have been proposed, the minister said Route 1: Gede (India)-Darshana-Ishardi-Bangabandhu Bridge-Joydevpur-Tongi-Akhaura-Chittagong-Dohajari-Gundum (Myanmer border) (Sub-route-1 Tongi-Dhaka. Sub-route-2 Akhaura-Kulaura-Shahbajpur) Route-2: Singabad (India)-Rohanpur-Rajshahi-Abdulpur-Ishardi) Route-3: Radiakapur (India) Biral-Dinajpur-Pabartipur- Abdulpur-Ishardi. The minister said the government also had plans for making train ticket purchases easier by mobile phone including travel information by SMS. Elevated expressway route The capital's transport plans included the long-proposed elevated expressway, given the nod the previous day, he said. The cabinet committee on economic affairs gave the communications ministry the go-ahead on Wednesday to start construction of the expressway to rid Dhaka of traffic gridlock. In answer to MP's questions, the minister said the planned elevated expressway in the first phase would stretch from the old airport to Shanir Akhra covering Farmgate-Sonargaon Hotel-Kawran Bazar-Mogbazar-Malibag level crossing. In the second phase, it would stretch from areas adjacent of Sonargaon Hotel to Sayedabad covering Sonargaon Road-Katabon-Tilkatuli. In the third and final stage, it would stretch from the Old Airport to Uttara covering New Airport Square. In answer to other questions on Thursday, the minister said the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway expansion project would begin in December and was expected to end by 2013. bdnew
