 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) Commerce minister Faruq Khan has promised action against people who distorted and invented history of the independence war. "The government will take steps against anti-liberation forces and those involved in the distortion of the history," he said at the two-day children's cultural show to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Bangabandhu Shishu Academy at the Shishu Academy auditorium on Friday. Already, steps have been taken to try the war criminals, he said. "We would not have had an independent country if there were no Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujubar Rahman." He urged the children to grow with the intelligence, foresight and courage of Sheikh Mujib. "The history of the liberation war has been distorted for many years. Those who have done it while knowing the true history are deliberate sinners. They cannot live in this country," ruling Awami League chief whip Abdus Shahid said. He put emphasis on establishing Bangabandhu Shishu Academy in each district. "The country will move ahead if the children can be raised as citizens with good mentality," said Prof AFM Arefin Siddique, vice-chancellor of Dhaka University. "We say many things which we do not believe. In this respect we will have to be more careful as guardians. "Besides, we will have to increase investment on children. This investment is not of money only. It can be energy, assets and time," he said. The children's festival started through a rally begun from the Mukta Mancha of Shishu Academy and went round the Doyel Chattar. An art competition followed. Prof SM Nazrul Islam, former vice-chancellor of Khulna University, and Marks Group chairman Abdur Rauf were among those present. b
