<TITLE> Salahuddin 'offered' SAFF presidency </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin has been unofficially offered the SAFF (South Asian Football Federation) presidency. Manilal Fernando, the vice-president of the Asian Football Confederation and FIFA development officer, made the proposal on behalf of the other seven SAFF countries when Salahuddin visited Sri Lanka. BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi said that the BFF president had accepted the offer as Manilal discussed the matter with the members of SAFF during the FIFA congress in Bahamas early this month. Sadi, however, said that the final decision would be taken at the SAFF meeting in July. Salahuddin told reporters by phone on Sunday that he would bring a great change in the regional organisation if he was elected SAFF president. He also said that if elected he would introduce under-19s, women's and club-level competitions in addition to the current men's competition to give an international shape to the regional competitions. Meanwhile, Salahuddin was critical of the existing committee headed by Nepal Football Association president Ganesh Thapa and BFF member Sirajul Islam Bachchu (general secretary of the SAFF committee) during the AFC congress in Kuala Lumpur last month. Thapa and Bacchu have been in the helm since 2000 and could hardly manage to organise a SAFF Championship regularly. bd
