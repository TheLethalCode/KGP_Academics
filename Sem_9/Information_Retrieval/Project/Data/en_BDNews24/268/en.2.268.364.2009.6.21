 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Olympic Association vice-president Mizanur Rahman Manu on Sunday has charged CEO and director Col (retd) Wali Ullah of behaving like an 'autocrat' after being not invited to a BOA official press conference on the 'Olympic Day 2009.' Manu, convenor of the 2009 Olympic Day organising committee, was supposed to preside over the conference, but he arrived at the end of the programme and alleged that he was not informed about the revised scheduled despite Wali Ullah talking to him in the morning. The press conference was originally scheduled to start at 5:00pm as per decision taken by the organising committee, but later it was brought forward to 2:30pm without the committee's consent and he was not informed, said Manu. Minutes after the press conference ended, an angry Manu asked BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed why he was not informed about the revised scheduled that also followed a scuffle between two groups before others calmed them down. The BOA vice-president also exchanged heated words with Wali Ullah, who many believe selected his favourites for different national federations during the tenure of the military-backed caretaker government. Manu, the former Awami League whip, later alleged that Wali Ullah ignored to execute decisions made by the different sub-committees, but could favour those whom he liked. The organiser said that the committee had decided to print 20,000 T- shirts for the participants, but it was reduced to 15,000 without consulting the committee. He also alleged that the BOA CEO set an agenda for the BOA members in its executive meeting on how to behave with the BOA officials and its staff as well as he allotted the training fund more to those whom he liked. Manu also alleged that the officials of the different federations could not speak in fear of him. Manu finally said that he was asked to refrain from playing politics by the BOA president when he raised the matter of Wali Ullah's autocracy in its executive meeting. What happened here was an 'indecent' incident, said BOA general secretary Kutubuddin Ahmed adding that he (Manu) was supposed to be informed and we would investigate the matter. "If anyone is found guilty, we will take action," said Ahmed, but defended Wali Ullah saying: "Dictatorship is a vague term as the BOA is run by the professionals. We all are working here as volunteers and the CEO has a role, but if he overrules, it is bad." Meanwhile, the BOA will observe the Olympic Day 2009 on June 23 in the capital as well as five other divisional headquarters in Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi and Barisal. bd
