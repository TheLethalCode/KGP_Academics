<TITLE> Barua blames CG for 'build up of black money' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Industries minister Dilip Barua claimed Wednesday that the past caretaker government's anticorruption drive caused a build-up of black money as businessmen had run scared for two years. "Undisclosed income has been created. Thousands of millions of taka are now undisclosed which must be retrieved," said Barua. But, he said black money should be allowed only into the industrial sector by imposing a 35 to 40 percent tax. The proposed budget has outlined a three-year provision for legalising undeclared income, with 'no questions asked', by payment of 10 percent tax and investment in one of 42 sectors including the stock market, infrastructure and start-up industries. The question was not now a matter of "black versus white", but whether a vast amount of undisclosed income could be made productive, said Barua of the national debate sparked by the government's 'money-whitening' offer. Barua was speaking at a post-budget discussion at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Advisers to the past caretaker government AB Mirza Azizul Islam and Hossain Zillur Rahman were also present in the seminar. Former finance adviser Mirza Azizul focused on the power crisis. "System loss in the power sector is very high now. The caretaker government added 450 MW to the national grid. Load shedding occurred for about 2 hours a day at that time, but now it is 6 hours." Azizul called on the government to explain the increased system loss. Former commerce adviser Hossain Zillur was more positive. "We should consider how we can gain most from our internal resources, as it is a country of around 150 million people." He said initiatives might be taken to build a dynamic SME foundation. "Success cannot be achieved if we cannot coordinate commerce, industries and skills enhancement," he added. He advised to upgrading the BGMEA Institute of Fashion and Technology to a university to increase the skilled work force in the one of the country's largest industries. In the proposed budget, import duty on raw materials has been lowered from 7 to 5 percent. But, advance tax and VAT (ATV) will rise from 1.50 to 2.25 percent. Acting president of DCCI MS Shakil Chowdhury recommended keeping ATV as before and said corporate tax must also be decreased to reduce undisclosed income in the economy. He suggested curbing diesel and furnace oil prices for the sake of industrialisation and taking initiatives to develop poor industries. Dilip Barua said this year's budget was more industry-friendly compared to past budgets. Mirza Azizul said, "The budget should not only be industry and business friendly, but also people friendly which is not seen in this budget." bd
