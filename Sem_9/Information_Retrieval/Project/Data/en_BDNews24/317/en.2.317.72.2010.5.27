 LENS, France, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mathieu Valbuena celebrated his first cap by giving a new-look France side a 2-1 win over Costa Rica in a World Cup warm-up on Wednesday.

Just back from a week-long training camp in the French Alps, France now cross the Mediterranean sea to play Tunisia before meeting China in the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
