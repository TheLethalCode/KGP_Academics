 LONDON, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jonathan Trott completed a double century on his Lord's Test debut on Friday to help England to a daunting first innings 505 on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh. Trott became the seventh England player to score a double hundred at Lord's and his 226 in over eight hours at the crease put him third behind Graham Gooch (333) and Walter Hammond (240).

After the interval Shahadat Hossain, who had bowled with undiminished enthusiasm during a dispiriting first day for the visitors, ran through the tail with three wickets from 21 deliveries. The paceman finished with five for 98 to become the first Bangladesh player to earn a place on the Lord's honours' board. Graeme Swann provided some overdue entertainment with 22 from 13 balls, putting the bowling into some sort of perspective with two fours and two sixes. Tamim Iqbal, who left the field for treatment to his injured left wrist after taking a nasty tumble on the boundary rope attempting to cut off a four, took his position at the top of the Bangladesh batting order and showed his attacking intentions immediately. He took a brace of fours off Tim Bresnan and alternated some airy swishes with spanking drives to reach 42 at the interval with six boundaries. The half-century partnership with Imrul Kayes (22 not out) took an even 50 min
