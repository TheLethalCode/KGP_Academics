 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology students blocked the road from Palashi market through Azimpur crossing on Thursday morning after a fellow student was crushed under a bus. The students are reported to have damaged about a dozen vehicles, including setting fire to four buses. At 3pm the students withdrew the blockade, saying that they will form a human chain on Saturday pressing for three demands. These are the cancellation of the licence of the bus company Winner Paribahan, compensation to the family and curbs on the movement of heavy traffic on the roads of Dhaka University and BUET campuses Nineteen-year-old Khondaker Khan Jahan Samrat, a first-year student of BUET's mechanical engineering department and a resident of Ahsanullah Hall, was run over by the bus around 8:30am in front of Eden College in Azimpur, said Sayeed Ibne Siddique, assistant sub-inspector of Lalbagh Police Station. A college staff member rushed him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the duty doctor declared him dead, he said. Samrat's sister Shammi Akhter said her brother was supposed to go to her place in Mirpur on Thursday and was waiting for a Mirpur-bound bus in Azimpur when the incident took place. Samrat's body will be taken to the home district in Gopalganj, Shammi said. The namaj-e-janaza of Samrat was held in the BUET mosque. Police officer Sayeed said they had seized the bus of Winner Paribahan but the driver managed to flee. bdne
