 SEOUL, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao begins a two-day visit to South Korea on Friday for talks with East Asian trading partners, but the issue of how to reign in provocative North Korea is expected to dominate. With Seoul and Tokyo convinced that North Korea torpedoed a the South Korean warship Cheonan in March, China's attempts to balance those ties with its traditional support of North Korea will see Wen face his neighbours' disquiet over Beijing's reluctance to press Pyongyang. Wen will be the first Chinese leader to meet South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak after Seoul accused Pyongyang of torpedoing its corvette and will also meet Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama at the three-nation regional summit on the resort island of Jeju at the weekend. US officials said this week that there were signs that China, the North's main benefactor and ally, is reviewing ties with the isolated state a week after an investigation headed by Seoul released evidence accusing the North for the sinking. But South Korean officials were more sceptical on whether Beijing will make the dramatic gesture of siding with the South, and the United States, when Seoul takes the North to the UN Security Council. A senior South Korean official said Seoul did not expect Beijing to come forward on the side of condemning Pyongyang or imposing fresh sanctions but will in the end not block the move to censure the North at the Security Council. North Korea has escalated blistering rhetoric since the release of the investigations' findings, threatening to severe all ties with the South and possibly shut down the Kaesong factory park, which is the last remaining major commercial link between the rivals that had been a symbol of reconciliation. On Thursday, the North's military said it was taking the first steps in severing the border link which provides access for South Korean workers to the Kaesong project. The move has fuelled concerns in the South that some of the hundreds of its workers who stay in the North Korean border city on a typical day may become stranded. The South will send in troops if the North shuts down the border and holds its citizens hostage in Kaesong, the South Korean official said on Friday on the condition of anonymity. Such a move would be a major escalation of tensions that have so far remained bluster on the part of Pyongyang following the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan that killed 46. Mounting antagonism between the two Koreas has unnerved investors, worried the bitter rivalry could spill over into conflict. South Korea's navy is conducting a three-way exercise aimed at better deterring submarine infiltration by the North, having upgraded its alert. But its defence minister was quoted as telling senior local journalists that there were no indications that North Korea may be getting ready for further provocations. Most analysts say that neither side is ready to go to war but warn there could be more skirmishes, especially along their disputed sea border off the west coast. Traders said the issue continues to hang over the market, although it is no longer driving prices down as it did early in the w
