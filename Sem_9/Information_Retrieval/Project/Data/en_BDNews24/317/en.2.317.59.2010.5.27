 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Main opposition BNP is having talks with its two partners on Thursday night after a gap of one and a half years. Party officials said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has convened a meeting with Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) at 9pm and Islami Oikya Jote at 10pm at her Gulshan office. "The meetings are part of exchange of views with partners in four-party alliance, other like-minded parties and professionals ahead of the June 27 hartal and anti-government movement," Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com. Eight other BNP leaders will attend the Thursday talks. Meeting with Jamaat-e Islami, the second largest party in the alliance, is not yet fixed. BNP last held talks with three of its alliance partners on Dec 29, 2008, when the last national elections were held. Khan said Khaleda would hold talks with National People's Party, National Democratic Alliance and Khelafat Mojlish on Saturday. Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nejami told bdnews24.com that a 15-member delegation, led by party chief Fazlul Haq Aminee, would attend the meeting. BNP participated in the 2001 and 2008 national elections jointly with its alliance partners. They secured a landslide victory in 2001 but were defeated in 2008. b
