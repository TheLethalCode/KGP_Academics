 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister has declared that not only the crimes against humanity, but also war crimes of 1971 will be tried in line with the International Crimes Act. Apparently referring to Pakistani citizens, Shafique Ahmed said on Friday, "Even any country's citizen (who was involved with the crimes during 1971 war of independence from pakistan) will be put on trial." He was speaking to reporters after inaugurating 15th annual district convention of Lions' Club International, District 315A, at Sonargaon Hotel. He dismissed out of hand comments by different quarters including the main opposition BNP that the trial process is just an eyewash. "It is not true," he asserted. Tk 10 crore has been set aside in the current budget for the trial and the same amount would be earmarked in the next budget, he said. "These initiatives indicate the government's good intention to hold the trial of war crimes." Asked how far the investigation has progressed, he said investigators will be done 'in due time' but they might as well say how much headway has been made. Asked about a political party's anti-government campaign to halt trial of 1971 crimes, he said legal steps would be taken. Regarding extra-judicial killings, he said, "There is no more crossfire in the country. It has stopped." Global human-rights watchdog Amnesty International on Thursday alleged that Bangladesh government had not stopped extra-judicial killings though it had pledged to stop such murders without trial. b
