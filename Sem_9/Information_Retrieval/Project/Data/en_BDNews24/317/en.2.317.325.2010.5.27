 Chittagong, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked the Chittagong leaders to forget their past disputes and jointly work for mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury to win in the upcoming CCC polls. AL central working committee joint general secretary Mahbubul Haque Hanif briefed reporters following a meeting on Thursday morning which Hasina hosted with party leaders from Chittagong ahead of the June 17 city corporation elections. Hanif was present at the one-hour meeting starting from 11:30am at Hasina's official residence Ganabhaban. The three AL parliament members from the city corporation area, and presidents and general secretaries of the city, south and north units and those who filed nomination papers for the mayoral polls against Mohiuddin were called to the meeting. Central AL leaders have already endorsed Mohiuddin, who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in the mayor post. Mohiuddin is contesting for the polls as a candidate of Nagorik Committee. Hanif told reporters after Thursday's meeting they had discussed ways to work for Mohiuddin. There might be various opinions within a major party like Awami League, he said. "If we work concertedly forgetting past disputes it will be possible for our Chittagong candidate to win," the AL leader said. bdne
