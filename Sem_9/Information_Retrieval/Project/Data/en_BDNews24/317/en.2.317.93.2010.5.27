<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The opposition BNP's future political strategies will depend on the result of the upcoming Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) mayoral election, a top leader said Thursday. Addressing a meeting of the representatives of the BNP and its affiliates, city president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury also said the CCC election was not an ordinary one. Khosru said the CCC mayoral ballot was not only a matter of Chittagong BNP. "BNP has joined the election as part of an anti-government movement," he said. He claimed that the Election Commission was not favourable to the BNP. "They [EC] are involved in a conspiracy to destroy BNP." Khosru is acting as the chief election agent for the BNP-backed mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam. Earlier, he issued a letter to the returning officer demanding removal of the acting mayor, Zahirul Alam Dobhash. In the letter Khosru claimed that the ruling Awami League had appointed Dobhash, who is their party man. He urged that a neutral person be selected for the position. The EC, however, in its reply mentioned that the appointment was not under its jurisdiction. Khosru on Thursday asked all the BNP leaders and activists to be on alert during the election on June 17. "Awami League is abusing its power. They might get engaged in vote-rigging by engaging the law-enforcement members." Emphasising the significance of polling agents, Khosru said, "The ruling party might threaten the polling agents. So, diehard supporters of the BNP should be selected as agents." City BNP general secretary Shahadat Hossain, former chief whip Wahidul Alam, and other leaders were present in the meeting. bdnews24
