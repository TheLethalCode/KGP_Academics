<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Top seed Serena Williams cruised into the French Open third round on Friday, in the first match of a packed women's schedule swollen by rain delays on the previous two days. Williams, the world number one, demolished German world number 77 Julia Goerges 6-1, 6-1 in just 55 minutes in a second-round match that had originally been scheduled to take place on Thursday.

Justine Henin, the 22nd seed and four-time champion, was due to resume her second round match against Czech Klara Zakopalova, in which she leads 6-3, 3-2, later on Friday. Russian former world number one Maria Sharapova, seeded 12, resumes at 6-3, 2-2 up against Belgian Kirsten Flipkens, with last year's beaten semi-finalist Samantha Stosur of Australia, the number seven seed, due on court against Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. Second seed Venus Williams faces Slovakian 26th seed Dominika Cibulkova in the third round, while third seed Caroline Wozniacki takes on Romanian 31st seed Alexandra Dulgheru, who triumphed in Warsaw last week. Defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and fellow Russian Elena Dementieva are also in third-round action, with Kuzentsova meeting number 30 seed Maria Kirilenko and fifth seed Dementieva tackling Canada's Aleksandra Woz
