<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)Two allies of the main opposition BNP-led four- party alliance have endorsed the June 27 hartal. At separate meetings with the BNP chief Khaleda Zia, top leaders of Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) and Islami Oikyo Jote (IOJ) told reporters that they would support the anti-government movement. The meetings on Thursday night took place after one and a half years. The BJP delegation, led by party chairman Andalib Rahman Partho, sat with the BNP chairperson just before 10pm. Mufti Fazlul Huq Amini led the IOJ delegation to the meeting after that meeting had ended. Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan earlier said: "The meetings are part of exchange of views with the partners in four-party alliance, other like-minded parties and professionals ahead of the June 27 hartal and anti-government movement." However, meeting with Jamaat-e Islami, the second largest party in the alliance, was not yet scheduled. BNP last held talks with three of its alliance partners on Dec 29, 2008, when the last national elections were held. Khan said Khaleda would hold talks with National People's Party, National Democratic Alliance and Khelafat Mojlish on Saturday. BNP participated in the 2001 and 2008 national elections jointly with its alliance partners. They secured a landslide victory in 2001 but were swept aside by the Awami League-led Grand Alliance in 2008. bdnew
