 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)--The Awami League is ruling the country by regulating democracy, BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed said on Thursday. Moudud was speaking at a discussion meeting titled "President Ziaur Rahman's political philosophy and today's perspective" at Dhaka Reporters' Unity conference hall in the city. Jatiya Gonotantik Party organised the discussion to mark former president Zia's 29th death anniversary, which falls on May 30. Moudud said: "The government is exercising one-party rule and has made parliament ineffective Everything, including judiciary and administration, is functioning amid regulation." Referring to the government's reaction to BNP's hartal call for June 27, Moudud claimed: "The government has been puzzled at the call of the hartal. It's a warning call for the government." He said Awami League had observed 130 hartals during the five-year term of BNP-led four-party alliance government." "They had observed 16 hartals during the first one and half years of the alliance government while BNP has called for a single one," he said. Moudud said the more the ruling party would talk about resisting the hartal, the more it would be successful. Awami League leaders reacted sharply to the hartal call by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and said they would resist it.
