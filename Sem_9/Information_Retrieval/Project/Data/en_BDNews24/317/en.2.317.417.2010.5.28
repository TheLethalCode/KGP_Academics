<TITLE> Howard's ICC bid on sticky wicket in Sri Lanka </TITLE>

Howard needs seven votes from the 10 Test playing nations but this rejection, which follows reported opposition from South Africa and Zimbabwe, leaves the Australian's campaign just one vote away from failing. The ICC's rotation policy requires an Australian candidate to fill the role from 2012 to succeed India's Sharad Pawar, who takes charge next month from England's David Morgan.
