 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)--Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has called on the Buddhists to join the 'peaceful' movement to topple the government. She made the call when a delegation of the religious minority called on her at her Gulshan office on Thursday night on the occasion of Buddha Purnima, the main festival of the community. BNP chairperson Khaleda said: "Today people of no religion are in peace. The country has to be saved from this government to restore peace." She claimed that the people are so annoyed with the government that they no more want to see it in the office. "That's why we have announced a peaceful movement programme." Khaleda said BNP wanted peaceful demonstration but the government was trying to push the opposition party into the path of confrontation. "You see what the ruling party men are doing. The people are desperately looking for a way out of the situation," she added. The BNP chief came down heavily on the government for its policy on Chittagong Hill Tracts, the region that has the huge concentration of Buddhists. She alleged that ruling Awami League-backed students were involved in violence and tender manipulation at public universities. Buddhist community leaders Samiran Dewan, Sukumar Barua and Jyoti Baruna also spoke at the gathering. BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and standing committee member Nazrul Islam were present.
