<TITLE> Late Dunga warns Brazil stars to play as a team </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Brazil coach Dunga was upbeat as he faced the media for the first time since the five-time World Cup winners arrived in South Africa early on Thursday. The 46-year-old 1994 World Cup-winning captain made more than 100 journalists wait an hour before emerging at the team base within Randpark golf club in a northern Johannesburg suburb. Dunga acknowledged Brazil were here to win a record sixth World Cup title, but admitted that will hinge on his ability to successfully blend together a galaxy of stars. "We have stars here but they must play together on the field because that is the most important thing. We have to play as a team or we will not progress," he warned. "One of the things I have tried to do is refresh the love for the Brazil shirt and the aim to play for the national team. But now we know everything we have done before will be measured by this competition. "If we do not win it, everyone will say the same things they always say - that the players and the preparation were not good enough." Having won the Confederations Cup in South Africa last June, Brazil are joint favourites with European champions Spain to win the June 11-July 11 tournament, the first World Cup staged by Africa. With Argentine counterpart Diego Maradona stating on Wednesday he would run naked through Buenos Aires if they lift the trophy, Dunga was asked what he would do if Brazil go all the way. "My only problem is to work and everything will come naturally," he said. "We must respect the individuals in the group and create a good feeling in the camp as quickly as possible because that will help us on the pitch. When the players are free, they can decide to do what they like." Brazil kick off their World Cup Group G campaign with a match against 2000-1 tournament outsiders North Korea on June 15 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg and later face Ivory Coast and 2006 semi-finalists Port
