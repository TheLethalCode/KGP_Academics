<TITLE> Japan and US resolve Okinawa base row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 28 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Japan and the United States agreed Friday to keep a US military airbase on Okinawa island, resolving a row that has badly strained ties between the allies but angering local opponents. Tokyo and Washington said in a joint statement that the controversial Futenma marine airbase would be moved, as first agreed in 2006, from a crowded city area to the coastal Henoko region of the southern island. They announced the deal after a telephone conversation between Japan's centre-left Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who took power last year vowing "more equal" ties with the United States, and President Barack Obama. "We were able to reach an agreement on the Futenma issue by the end of May," Hatoyama told reporters, referring to a self-imposed deadline on an issue that has badly eroded his domestic political capital. The White House said both leaders "expressed satisfaction with the progress made by the two sides in reaching an operationally viable and politically sustainable plan to relocate the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma." The base has long angered locals because of aircraft noise, pollution, the risk of crashes and friction with American service personnel, especially after the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen. Hatoyama, who in an August election ended Japan's half-century of conservative rule, initially vowed to scrap the 2006 pact and move the base off the island, but then failed to find an alternative location. He caved in and broke his election pledge early this month when he said the base would stay on Okinawa, a subtropical island that has been the reluctant host of a heavy US military presence since World War II. Both sides said that the 50-year-old US-Japan alliance "remains indispensable not only to the defence of Japan, but also to the peace, security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region." "Recent developments in the security environment of Northeast Asia reaffirmed the significance of the alliance," they said -- a reference to a multinational report that last week blamed North Korea for sinking a South Korean naval vessel in March, killing 46 sailors. In the statement, both nations' foreign and defence ministers confirmed that they will return to the existing pact, adding that 8,000 Marines would be moved to the US territory of Guam as previously agreed. A logistical study would be completed by late August, they said. The festering dispute has provoked mass anti-base rallies, both on Okinawa and other islands that the government has eyed as potential alternative locations, and hammered Hatoyama's popularity. With upper house elections slated for July, approval ratings for Hatoyama's cabinet have plunged to around 20 percent. The premier's coalition partner, the Social Democrats, strongly oppose the move. Their leader and Hatoyama's consumer affairs minister, Mizuho Fukushima, signalled Friday she would not resign, as she had earlier threatened, but also said she would not sign a cabinet resolution to support the base relocation. Hatoyama's office postponed a scheduled afternoon press conference without giving a reason or a new time. Okinawans meanwhile vented their fury. Susumu Inamine, the anti-base mayor of Nago city, which includes the Henoko area, accused Hatoyama of "a betrayal of the Okinawan people" and vowed he would continue to refuse negotiations with Tokyo. Okinawa's Ryukyu Shimpo newspaper in a special edition predicted that a flare-up in local opposition was inevitable and warned it was unlikely the relocation would go smoothly. The joint statement said both sides "recognised the importance of responding to the concerns of the people of Okinawa that they bear a disproportionate burden related to the presence of US forces". They also said that some military training may in future be shifted off Okinawa, possibly to the remote island of Tokunoshima, to Japan Self-Defense Force bases elsewhere in Japan, or to G
