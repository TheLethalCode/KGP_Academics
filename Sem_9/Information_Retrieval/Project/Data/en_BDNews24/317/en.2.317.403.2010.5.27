 SINGAPORE, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Nearly one in 10 people believe global warming is part of a natural cycle of events, and nothing to really worry about, an alarming increase on the figures from two years ago, according to a global poll.

For almost a third of respondents, the biggest danger from climate change was extreme weather conditions, followed by desertification and drought. And most people surveyed said they were personally doing something about global warming, with saving electricity the most popular activity, followed by reducing water consumption and recycling waste. Almost half of those surveyed said they would also be willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. The survey was conducted from February to April this y
