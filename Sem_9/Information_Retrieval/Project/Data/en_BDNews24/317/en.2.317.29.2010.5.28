 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com) -- A senior leader of the ruling Awami League has claimed BNP chief Khaleda Zia does not say her prayers and is involved in anti-Islamic activities. "She does not offer prayers and is involved in anti-Islamic activities, while our leader Sheikh Hasina abides by Islamic rules and regulations," party's acting general secretary Mahabub-Ul-Alam Hanif told a conference. Bangladesh Awami Olama League, an associate organisation of Awami League, organised the conference at the Institution of Engineers on Thursday. Hanif said, however busy the prime minister, she says her prayers regularly and recite the holy Koran. Referring to a newspaper report, Hanif said: "Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami's son, who is staying abroad, is involved in unethical activities and frequents night clubs in Malaysia and other countries." "It apparently is not befitting for a person to try to speak about the religion when that person has failed to establish Islam in his own family." Hanif said Nizami and Jamaat's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed do not care about Islam; they believe in Maududism, the philosophy of Jamaat-e Islami Pakistan's founder Syed Abul A'ala Maududi. The Awami League leader said: "They cheat people in the name of Islam. They do politics and business under the cover of Islam." Referring to BNP chief whip's announcement on boycotting budget session and launching street agitation, Hanif said: "We want to make it clear that Awami League believes in democracy and peace. "But we will resist any destructive activity." He said BNP wanted to destabilise the country and jeopardise the security of life and property of the people. Chaired by Olama League president Ismail Hossain, the programme was also addressed by Awami League leader AFM Bahauddin Nasim. b
