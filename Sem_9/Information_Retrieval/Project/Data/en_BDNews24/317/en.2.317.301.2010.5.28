<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Friday a bill on restoration of the original constitution framed in 1972 will soon be placed in the parliament. The constitution of 1972 can only be reinstated by the parliament, not by Supreme Court verdicts, the minister said. The constitution of 1972, which has been changed 14 times, was the main one adopted after Bangladesh's freedom that contained the four basic principles on which the war of independence from Pakistan had been fought. He also criticised the movement programmes declared by the main opposition BNP and repeated his allegation that "it was launched only to thwart the war crimes trial." Ashraf, also the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, was addressing an anti-radicalism convention organised by the Platform against Communalism and Militancy at the capital's Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. The government would bring all war criminals to justice, Ashraf said. Alluding to the main opposition BNP, the AL leader said, "A certain party and its associates are spreading propaganda to confuse people about the war crime issue." "They are saying that the prevailing law and order is not suitable to hold the trial, which is completely wrong," he added. Faruk Tariq, leader of Pakistan Labour Party and also a human rights activist, was also present at the convention. Tariq said, "Liberal Pakistanis also support the trial of the members of Al-Badr, Al-Shams and Razakar forces who, being collaborators of the Pakistani army, killed Bengalis and committed crimes against humanity. Hundreds of representatives from different left-leaning and progressive organisations and Sector Commanders' Forum participated. bd
