 Pabna, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Majpara union of Atgharia Upazila in Pabna has earned the distinction of becoming the country's 'first biogas union' having set up over 100 biogas plants. Speaking at a programme at Ramchandrapur High School ground organised by Infrastructural Development Company (IDCOL), Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas said, "It is a matter of joy that 106 biogas plants have been set up at Majpara union. Locals are now using it to cooking, lighting, running shallow machines using biogas." As part of its role in financing infrastructure and renewable energy projects, IDCOL has established a "National Domestic Biogas and Manure Programme" which provides subsidies and loans to those individuals who want to set up biogas plants. With the aim of establishing 37,269 biogas plants across the country by 2012, IDCOL is naming every union with over 100 biogas plants a 'biogas union' It has so far helped set up 12,000 plants which use cow dung and poultry litter to produce gas that can be used for cooking. The minister at the programme said that the government wants to make the country self-reliant on energy, and spoke about the relationship between his department's livestock projects and biogas. Also speaking at the programme, IDCOL executive director Islam Sharif said: "Only thirty percent of the population, living in the cities and towns, are able to use natural gas for cooking." For the whole of Bangladesh, the percentage is only 3% He said, as a result, most people in Bangladesh use firewood, dry leaves, dried cow-dung and other waste for cooking, which is leading to deforestation causing enormous harm to the environment. IDCOL chairman and Economic Relations Division secretary Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Bhuiyan presided over the ceremony. The biogas programme is financed by SNV, the Netherlands Development Organization and Kfw, a German bank, and is implemented through local private companies, NGOs, and Micro finance institutes. IDCOL is a state owned company set up under the Ministry of Finance in 1997. bdnews24.c
