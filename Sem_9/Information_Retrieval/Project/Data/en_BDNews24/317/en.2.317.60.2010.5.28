<TEXT>
 OSTRAVA, Czech Republic, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Former world record holder Asafa Powell clocked the fastest time of the year when winning the 100 metres in 9.83 seconds at the Ostrava Golden Spike meeting on Thursday. World 100 and 200 metres record holder Usain Bolt failed in his attempt to add the 300 world best to his accomplishments on a damp evening. Jamaican Bolt, competing over the rarely-run distance for the first time, came off the bend in front but could not keep up the pace into a headwind and finished in 30.97, outside American Michael Johnson's mark of 30.85, set in 2000. Powell, overshadowed in recent years by compatriot Bolt, was quick out of the blocks in the 100 metres final and looked relaxed throughout the race for a comfortable win some three metres ahead of the field. Olympic champion Bolt's fastest time this year was 9.86 run in Daegu, South Korea this month. His world record of 9.58 was set at last year's world championships in Berlin where he also established a new mark for the 200 of 19.19 sec
