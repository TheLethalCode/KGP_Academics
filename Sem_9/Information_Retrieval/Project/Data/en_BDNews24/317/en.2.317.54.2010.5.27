 LONDON, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England batsman Jonathan Trott put a troubled winter behind him on Thursday with a second century in as many home Tests on the opening day of the first Test against Bangladesh at Lord's. Trott stroked an unbeaten 107 as England prospered at the expense of the threadbare Bangladesh attack to reach 231 for three at tea after being put in to bat. After helping England regain the Ashes at The Oval last year with 119 on his Test debut, Trott struggled in the subsequent series in his native South Africa and in Bangladesh. Under pressure on Thursday to justify his test spot, Trott carved a boundary from his third delivery after Alastair Cook had been dismissed lbw for seven. He batted with increasing authority, reaching his hundred with his 12th four from 133 balls, a handsome drive through the covers.

Shakib Al Hasan's decision to field first on winning the toss on a cool, overcast morning was quickly exposed after Cook had been dismissed propping half-forward to Shahadat Hossain. Hossain bowled with energy and verve but, in common with his team mates, he was rendered innocuous as the sun began to shine and sapped any early life from the pitch. Shakib, who had been isolated from his team-mates before the match after contracting chicken pox, demonstrated the paucity of his bowling resources by coming on as first change at the Nursery End with his left-arm spin. He conceded 49 from 12 overs before switching to the Pavilion End 20 minutes before tea where his luck changed when he comprehensively bowled Kevin Pietersen for 18. Pietersen, who was player of the series in England's successful Twenty20 World campaign, had threatened to tear the attack apart with three sumptuous f
