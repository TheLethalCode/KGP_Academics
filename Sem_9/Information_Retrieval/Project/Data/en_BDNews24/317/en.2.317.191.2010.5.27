 PARIS, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of workers took to the streets in cities across France on Thursday to protest against government plans to raise the minimum retirement age of 60 as part of a reform of the costly pension system. Trade union leaders said the marches were the first step in a long struggle to defend the retirement age, a trademark reform of the late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, against the current government which says it has no alternative. Transport was working almost normally and between 10 and 20 percent of public service workers went on strike in schools, the post office and France Telecom. A poll for the Le Parisien daily said 62 percent of those responding were ready to demonstrate. One of the earliest marches, in Marseille, drew a larger turnout than a previous protest day in March. Unions estimated the crowd at 80,000 while police gave a figure of 12,000. Estimates for the Paris march were due later on Thursday. "Only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that (President) Nicolas Sarkozy is methodically attacking," Bernard Thibault, secretary general of the powerful CGT union, said. Labour Minister Eric Woerth said on Wednesday that the current retirement age was "not dogma" and Budget Minister Francois Baroin said on Thursday a pension reform bill would be debated in parliament after the summer break. "There are basically no other measures on the table that are convincing," Woerth told reporters. Sarkozy added a partisan sting to the debate on Wednesday by saying, to loud protests from the opposition Socialists, that France would have "much fewer problems" if Mitterrand had not lowered the retirement age in 1983. TRANSPORT PENSIONS UNTOUCHED According to a report last month by the government-appointed Pensions Advisory Council, France's pension system faces a funding gap of around 70 billion euros ($86 billion) in 2030 and that could balloon to more than 100 billion euros by 2050. Like other countries in the euro zone, France is struggling to bring its swollen public deficit under control. It has announced a freeze on central government spending over the next three years but has ruled out tax increases. According to French media reports, the government is considering increasing the retirement age to 62 or 63 years and extending the period during which contributions have to be paid to 42 years from the current level of 40.5 years by 2030. However, President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said that no decisions had been taken as yet. Sarkozy has singled out an overhaul of the pension system as his government's key reform project this year but his plans already have aroused strong opposition from unions. The CGT's Thibault said further protests could come before the summer break. CFDT union leader Francois Chereque said: "Things will happen over time. One protest will not suffice." There have been expectations for several months that a rise in the retirement age would be part of the planned reform but French media have focused closely on the issue in recent days. The transport chaos that often accompanies strikes in France was mostly absent on Thursday, partly because the reform plan would not touch costly special pension schemes for transport workers, a powerful sector that brought an earlier conservative government to its knees in 1995 when it tried to reform them. "The government's plan is not the toughest that could be, despite what the banners will say," the business daily Les Echos wrote in an editoria
