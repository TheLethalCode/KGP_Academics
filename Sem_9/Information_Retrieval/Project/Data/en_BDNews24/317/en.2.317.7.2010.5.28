 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP has again demanded mid-term elections to test the Awami League-led coalition government's popularity. Senior leader MK Anwar said on Friday, "We threw the hartal programme to meet the people's demand. This is a sort of protest against the government. The government is trying to stifle the people's protest." Earlier by the end of the last year, several high-profile leaders of the party urged the government to announce mid-term polls. Anwar also said there is still time for the government to reform itself and call the elections. Anwar, who sits on BNP's policymaking standing committee, was speaking at a discussion meeting organised by the National Youth Forum to mark the 29th death anniversary, which falls on May 30, of former president Ziaur Rahman at the National Press Club. The opposition leader presented the data of about 300 hartals called by the present ruling Awami League in previous BNP regimes from 1991-1996 and 2001-2006. "BNP, contrarily, called only 49 hartals when the Awami League was in power from 1996," he said. Harshly criticising the government for its failure in different sectors. "The present government has surrendered every interest of Bangladesh to the neighbouring country only to remain in power," he said alluding to India. "They have signed several deals that are still waiting to be placed before the parliament. So, not only democracy, even the independence and sovereignty are also in grave danger," he observed. On Thursday, acting Awami League general secretary Mahabub-Ul-Alam Hanif told a Bangladesh Awami Olama League conference that BNP chief Khaleda Zia does not say her prayers and is involved in anti-Islamic activities. Reacting to the statement, Anwar said, "That is a remark of poor taste. [Khaleda] does not say her prayers with Tasbih in her hand and wearing head scarf to show around. She and her party do not do politics in name of religion." BNP's long time ally Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general M Kamaruzzaman, Jatiya Ganatantrik Party president Shafiul Alam Pradhan, National People's Party president Sheikh Shaowkat Hossain Nilu and top-ranking leaders of some other parties were also present at the conference.
