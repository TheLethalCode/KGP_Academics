 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Emphasis should be given on education, health and skills development training of the women while preparing budgets, a top economist said Friday. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, also chairman of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), said many of the projects undertaken in budget preparation are not always implemented. He made the remarks at a pre-budget discussion on gender equality at the Bangladesh Economic Association auditorium in the city. "So it is important to implement the projects rather than just include them into the budget plans," Kholiquzzaman said on Friday. On women empowerment, he said they should be provided with sustainable employment. In the keynote paper, Hannana Begum, president of Unnoyan Kotha, said the underprivileged women must be given preference to build a sustainable economy. "In addition, contribution of the women within the families should be endorsed by the state. It will make a greater change to their dignity," she added. She also stressed implementation of the legal framework to stop violence against women and to build skilled manpower through special training. Former vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University Amirul Islam Chowdhury presided over the discussion. bdn
