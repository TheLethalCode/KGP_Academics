 ASADABAD, Afghanistan, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A top leader of Pakistan's Taliban may have been killed in a clash with Afghan forces near the border, a senior Afghan police officer said on Thursday, possibly improving security in the Swat Valley. Maulvi Fazlullah, the head of a Taliban faction in Pakistan's Swat Valley, was reportedly killed along with six of his comrades in the Barg Matal district of Afghanistan's Nuristan province, which lies close to the border with Pakistan, said Mohammad Zaman Mamozai, chief of the Afghan border force for the eastern region. "Maulvi Fazlullah was killed in a direct clash with Afghan border police ... last night," he said. He did not have further details. The Afghan Taliban have confirmed the fighting, but said no foreign militants were involved. The report of Fazlullah's death comes after several days of clashes between Afghan forces and militants in Barg Matal. Maulvi Faqir Mohammad, who heads a Pakistani Taliban faction based in the Bajuar tribal region, denied media reports that Fazlullah was leading any assault in Afghanistan. "He could be in Nuristan because the Taliban have been moving back and fourth along the (Pakistan-Afghan) border," he told Reuters by telephone prior to reports of Fazlullah's death. "He may be living in Nuristan but he is not engaged in any fighting there," he said. Jaffar Khan, a top police official in Chitral, which lies opposite the Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, said there were reports Fazlullah was fighting in Nuristan during the last two days, but it was not confirmed. In a BBC interview in November, Fazlullah said he had escaped to Afghanistan after a Pakistani military offensive against the Taliban in his stronghold in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley in April last year. The Pakistani army maintains a troop presence of about 30,000 in Swat and surrounding areas, but there are signs that the Swat Taliban are attempting a comeback. Thus, the death of Fazlullah might improve security in Swat where he previously held sway, said Mehmood Shah, former security chief in Pakistan's tribal areas. "Swat probably will stabilise a lot," he said. "But he was not much of a figure in the overall Taliban." The TTP is under pressure from military operations in Orakzai, he said, referring to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, a loose grouping of more than a dozen factions based in different parts of northwest Pakistan. "So I think it will have good effects in Swat," he said. "But I don't think it will have any more effects" in other area
