 LAHORE, Pakistan (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Gunmen stormed two Pakistani mosques belonging to a minority sect in Lahore on Friday, taking worshippers hostage and sparking gun battles with police that left 17 people dead, officials said. Gunfire and blasts rang out as the attackers, at least one of whom wore a suicide vest, stormed a mosque in the upscale neighbourhood of Model Town and another in the busy area of Garhi Shahu as people gathered for weekly prayers. They are both mosques of the Ahmadis, also known as Qadiani, and have tens of thousands of members. Rights groups say the sect has long been persecuted in Pakistan and has remained an occasional target of sectarian attacks. Lahore, a city of eight million near Pakistan's border with India, has been increasingly subject to Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked attacks in a nationwide bombing campaign that has killed more than 3,300 people in three years. "Terrorists have attacked mosques. They are firing and using grenades. They have taken people inside the mosque hostage," district civil defence official Muzhar Ahmed told AFP by telephone from the scene in Garhi Shahu. Television stations broadcast the sounds of gunfire and footage of destroyed vehicles and motorcycles, with a man -- apparently a civilian -- lying on the ground with blood nearby as Pakistani security forces scrambled to the scene. "The operation is continuing. Commandos are on site. Terrorists are inside the mosque. One of the terrorists has been killed, one arrested and one is injured," Punjab provincial police chief Tariq Saleem Dogar told reporters. Officials said at least 17 people died during the attack in Model Town but there was no immediate clear picture on the number of casualties at the second mosque, where civil defence reported that hostages had been taken. "Fifteen people were brought in dead and two others expired in hospital," Doctor Javed Akram, chief of Lahore's Jinnah Hospital, told ARY television. "There are 24 injured at the hospital, seven of them critical," he said. The victims had gunshot wounds and head injuries, he added. Fahim Jahanzeb, a rescue services spokesman, said at least 28 people had been injured. Amjad Iqbal, a police officer who was in Garhi Shahu told AFP that firing was still going on into the mid-afternoon. "The attackers are on the roof of the mosque and they are shooting at police," he said, fearing that people were wounded. Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani strongly condemned the attacks, expressing "deep sorrow and grief over the loss of precious lives". Founded by Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in 1838, the Ahmadi sect has a number of unique views including that Ahmad himself was a prophet and that Jesus died aged 120 in Srinagar, capital of Indian-ruled Kashmir. Friday's incident was the first major attack in Lahore since March suicide attacks seconds apart targeted the Pakistani military, killing 57 people shortly before the main Muslim weekly prayers were to begin. Eight attacks have killed more than 170 people in Lahore over the past year, a historical city, playground for the elite and home to many top brass in Pakistan's powerful military and intelligence establishment. Religious violence in Pakistan, mostly between majority Sunni Muslims and minority Shiites, has killed more than 4,000 people in the past decade. In October 2005, eight people were shot dead when masked gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs stormed into an Ahmadi mosque in Mandi Bahauddin town, 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Islamabad. In the southwestern city of Quetta, where targeted killings blamed on insurgents and Taliban militants are increasing, gunmen shot dead four policemen and then fled on the back of a motorcycle Friday. "A police station house officer, two constables and the driver were killed on the spot," local police official Mohammmad Amin told
