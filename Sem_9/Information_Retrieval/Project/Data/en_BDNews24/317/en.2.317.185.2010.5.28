 MILAN, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Treble winners Inter Milan see England coach Fabio Capello as a candidate to succeed Jose Mourinho as their next manager, club president Massimo Moratti said on Friday. "I haven't taken a decision. Capello is one of the candidates and he certainly has a great pedigree," Moratti told www.gazzetta.it in a webchat. He did not say whether the club had already approached the English Football Association about Capello, who had previously said the national role would be his last coaching job and had seemed set to continue through to Euro 2012.

"We want to end this saga well. I have no deadline to find a new coach. Maybe Mourinho will stay with us and I won't need a new one," Moratti said before explaining why Inter are not letting the Portuguese go lightly. "I don't believe it is a rude or overly hard position to take. It's only the fact that we would willingly have continued with Mourinho. Mourinho has been spectacular," he said. Moratti also expressed interest in Arsenal and Liverpool midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Steven Gerrard but said it would be almost impossible to buy
