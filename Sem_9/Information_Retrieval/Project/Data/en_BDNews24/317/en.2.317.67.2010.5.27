 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  A food security forum has stressed development of an efficient marketing chain for agricultural produce and surface water management. The two-day forum, organised by the government, with the assistance of a number of national and international agencies, called upon the government and development partners to support the preparation of the Country Food Security Investment Plan (CFSIP). The conference at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, was meant to discuss the relevant sectors for disbursement of funds pledged to Bangladesh by developed countries. The forum will also decide on the expenditure strategy. These allocations will be finalised at the upcoming meetings of the G8 in June in Canada, and at the Asia Food Security Investment Forum in the Philippines in July. Earlier, a $20 billion fund was formed at the G8 Group's 2009 summit in Italy's L'Aquila. This year, the G20 also pledged $22 billion to different countries for development in the agriculture sector, food minister Abdur Razzaque told a press briefing on Tuesday. Food minister Abdur Razzak told a press conference after the conclusion of the forum that they have stressed the need for technology development, transfer and deployment for ensuring all aspects of the CFSIP. The forum had seven technical sessions on agricultural productivity and climate change, development of fisheries and livestock, safety net programs and public food distribution, agri-marketing and price stabilisation, nutrition security and governance as a cross cutting issue, said the food minister. "We called upon the government to engage all stakeholders including the people in a consultative manner for formulating the CFSIP." He said that the forum has made a "broad outline" of recommendations, which would be finalised by a high powered committee. "The committee will submit it to the ministry within the next five days." Razzak said that the development partners agreed that they would not "impose" any policy while committing aid. "They have agreed to support the country-led strategies." Replying a query, the minister said that the Multi Donor Trust Fund has already agreed on a $50 million package to support food security. "They have asked to submit project proposal by June." According to the minister, the forum called upon the government to prepare and plan its programmes in a prioritised manner for their implementation and allocate budgetary resources subject to national capability. b
