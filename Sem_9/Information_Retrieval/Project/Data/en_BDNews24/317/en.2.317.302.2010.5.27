 Khulna, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  A freedom fighter died at Khalishpur early Thursday, police said. Altaf Hossain, 60, died at around 2:15am while receiving treatment at Khulna Medical College Hospital, Khalishpur police chief Abu Mokaddem Ali told bdnews24.com. Locals had brought him to the hospital when they found him lying wounded in front of Lal Hospital at Central Block Road at around 11pm on Wednesday, he said. Five or six criminals earlier fled the scene after dumping him there after hitting him with sharp weapons, Abu Mokaddem Ali said, adding that there was no light in the area at that time because of load-shedding. The body is in the morgue for autopsy. Senior police officials, Awami League and Muktijoddha Sangsad leaders have already visited the scene and then the hospital to see the body. Relatives of Altaf Hossain, however, blamed local Awami League leaders for the killing. Mokaddem quoted Hossain's wife Jahanara Begum saying that her husband had told his relatives on his way to the hospital at night that Awami League leader Kazi Fazlur Rahman Mahabbat and his younger brother Kazi Ataur Rahman along with three or four persons had attacked him. Regarding this, Khalishpur Awami League's general secretary Abul Bashar told bdnews24.com: "Mohabbbat is now in India. I don't know if his accomplices have caused the killing." Mokaddem said that the police had launched their drive to arrest those implicated in the killing soon after receiving the news last night. No case has been lodged yet. bd
