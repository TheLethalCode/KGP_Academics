 NEW DELHI, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Temperatures close to 50 degrees Celsius gripped large swathes of India, killing dozens of people as the country waits for the annual monsoon rains to reach the mainland, media and officials said on Thursday. The hottest place in India, at 49.3 degrees (121 Fahrenheit), was Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, with severe heat also prevailing in Punjab and Haryana. The health ministry does not regularly publish aggregated statistics of heat-related death tolls across states. CNN-IBN news channel on Thursday put the number at 134.

City doctors said they had admitted 10-20 percent more patients suffering from heatstroke than last year, according to the Times of India. Residents poured into the air-conditioned metro in record numbers on Tuesday, the paper said, abandoning buses, taxis and auto rickshaws. Officials in Orissa alone have confirmed 34 deaths from the heat wave since March, though authorities are investigating 65 more suspected deaths.
