 PARIS, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belgium's Justine Henin made a brief cameo appearance on Centre Court to complete a 6-3, 6-3 win over Czech Klara Zakopalova in the second round of the French Open on Friday. The match was interrupted by dusk and rain on Thursday with the four-time champion holding a 3-2 advantage in the second set and the Belgian started confidently, breaking her opponent's serve to open a 4-2 lead. She was broken back but won the last two games to prevail on her fourth match point with a forehand winner down the line after one hour and 15 minutes. The 22nd-seeded Henin, back from 20 months in retirement, will next face either Russian 12th seed Maria Sharapova or compatriot Kirsten Flip
