<TITLE> Shafique sees no 'crossfire' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) Law minister Shafique Ahmed has claimed that crossfire has stopped. The minister's comments came a day after the global human-rights watchdog Amnesty International criticised Bangladesh government for not stopping extrajudicial killings as it pledged. In its annual report it alleged that extrajudicial executions reported as deaths from "crossfire" or after a "shoot-out" had not stopped in Bangladesh though the ruling Awami League in its campaign pledges vowed to stop such murders without trial. Even on Monday, two alleged 'terrorists' were killed in a 'gunfight' with the police and RAB, the media reported quoting the law-enforcing agencies. However, Shafique said on Friday: "There is no more crossfire in the country. It has stopped." Earlier, the home minister, state minister for home and many government policymakers advocated the need for extralegal murders. Regarding the war crimes trial, speaking at a programme in the capital, he declared that not only the crimes against humanity, but also war crimes of 1971 will be tried in line with the International Crimes Act. Apparently referring to Pakistani citizens, he said, "Even any country's citizen (who was involved with the crimes during 1971 war of independence from pakistan) will be put on trial." He dismissed out of hand comments by different quarters including the main opposition BNP that the trial process is just an eyewash. "It is not true," he asserted. Tk 10 crore has been set aside in the current budget for the trial and the same amount would be earmarked in the next budget, he said. "These initiatives indicate the government's good intention to hold the trial of war crimes." Asked how far the investigation has progressed, he said investigators will be done 'in due time' but they might as well say how much headway has been made. Asked about a political party's anti-government campaign to halt trial of 1971 crimes, he said legal steps would be taken. He was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the 15th annual district convention of Lions' Club International, District 315A, at Sonargaon Hotel. bdnews
