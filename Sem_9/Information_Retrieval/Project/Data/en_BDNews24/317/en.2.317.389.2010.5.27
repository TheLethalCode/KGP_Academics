 Chittagong, May 27  Mayoral candidate Manzur Alam urged Chittagong BNP leaders not to let him down in the election. He was addressing a representatives' meeting of BNP and its associate organizations. It was organised to express his gratitude for their backing in the upcoming election. He told the meeting that he will give his best to the welfare of the party. Recently, Manzur paid a courtesy visit to the party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia and obtained her support for competing in the CCC polls. Highlighting the importance of winning the poll, Manzur said, "It is a do-or-die situation. Those who sincerely love the party should work wholeheartedly for its sake." Addressing party activists, he continued, "Some members of the ruling party is trying to create a rift amongst us. But I want to stay with you." He warned everyone to be aware of conspiracies, saying, "This election cannot be taken as just any other, it has to be taken as a movement." Former mayor and metropolitan AL president ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is seeking an unprecedented fourth time in office under the banner of Nagorik Committee. His once close associate and three-time elected ward councillor under AL banner, Manzur Alam is his contender. bdnews24
