 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)Two allies have endorsed the countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike that the main opposition BNP has called for June 27. At separate meetings with BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Thursday night, top leaders of Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) and Islami Oikyo Jote (IOJ) told reporters that they would support the anti-government movement. The meetings with two components of the four-party alliance took place after a gap of one and a half years. The BJP delegation, led by party chairman Andalib Rahman Partho, sat with the BNP chairperson just before 10pm. Partho told reporters, "We had talks with the BNP chairperson about the movement. "We have given our full support to the June 27 hartal," he added. Mufti Fazlul Huq Amini led the 15-strong IOJ delegation to the meeting at 10:30pm. They came out of the BNP chief's political office in Gulshan at 11:15pm. IOJ secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami told bdnews24.com: "The opposition leader asked for our support in the anti-government movement. "We have endorsed the upcoming movement against the government," he added. Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan earlier said: "The meetings are part of exchange of views with the partners in four-party alliance, other like-minded parties and professionals ahead of the June 27 hartal and anti-government movement." However, meeting with Jamaat-e Islami, the second largest party in the alliance, was not yet scheduled. BNP last held talks with three of its alliance partners on Dec 29, 2008, when the last national elections were held. Khan said Khaleda would hold talks with National People's Party, National Democratic Alliance and Khelafat Mojlish on Saturday. BNP participated in the 2001 and 2008 national elections jointly with its alliance partners. They secured a landslide victory in 2001 but were swept aside by the Awami League-led Grand Alliance in 2008. bdnew
