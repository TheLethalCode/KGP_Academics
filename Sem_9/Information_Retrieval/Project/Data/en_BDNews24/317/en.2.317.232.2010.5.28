 Rajshahi University, May 28 (bdnews24.com)-Islami Chhatra Shibir cadres riding motorcycles entered the closed Rajshahi University campus late on Thursday night. The pro-ruling Awami League student organisation Bangladesh Chhatra League took out a procession on Friday protesting the incident and called for actions to resist Shibir, the opposition Jamaat-e-Islam-backed student group. On Jan 8, BCL activist Faruk Hossain was killed in an attack at the university by the Shibir activists, who also cut off the veins of four BCL activists. At least 50 BCL activists and several policemen were also injured in that attack. Fourteen cases, including one for murder, were filed with Motihar Police Station over the clashes. Police had arrested more than 150 leaders and activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and Shibir. A good number of their leaders and activists are also in hiding. Classes and exams were cancelled for three days after that clash. The summer vacation started on Apr 17 and classes are scheduled to resume on June 1. Thursday's show by the Shibir men, just a few days before the university opens, has caused fresh tension on the campus. Witnesses said at around 10:30pm, a group of some 18 youths on six motor bikes took out a procession of sorts on the campus that ended in front of the central library. They vandalised the effigy of Shibir placed there by BCL. They also threatened the night guards Kazim Ali and Nasir Uddin when they asked for their identity. They left campus through the Kajla Gate. Police were present at that time. Proctor Chowdhury M Zakaria said discussions were taking place with the police. Security on the campus would be increased, he added. Abul Khayer, officer in charge of Motihar Police Station, said more police would be deployed and that an investigation was underway. The university's BCL president Awwal Kabir demanded an immediate ban on Shibir politics and arrest of their leaders and activists. bdnew
