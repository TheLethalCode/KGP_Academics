 WASHINGTON, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Senate rejected a proposal on Thursday to require President Barack Obama to submit a timetable for pulling US forces out of Afghanistan, despite unease among some members of his own party over the nine-year-old war. The 80-18 vote nixed a bid by liberal Democrat Russ Feingold for a detailed troop timetable, which he argued would avoid future "emergency" war spending bills such as the $33 billion (22 billion pounds) one now before the Senate. Most members of the Democratic-majority Senate proved unwilling to dictate to the president, with a buildup of 30,000 additional troops still underway that Obama ordered to Afghanistan and a new military push in the Kandahar area. Adopting Feingold's plan would "reinforce the fear ... that the United States will abandon the region," Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat, said. Levin said this was unwise as the Taliban is "doing everything it can" to convince Afghans that US, NATO and Afghan forces cannot protect them. But several senators in Democratic leadership positions did back Feingold's call for an exit strategy. Supporters included Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin and senators Patty Murray, Byron Dorgan and Chuck Schumer. Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, opposed the proposal. Reid, who is in a tight race for re-election in a western state, said this week that "I've felt no impatience about Afghanistan in my caucus." Around the Senate, some anxiety could be heard now that US combat deaths have passed 1,000 in Afghanistan and the cost of the war topped $300 billion. The war in Iraq has cost over $700 billion, with 4,400 US military dead since 2003. "I'm impatient. Time to start thinking about a different approach, I think," Senator Tom Harkin said of Afghanistan earlier this week. Senator Jeff Bingaman, another Democrat, said: "I think there's a high level of impatience, but exactly what should be done legislatively about that issue, I don't know." He voted against Feingold's proposal; Harkin voted for it. END DATE SOUGHT Feingold acknowledged Obama had set July 2011 as a starting date for removing US troops, but said there should also be an end date. "The president should convey to the American and Afghan people how long he anticipates it will take to complete his military objectives," he said. There were no Republican votes for his plan. "Thanks to the McChrystal strategy, American forces have already brought pressure on the Taliban in Afghanistan. We need to keep that pressure up if this counterinsurgency strategy is to succeed, and it must," Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. General Stanley McChrystal is in charge of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan. The Senate also shelved a Republican proposal to find ways to pay for the new war spending with cuts to other programs. Reid scoffed at this idea, saying Republicans "never raised a fuss about paying for the war under President Bush." Reid wants the Senate to finish the war spending bill this week. The money must also be approved by the House of Representatives, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls it a "heavy lift" among Democrats wary of spending more on the battlefield. The House won't act until next month at the earliest. The Appropriations Committee had been expected to vote on its version of the bill Thursday, but the meeting was postponed. Obama requested $33 billion in February to pay for his Afghan surge, but Congress has been busy with domestic priorities and worried about scarce budget resources. The money comes on top of about $130 billion that Congress already approved for Afghanistan and Iraq for this year. The Senate version includes around $4 billion for a "civilian surge" of economic aid for Afghanistan and Pakis
