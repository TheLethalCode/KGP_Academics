 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)When his body arrived at Gopalganj town's DC Road for burial, the whole neighbourhood appeared dumbstruck at his unexpected demise in a road accident on Thursday. His parents are dumbfounded after losing their only son, 19-year-old Khondaker Khan Jahan Samrat, who was a first-year student at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. He was their only son, born after three daughters. Father KMS Alam was weeping and lamenting that he would never hear his son's voice again. "My son went to Dhaka to be an engineer and do something good for the country and its people." "The killer bus has snatched away my pride. Only minutes before his death, he was telling me about what he was learning at the university." "He told me that he has memorised many mechanical terms. I suggested that he writes them on paper as it would help strengthen his memory. He talked to his mother after me." Only 10 minutes later, a passer-by informed Alam over Samrat's mobile phone about his death in the accident. Relatives, classmates and friends flocked to their house after the news spread, creating a heart-wrenching scene. The youngest among the four children of KMS Alam, a retired deputy director of social welfare department, and Shamsunnahar, he was a favourite with family and friends. Samrat was born on July 5, 1991 at Khulna's Basupara. He obtained GPA 5 in both SSC and HSC exams. He began his class at BUET on May 22. Samrat left Ahsanullah Hall, where he was a resident, in the morning and was waiting for a bus at Azimpur that would take him to his elder sister Jannatul Naim's house at Mirpur. He was run over by a speeding bus in front of Eden College around 8:30am. When the casket carrying his body reached Gopalganj on Thursday evening the whole area was overwhelmed with sorrow and laments of parents, relatives, fellow students and neighbours. Following Namaj-e-Janaza at his family's original homestead at Batbari village in Sadar Upazila's Nizra union, Samrat was buried beside his grandfather at their family graveyard. bdnews
