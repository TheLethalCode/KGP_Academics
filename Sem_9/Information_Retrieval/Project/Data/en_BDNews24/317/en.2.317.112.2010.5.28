 NEW DELHI, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Maoist rebels sabotaged a high-speed train in West Bengal on Friday, killing at least 25 people after it smashed into the path of a goods train, officials said. Local television showed the mangled wreckage of capsized carriages across the tracks and the death toll could rise to between 50 and 60 as many passengers were still trapped. Dozens more were injured. Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee said a bomb had hit the train. Police said they were also looking at other sabotage methods such as removal of the tracks' "fish plates". The crash occurred in West Bengal in an area known to be a stronghold of Maoist rebels, but involvement of Maoists has not been confirmed. "At this stage I can confirm 25 deaths," Manoj Kumar, a railway official, told Reuters. "The toll will be much higher. "We can give a final figure only after rescue operations are complete. We have to cut open the compartments and bring out bodies." Air force helicopters were evacuating the injured. The Maoists, which number thousands of fighters across swathes of eastern and central India, have stepped up attacks in the last year. In April, 76 police were killed in an ambush in one of the heaviest tolls in years. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the insurgency as India's biggest internal security challenge and his Congress-led government has been under increasing political pressure to deal with the insurgents. The passenger train was going to Mumbai from Kolkata. The incident occurred in the state's Jhargram area at around 1:30 a.m. (2000 GMT). "From whatever I have been told the apprehension is the Maoists were involved," Banerjee said. TRAPPED PASSENGERS A reporter of the Telegraph newspaper described a scene of chaos and panic at the site. "People are crying. Rescuers are struggling to save the survivors and get the bodies out," Naresh Jana told Reuters. "I can see body parts hanging out of the compartments and under the wheels. I can hear people, women, crying for help from inside the affected coaches." The incident comes days after a passenger airliner crashed in southern India, killing 158 people, underscoring safety issues and concern that India's ageing infrastructure was failing to keep pace with an economic boom. The Maoists, who say they are fighting for the rights of the poor and landless, have attacked trains in the past, mostly in eastern India. In March, police suspected their hand in the derailment of India's most prestigious high-speed Rajdhani Express. Maoists have also taken over trains in past years in a show of strength, holding them for hours. The rebels, who often attack police, government buildings and infrastructure such as railway stations, have in recent months stepped up attacks in response to a government security offensive to clear them out of their jungle bases. The decades-old movement is now present in a third of the country. They are mostly spread in rural pockets of 20 of India's 28 states and hurt potential business worth billions of doll
