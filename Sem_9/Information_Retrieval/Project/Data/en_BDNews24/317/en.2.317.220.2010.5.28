 Chittagong, May 28 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong City mayoral candidates ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and M Manzur Alam on Friday launched their campaigns from shrines of two Islamic saints. Mohiuddin, the Awami League-backed candidate, visited the shrine of Shah Amanat, where he offered his Juma prayers at the mosque, exchanged greetings with the devotees and asked for their votes and blessings. He, however, did not give any formal speech. Mohiuddin is contesting the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation elections under the banner of Nagorik Committee. City AL organising secretary M A Rashid, ward councillor Jaharlal Hazari and hundreds of activists of the Awami League's associate organisations accompanied him. Earlier in the morning, Mohiuddin attended a party meeting at ward 17 (Baklia). Later in the afternoon, he attended several meetings at Shulakbahar, Chwakbazar, Chandranagar and Andarkilla. Mohiuddin urged the participants to elect him for an unprecedented fourth term in office. Mohiuddin said he wanted to build Chittagong as a modern and developed city like Singapore. "It is possible to develop this city like the Singapore City by tapping its potentials," Mohiuddin told reporters in the morning after attending a programme of the Chittagong Camera Journalists Forum. He pointed out that it was not only an election pledge. Mohiuddin claimed that the breaches within the party were cemented after the party had endorsed his candidature on May 22. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina a meeting with the Chittagong leaders on Thursday asked them to forget past disputes and work for Mohiuddin. Leaders who stood against Mohiuddin's nomination were called to the meeting, including Rezaul Karim Chowdhury. Following the meeting, party joint general secretary Mahabub-Ul-Alam Hanif said Rezaul would also work for Mohiuddin. Rezaul, before the meeting, had said that once Awami League and Mohiuddin were synonymous, but that "now the things have changed." The conflict between Mohiuddin and a Chittagong MP Nurul Islam BSC, who is also the city AL vice president, had peaked ahead of the elections. His followers had declared three candidates, all of whom who had collected nomination papers but only Rezaul had submitted them. Manzur, the main opposition BNP-backed hopeful, offered Juma and special prayers at the shrines of Shah Amanat and Badar Shah Awlia in the city. He formally began his campaign through participating at a views-exchange meeting with leaders of BNP and its associate organisations of Patharghata Ward-34. Running the election under the banner of Chittagong Development Movement, an organisation of pro-BNP professionals, Manzur asked everyone to sink past differences and work for him to build Chittagong as a modern city. He warned of possible bid by the Awami League to rig the ballot. "Everyone will have to guard ballot boxes so that the party in power can no way resort to rigging." Former acting mayor and long-time councilor, Manzur got the green light from the main opposition party on May 17. He was involved with Awami League politics for a long time and filled in for former mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. He ran in the ninth parliament polls as an independent candidate from a Chittagong seat and finished third. bdnews24.co
