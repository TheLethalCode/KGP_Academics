<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, May 27(bdnews24.com)--Experts of Geological Survey of Bangladesh (GSB) have told the people of Rupganj Upazila that there was no reason to panic over the cracks in the lands. A kilometer-long crack developed in Boropa and Sutalra villages in Tarabo municipality under the Upazila on Tuesday which locals say has been increasing in range and depth. Moreover, deep cracks were also seen at around 50 points, each 2-3 feet wide in Golakandail and Hatab areas. The cracks caused panic among the people, and hundreds crowded to see them every day. On Thursday, special prayers were offered at Boropa, Mollabari Jam-e-Masjid and other neighbouring mosques. Many have moved away their household items and cattle. A four-member expert team headed by ASM Maksud Kamal, GSB's director, visited the spots on Thursday and advised the people to not panic. Two teams of Dhaka and Demra's Fire Service and Civil Defence also visited the spot. Rafiq Mollah, a resident of Boropa, said, "We are concerned over the matter. We think that the cracks occurred because of local industries lifting vast quantity of water from the underground reserves through deep tubewells." Kamal, also an earthquake specialist and advisor of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Project (CDMP), said after visiting the spots that initially data were being collected. "After analysing and testing the data, we will be able to deduce the reasons for the cracks. However, our primary suspicion is that water from the rainy season has seeped into fossil or pit layers leading to expansions underground." "Also, layers formed with old and decomposed trees that were covered by earth could cause the cracks. Landslides may occur when they are not compatible with surrounding layers. It is not something to panic about," observed the GSB director. However, Kamal said soil testing was mandatory in case of high-rise and bridge constructions. Rupganj Upazila Nirbahi officer Nahida Sultana Mallick on Tuesday told bdnews24.com: "I visited the site. There are cracks at different places with 5-7 feet depth, even inside a house." No casualties were reported yet, she said, adding that "it might happen due to pulling out of water in the Rupganj industrial area." The crack was also seen in the embankment area of Agrani irrigation Project. b
