<TEXT>
 Rangpur, May 14 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has termed a recent television news item about his illness as 'baseless', claiming "they wanted me to die". Proclaiming himself as the only authority in Rangpur, the former military dictator said "no-one will be allowed to boss around". He also advised those who oppose him to leave the party, saying that "they won't be allowed to stay." Ershad was speaking at the meeting of Rangpur district's new convening committee. The octogenarian leader was recently hospitalised. During that time, both broadcast and print media reported about his illness. Pointing out the error made by a particular television channel, Ershad said, I was alive and under treatment in the hospital. A TV channel reported that I was dead and that I was in coma. They wanted me to die." He, however, did not name the channel. Ershad also said that he should not have kept his Dhaka constituency seat instead of Rangpur. He expressed his desire to fix this error by saying "I want to die after becoming the parliament member from Rangpur Sadar constituency in the next election" The JP chief also termed Rangpur as the fortress of his party. He said that his younger brother GM Kader has been made the convener of JP's Rangpur section and that he wants to see his party winning all the parliament seats of Rangpur in the next election under Kader's leadership. Warning the main government party Awami League, the JP chief said that AL will not be able to remain in power without their support. The new members of the committee were present in the meeting presided by GM Kader. JP activists of Badarganj and Pirganj began fighting as soon as Ershad left. The local party leaders, however, managed to bring the situation under control. b
