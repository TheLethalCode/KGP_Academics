 NIAMEY, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The security forces in Niger defused a second landmine in the capital Niamey on Wednesday, hours after the director of a private radio station was killed when his vehicle ran over a similar device. The attacks were the first of their kind in the capital since the start of a Tuareg-led rebellion in the former French colony's desert north almost a year ago, an uprising which has mainly targeted army patrols and remote garrisons in the Sahara.

The MNJ denied responsibility for those attacks, blaming them on "Niger army militias" they said were aiming to discredit the insurgency and justify a security crackdown.
