 NAIROBI, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition on Friday called three days of nationwide protests next week to put pressure on President Mwai Kibaki's government after the collapse of mediation efforts over a disputed election. Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) also called for international sanctions on Kibaki, who was re-elected in the Dec. 27 poll, saying world leaders would be irresponsible to trust him with "a single cent". "We are asking our countrymen and women with whom we feel such great sadness and solidarity to join us in demonstrations countrywide on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week," ODM secretary general Anyang' Nyong'o told reporters. Odinga's supporters say Kibaki stole the vote. "Kenyans are entitled to protest peacefully at this blatant violation of their fundamental rights," Nyong'o said, adding that Kibaki's team looked "hell-bent" on clinging to power. The ODM said protests would be held in nearly 30 places around Kenya, and that it had asked police to provide security for a mass rally on Wednesday in a central Nairobi park. Previous protests have led to riots and vicious clashes between Odinga's supporters and the security forces, adding to a death toll of around 500 since the ballot. The government has said it will not allow more protests, and police in riot gear patrolled parts of the capital on Friday. "Dialogue is not engaged in the streets. Dialogue suggests that people resolve their differences peacefully, over a table, not through destroying property and killing innocent Kenyans," Local Government Minister Uhuru Kenyatta told reporters. The unrest has tarnished Kenya's democratic credentials, damaged east Africa's largest and previously booming economy, hit supplies to neighbours, and unnerved Western donors. This week's failure of AU head and Ghanaian President John Kufuor to broker a deal has dismayed Kenyans enduring one of the worst chapters of their nation's post-independence history. Kufuor flew out empty-handed on Thursday, but said former U.N. head Kofi Annan, another Ghanaian, would lead a group of eminent Africans in a new push to resolve the crisis. ODM said Annan would fly in on Tuesday, 24 hours before the planned mass protest in Nairobi's Uhuru (Freedom) Park. "MORTAL COMBAT" Analysts say Odinga has lost momentum in recent days as Kibaki entrenches himself by appointing the core of a new cabinet, carrying out state functions and recalling parliament. Aides to the 76-year-old president, a veteran of Kenyan politics and member of the nation's largest and most powerful Kikuyu tribe, say the opposition's refusal to meet Kibaki face-to-face shows it is not interested in dialogue. ODM say they will only meet if an international mediator is present. Kibaki and Odinga, a 63-year-old former political prisoner and wealthy businessman, have not met since the vote, even though they have had close ties in the past including when the opposition leader sat in Kibaki's cabinet from 2002-05. Around Kenya, there is widespread frustration that the poor have largely paid the price of the unrest while the political elite have stayed in comfortable and well-guarded compounds. As well as the death toll, which Odinga told Reuters was already nearing 1,000, more than a quarter of a million Kenyans are homeless from ethnic clashes since Kibaki was sworn in on Dec. 30. "Our leaders are stuck in mortal combat, unable to rise above their ambitions and put the interests of the country and the people first," wrote Daily Nation columnist Lucy Oriang. The West, including the United States and Kenya's former colonial ruler Britain, has expressed displeasure at irregularities in the presidential vote count, and has been pressing for some sort of power-sharing agreement. Kibaki has said he will consider a coalition, while Odinga would prefer a re-run of the election. With key sectors like tourism and commodities hit by the crisis, analysts say the full impact on one of Africa's brightest economies depends wholly on how long it lasts.
