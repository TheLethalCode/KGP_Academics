<TITLE> US embassy reposts $1mln reward over Athens attack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ATHENS, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US embassy in Athens on Thursday reposted a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest of unknown attackers who launched a grenade strike on its building a year ago. Greek police have so far failed to make any headway in the case, the most high-profile attack by a guerrilla group since the dismantling of the extreme left November 17 leftist guerrilla group in 2002. "A group calling itself Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility shortly after last year's attack," the embassy said in a statement. "There have been no arrests in connection with the ongoing investigation, despite the efforts of the Greek government." The leftist group, which emerged after the capture of the November 17 group, took responsibility for the rocket-propelled grenade attack on the embassy that caused minor damage to the building and no casualties. In the past few years it has also attempted to kill the culture minister and bombed the Athens courts and the economy ministry. No member of the leftist group has ever been caught.
