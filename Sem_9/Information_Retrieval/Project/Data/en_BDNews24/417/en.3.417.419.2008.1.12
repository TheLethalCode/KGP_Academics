<TITLE> Hormuz incident shows Iran a threat: top US officer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sat Jan 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tense encounter between US Navy ships and Iranian boats in the Gulf shows Iran poses a threat and the United States is ready to counter it, the top US military officer said on Friday. "There's no doubt in my mind that shots would have been fired, had the situation demanded it," said Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The incident ought to remind us all just how real is the threat posed by Iran and just how ready we are to meet that threat if it comes to it," Mullen told reporters. "We will defend ourselves and our ships, and we will do so with deadly force if need be," he said at the Pentagon. According to the United States, five Iranian speedboats maneuvered aggressively close to three US Navy ships in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and the U.S. ships received a radio transmission threatening an explosion. On Friday, the Pentagon released what it said was full, unedited video of the encounter, lasting around 36 minutes. The United States has formally complained about the incident. Iranian officials have dismissed US objections, saying the encounter was normal and the Iranian boats were merely trying to identify the U.S. vessels. The incident was another sign of tension between the United States and Iran, at odds over a range of issues including Tehran's nuclear program and its alleged role in Iraq. A Navy spokeswoman said US and Iranian vessels had been involved in two other incidents in the Strait of Hormuz in the past month. On December 19, the USS Whidbey Island fired warning shots to deter a small Iranian craft and on December 22, three small Iranian craft that had been shadowing the USS Carr turned away after blasts of the American ship's whistle, the spokeswoman said. The Strait of Hormuz is the most prominent potential "choke point" for crude oil flows, handling 17 million barrels per day, or two-fifths of globally traded oil. CLOSE TO OPENING FIRE U.S. officials have said US sailors were close to opening fire in Sunday's encounter before the Iranian boats moved away. They have said they believe the boats came from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. "I'd much rather prevent a war than fight one. We'd all prefer Iran to take a more productive, positive role in the region. And I support the use of economic and diplomatic measures to help bring that about," Mullen said. "But our own military restraint in dealing with that problem should in turn never be confused for a lack of capability." Some US commentators have suggested the US sailors should have opened fire and their restraint will be interpreted by Iran as a sign of weakness. But Mullen, a former head of the US Navy, said the crews' actions had been "exactly right." The United States and Iran had already issued video footage to support their conflicting accounts of the incident. The United States also has released the recording of a message it says was received by the US ships. "You will explode after ... minutes," a heavily accented voice on the recording says. US officials initially said the audio was believed to have come from one of the Iranian boats but they have since said they are not certain of its exact origin. "I can't shed any light as far as the radio transmission is concerned," Mullen said. "If you're out there on the bridge, it's hard to tell where (radio transmissions are) coming fro
