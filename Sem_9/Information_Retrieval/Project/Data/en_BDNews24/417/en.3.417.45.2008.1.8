<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan Tuesday said the advisers might have been removed from their posts. The four advisers resigned for their failure to do their jobs properly, he said. His comments came hours after law adviser Mainul Hosein, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury quit the technocratic government. Khan, former finance adviser who also resigned his post before the army-backed government came to power in mid-January, said: "The four advisers' resignations and mine are not the same." "We resigned out of conscience," he said. "We had realised that it was not possible for us to ensure a free and fair election at the time," Khan said. "The way government officials are removed from their posts for failure to do their jobs properly, the same thing may have happened to the four advisers," Khan said. "These are routine resignations," he said. Commenting on the pledges for elections expected by the end of 2008, Khan said: "If the government fails to hold elections within the promised date it will be a big disaster." "The whole process will be unconstitutional," he said. Khan said the country was going through a crisis and the prices of essential commodities went beyond the common reach. "In this situation, it is not possible for an unelected government to run the country anymore." The RRC chairman said: "For the same reason, the caretaker government should transfer power to an elected government." bdn
