<TITLE> Bush launches Middle East peace drive in Israel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush headed to the Middle East on Wednesday, aiming to nurture Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in the face of deep scepticism and try to rally Arab opposition to Iran. Once wary of hands-on Middle East diplomacy, Bush will make his first presidential visit to Israel and the West Bank in a bid to shore up fragile negotiations aimed at forging a peace treaty by the end of the year. "What has to happen in order for there to be a peaceful settlement of a long-standing dispute is ... outlines of a (Palestinian) state clearly defined," Bush said at the White House before flying to Israel. But chances of an agreement before Bush leaves office in January 2009 appear slim, and no breakthroughs are expected during three days of talks following up on an international conference he hosted in Annapolis, Maryland, in November. With security in Israel tight for the visit, Bush will travel to Jerusalem after a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Shimon Peres. He goes to Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Thursday to see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush will attempt to nudge Olmert and Abbas, both of them politically weak, to move forward in talks already bogged down in recriminations since the Annapolis summit. The Palestinians have been upset over Jewish settlement expansion and Israel is threatening to escalate attacks on militants in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip in response to cross-border rocket fire. While Bush has called settlement expansion an "impediment", doubts remain over how much pressure he will be willing to put on Israel, a key ally, to make compromises. Critics have accused Bush of neglecting the Middle East's most intractable conflict during seven years in office. Now his trip is meant to show he is keeping his pledge to get involved. During a tour of the region that will include a number of Arab countries, Bush also will hope to enlist support to help contain Iran, a goal underscored by a confrontation between U.S. and Iranian vessels in the Strait of Hormuz at the weekend. JEWISH SETTLEMENT At talks on Tuesday smoothing the way for Bush's visit, Olmert and Abbas authorised negotiations on thorny issues such as borders and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees. It is unclear, however, how they could close a deal. Abbas and his Fatah faction wield little power beyond the West Bank after Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip in June. Weakened by the 2006 Lebanon war, Olmert could face new calls to resign at the end of the month when a commission issues its final report on the conflict. His coalition government is already under strain over peace talks on core issues. "Without talking about these issues there is no chance to move forward, and it is important that it happens right when the president arrives for a visit ... which will push the process forward, and this is positive," said Israeli Vice Premier Haim Ramon. In the Gaza Strip, Hamas issued a statement calling Bush "the biggest devil". For Bush, who disdained the failed peace effort of former President Bill Clinton in the twilight of his presidency, the underlying motive of the trip appears to be about using his waning months in office to shape a legacy not completely defined by the unpopular war in Iraq. Many analysts say that if Israelis and Palestinians are to resolve differences, it will require direct, sustained presidential engagement. But Bush has made clear he has no intention of adopting what his administration once derided as Clinton's "shoot the moon" approach to Middle East peacemaking. Bush, who last visited Israel as Texas governor, has been vague about his trip's objectives and has no plans even to hold a three-way meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. His itinerary includes a stop in Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity. He will also make stops in Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt to press Arab allies to help rein in Ir
