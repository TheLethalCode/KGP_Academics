<TITLE> Govt opens nationwide OMS to curb rice prices </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government began selling rice at subsidised prices under a makeshift arrangement across the country Wednesday to curb the price of the staple. Director general of the food department Mollah Wahiduzzaman launched the Open Market Sales programme from an outlet in Motijheel, Dhaka. Wahid said that the effort would help curb the prices amid growing concerns that low-income people are facing difficulties in procuring rice at market rates. The government fixed Tk 25 for one kilogram of rice against the market price of Tk 30-32. A family can buy three kilograms of rice daily under the programme. "We have introduced the programme in all divisions, districts, upazilas and municipalities," Wahid said. On why the government did not introduce the programme at the village level, he said: "Substantial amounts of rice are in stock in many village houses. That's why we have not made it (at village level)." He said the government also made a number of alternative programmes in rural areas, including vulnerable group feeding, test relief and food for work. The rice will be sold through 1,990 dealers countrywide who will sell 850 kg a day. Some 450 dealers have been deployed in the Dhaka metropolitan area. To run the programme the government has allocated a total of 25,372 tonnes of rice for this month. Apart from this some 20,000 rice have been allocated for the outlets run by Bangladesh Rifles. The OMS comes as the government faces low public confidence after the prices of rice recently shot up at an abnormal rate. Amid a fear of a possible food crisis, such sudden price escalation of rice rang a warning bell for the government. Last year's two spells of flooding and the Nov 15 cyclone caused a huge loss of crops countrywide. The council of advisers decided in a meeting on Dec 9 to sell rice in the open market. bdnews24.com/
