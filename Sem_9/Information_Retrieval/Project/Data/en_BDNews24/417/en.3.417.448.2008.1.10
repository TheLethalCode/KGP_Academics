 NAIROBI, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Efforts by international mediators to end Kenya's post-election political impasse have failed, a source close to the talks said on Thursday. "The negotiations have failed," the source said, adding that African Union head John Kufuor was leaving Kenya after separate meetings with President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga who says he was robbed of the Dec. 27 election. Minutes later, however, Kufuor told reporters the parties had agreed to "work together" under an Afican panel to be headed by former U.N. head Kofi Annan.
