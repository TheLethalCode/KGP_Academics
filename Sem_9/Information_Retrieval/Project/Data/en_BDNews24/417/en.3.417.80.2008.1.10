<TITLE> Cloud over cricket leagues fails to clear </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The uncertainty over the start of the premier and first division leagues lingered on with a meeting between the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the clubs on Thursday failing to clear the clouds. BCB president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali Thursday sat with the club representatives to thrash out a way to hold the leagues after the High Court on Nov 25 froze a BCB decision to relegate Brothers Union and Indira Road KC to the first division. However, no representative of Brothers Union, which filed the writ petition to the court, attended the meeting. The meeting asked Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club to get the message across to the Brothers that the BCB would not sit with the Gopibagh-based club until it retracted the writ petition against the board. "[We] sat with those clubs that have made a lot of contribution in Bangladesh's cricket and we want reflection of opinions of those clubs on our plan. That's why we have had a meeting with them," Jamali said after emerging from the three-hour meeting at Hotel Sheraton. On whether Brothers skipping the meeting added to the uncertainty over holding the leagues, the BCB boss said, "We invited them, but what can we do if they don't turn up? "It is not wise to comment on the complication of law and there is no way to seek a compromise on the matter after it went to the court," said Jamali. He added that they could not discuss the matter with Brothers as it had sent a legal notice to the board. Jamali added the board wanted to give Brothers some more time before the relegation matches and to provide supports including money and players, if needed. "It's not a good sign at all to go to court over matters in sports," said the BCB chief. "We can hold the league by getting a court verdict, or it can be done by withdrawing the writ petition." Abahani director Kazi Nabil Ahmed said, "All the club representatives who attended the meeting agreed to play and representatives of Abahani and Mohammedan will request Brothers to withdraw the writ petition." bdnew
