 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)Five advisers poised to fill as many cabinet vacancies will be sworn into office Wednesday. Three of them confirmed to bdnews24.com that they had been invited to the swearing-in ceremony at Bangabhaban at 6:30pm. Former BIDS senior research fellow Hossain Zillur Rahman, retired major general Golam Quader and former ADAB director Rasheda K Choudhury told bdnews24.com's Ahmed Dipu that they were considering the invitations. Former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali, another widely heard name, told bdnews24.com's Ehsanul Haque that all would be revealed on television, but would not comment further on whether he had been invited to take the oath. AF Hassan Ariff, former attorney general under the four-party coalition government, has also been invited to the presidential palace for oath-taking to fill the fifth vacant post of adviser, his assistant Ashik Al Jalil told bdnews24.com. In a dramatic turn of events, law adviser Mainul Hosein, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury quit the Fakhruddin administration Tuesday. Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri was the first to resign his post on Dec 26, taking responsibility for the loss of two rare Vishnu statues. The resignations piqued people's curiosity about the new advisers as bdnews24.com revealed the names of the probable cabinet members early Wednesday. The 'resignations', which some top government officials said were forced, came three days before the anniversary of the changeover by the military-backed government. In instant reaction Tuesday, Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said the advisers might have been removed from their posts. "Government officials are removed from their posts for failure to do their jobs properly. The same thing may have happened to the advisers," Khan said. "These are routine resignations," he said. bdnews24.com/ti
