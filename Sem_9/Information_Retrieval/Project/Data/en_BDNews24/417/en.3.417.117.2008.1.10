 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Technology Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The country's leading mobile operator Grameenphone has introduced BlackBerry wireless solutions to provide clients with access to a wide range of business and lifestyle applications. The applications include options such as emailing, browsing, messaging, organiser, phone and multimedia. GP joined hands with the Canada-based Research in Motion, or RIM, to provide the services. Unveiling the new plan at a news briefing, the officials of the both companies said Wednesday they were optimistic that the new services would enormously benefit the clients, especially the corporate ones. The BlackBerry solutions will be provided through the GP's Business Solutions, a special package for businesses. GP CEO Anders Jensen said: "The BlackBerry platform is the gold standard in mobility for business users around the world. We are proud to be the first mobile operator to launch the BlackBerry wireless solution in Bangladesh, bringing in the next level of global connectivity for businesses." The GP will initially offer the BlackBerry 8700g and BlackBerry Pearl smartphones in conjunction with BlackBerry Enterprise Server and BlackBerry internet service. The BlackBerry 8700g and the BlackBerry Pearl will operate on the GP's EDGE/GPRS enabled GSM network. The BlackBerry 8700g comes with a full QWERTY keyboard and delivers fast performance for wireless email, web browsing and other mobile applications along with other features. The BlackBerry Pearl smartphone is packed with powerful communication and multimedia capabilities and yet it is incredibly sleek and stylish, the company said in a statement. Norm W K Lo, vice president of the RIM's Asia Pacific operations, was optimistic. "Everywhere in the world, mobile communication is a fast growing business. We are excited to be here in Bangladesh," Norm Lo told bdnews24.com on the sidelines of the news briefing Wednesday. He said like other countries in South Asia they hoped to succeed in Bangladesh. "We successfully offer BlackBerry in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. We expect the same in Bangladesh," he said. Bangladesh has been the latest addition since the services continue to grow across the world, he said. Currently, Blackberry has 12 million subscribers around the world, and the officials expect to sign up over 1.8 million subscribers by the next quarter of the year. Norm Lo said Bangladesh is going to be its good market. "We want to do business in Bangladesh. There is a great future," he said. Describing BlackBerry's client base, the official said the US Navy and FBI, and Australia and governments in many other countries use the services. Based in Waterloo, Ontario, RIM is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative wireless solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market. Founded in 1984, RIM operates offices in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. RIM is listed on the Nasdaq Stock market and the Toronto Stock exchange. Meanwhile, a top Banglalink executive told bdnews24.com that the second largest mobile operator in Bangladesh was also coming up with its own push email solutions. "I can assure you it'll have exciting features," said Omer Rashid, Banglalink's director of marketing who leads arguably the most aggressive marketing campaign in Bangladesh. He would not give details. bdnews
