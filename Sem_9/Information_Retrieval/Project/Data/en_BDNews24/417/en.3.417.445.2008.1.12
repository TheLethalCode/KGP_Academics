<TEXT>
 Boston, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Arabs who raised nearly $2 million for an Islamic charity were convicted of defrauding the US government by using the tax-free donations to support holy war and holy warriors, prosecutors said on Friday. A federal jury in Boston on Friday found Libyan-born Emadeddin Muntasser, Muhamed Mubayyid, a Lebanon native and Samir Al-Monla, an immigrant from Kuwait, guilty of conspiring to defraud the government and scheming to hide information from it, the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, Michael Sullivan said. The men could face five years in prison for each charge. Muntasser, who was turned down for U.S. citizenship, was also convicted of making false statements while Mubayyid was convicted of submitting false tax returns. Their attorney could not be reached for comment. The government said Muntasser founded a group called Care International, ostensibly to raise money for "charitable, religious, educational, and scientific purposes." But prosecutors said he and the others also collected funds to publish and distribute newsletters which "actively promoted 'jihad,' or holy war, involving 'mujahideen,' or Islamic holy warriors." The Massachusetts-based charity, which is not related to the well-known relief group CARE International, was not required to pay taxes on money it raised for humanitarian aid and collected roughly $1.7 million in donations between 1993 and 2003 without paying tax. "Today's convictions should be a warning to organizations or persons who intend to fund their support of any militant organization or goal, including the mujahideen and jihad, by abusing our nation's tax laws, that they will be pro actively investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Sullivan said in a statement. While Care International performed some real charitable work, it also used some of the money it collected to finance the publication and distribution of what prosecutors call a "pro-jihad book" called "Join the Caravan."
