 SYDNEY, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's troubled tour of Australia is expected to proceed as planned after the International Cricket Council (ICC) bowed to pressure on Tuesday and sacked umpire Steve Bucknor. The ICC caved in to India's demands to axe Bucknor from next week's third test in Perth as well as appointing match referee Ranjan Madugalle as a mediator to resolve the bitter dispute between the teams following last week's ill-tempered match in Sydney. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) immediately welcomed the moves and said it was likely the tour would resume after it was suspended on Monday. "Definitely I'm happy," BCCI president Sharad Pawar told reporters in New Delhi. "Particularly I'm grateful to the Australian board for taking a very positive approach in the matter." The BCCI had told their players to remain in Sydney rather than travel to Canberra for their next practice game, until Harbhajan Singh's appeal against a three-match suspension was heard. Harbhajan was banned for calling Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds a "monkey" but has denied the charges and appealed against the ruling. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed confirmed that Harbhajan would be allowed to resume playing until the case was decided but there was no guarantee it would be heard before the third test starts in Perth next Wednesday. BOWDEN IN However, a separate case into allegations of abusive language by Australian all-rounder Brad Hogg would be heard before the next match started, the ICC said. Speed is hopeful the game will go ahead as planned after the ICC appointed New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden to officiate alongside Pakistan's Asad Rauf. India wanted Bucknor sacked as punishment for a series of blunders the 61-year-old West Indian made in the Sydney test that contributed to their defeat. Speed said the ICC did not normally allow member nations to interfere with the umpires but the change was necessary to ensure the tour continued. "Steve accepts that his presence was a problem and in the best interests of the game he accepted the decision," Speed said. "It is an extraordinary set of circumstances and we want to take some of the tension out of the situation." Speed said Madugalle would fly to Perth to speak to Australia captain Ricky Ponting and Indian skipper Anil Kumble before the match. Relations between the two teams have hit rock bottom since last week's drama-charged match in Sydney which ended with Kumble accusing the Australians of breaching the spirit of cricket. "We are bringing Ranjan in as a facilitator in an effort to prevent any ill-feeling that may have been present at the Sydney test from rolling over to Perth," Speed said. "I believe the captains need to sit with Rajan Madugalle and listen to what he has to say and express to him what their problems are, resolve those issues and move forward." Australia lead the four-match series 2-0 after wins in Melbourne and Sydney
