<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei sought clarity from Iran on Friday about an atomic programme the West fears may ultimately yield warheads. A diplomat close to the International Atomic Energy Agency said an IAEA investigation stonewalled by Iran for years until August had entered a final phase, addressing US intelligence about past, covert attempts to "weaponise" atomic material. Making his first Iran trip in almost two years, ElBaradei began talks with Iranian atomic energy chief Gholamreza Aghazadeh. On Saturday, he will meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. "Regarding the active cooperation of Iran with the agency (IAEA) and resolving ... important matters about Iran's nuclear issue, Tehran's relations with the agency have entered a new phase," the deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Saeedi, told the official IRNA news agency. ElBaradei's last visit in April 2006 made no headway in getting Iran to be open about a programme it maintains is meant only to generate energy but was long hidden from the IAEA. The Tehran talks coincide with a Middle East tour by US President George W. Bush, who has said Iran is a "threat to world peace" and is seeking Arab support to rein in Iran. Tehran dismisses US charges and says its nuclear plans are peaceful. The Islamic Republic and the United States are now embroiled in another row over a naval incident in the Strait of Hormuz. Washington says three of its warships were threatened by small Iranian craft on Sunday. Iran says it was a routine contact. IRAN WANTS CASE CLOSED "We hope Mr ElBaradei in Iran, seeing more realities ... makes an effort to completely close Iran's dossier at the agency..." powerful cleric Ahmad Khatami said in a sermon. The IAEA says the file cannot be closed before Iran allows wider inspections under the Additional Protocol to verify there is no secret nuclear activity geared to bomb-making. No progress has been made on this issue, unlike the inquiry into Iran's nuclear history. But ElBaradei was expected to press for compliance with the Protocol, critical to defusing mistrust in Iran's intentions that prompted two sets of UN sanctions. Influential ex-nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani suggested Iran would expand cooperation with the IAEA if its file were returned to the agency by the UN Security Council. The West rules that out without full compliance and a halt to enrichment. Iran has rejected Security Council resolutions demanding an enrichment suspension in exchange for talks on trade benefits. But prospects of harsher UN sanctions sought by Washington have receded since a U.S. intelligence report in December that said Iran apparently halted an active atomic bomb programme in 2003. Iran denies ever having had such a programme. Some Western nations fear the US report has eased pressure on Iran to heed international demands for restraint. Iran said in August it would answer outstanding questions in sequence about its nuclear past but an end-of-year target mooted by ElBaradei for completing the process passed with the most sensitive issues still unresolved.
