<TITLE> Russian presidential heir backs stronger navy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's anointed successor, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Friday he supported plans to revive Russia's naval strength but it would take time, Interfax news agency reported. "The navy must be revived so that Russia is a naval power," said Medvedev, now first deputy prime minister, at a meeting with crew members of the Kapitan Morgun in the northwest Arctic port of Murmansk, Interfax reported. Putin endorsed Medvedev's candidacy last month, and Medvedev is expected to win the presidential election next March easily. "We were respected when we were a naval power," Medvedev was quoted as saying. "Such work is slower than one would like it to be, but this is the first time in the past 20 years that we have tackled it," he said. Russia has increased spending on many areas of its military machine in recent years after a decade of neglect following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
