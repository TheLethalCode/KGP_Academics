 MADRID, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's prime minister on Wednesday accused the opposition of "unpatriotically" sowing alarm about the economy and promised to create jobs and boost the minimum wage if his government is re-elected in March. With a spike in inflation and signs a property bubble might be about to burst, the economy has been transformed from the government's trump card into a problem in a matter of months. Polls showing a jump in the number of Spaniards worried about money matters have been a gift to the conservative opposition, which has accused the government of failing to prepare for bad times and of playing down their seriousness. In an address to business leaders, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero turned the Popular Party's language against it, accusing the conservatives of sowing panic and therefore making economic suffering more likely. "It's perfectly permissible to criticise government economic policy as hard as you like, but creating unjustified alarm about a country's economy can damage expectations. When criticism is not fair or objective, allow me to say that this is the most unpatriotic behaviour imaginable," Zapatero said, as he made promises to create jobs and hike low wages. The government expects growth of 3.8 percent in 2007, continuing a decade in which Spain has been one of the euro zone's best performers. But there are signs that the credit crisis has put an end to the rapid accumulation of household debt which fuelled the construction boom that provided much of the growth. The stock market is also rattled, with shares in one leading property company, Colonial, plummeting over the holiday period amid fears about its debt load. OPPOSITION POUNCES The opposition has pounced on rising unemployment and inflation data -- Spain's EU-harmonised harmonised inflation jumped to a higher than expected 4.3 percent in December, its highest in 12 years. The PP's economic spokesman, Miguel Arias, has accused Zapatero of "closing his eyes" to growing economic problems. But the prime minister, whose Socialists have a narrow lead over the PP ahead of the general elections on March 9, said Spain was well placed to withstand the economic shockwaves he blamed on the U.S. subprime crisis and the credit crisis. "There are multiple reasons to expect that the impact (of world economic troubles) is going to be limited and short, and won't affect countries equally," he said. He pointed to a banking system which has escaped major losses from subprime strife and said four consecutive years of budget surplus allowed "ample room for fiscal manoeuvre." A new Socialist government would further boost the minimum wage to 800 euros a month from the current 600 euros during its four-year term and aim to create from 1.6 million to 2 million jobs, he said. Announcing measures likely to appeal to his business audience, he also promised to eliminate red tape and promote the restoration of town centres, a move he said would provide work for construction companies seeing housing demand evaporate. Income tax will also be simplified, said Zapatero, but he said he was not going to try to match PP promises of tax cuts for low earners. "I don't think it's good for us to engage in an excessive competition of promises on taxation in election times," Zapatero sa
