 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Five advisers poised to fill as many cabinet vacancies will be sworn into office Wednesday. Three individuals Wednesday confirmed to bdnews24.com that they had been invited to the swearing-in ceremony at Bangabhaban at 6.30pm. Former BIDS senior research fellow Hossain Zillur Rahman, former ADAB director Rasheda K Chowdhury and former NSI chief retired major general Golam Quader told bdnews24.com's Ahmed Dipu that they were considering the invitations. Another widely heard name, former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali, told bdnews24.com's Ehsanul Haque that all would be revealed on television, but would not comment further on whether he had been invited to take the oath. Former attorney general under the four-party coalition government, AF Hasan Arif, is expected by many to fill the fifth vacant post of adviser. Several officials, asking not to be named, said the Bangabhaban is ready for a 6:30pm swearing-in ceremony. The government has already handpicked the five people from different sectors for the new jobs, the officials said Tuesday. In a dramatic turn of events, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein, health and religious affairs adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury quit the Fakhruddin administration Tuesday. Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri was the first to resign his post on Dec 26 after two rare Vishnu statues went missing. The 'resignations', which some top government officials said were forced, came three days before the anniversary of the changeover by the military-backed government. In instant reaction Tuesday, Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said the advisers might have been removed from their posts. "Government officials are removed from their posts for failure to do their jobs properly. The same thing may have happened to the advisers," Khan said. "These are routine resignations," he said. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim had earlier told bdnews24.com that the swearing-in ceremony for new advisers would take place Wednesday. Munaim did not name the new advisers. bdnews24.
