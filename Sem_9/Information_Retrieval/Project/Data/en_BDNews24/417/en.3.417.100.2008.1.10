<TITLE> Bangladeshis confusing polls with price hike, resignations: Pasi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  US charge d'affaires Geeta Pasi Thursday said Bangladeshis were confusing holding of the elections with issues such as the price hike of essentials and the resignation of the advisers. "I think you Bangladeshis are confusing the roadmap with other issues (such as the price hike of essentials and the resignation of advisers)," Pasi said to journalists after attending a certificate-awarding ceremony in Baridhara in the city. She made the remark when asked whether she thought soaring prices of essentials and the resignation of advisers would derail the roadmap the Election Commission had announced. She renewed the call on the caretaker government to restore democracy "no later than 2008" and said the US policy toward the administration would remain the same. "The US policy continues to remain the same. We support caretaker efforts to comply with the election roadmap for free and fair elections no later than this year." Pasi attended the programme to award certificates among some personnel of private security company Group 4 Securicor who extinguished fire at a house of the US embassy in Dhaka on July 2 last year. "We continue to urge the caretaker government to restore democracy to Bangladesh", she said. "We are very much in support of the caretaker government and the people of Bangladesh and working closely with the government and supporting their efforts." Terming the voter registration programme 'massive', she said registering 90 million people was really tough for any government. "I think the project will expand further." bd
