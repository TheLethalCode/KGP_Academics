 Dhaka, Jan 08 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court Tuesday issued a rule asking the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the corruption case against detained Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and his wife should not be declared illegal. Upon a writ petition, the court also stayed the proceedings against wife Hasina Mohiuddin in the case. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Abdul Awal gave the ACC four weeks' time to prove their case is legal. The ACC chairman, secretary and deputy director in Chittagong have been named respondents in this ruling. ACC deputy director for Chittagong Md Arif Siddiqi filed the case on Dec 2, 2007 accusing the mayor and his wife of having Tk 3.83 crore in illegal earnings. Mohiuddin and his wife filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the case. bd
