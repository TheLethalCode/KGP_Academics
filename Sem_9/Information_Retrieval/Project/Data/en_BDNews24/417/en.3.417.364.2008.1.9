<TITLE> Indonesia Suharto still critical: doctor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Indonesian president Suharto's condition remains critical, but has improved slightly overnight, a member of his medical team said on Wednesday. Suharto, 86, was rushed to hospital last week suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems, and his health deteriorated on Tuesday as doctors tried to avert multiple organ failure. "He is still in critical condition. He is conscious, alert. He asks to pray while lying in bed," Mardjo Soebiandono, the head of the medical team treating the former general, told a news conference. "His heart isn't strong enough to pump blood." Soebiandono said that doctors would resume giving him blood transfusions and haemodialysis to remove excess liquid from his body, but would wait for his condition to stabilise before installing a pacemaker. All six of Suharto's children, and almost all of his sons-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren were with him at the hospital on Tuesday, indicating the seriousness of his condition. Suharto ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for over three decades until he was ousted in 1998 in the face of a tumultuous pro-democracy movement and economic crisis. The former strongman, who rarely appears in public, has suffered from various ailments in recent years, including intestinal bleeding and strokes. Critics say he and his family amassed billions during his rule, but the former president and members of his family deny any wrongdoing. Suharto was previously charged with graft but escaped prosecution when he was deemed too ill to stand trial. He and his family were still involved in a couple of high-profile court cases. The sudden deterioration in his health over the weekend prompted some senior politicians and one of Suharto's daughters to call for legal proceedings against him to be dropped. But the attorney-general said on Monday his office would press ahead with a civil case against Suharto. Despite Suharto's humiliating ouster in 1998 and the subsequent attempts to prosecute him for corruption, members of Indonesia's political and business elite flocked to his bedside to pay their respects, a mark of his lingering influence.
