 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  In a dramatic turn of events, law adviser Mainul Hosein, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury resigned Tuesday. Full Story. Updates with quotes from advisers and AL reactions The resignations came three days before the anniversary of the changeover by the military-backed government. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com that the advisers cited "personal reasons" for their resignations. He said the swearing-in ceremony for new advisers would take place Wednesday. Munaim did not name the new advisers, who are meant to fill vacancies on the technocratic government. Officials said the Cabinet Division started preparations for the swearing-in ceremony for the new advisers. Geeteara told bdnews24.com that she submitted her resignation letter to the Cabinet Division around 2pm Tuesday. The resignation of Mainul was confirmed by his wife Saju Hosein. Mohammad Iqbal Hossain, public relations officer for the power ministry, confirmed the resignation of Tapan. At 5pm, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman confirmed the news of his resignation. "I worked for the nation and am still working. I will work in future as well. I will keep working when and where I get a chance to do so." "In the past, I was in a different place. At present, it is another place. And I will work in future from where I will be assigned to." Asked to explain why it happened, Matiur said: "No power is permanent." Earlier at 4pm, Matiur said he did not resign, after he was asked by reporters to comment on media reports on his "resignation". Later he told bdnews24.com: "What you have heard is true." In instant reaction, the Awami League said an immediate power transfer to an elected government would solve the "problem". Acting AL chief Zillur Rahman said, "The "problems" won't be solved through the resignations of advisers. An election is the only tool to resolve the "problems"." Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri was the first to resign his post on the Fakhruddin administration in Dec 26, taking the responsibility for the loss of rare artefacts from Zia International Airport. The resignation was on "personal grounds", the adviser initially told bdnews24.com by phone. Later, he said: "I made hints of resignation when I talked to reporters the other day." Mainul has often been accused by the media and the public of making outrageous and inconsistent comments on sensitive political topics. His remarks came at a time when the caretaker administration says it is committed to holding a free and fair election by year-end. Mainul told a private television station Monday that the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led government would live up to its pledges that include curbing corruption and delivering a flawless democracy through a credible election. He also said that some vested groups were trying to push the government into trouble, but did not elaborate. After his resignation, Mainul said: "I'm not feeling well. What is the point giving reactions after resignation? I'll speak to you later." "For me work was a mission. I tried my best, but don't know how much I was successful." "I wish the government all the best. I would be happy if the government's mission becomes successful," he said. "I would be very happy if newcomers perform well." Mainul, known for his friendly attitude towards the media as information adviser, avoided reporters all day. Calls from reporters to his cellphone went unanswered. Every time bdnews24.com rang his number, his wife Saju Hosein or his driver said he was taking rest. Tapan drew flak for his recent comment that the government has nothing to do with runaway food prices despite the prices have doubled since the emergency administration took charge in Jan 2007. Geeteara in Nov last year termed the fertilser crisis that prompted nationwide protests a 'myth' created by the media and the farmers unwilling to queue up. Geeteara told bdnews24.com: "There are complex problems in the jute sector. Resolution of the problems is very difficult. Here nobody works according to their responsibilities. There is huge amount of dues. Why should I take responsibility for all these?" Whether the resignation of the four advisers stemmed from policy or personal differences with colleagues was not immediately clear. bdnews24.com/
