 LONDON, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ministers agreed with building a new generation of nuclear power stations at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Asked if any minister had spoken in opposition when the cabinet discussed whether to give the green light to a new generation of nuclear plants on Tuesday, the spokeswoman said: "Not that I'm aware of." Nuclear and energy issues had been the main items on the agenda at Tuesday's cabinet meeting and there had been a "very good discussion with many interventions from members of the cabinet," the spokeswoman said. Her comments reinforced expectations that Business Secretary John Hutton will give the go-ahead to new nuclear power stations when he makes an eagerly awaited statement on energy policy to parliament on Thursday. The decision could spark a new battle with environmental campaigners, opposed to new nuclear plants. Last February a High Court judge overturned the government's initial go-ahead for new nuclear plants, saying it had failed to consult the public properly. Environmental group Greenpeace says a decision in favour of nuclear this week would still be unlawful, largely because people were given flawed information in the second consultation and because there is still no plan for radioactive waste.
