 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday urged businesses not to adopt unfair business practices and keep the price of rice and other essentials within the reach of people. "There was a spike in the rice price a few days ago. But because of the steps taken by the army, the situation was controlled within 24 hours," he said after receiving aid for the cyclone Sidr victims at the Officers' Mess in Dhaka Cantonment. "The people are the government. For now their first task is to help the government to keep the price of commodities in check." "The price of per kilogram rice has come down to Tk 27 from Tk 36 in many districts. The reflection is visible in some parts of Dhaka too," he said. Moeen said, "Life in the cyclone-ravaged areas is becoming normal as the rehabilitation work is being carried out there at full pace. "Help from different organisations and people helped made it possible. The total aid received until now is Tk 23 crore. We have already disbursed Tk 16 crore in the affected region." "We are distributing text-books among SSC candidates in the affected region so that they can sit the exams." The army chief Thursday received aid of some Tk 1.20 crore for the Sidr-hit people.
