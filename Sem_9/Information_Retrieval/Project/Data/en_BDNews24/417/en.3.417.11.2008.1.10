<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The economy is forecast to face a tough time in the latter half of fiscal 2007-08, the Centre for Policy Dialogue said Thursday. CPD made the prediction in a report, titled First Six Months of FY2007-08: Changes and Challenges Ahead . According to the report, successive floods, Cyclone Sidr, the global economy, domestic inflation and the consequent impact on investment brought almost all targets under serious threat. The report appreciated that the first half of the year saw higher foreign currency reserves and remittances. From July to November, Bangladesh received $ 2,806 million in remittances. Revenue collectionincome tax in particularalso increased. The private think-tank however also recorded a rise in revenue expenditure. The rate of revenue collection was 44 percent during the period. This year's target will be fulfilled if only 19 percent revenue is collected in the latter half of the present fiscal. CPD also advised giving further emphasis on value added tax and import duty to achieve the target. Revenue expenditure increased by 30.7 percent in the first half of FY07-08, more than double the target. Expenditure stood at Tk 5294.4 crore during July-August, up from Tk 4050.4 crore over the same period in the previous fiscal. A big share of this went toward loan repayment. CPD executive director Dr Mostafizur Rahman said higher revenue expenditure would put pressure on the next budget. He also suggested any unused block allocation could be used for rehabilitation programmes. The revenue expenditure budget for the present fiscal has reserved Tk 2182.2 crore as a block allocation. On implementation of the Annual Development Programme, the CPD said the performance in the sector was poor. Tk 3042 crore was spent from July to October and "14 ministries that are responsible to develop their own budgets could not register high performance," the report said. It called for a midterm review and restructuring of the ADP for the next six months keeping in mind the requirements for flood and Sidr rehabilitation programmes. A total of Tk 898 crore was allotted for unapproved projects under the ADP for the present fiscal, and Tk 1414 crore was kept for special allocation, the report said. The total budget deficit till October was Tk 9,850 crore or 55.5 percent higher than the corresponding figure for the previous fiscal, and requiring significantly higher government borrowing from domestic sources. Government borrowing from domestic sources rose by 33.3 percent during the July-October period, the CPD report said. Foreign financing amounted to Tk 1642.74 crore during the period, nine times higher than the corresponding figure for FY06-07, reported CPD. From July to November, total disbursement in agricultural credit stood at Tk 1,869.3 crore, 6.6 higher than the disbursement over the comparable period of FY06-07. Rice import during the period was four times higher than the import during the same period last fiscal year. As much as 1,837 million tonnes of foodstuffs have so far been imported, 53 percent higher than the import over the same period the previous fiscal. Cyclone Sidr cost the livestock sector Tk 132.26 crore. Bird flu caused a probable loss of Tk 500 crore in poultry sector. The CPD report warned of a fall in growth of the poultry sector if there was a failure of investment in the sector. Inflation worsened in November. Lower domestic production, rising prices in international markets and supply disruption were major forces contributing to consumer price inflation and price hikes, the report said. It said the central bank needed to seriously consider using exchange rates as a tool to reduce inflationary pressure by reducing import prices. It said depreciation of the taka continued at 11.95 percent against the euro and 12.18 percent against the Indian rupee during the period. bdnews2
