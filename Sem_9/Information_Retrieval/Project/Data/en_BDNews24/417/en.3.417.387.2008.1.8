 Dhaka, Jan 8n (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and BNP Tuesday expressed guarded reaction to the resignation of four advisers to the caretaker government. The AL said an immediate power transfer to an elected government would solve the "problem". Acting AL chief Zillur Rahman said, "The problems won't be solved through the resignations of advisers. An election is the only tool to resolve the problems." BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed said, "We will hope that the government will not go back on its election roadmap because of the resignation of the four advisers. "[We hope it] will fulfil the people's expectations by holding a fair election." Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury resigned Tuesday, three days before the anniversary of the changeover by the military-backed government. Hafizuddin criticised food adviser Tapan Chowdhury for his recent comment that "the government has nothing to do the spiralling food price". "As an adviser he cannot say that. This is not acceptable." In the same vein he criticised Geeteara's comment on fertiliser crisis in Nov. Senior joint secretary general of pro-Khaleda Zia faction of the BNP, Nazrul Islam Khan, said, "These are merely changes of some persons in the government. This is no change in the government policy. So we don't want to make any comment on this." Bangladesher Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said, "The resignations of the advisers is a normal incident. It proves that the government is restive. Besides, it is undeniable that the government is not being able to play any effective role in running the state." General secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh Mujahidul Islam Selim said, "The resignation of four advisers is significant. There were different allegations against many of them. There was demand for their resignation from the people as well. "They failed to perform their duties. The failure is not only of the four advisers, it is the failure of the whole government," Selim said. "We earlier said such type of government shouldering so much work would not be able to stay in power for long. We hope the government will learn from the incident and hold election quickly." Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general M Kamaruzzaman said, "Despite the resignations of the advisers people want a fair election in line with the roadmap. People want immediate handover of power to elected public representatives." bdnews24.com
