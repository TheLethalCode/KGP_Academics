 BISSAU, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Guinea-Bissau on Friday arrested two Mauritanians suspected of involvement in the killing of four French tourists who were gunned down on Christmas Eve in Mauritania, the police chief said. "I can confirm that we have two Mauritanians suspected of killing the French tourists in Mauritania. They were arrested early this morning at a hotel in Bissau," Judicial Police Director Lucinda Ahukharie told Reuters. She said Guinea-Bissau police had carried out the arrests at the request of French authorities. On Dec. 24, three attackers, whom Mauritanian officials suspect are Islamic militants linked to al Qaeda, gunned down four French tourists and injured a fifth as they enjoyed a Christmas Eve picnic on a road in southern Mauritania. Mauritanian security forces had detained at least seven people suspected of helping the killers. Three days after the French were slain, gunmen killed three army soldiers in the remote and sparsely populated north of Mauritania, bordering Algeria and Morocco's breakaway territory of Western Sahara. The December killings in Mauritania led to the cancellation of the 2008 Lisbon-Dakar rally due to take place in January.
