<TITLE> Djokovic keen to snatch Federer's crown </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After a stellar year in which he reached his first grand slam final and soared to third in the world rankings, Novak Djokovic could be forgiven for thinking he had done the hard work as far as his career was concerned. But as he prepared for next week's Australian Open, the Serb acknowledged he needed to improve further to fulfil his goals of winning a major and topping the standings. "I would be happy if I had a year like 2007, this year," Djokovic, runner up to Roger Federer at the U.S. Open, told Reuters in an interview. "I would be satisfied but I know that I can do more, that I can go further. I can improve still in some segments in the game and I am aware of that fact. "I finished (2006) ranked 16 and I honestly didn't expect to rise to number three in the world, just after half a year, but it's just hard work." With the world's top two, Federer and Rafael Nadal, mopping up the majority of tournaments they enter, Djokovic said he could not afford to let up. "I am trying to stay consistent, that's one of the most difficult things in today's tennis, to stay where you are as long as you can and even go up further. That's one of my goals," he said. Aged 20, time is on Djokovic's side. Though he will be one of the favourites at Melbourne Park, he said he was not getting ahead of himself. "There is a lot of time and I am not in a rush," he said. "I know there is a lot of expectation but still there are a lot of things yet to be solved and a lot of time to come." Djokovic beat Federer to win the Montreal Masters in August before losing to the world number one in the U.S. Open final. His run of results prompted many pundits to say that he was the natural heir to the Swiss man's throne. "I don't want to feel just a part of that rivalry, or what (the media) are making of my relationship with Roger," he said. "I look at him as I look at every opponent in the world. Of course, all the credit is to him, all the respect, he is the best player in the world, but that doesn't matter any more. "It used to be two years ago, when I got to the court with him, or with (Marat) Safin, big champions, I was just trying to play well and pretend to play good. 'A CHAMPION' "Now I want to win because I want to be in that position, I want to be a champion." Djokovic, who said he was working on his volleys in an effort to be more aggressive, pinpointed the two Masters events in Indian Wells and Miami last year as the moment when he knew he could compete with the very best. "I think that was the turning point in my career," he said. "That's when I started to win more and more matches, and win the big matches, against Rafa (Nadal), in Miami, when I won the tournament, which is one of the biggest events. "I also played in the finals in Indian Wells. After that I had a lot of confidence in myself." After a short break following the Masters Cup in November, Djokovic began the new season at the Hopman Cup in Perth, where he won all four of his singles matches. "I still am not 100 percent fit, I know that, but I am not scared," he said. "I have been working hard for the last three-and-a-half weeks and I still have time. I am sure I will be 100 percent ready, because I have high goals for this year's Australian Open.
