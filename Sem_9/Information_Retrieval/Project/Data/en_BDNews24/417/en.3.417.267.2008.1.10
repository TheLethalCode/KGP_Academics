 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University students Thursday formed a human chain demanding the release of detained teachers and students. Over 200 students under the twin banners of new students' outfits Nirjaton Birodhi Chhatra Jote and Chhatra Bondhu continued the demonstration for one hour, wearing white and red cloths around their heads. They said they would boycott classes and exams if the detainees were not freed by Saturday. DU vice-chancellor SMA Faiz told reporters: "It's a programme of the students. I won't comment on it. All of us want the teachers and students to be released. But it isn't wise of the students to boycott classes and exams." "I hope the government will resolve the matter shortly," he said. Acting Dhaka University Teachers' Association president Tajmeri SA Islam said: "It's frustrating that the students have taken up a boycott programme. They could have protested in different way." On demand for the release of teachers and students, acting dean of the Social Sciences Faculty AAMS Arefin Siddique said: "Charges can be dismissed in a legal process. The government can withdraw the case anytime." "I don't understand why the government is taking so long," he said. The teachers and students started their movement Tuesday, when the university reopened after vacation. They said they would continue their protests until the detainees were released. bdnews24
