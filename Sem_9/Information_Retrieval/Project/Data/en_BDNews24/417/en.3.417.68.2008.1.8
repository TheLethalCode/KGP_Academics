<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Tuesday said preventing corruption was more effective than checking it. The ACC Act stipulates involving people and making them aware of preventing corruption alongside checking the malaise and all would have to work in unison to do so, the ACC chief said. Mashhud made the remark at a meeting with representatives of Corruption Prevention Committees from different districts at the ACC's Segun Bagicha office. ACC director general (prevention) Abu Taleb was also present. Representatives of seven northern districts participated in the first of a three-day series of meetings. As many as 119 representatives from 51 upazilas of Thakurgaon, Dinajpur, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Kurigram and Rangpur districts attended it. Directives on corruption prevention activities were issued to the district and upazila level committees. Hasan Mashhud said though the committees had been formed at government initiatives, their activities could not be stopped after a certain stage. Many might not have been accommodated in the committee, but they could not be avoided. Despite not being on the committee, they still could be involved in the working of the committee, he added. "The Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution. You have taken responsibility. Work sincerely. "Sometimes, some things may be imposed from above for the sake of good work. You should not think that you are being ordered to work. All will have to work spontaneously. You should not wait for orders from above. The ACC chief continued: "Many people say that the cause of corruption is low salary. It is not true. Salaries had been increased several times, but corruption did not decrease. Some 70 to 80 percent of our population is in poverty. They do not indulge in corruption." He urged the committee members not to get involved in persuasion. He said that such activities would stain the work of the whole committee. Prevention of corruption would have to be turned into a social movement, the ACC chairman said. bdnews2
