 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Some say the resignations of four advisers expose the government's failure to deliver what the people have expected of it. They say the job of the interim government now is to immediately transfer power to an elected government by staging a free and fair election. Educationist Prof Serajul Islam Chowdhury said Wednesday that the outgoing advisers had failed and run into controversy. "Their departure was not unexpected," Chowdhury said. "They failed to be efficient in their job. They showed a lack of responsibility. Their inefficiency aggravated prevailing crises, including the one in the economy," he told bdnews24.com. With them gone, the main concern now is if the government could live up to its billing. He said elections should be the focus. "I think now the government's main job should be holding a fair election and transfer power," Chowdhury said. Asked what should be the advisers' job, he said: "They lack understanding on their job responsibilities. The most serious concern is that they have accountability to none." "A political government at least has a minimum responsibility toward the people as they would have to again seek mandate in the election. So they need to care [about what they do]. "But as the caretaker government does not have any accountability we cannot expect many things from them," he said. General secretary of the Communist Party of Bangladesh Mujahidul Islam Selim said the resignations were inevitable since the four advisers had been mired in a slew of allegations. "People demanded their resignation. Their resignation confirmed their failure in performing their duties," he said. "The failure of the half of the advisers reflects overall failure of the government," Selim asserted. He said when an unelected government takes too many jobs in hand chances of failure remains high. "We feared that before. Now our concern has proved true," he said and added that now the government should focus on elections. "The government's main job is to complete the legal course against the high-profile corruption suspects and hand over power to an elected government," he said. "It does not need to expand its scope of duty," Selim said. Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haque Inu said the advisers' resignations reflect that the administration was facing a crisis in running the country. He demanded dialogue with the political parties to overcome the crisis. Prof MM Akash, who teaches economics at Dhaka University, said he looked forward to seeing who come to fill the vacancies. bdnews24.
