<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey has halted the flow of Azeri gas to Greece due to a suspension of gas supplies from Iran to Turkey, a senior Turkish Energy Ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday. Iran, one of Ankara's main gas suppliers, stopped pumping to Turkey on Monday, blaming the disruption on cold weather and a cut in Turkmen gas supplies. The Turkish official said daily gas consumption in Turkey had fallen to 124 million cubic metres from 142 million as a result of measures prompted by the halt in Iranian gas flows. "As of yesterday, those gas-fired electricity producers who could do so have switched to alternative fuel, while others have implemented certain cuts. In this context there is no problem in electricity production," the official said. He said agreement had been reached with Greece to make up for the cut in their supplies in the coming days. The first cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to make up for the shortfall was due to arrive at a Turkish port on Jan. 14 and talks were continuing on further LNG purchases from the spot market, he said. Russia, Turkey's other main energy provider, is unable to allocate additional supplies, according to previous comments from an energy ministry official. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday that the gas flow to Turkey will increase, but did not speficy any timeframe. State-run Anatolian news agency reported Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan as saying on Tuesday he will ask Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to restore the flow of natural gas to Turkey. Ankara is strengthening energy ties with Iran and plans to invest billions in Iranian energy projects despite criticism from the United States. Last week the flow from Iran fell to 4-5 million cubic metres a day from an agreed 30 million, after the halt in Turkmenistan gas supplies to Iran. A daily reduction of 30 million cubic metres from Iran and a 5 million cubic metre deficit in gas from Russia has created a daily deficit of 35 m
