 SYDNEY, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's players made a welcome return to the playing field on Thursday when they took on an ACT Invitational XI in their first outing since their tour of Australia was plunged into chaos. The tourists showed little effects from missing two days training while the tour was under suspension as they racked up a handsome total of 325 for nine. India declared late in the day at Manuka Oval, the ACT replying with 10-0 when stumps were drawn. Opener Wasim Jaffer enhanced his chances of playing in next week's third test in Perth with a gritty 92 after a string of low scores in the first two tests but threw his wicket away when a century beckoned. Jaffer struck eight fours and two sixes and also shared a 66-run stand with Virender Sehwag, who made 24 from 49 balls after being given the chance to push for test selection. Rahul Dravid made 62 after being dropped down the order following his promotion to makeshift opener for the test series. However, out-of-form middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh failed again when he made just two. Dravid said it was important for all the batsmen to score runs to secure their place in the next teat. "Definitely I'm sure Yuvraj and the rest of the guys would like to get a lot more runs on the board," Dravid told reporters. "It does help for your confidence. That hasn't happened. They will probably get one more hit in this game. "I hope they can use that well. It was nice to see Wasim get runs today at the top of the order. He looked solid, played really well." Acting captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed 38 off 37 balls while Harbhajan Singh made a third-ball duck after being booed by a handful of spectators on his arrival the crease. Harbhajan was banned for three matches after he was found guilty of racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during last week's second test in Sydney. Harbhajan has denied the charges and lodged an appeal, allowing him to play until the case is finished. The Indian board had threatened to abort the tour unless the International Cricket Council (ICC) dropped the charges, but continued after the ICC agreed to a number of concessions, including the sacking of West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor
