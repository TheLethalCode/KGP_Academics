<TITLE> S.Korea terminates first multipurpose satellite </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea is ending the mission of its first multipurpose satellite, launched in 1999, after losing contact with it at the end of December, its space agency said on Friday. The Arirang satellite had an original mission of three years, mapping the Earth's surface. It continued in operation for several more years after that, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute said. The satellite is programmed to use emergency power if it loses contact with controllers. That power source is expected to be depleted at the end of this month, it said. In July 2006, South Korea launched its Arirang-2 satellite from a facility in Russia. It produces images with 40 times the resolution quality of the first Arirang satellite. South Korea, which relies heavily on the United States for aerial intelligence on North Korea, said its Arirang-2 satellite provides "real-time visual data on North Korea's missile launch preparations or military activities, which would be otherwise unavailable," its overseas information service said. In November, South Korea said it plans to launch a lunar probe in 2020 and make a moon landing by 2025 under a new space project that will develop indigenous rockets to put satellites into orbit.
