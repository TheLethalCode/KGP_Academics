 MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Voters in New Hampshire choose candidates for US president on Tuesday, with Hillary Clinton at risk of seeing her once high-flying Democratic campaign buried under rival Barack Obama's surge. Five days after finishing a disappointing third in Iowa, the former first lady trails Obama by double digits in many New Hampshire polls and had to reassure supporters on Monday that she was staying in the race. For Obama, a U.S. senator from Illinois bidding to be the first black president, a win in New Hampshire would solidify his hold on the top spot in the Democratic nominating campaign and deal a second consecutive humiliating loss to Clinton, the former front-runner. In a hard-fought Republican battle, Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds a narrow lead over Mitt Romney, the former governor of neighboring Massachusetts who poured tens of millions of his personal wealth into the race. Clinton, a U.S. senator from New York, and Romney are both under heavy pressure to revive their campaigns after disappointing showings in Iowa. Until recently, Romney led polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, but he finished second in Iowa to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. A new Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll showed Obama expanding his lead over Clinton to 13 points, 42 percent to 29 percent, with former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards in third at 17 percent. McCain led Romney 36 percent to 27 percent in the Republican race, with Huckabee at 10 percent. New Hampshire's primary is the next battleground in the state-by-state process of choosing Republican and Democratic candidates for November's election to replace President George W. Bush. At a polling station Tuesday morning, Romney predicted the New Hampshire vote would be close and looked ahead. "Republicans are going to get behind me and independents are going to get behind me and we're going to end up winning this thing," he said. Polls close at 8 p.m. EST (0100 GMT Wednesday) on Tuesday, with results expected to begin rolling in quickly. State election officials have predicted a record turnout in New Hampshire during the most wide open U.S. presidential race in more than 50 years, with no sitting president or vice president seeking the nominations. The tiny mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch opened the state's voting shortly after midnight, as it has for every election since 1960, in a balloting display more media circus than civic event. OBAMA WINS DIXVILLE NOTCH With a room full of cameras recording their every move, a few of the town's registered voters cast ballots. Obama won seven of the 10 Democratic votes, with former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards getting two and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson getting one. McCain won four of the seven Republican votes, with Romney winning two and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani getting one. In the final hours of the state's campaign on Monday, the candidates sought to drive home their message and fire up supporters to turn out. Clinton closed the day with a final rally in Manchester with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Earlier, she became emotional at a stop in Portsmouth, her eyes welling up with tears and voice choking as she discussed why she was seeking the presidency, taking a shot at Obama in the process. "Some of us put ourselves out there and do this," she said, her voice breaking and her eyes glistening with tears, "against some pretty difficult odds and we do it, each one of us, because we care about our country. "But some of us are right and some of us are wrong. Some of us are ready and some of us are not." She said she would stay in the race at least until "Super Tuesday" on Feb. 5, when 22 states hold nominating contests. At a rally of about 400 people in Bedford, Romney also took a shot at Obama's campaign theme. "Barack, name something you have changed. Name a business you have changed ... name something in Washington you have changed," he said. "You think we ought to change but you've never done it."
