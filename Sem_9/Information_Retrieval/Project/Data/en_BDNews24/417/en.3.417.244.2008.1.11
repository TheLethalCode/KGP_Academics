<TEXT>
 Wellington, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary, who along with Nepal's Tenzing Norgay Sherpa became the first to conquer the world's highest peak Mount Everest, died in hospital in Auckland on Friday morning. He was 88. Following are five facts about Hillary. BEE KEEPER, MOUNTAINEER: Born in Auckland in 1919, Hillary followed in his father's footsteps after school and became a beekeeper. This summer job allowed him time to climb mountains in the winter. EVEREST AND KNIGHTHOOD: As Hillary trekked away from his successful expedition up Nepal's Mt Everest in 1953, a runner arrived bearing a letter addressed to "Sir Edmund Hillary KBE". Hillary was reported to be somewhat peeved that someone had accepted a knighthood from Britain's new queen on his behalf. NATIONAL HERO: Many Kiwis affectionately call Hillary "Sir Ed" and believe his earthy directness and dry humour epitomised the best in their countrymen. On announcing news of Hillary's death New Zealand Prime Minister described him as a "quintessential Kiwi". FIVE DOLLAR NOTE: Hillary became the first living New Zealander to appear a bank note in 1990. The five dollar note pictures Hillary alongside Mount Cook/Aoraki, the highest mountain in New Zealand, and a Massey Ferguson tractor, the model he used, with minor adjustments, in his 1958 trek to the South Pole, the world's first by motorised vehicle. OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS: After Everest, Hillary led a number of expeditions. He and son Peter, also a mountaineer, became the first to introduce jetboats to India's Ganges river during a 1977 expedition to find the great river's source in the Himalayas. He returned many times to Nepal, dedicating his later years to improving life for people living in the mountains.
