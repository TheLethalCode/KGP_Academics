 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Jannatul Ferdous Niki, who was arrested on alleged ties to Yaba trade, was freed from jail on bail Tuesday, a prisons official said. The superintendent of Dhaka Central Jail, Golam Haider, said Niki left the jail around 7pm. Niki's brother-in-law MHN Bulu received her at the jail gate. The High Court granted Niki bail in a narcotics case, Haider said. RAB-3 arrested her at the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Nov 4 last year, when she tried to turn herself in. The same day, RAB arrested Niki's boyfriend Mahbubur Rahman Joynal, managing director of Purbani Hotel International. On Oct 29, 2007, RAB officers raided the Dhanmondi home of Joynal and seized Tk 28.5 crore in local and foreign currencies, a huge amount of gold and diamond ornaments, bottles of liquor and arms in a 15-hour operation. bdnews
