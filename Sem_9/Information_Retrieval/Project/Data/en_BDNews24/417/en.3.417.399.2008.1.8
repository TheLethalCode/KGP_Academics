 Dhaka, Jan 08 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka stocks ended higher Tuesday after two days of losses amid investors dumping stocks to buy into state-run Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum. Jamuna Oil Company is set to enter the capital market on Wednesday. CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange Salahuddin Ahmed Khan cited investors holding off to buy shares of Jamuna as the reason for the recent downward trend. "Trading of shares of Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum will require cash as they will be traded in spot transactions, he said. "This led investors selling off their holdings to gather cash over the last couple of days." Shares in banks, pharmaceuticals and mutual funds ruled the turnover board Tuesday. The market started with a tiny decline on the general index which then rose sharply in the second hour of trading remaining more or less stable to end up.
