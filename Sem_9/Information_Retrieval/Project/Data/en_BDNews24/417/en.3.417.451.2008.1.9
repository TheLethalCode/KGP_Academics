 BEIRUT, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arab League chief Amr Moussa began the difficult task on Wednesday of getting rival Lebanese leaders to agree details of an Arab plan to end Lebanon's presidential crisis. "Lebanon is in danger... and we want to salvage the situation in Lebanon," Moussa told reporters at Beirut airport. "We come full of optimism, full of hope.

Berri has called a parliamentary session for Saturday in a 12th attempt to elect a president, but another postponement is inevitable unless a surprise deal emerges during Moussa's talks. Parliament elects Lebanon's president with a quorum of two-thirds, something neither camp currently hold. Lebanon's political stalemate has lasted 14 months over opposition demands for veto power in government.
