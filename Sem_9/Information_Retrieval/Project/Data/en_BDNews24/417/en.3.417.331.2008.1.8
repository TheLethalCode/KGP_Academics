<TITLE> Kenya crisis drives up market prices in Burundi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUJUMBURA, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burundi is facing shortages of many goods and prices are rising as a political crisis in Kenya, East Africa's business hub, chokes off supplies, traders said on Tuesday. Kenya's government says nearly 500 people have been killed in riots and ethnic clashes that broke out following President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election in Dec. 27 polls. Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, eastern Congo and southern Sudan all rely on Kenya as a business, transport and services hub, and the unrest has halted most deliveries. Prices of powdered milk and cooking oil have doubled in the main market in Burundi's capital Bujumbura. "Kenya factories have been closing since Christmas and the troubled period that followed the election explains why there is shortage of Kenyan products on offer," Phocus Ngayabihema, head of the traders' association at the market, told Reuters. "The Kenya crisis has affected us very much." Ngayabihema predicted that prices would stay high for up to six weeks until Kenyan products became widely available again. "We heard that activities resumed there, but most goods will reach us in three weeks or one month," he said.
