<TITLE> Iran must clarify nuclear questions faster: ElBaradei </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN nuclear watchdog chief said he had urged Iran on Friday for swifter cooperation in resolving questions about its atomic activity, which the West fears will yield atomic bombs. "I discussed with (Iran's atomic energy chief) how we can work together to accelerate the pace of our cooperation to clarify all outstanding issues before my report in March," International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei said. He described the start of two days of rare talks in Tehran as "frank and friendly". "I asked Mr (Gholamreza) Aghazadeh to give us maximum transparency and provide assurances about all present nuclear activities," ElBaradei, who will meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Saturday, told reporters. "If we are able to clarify past and current activities, it will provide an atmosphere to overcome the standoff between the P5+1 and Iran," he added, referring to six world powers who sponsored U.N. sanctions to curb Iran's nuclear programme. Aghazadeh said the IAEA could be assured of full cooperation with the IAEA. The agency has long sought to verify Iran's nuclear programme is geared solely to producing civilian energy, not atomic bombs as Western powers suspect.
