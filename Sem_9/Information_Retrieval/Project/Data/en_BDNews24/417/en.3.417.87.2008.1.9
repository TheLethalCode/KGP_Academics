 NAIROBI, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete on Wednesday appointed Benno Ndulu governor of central Bank of Tanzania and revoked Daudi Ballali's appointment over irregular payments made from the bank. "The President has decided to revoke the appointment of Daudi Ballali as the Governor of Bank of Tanzania. Because of that, the President has appointed ... Benno Ndulu as the new governor," a statement issued by Tanzania State House said. The move came after Kikwete investigated a report into payments worth about 133 billion Tanzania shillings ($116.1 million) made to 22 firms. The statement said Kikwete called for further investigations into the companies which either had flawed or non-existent records for payment of services. The payments were made in 2005 from Bank of Tanzania's External Payment Arrears Account. "The president is saddened and angered by reports of violations in the settling of external debts by sensitive departments of Bank of Tanzania," the statement said. "He therefore has asked that legal and administrative action be taken against the companies and individuals that were involved in these actions."
