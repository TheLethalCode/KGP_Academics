 MOSCOW, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia, one of the world's top markets for tobacco sales, plans to join an international agreement aimed at cutting smoking by banning all cigarette advertising, the government said on Thursday. Russia's Cabinet approved a draft law to join the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which says each country should ban all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship within five years of joining. "The Russian government at its meeting today approved Russia joining the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control," the government press service said in a statement. The draft still has to be approved by parliament and signed into law by the Russian president. Russia's cigarette market is dominated by global tobacco companies Japan Tobacco Inc., Altria Group's Philip Morris division, British American Tobacco Plc and Imperial Tobacco. Russia is Europe's biggest cigarette market and is a significant generator of profits for tobacco companies who have struggled to break into China, the world's biggest market. Russia trails China and the United States in annual sales but is larger than Japan, the fourth-largest world market. Tobacco smoking kills about 5 million each year, a figure that the World Health Organisation says could double to 10 million each year by 2020 if current trends continue. RUSSIAN SMOKING Smoking is very widespread in Russia and the government has already imposed limits on advertising as it seeks to slow the decline in Russia's population. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2003, seeks to cut smoking and counter the attempts of tobacco multinationals to attract smokers in developing countries. "The contents of the Convention fully accord with Russia's national interests and acceptance of the Convention would help form a healthy way of life and strengthen the nation's health," according to materials prepared for the Cabinet meeting. The Convention says each signatory should impose a comprehensive ban on all tobacco advertising or at least apply restrictions on marketing, promotions and sponsorship by cigarette firms. Alexander Lyuty, director of corporate affairs at BAT Russia, supported ratification of the Convention but called for an individual approach in each country. "A host of the convention's provisions have already been put into effect by Russian law -- Russia has already banned outdoor, television and radio advertising of tobacco products," Lyuty said. "Our company welcomes the fact that the Framework Convention recognises the necessity of respecting national peculiarities and constitutions," he said. "There is no universal approach to the regulation of tobacco smoking. Every country is individual."
