 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Centuries by Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince and AB de Villiers put South Africa in a commanding position in the deciding third test against West Indies on Friday. West Indies, who need 417 to make South Africa bat again, were 23 without loss in their second innings at stumps on the second day. South Africa declared their first innings closed on 556 for four, made in reply to West Indies' 139. Smith scored 147, Prince made an undefeated 123 and De Villiers weighed in with 103 not out. The centurions were supported by Hashim Amla's 69 and an innings of 74 by Jacques Kallis. Smith and Amla resumed on 213-1, and a cloudless sky denied the West Indian bowlers the overcast conditions that had made their South African counterparts a rasping threat on the first day. Medium pacer Darren Sammy struck in the ninth over of the day when Amla tried to work a delivery to the leg side and instead steered a catch to Dwayne Bravo at silly mid-off to halt the second-wicket stand at 199. Six balls later Jerome Taylor had Smith caught behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, who dived in front of first slip to end an innings of four hours in which Smith faced 165 balls and hit 27 fours. Kallis and Prince soon re-established South Africa's dominance in a partnership of 122 that was cut short when Kallis slashed at a ball from off-spinner Marlon Samuels and was caught by Runako Morton at slip. Prince and De Villiers dealt efficiently with the second new ball, and forged ahead into the second hour after tea in an unbroken partnership that reached 182 before the declaration came after De Villiers scored his century. Prince faced 196 balls and hit 15 fours, while De Villiers scored his runs off 109 deliveries with 15 fours and a six. Daren Ganga (six not out) and debutant Brenton Parchment (17 not out) successfully negotiated the 11 overs West Indies faced in their second innings before stumps. The three-match series is level at 1-1
