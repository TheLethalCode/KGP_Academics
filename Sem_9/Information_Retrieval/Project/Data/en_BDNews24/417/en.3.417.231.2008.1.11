 Washington, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it had designated the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), a group linked to PKK Kurdish militants, a terrorist group, subjecting it to US financial sanctions. The US State Department said TAK is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) and was responsible for multiple terrorist attacks in Turkey. "With this designation, the United States reaffirms its commitment to fight terrorism in cooperation with its NATO ally, Turkey," State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. The United States and European Union, like Turkey, classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Turkey, which has been waging an aerial bombing campaign against PKK positions in northern Iraq, blames the rebels for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since 1984 when the PKK took up arms to fight for an ethnic homeland in southeastern Turkey. "The United States will continue to work with Turkey, Iraq, and the rest of Europe against the PKK and its support networks and affiliates, such as the TAK," the State Department spokesman said. "There must be no safe havens for such terrorists." During a White House visit by Turkish President Abdullah Gul on Tuesday, President George W. Bush said the United States would continue to help Turkey fight Kurdish guerrillas along its border with Iraq but also urged Ankara to find a long-term political solution to the problem.
