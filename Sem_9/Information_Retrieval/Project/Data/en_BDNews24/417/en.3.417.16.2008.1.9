 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)Tarique Rahman Wednesday told a Dhaka court that interrogators had tortured him when he was taken into remand earlier. Standing in the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ehsanul Haque, Tarique demanded his physical security be ensured during remand. Describing his plight in custody, Tarique said: "I was taken somewhere else other than the police station. I was assaulted physically." He also accused jail authorities of not taking measures for his treatment despite a court order. "The jail authorities are not making moves for my treatment. But the court has ordered it to do so," he told the court. Tarique made the statement after a police investigator sought permission for taking him on further remand for questioning on charges of extortion. The magistrate allowed the police to take him in for one day's remand, after Gulshan police sub-inspector Imtiaz AK Bhuiyan appealed to the court. The magistrate, however, asked the investigator to remain "cautious" during the interrogation. The charge against Tarique involves alleged extortion of Tk 1.32 crore from a building contractor. Owner of Reza Construction Md Aftabuddin filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on March 27. Tarique's close friend and business partner Giasuddin Al Mamun and six others are also accused in the case. Mamun and another accused Quamruzzaman confessed in earlier statements to the court that they had handed over a major portion of the alleged bribe money to Tarique. Investigators questioned Tarique at Dhaka Central Jail gate on Jan 4 in the same case. bdnews24.co
