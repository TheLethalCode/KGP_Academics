 NEW YORK, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifty-two percent of New York City voters say Mayor Michael Bloomberg would make a good president but only 34 percent would vote for him, a poll released on Wednesday said.

Fifty-one percent of New York City voters said it was "very likely" or "somewhat likely" he will run versus 45 percent who said it was "not too likely" or "not likely at all." Given a choice, 47 percent of New York City voters would like to see Bloomberg run for governor of the state of New York while 16 percent would like him to run for president. Thirty-two percent said "neither." By a margin of 70 percent to 26 percent, New Yorkers said he would make a good governor.
