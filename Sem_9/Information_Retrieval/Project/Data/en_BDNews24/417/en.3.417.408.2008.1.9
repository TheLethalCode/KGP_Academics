<TITLE> Nigeria seeks arrest of 8th ex-governor for graft </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAGOS, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -A Nigerian court has ordered the arrest of the former governor of the oil-producing southern state of Edo on charges of embezzling 2.9 billion naira ($24.5 million), court papers showed on Wednesday. Lucky Igbinedion is the eighth governor from the previous administration charged with corruption since President Umaru Yar'Adua took office in May. The warrant for his arrest is particularly important because Igbinedion was one of three principal backers of Yar'Adua during the ruling party primaries last year and people with such connections have traditionally been shielded from the law. The move will also assuage fears among many Nigerians that the anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, would lose its teeth with the controversial removal of its chief, Nuhu Ribadu, last month. A spokesman for EFCC was not immediately available for comment. One of the 142 counts against Igbinedion, published in ThisDay newspaper, said: "Lucky Igbinedion on or about 30th March 2007 did procure Gava Corp Ltd to retain in its account ... funds illegally withdrawn from the account of Edo state government." Igbinedion, who was governor of the oil producing state for eight years, went into hiding after his tenure ended on May 29, when he automatically lost constitutional immunity from prosecution. His whereabouts are still unknown. Africa's top oil producer is one of the world's most corrupt countries, according to independent watchdog Transparency International. Nigeria's 36 governors, with discretionary powers over millions of dollars of oil revenue, often behave like feudal monarchs in their states, doling out cash and perks to supporters and persecuting opponents with impunity. Yar'Adua has pledged zero-tolerance for corruption, but anti-graft campaigners see him facing an uphill struggle, particularly with those who helped him into the job. Seven former governors have been charged since Yar'Adua took office in May, but activists say there has been no significant progress in the cases against five of the ex-governors who were charged in June and granted bail, signalling a lack of will to proscute them. Two former governors, James Ibori of Delta state and Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti state, were charged last month and remanded in prison. The case against Ibori, who is accused of embezzling over $85 million and trying to bribe police with $15 million to stop investigating him, is seen as a big test of the new government's commitment to fight endemic fraud in the political system.
