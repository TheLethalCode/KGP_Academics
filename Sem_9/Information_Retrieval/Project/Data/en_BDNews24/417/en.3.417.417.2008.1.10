 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Consumer price inflation, fuelled by soaring food costs, rose to a record 11.21 percent in November on a point-to-point basis surpassing the previous high of 10.12 percent in July, according to newspaper reports published Thursday. "There is no doubt that the November inflation was the highest in the last 10-12 years," M Asaduzzaman, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, told bdnews24.com Thursday. The point-to-point inflation reached the double-digit mark at 10.12 percent in July, 10.10 percent in August and came down to 9.6 percent in September, according to BBS statistics. On point-to-point basis, food inflation reached 13.80 percent in November, which was 11.73 percent in October, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. However, the inflation rate on non-food items decreased by 0.17 percentage points. It was 7.25 percent in November last year and 7.42 in October. "Supplyside constraints and the effects of the consecutive natural disasters attributed to fuelling the inflation," a senior Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics official, on anonymity, told bdnews24.com. Asaduzzaman said that inflation was fuelled mainly by supplyside constraints, but consumer' sufferings would have been eased up if their incomes had risen to that extent. "Consumers' earnings did not increase with the rising inflation rate," the BIDS research director said adding that the government would have to take initiatives to increase income of the consumers. He also said that the inflationary pressure was more acute in the rural areas than in the urban areas. The BBS data showed that the income level of the population living below the poverty line had increased at a lower rate in the last fiscal year that ended June 30, 2007. The general wage rate had increased by only 4.5 percent in last fiscal year compared to 9.8 percent of the previous fiscal year. Referring to the BBS data, a recent central bank report said that wages in the manufacturing sector had increased 4.3 percent in fiscal 2006-07 while it was 10.7 percent in fiscal 2005-06. Increase of wage rates in the manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries and construction sectors was below the rates of consumer price inflation of 7.2 percent in fiscal 2006-07, the latest Bangladesh Bank annual report revealed. According to BBS data of 2005, nearly 40 percent of the country's 140 million people live below the poverty line. Economists also blamed continued rise in food and fuel prices in the global market for the high inflation that has already challenged the country's macro-economic stability. Zaid Bakth, senior research fellow of the BIDS, said that the CG failed to contain the inflationary pressure due to a series of mistakes. The mistakes included the anti-hoarding drive conducted by the government early last year, which resulted in sluggish import business activities. The increase of import duty on raw and intermediate materials in the current fiscal budget had been another main mistake, he said. bd
