<TITLE> UN watchdog chief seeks nuclear clarity in Iran </TITLE>

 VIENNA, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN nuclear watchdog chief headed for Iran on Thursday to push for full transparency over its past and present atomic activity after US-Iranian tensions were heightened by a naval incident in the Gulf. Keen to resolve Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear ambitions without conflict, International Atomic Energy Agency Director Mohamed ElBaradei may try to capitalise on signs of improving Iranian cooperation with IAEA investigators. A diplomat close to the IAEA said on Tuesday their inquiries, which Iran stonewalled for years until August, had entered a final phase with Tehran addressing US intelligence about past, covert attempts to "weaponise" atomic material. In talks with Iranian leaders on Friday and Saturday, ElBaradei hopes to "develop ways and means to enhance and accelerate" steps to clarify the past and current scope of Iran's nuclear efforts, an IAEA statement said. An Iranian official said ElBaradei, who declined to speak to reporters at Vienna airport before leaving, will meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. He was expected to seek an end to curbs on UN inspections, key to verifying Iran's denials of any diversions of nuclear materials into bomb-making, as well as press for a rapid conclusion of the investigation into Iran's past. His trip coincides with a Middle East tour by US President George W. Bush aimed at garnering Arab support to rein in Iran. Bush called Iran "a threat to world peace" on Wednesday, three days after Washington said Iranian boats harried US naval forces in the Gulf. Iran said its craft asked US ships to identify themselves and accused Washington of trying to stir up tension. Tehran denies its programme to generate energy from enriched uranium is a front for bomb-making. It condemns UN sanctions for refusing to halt enrichment as illegal and has expanded a new centrifuge production plant. SLOW TRANSPARENCY PROCESS The Islamic Republic pledged in August to answer outstanding questions about its nuclear history. But an end of year target mooted by ElBaradei for completing the process passed with the most sensitive issues still unresolved. A US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) issued on Dec. 3 said Iran had shelved a covert nuclear arms drive in 2003. This undercut the White House stance that Tehran was actively seeking a bomb and its campaign for tougher United Nations sanctions. There is some Western concern the NIE took pressure off Iran to heed international demands for nuclear restraint. Western diplomats said in late December that Iran seemed to be parrying the IAEA on final questions to do with militarising enrichment work and a related issue involving traces of highly-enriched, or bomb-grade, uranium found by inspectors on nuclear research equipment. Diplomats close to the IAEA denied the suggestions of new obstruction. One said Iran had begun substantive talks with the IAEA on the intelligence about weaponisation and this offered significant potential for wrapping up the inquiry. Weaponisation involves alleged administrative and research links between processing of uranium ore, testing high explosives and designing a missile warhead. Iran has denied any such links.
