<TITLE> Chile`s Bachelet fires 5 ministers in govt shuffle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Santiago, Chile, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chilean President Michelle Bachelet fired five ministers on Tuesday in a major cabinet reshuffle to steady her embattled government, hit by low approval ratings despite strong economic growth. Bachelet, who already accepted the resignation of two ministers in the past month, said she was replacing her economy, mining, public works, agriculture and planning ministers. She also appointed a new interior minister after the former one resigned unexpectedly last week. Bachelet's approval ratings are suffering amid rising crime and as voters blame her for failing to fix problems with the public transit system in the capital eight months after a revamp belly-flopped. Chileans are also disgruntled they have not seen more benefits from a copper bonanza that has driven the economy to about three years of strong growth.
