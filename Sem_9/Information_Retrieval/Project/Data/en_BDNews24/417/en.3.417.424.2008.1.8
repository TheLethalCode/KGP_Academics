 YAOUNDE, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon's Football Federation has called on Barcelona to immediately release striker Samuel Eto'o so he can join the national squad for the African Nations Cup, which kicks off in Ghana on Jan. 20. Federation spokesman Abdouraman denied statements in the media by Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard that a deal had been reached with the club to release Eto'o on Jan. 12. "We were surprised by Rijkaard's declaration because we've not reached such an agreement with Barca," he said late on Monday. "This is unacceptable. We want Eto'o released immediately so that he joins the rest of the squad." National coach Otto Pfister needed Eto'o in training to be able to make a final squad selection by the Jan. 10 deadline, Abdouraman said. Eto'o was the only member of the 28-man shortlist not to have confirmed his attendance at a training camp in Burkina Faso and Abdouraman called on Barcelona to release the player by Tuesday. "We hope they do not put us in a situation of considering some action against them," he said. Abdouraman said Barcelona contacted them last month to request Eto'o remained with the Spanish club till Jan. 16, but Pfister replied that this was impossible because of the essential role the striker plays in the squad. Barcelona were also reminded of the FIFA rules for continental championships stating clubs must release players two weeks before the start of the tournament, Abdouraman said. "But, surprisingly, last Saturday night we received a message instead from Barca's medical doctor, not the club management as expected, stating that releasing Eto'o would jeopardise his re-education after a prolonged period of absence from the pitch due to a knee injury," said Abdouraman. Eto'o returned to action for Barcelona last month after a long-term injury that required surgery. Four-times Nations Cup winners Cameroon are drawn in group C alongside Egypt, Sudan and Zambia. The Indomitable Lions play their first game against Egypt on Jan. 22
