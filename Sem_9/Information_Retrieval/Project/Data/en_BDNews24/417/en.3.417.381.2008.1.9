 NEW DELHI, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian cricket board's threat to withdraw from their Australia tour if a ban on spinner Harbhajan Singh is not revoked has raised more awkward questions over a national body's relationship with the governing council. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Tuesday the team would resume a tour which had been in jeopardy after protests over poor umpiring in the second test in Sydney reached a flashpoint with the ban on Harbhajan for racial abuse. The International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Mike Procter banned Harbhajan for three tests on charges of calling Andrew Symonds a monkey. Skipper Anil Kumble accused the home team players of lacking sporting spirit after India's second successive defeat and the team has rallied around Harbhajan, who denies the charge. Cricket-mad India, angered by the umpiring and the ban, is also the sport's commercial hub due to a booming economy. The tourists have won widespread support over poor umpiring, and the ICC caved in to Indian pressure and dropped the seasoned Steve Bucknor for the third test after initially rejecting the demand. The ICC has also asked chief referee Ranjan Madugalle, a former Sri Lanka captain, to broker peace between rival skippers, angering some like former West Indies skipper Clive Lloyd and South Africa coach Mickey Arthur who have asked whether every team would be granted such demands. The Indian board has dubbed the ban "obnoxious", saying it would accept nothing other than the ICC appeals commissioner exonerating the Indian bowler. PAST STAND-OFFS India are not new to stand-offs with the ICC. A defiant BCCI almost triggered a civil war in the sport on their 2001 South Africa tour after ICC match referee Mike Denness penalised many of their players during the second test. Denness banned batsman Virender Sehwag for one test, fined some others for excessive appealing and penalised premier batsman Sachin Tendulkar for cleaning the seam without the umpire's consent. However, the BCCI forced the South African board to exclude Denness for the final test and the ICC responded by withdrawing official status to the match. The Indian board, having dropped Sehwag for the unofficial test, insisted on fielding him for the next game at home against England to jeopardise the series until they backed out at the last minute by finally omitting Sehwag. Their endorsement-rich players threatened a boycott of the 2003 World Cup, refusing to sign tournament contracts curbing personal endorsements that conflicted with official sponsors until they relented after the ICC made some concessions. The ICC has rejected criticism of succumbing to one board's clout, saying decisions were always made collectively because its top executive board consists of national boards. The Sydney row follows the Oval test crisis in August 2006 when Pakistan were ruled to have forfeited a test for the first time ever after refusing to take the field in protest when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove changed the ball and penalised them five runs for alleged ball-tampering. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute and Australian Hair was sacked from the ICC elite panel after his board blamed him for the fiasco. Some cricket officials feel the Indian board's adamant stand on Harbhajan was due to pressure from senior players, who have popular support within the country on the issue. Millions of dollars in sponsorship and television rights are also at stake on the tour
