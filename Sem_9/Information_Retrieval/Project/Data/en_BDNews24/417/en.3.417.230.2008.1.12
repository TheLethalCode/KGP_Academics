 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Some 300 students of Dhaka College took to the streets near New Market late Friday to protest against leak of question papers of English (Compulsory) 2006 examinations for a second time, police said. The National University earlier in the day suspended the rescheduled examinations of the second year honours class, the PID said in a statement. The decision sparked the protest Friday night after the news reached the students of Dhaka College. The question papers first leaked on Nov 11, prompting the authorities to cancel the exams. Later the exams were rescheduled for Jan 12 and 13. The protesters put up barricade on the streets, halting traffic for about one hour, said Anisur Rahman , officer-in-charge of New Market Police Station. The students briefly scuffled with police but the law enforcers took control of the situation immediately, Anisur said. Dhaka College student KM Ziaur Rahman Raju said four students were slightly injured during the scuffle with police. Police official Anisul said the protesting students went back to the dormitories at 10:30pm. The date for the suspended examinations would be announced later. The other schedule of the ongoing examinations would remain unchanged, the PID said. bdnews
