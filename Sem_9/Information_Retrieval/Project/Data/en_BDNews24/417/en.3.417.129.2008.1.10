 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Sabera Aman, wife of former state minister for labour and employment Amanullah Aman, was freed from prison Thursday, one month after the High Court granted her bail. Sabera left the prisons cell of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) at 12:30pm as the High Court on Dec 9 bailed her. "Sabera Aman was freed after we received necessary papers from the High Court for her release," Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general (prisons) told bdnews24.com. "The High Court, considering her fragile health condition, granted Sabera Aman bail. But it is unfortunate that the release was delayed by one month," her lawyer Syed Janinal Abedin Mesbah told bdnews24.com. The Special Judge's Court housed on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises on June 21 jailed Sabera to three years in prison for aiding her husband in corruption. On March 6 last year, Abdullah Al Zahid, an assistant director of the Anti-corruption Commission, filed a case with Kafrul Police Station against the couple for having illegal wealth worth Tk 8.28 crore and concealing information on the assests. Sabera, suffering from cancer, was sent to jail as she surrendered to the makeshift court on May 9 last year. bdnews24.com
