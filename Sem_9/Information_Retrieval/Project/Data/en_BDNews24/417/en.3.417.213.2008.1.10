 KINSHASA, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tutsi rebels threatened to withdraw from a peace summit aimed at ending fighting in eastern Congo on Thursday, demanding security assurances from the government. The talks opened on Sunday in the capital of violence-torn North Kivu province, Goma, grouping government officials, local leaders and warring factions to seek solutions to a conflict that has displaced more than 400,000 people in the past year. Members of a delegation representing renegade General Laurent Nkunda's Tutsi-dominated insurgency said they would not take part in meetings on Thursday after their military spokesman was threatened with arrest. "We have suspended our participation at the conference while security measures are taken," delegation member Jean-Desire Muiti told Reuters. Muiti said the decision was taken after Major Serephin Mirindi, Nkunda's military spokesman, was accused of involvement in the 2001 assassination of former President Laurent Kabila by an official from Congo's U.N. peacekeeping mission, MONUC. He said other delegation members were forced to intervene to prevent Mirindi's arrest by members the Republican Guard of current President Joseph Kabila, Laurent's son. MONUC spokesman Kemal Saiki said the incident was a simple case of mistaken identity and that Mirindi was never threatened with arrest. HOTEL OR BUSH "The guy was not arrested. He was not detained. There was no intimidation. No threat. Nothing," he told Reuters. However, Muiti said the rebels were demanding a written commitment from the Republican Guard that Nkunda's delegation would not be harrassed or threatened. "We will stay at the hotel until they answer us. If they don't, we will return to the bush," he said. The peace summit, called after the disastrous failure of a goverment offensive against Nkunda last month, has already faced setbacks. Originally due to open Dec. 27, the conference officially opened on Sunday and was then delayed an additional day to register delegates and settle disputes with a civil society delegation and local Mai Mai militia representatives. Conference officials announced on Wednesday an extension of the planned nine-day summit until Jan. 17. Neither Kabila nor Nkunda have attended the meetings personally. The opposition has accused the government of capitulating to Congo's last major illegal armed group by holding the talks. Fighting between government forces, Nkunda loyalists, Mai Mai militias and Rwandan Hutu rebels has continued in eastern Congo despite the official end of a broader 1998-2003 war that killed an estimated 4 million people.
