 HAVANA, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philip Agee, a former CIA spy who exposed its undercover operations in Latin America in a 1975 book, died in Havana, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said on Wednesday. Agee, 72, died on Monday, the newspaper said, calling him a "loyal friend of Cuba and staunch defender of the people's struggle for a better world." Agee worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for 12 years in Washington, Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico. He resigned in 1968 in disagreement with US support for military dictatorships in Latin America and became one of the first to blow the whistle on the CIA's activities around the world. His book "Inside the Company: CIA Diary" revealed the names of undercover agents in Latin America and was published in 27 languages. The U.S. government called him a traitor and said some of the agents he exposed were later murdered. Agee went to live in London but was deported by Britain at the request of the U.S. government, which withdrew his passport. He settled in Cuba in the 1980s after several European governments denied him residence.
