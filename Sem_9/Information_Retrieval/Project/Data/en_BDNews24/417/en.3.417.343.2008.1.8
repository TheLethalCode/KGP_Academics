 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday called on the police to become service-oriented and modern-minded and move away from their "colonial attitude". "An overwhelming amendment to the colonial police law of 1861 is mandatory for that," he said at a programme marking the start of Police Week at Rajarbagh Police Line in the city. "The role of police is imperative in establishing the rule of law" "To cope with the current context, the institution should be more service oriented in the light of human rights and democratic values," the chief adviser said. 'Police Week 2008' kicked off Tuesday with the pledge to make police real friends to the public and offer better service through ensuring safety and legal assistance. bdnews24.com
