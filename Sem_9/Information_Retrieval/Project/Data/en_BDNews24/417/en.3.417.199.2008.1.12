 ISLAMABAD, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has expelled a reporter for the New York Times Magazine who interviewed Taliban leaders and visited the southwestern Baluchistan province on the Afghan border, a media watchdog said. The journalist, Nicholas Schmidle, whose report "Next-Gen Taliban" appeared in the magazine on the weekend, was deported on Friday, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said.

"At a time of growing crisis in Pakistan, perhaps the worst tactic for promoting calm is for the government to silence the press."

The emergency rule was lifted on Dec. 15 and most of the channels are back on air but none is running the popular talk shows that infuriated the government. The government rejects criticism on media curbs. "The media in Pakistan is the freest ever in the history of the country.
