<TITLE> Windies board questions 'extreme' Bucknor sacking </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 9 (bdews24.com/Reuters) - The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has dubbed as "extreme" the International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision to drop umpire Steve Bucknor following the Sydney test controversy. The ICC dropped Jamaican Bucknor for the third test in Perth following pressure from the Indian board after umpiring errors in the second test, which Australia won by 122 runs to go 2-0 up in the series. "On the surface, the ICC's reaction in this particular instance seems to be extreme," West Indies board president Julian Hunte said in a letter to ICC president Ray Mali and published in the board's Web site www.windiescricket.com. "A dangerous precedent may have been set by the ICC." The ICC seemed to be adopting double standards after refusing to act on a formal protest by West Indies against poor umpiring on their 2005 Australia tour, he said. "The ICC's reaction by (general manager) Dave Richardson was to acknowledge that errors were made but to insist that 'the overall standard of umpiring has improved in recent years, particularly with the advent of the elite panel'. "It would be interesting to know what made this situation any different," said Hunte. He added both New Zealand's Billy Bowden, who will replace Bucknor, and Procter also officiated in that series. The West Indies board has sought more information on the Bucknor issue, including communication between the umpire and ICC, to decide on any future action. Bucknor, 61, is the most experienced umpire in international cricket history, having stood in a record 120 tests and five one-day World Cup finals. "There is no question that even the best umpires make mistakes," Hunte said. "They are human and there are circumstances which may affect their judgment. "What worries us is whether the action of the ICC in the case of Mr. Bucknor might create even more problems for the ICC and international cricket down the line
