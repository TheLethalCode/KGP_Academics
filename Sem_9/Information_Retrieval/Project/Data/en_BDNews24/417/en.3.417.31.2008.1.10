<TITLE> Ukraine nearly in WTO, export duty hurdle remains </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine could be invited to join the World Trade Organisation next month, but it must first resolve a row with the European Union about export duties, trade negotiators said on Wednesday. Ukraine, with a population of 47 million, is the biggest country besides Russia and Iran outside the 151-member WTO, which umpires the world trading system. Membership would provide new export opportunities for Ukraine's industry, still saddled with Soviet-era plants, and its farmers, who cultivate some of the most fertile land in Europe. Ukraine has completed negotiations with the WTO as a group, but under WTO accession rules it must reach a bilateral agreement with any member that seeks it, from which all other members benefit. The differences with the EU about export duties are the last remaining hurdle, with Brussels seeking a guarantee from Ukraine to reduce them, not just a declaration of intent. "What we're seeking is a commitment that would be legally binding," said John Clarke, deputy head of the EU's WTO mission. Clarke told Reuters this was not just a drafting issue as the wording could mask substantial economic costs. Ukraine has agreed to cut, but not eliminate, export duties over five years, he said. NON-FERROUS METALS The EU is particularly concerned about export duties on non-ferrous metals, which Brussels argues constitute an effective subsidy for domestic metallurgy plants. That is because tight margins in metals would make it prohibitively expensive for smelters in other countries to import Ukrainian metals if the export duties are applied. The EU also wants guarantees that Ukraine will not circumvent the restrictions on export duties by introducing measures with the equivalent effect, such as taxes or licence fees, Clarke said. Brussels and Kiev are exchanging e-mails about the wording, and could hold a meeting or teleconference to finalise the deal in the next few days, he said. Chile's WTO ambassador Mario Matus, who chairs the working party on Ukraine's accession, said he hoped to have a meeting of WTO members in the second half of this month to finalise the accession package, provided the export duty issue is resolved. The way would then be clear for the next WTO general council on Feb. 5-6 to vote on Ukraine's accession request. "If everything goes well we'll have a formal meeting which is the beginning of the end of the accession process," he told Reuters. Trade officials at Ukraine's Geneva mission were not immediately available for comment. Membership would not only allow Ukraine, which borders new EU members Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, to share the benefits of the multilateral trading system but would also give it significant leverage over its powerful neighbour Russia. Once Ukraine has joined it would be able to set conditions for Russia's own accession as the WTO operates by consensus of all its members. Georgia, which has a series of political and economic disputes with Moscow, is already using its membership to hold up Russia's accession. If Ukraine's accession is approved next month, it will be in a race with the African archipelago of Cape Verde to become the WTO's 152nd member, whose accession was approved last month. Membership takes effect only when it has been ratified by the acceding country, which has 6 months from approval to do
