 PRISTINA, Serbia, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament on Wednesday re-elected Fatmir Sejdiu as president of the Albanian majority province ahead of an expected declaration of independence from Serbia early this year. Sixty-eight deputies in the 120-seat assembly voted to return 55-year-old Sejdiu for a new five-year term, under a governing coalition deal to be voted on at the same session. Parliament was expected to endorse ex-guerrilla Hashim Thaci as prime minister, at the helm of a "grand coalition" of Thaci's Democratic Party and Sejdiu's Democratic League of Kosovo. Sejdiu succeeded the late Ibrahim Rugova in February 2006, becoming Kosovo's second president -- a largely ceremonial post -- since NATO drove out Serb forces in 1999.
