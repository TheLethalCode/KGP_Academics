 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Saturday said soaring prices of daily commodities during his first year in office created an "unbearable situation" for citizens, particularly for the limited-income group. In a televised address to the nation to mark the first year of the military-backed interim government, Fakhruddin admitted that the prices went beyond control. "The way the prices of rice, oil, wheat and some other daily commodities have increased it has created an unbearable condition for the citizens in general and the limited-income people in particular," Fakhruddin said. He described various measures by his administration to arrest the situation. Reaffirming his administration's commitment for a free and fair election, he said that there was no room for doubt about the holding of Jatiya Sangsad elections by December 2008 as per the roadmap announced by the Election Commission. The chief adviser said the government is determined to hold the parliamentary elections well ahead of December, if possible. "As per our pledge after the completion of the Election Commission's talks with the political parties the reform of the election laws and rules will be finalised." The chief adviser said though Bangladesh is a young country it boasts a glorious civilisation and heritage. He said 2008 would be the most important year in the country's history as "we will reach real democracy following the announced roadmap for the elections reflecting the aspirations of the people and the government". "This kind of spontaneous elevation is rare in world history. But we are going to do that, because we believe there is no alternative to democracy." Fakhruddin went to speak of the government's anticorruption drive: "After assuming office we signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The signing of the convention will brighten the image of Bangladesh in the international arena." "Besides trial of the corruption suspects we have been formulating a mid-term strategy paper for checking corruption." The chief adviser also mentioned that after 36 years of independence the government has following the guidance of the constitution by separating the judiciary from the executive branch in November last year. He said it would be considered a milestone in the history of Bangladesh in establishing rule of law. "Though the political parties of the country always pledged separation of the judiciary in their manifestoes, after coming to power they did not keep their word," he added. The chief adviser said that the patriotic assistance the armed forces were rendering to the civil administration in running the country and facing disasters deserved special mention. "At present they are giving significant assistance in checking serious crime, terrorism and corruption and in relief and rehabilitation of the flood and cyclone survivors." "They are also playing important role in preparing a voter list with photographs," he added. Fakhruddin mentioned the recently drafted law for a National Human Rights Commission to safeguard human rights in the country. He said the national human rights commission would be formed soon. He also said the government has taken significant steps to strengthen the institutional structure of the Anticorruption Commission through restructuring. He mentioned the special tribunals set up at different areas of the country to dispose of corruption cases quickly, stressing that the trials of those accused of corruption are being held as per the existing laws. Speaking of the economy, Fakhruddin said last year economic growth was 6.5 per cent despite political instability and the global rise in oil prices. He said in six months from July to December last year the investment in the EPZs increased more than two fold by 135 per cent. Agricultural loan distributions rose by 61 per cent in the six months which Fakhruddin called very significant. "The government has taken steps to make Chittagong and Mongla ports modern and dynamic for spreading import and export trade of the country," the chief adviser informed the nation, adding that the efficiency of Chittagong Port has increased by 40 per cent. He also mentioned the scope of manpower exports to different countries in the Middle East and South East Asia have been increasing as a result of the caretaker government's bilateral and multilateral initiatives. Fakhruddin said the contribution and role of expatriates in the development of the country was increasing at a steady pace, with foreign remittance crossing $6 billion for the first time this year. Foreign exchange reserves remained above $5 billionalso a record, he added He also mentioned that 24 power projects with the capacity of producing 1030 megawatt electricity were approved in 2007. bdnews24.com/
