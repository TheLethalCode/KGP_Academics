 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com) - Former minister Anwar Hossain Monju now living with his daughter in the US has spoken of returning to the country soon. He has also hinted at joining politics after his return, saying: "I will return to the country soon. I will fight the case against me legally after returning home. I believe I will get justice." Monju made the disclosures, when contacted in Washington by bdnews24.com's Hasanuzzaman Hasan Friday. Monju, elected lawmaker five times and communications minister during the tenure of HM Ershad and Sheikh Hasina, currently resides with his daughter Maniza Hossain in Washington. Maniza works as an executive with the Heritage Foundation in the US. Monju left the country after the promulgation of the state of emergency on Jan 11. Monju and his wife former lawmaker Tasmima Hossain have not been back since joint forces raided their Dhaka home. Question: Where are you now? Monju: I am living in my daughter's house in Washington. I will return to the country soon. I will face the case filed against me through the legal process. I believe I will get justice because I know our judiciary is independent." Q: What is the nature of the case filed against you? Monju: By the grace of Allah, the government could not file any corruption case against me. I was a minister for two terms. As a people's representative, I have worked for the welfare of the people and development of the country. The people know what I have done. Q: What is your reaction to the January 11 changeover and its first anniversary? Monju: I would say the caretaker government has run the country well for the past one year. Stability has prevailed. However, we should not forget that natural calamities like floods and Sidr devastated the economic sector during this time. Let me go back a little. Following the 8th Jatiya Sangsad, two caretaker governments have been formed so far. The first one was with President Iajuddin Ahmed also as the chief adviser. Law and order crumbled during the first caretaker government. Next came the second caretaker government led by Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed. Our armed forces have been helping this government. Although as per the constitution the caretaker government was expected to hold Jatiya Sangsad elections in 90 days, the reality did not make it possible. The government had to correct some institutional matters too. People in the country and expatriates hope that a fair election will be held as per the announced roadmap by the end of 2008. Q: Do you think the present government is running the country as per the constitution? Monju: I think the present government is following the constitution in running the country. The foreign donors and development partners have full support for this government. Q: Do you think participation of the army in running the country is necessary? Monju: Don't look at the matter from that angle. To run the country, coordination among the executive, judiciary and parliament is necessary. The army is part of the executive branch. There is nothing to separate it. Q: Do you think that the pre-January 11 situation would return if the state of emergency were withdrawn? Monju: No. The country cannot be taken back to the pre-January 11 situation. The politicians must realise this. All of us have to understand why and for what reasons the state of emergency had to be promulgated on January 11. Q: How do you think election is possible excluding the jailed political leaders? Monju: There is no relation between the issue of the jailed and the election. The issues of the politicians who are in jail will be settled through the legal process. It is not right to link it with election. However, it is true that due to the presence of the state of emergency, some judicial matters have faced questions. However, I think that if the higher court is active this question will no more be there. Q: What is your reaction to the resignation of the five advisers of the caretaker government? Monju: It is a normal matter. I was in two cabinets. Sometimes, the cabinet needs to be reshuffled to make it more dynamic. Q: Do you think it is the government's failure? Monju: As I am outside the country, I cannot comment on this. However, steps should be taken to keep the prices of essentials at tolerable levels. Food for Work and OMS programmes should continue. Q: You have resigned from your own party. What would you do after returning to the country? Monju: I gave a resignation letter to the party. The party did not accept it. But you can understand, I will return to the country soon. Q: Questions surfaced over Bangla-language daily Ittefaq. Recently, a statement was published. We want to know your position in this regard. Monju: Ittefaq was established by my father and is now the oldest national newspaper of the country. But the way I have been excluded from its editorship, and the way journalists and employees are still being sacked is painful and condemnable. The paper has a place in the people's hearts as a result of the work of all. The responsibility of excluding me as the editor lies with some over enthusiastic people in the administration. I have an address in Dhaka. If anybody is removed from the post of editor, he has to be informed through a letter. This process has not been followed in my case. An over enthusiastic quarter did it to please those in power. bdnew
