<TITLE> Turkish PM denies "weariness" in drive to join EU </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed Turkey's determination to join the European Union on Thursday and denied there had been a slowdown in reforms. The EU and many Turkish commentators say Erdogan's centre-right government has lost its appetite for carrying out reforms required by the wealthy 27-nation bloc. "There can be no question of weariness on the EU issue. We are doing whatever has to be done (to join)," Erdogan said in a televised address outlining a new government action plan. "We are winning (in the EU process). About 70 percent of Turkish exports generally go to EU member states. This situation enriches our relations. So we will continue our EU efforts." Turkey is under EU pressure to improve freedom of expression and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, but Erdogan's government is treading carefully for fear of angering nationalists both in parliament and in the country. The government had been expected this week to amend article 301 of the penal code which makes it a crime to insult "Turkishness". The article, strongly criticised by the EU, has been used to prosecute writers and intellectuals. But Erdogan has signalled the reform may not be ready now until at least next week. Some political analysts say French President Nicolas Sarkozy's strong opposition to Turkey's EU membership is undermining reformers in Erdogan's government as Ankara has less incentive to meet EU criteria. Sarkozy says Muslim but secular Turkey is too big, at 74 million people, and too culturally different to join the EU. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel say Turkey should instead accept a privileged partnership with the EU falling well short of membership, an offer Erdogan has rejected.
