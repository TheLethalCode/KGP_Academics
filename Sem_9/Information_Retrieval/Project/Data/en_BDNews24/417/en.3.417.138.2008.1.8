<TITLE> Israel blast was old ordnance, not attack: army </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion in northern Israel on Tuesday appeared to have been caused by the detonation of old ordnance, rather than a rocket attack from Lebanon, an Israeli military spokeswoman said. "The indications right now are that a dud rocket exploded," she said, adding that the rocket may have been left over from Hezbollah guerrilla barrages during the 2006 Lebanon war. "We stress that we are still investigating," she said. Israel's Army Radio reported earlier that the explosion in the northern village of Shlomi was caused by a rocket attack.
