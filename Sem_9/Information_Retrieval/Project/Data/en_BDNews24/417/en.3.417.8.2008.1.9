 BUJUMBURA, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five fighters from Burundi's last rebel group were killed on Wednesday in clashes with government forces, an army spokesman said. Colonel Adolphe Manirakiza said the fighting took place in the western district of Musigati, a stronghold of the rebel Forces for National Liberation (FNL). "FNL rebels attacked government positions at Musigati. Government forces retaliated and killed five among the assailants," he said. Three government soldiers were wounded in the exchange of gunfire, which Manirakiza said violated a September 2006 truce. "FNL rebels often leave their positions and launch attacks on our troops. For us, this is a violation of the ceasefire and we can't tolerate it," he added. An FNL spokesman confirmed the fighting, but accused the government troops of attacking first. "Our combatants were searching for food and immediately government soldiers started to shoot on them," FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana said by the telephone from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. "The army must understand that our fighters have right to have food," he added. Talks to implement the 2006 peace agreement have been suspended since July last year when FNL rebels walked out of a truce monitoring team. The rebels have accused the South African chief mediator Charles Nqakula of bias, an allegation he has denied. Nqakula is expected in the capital Bujumbura next week to see how he can push forward the deadlocked talks, after a deadline set by the African Union for both parties to finish negotiations expired on Dec. 31. The FNL's persistent insurgency is seen as the final barrier for lasting stability in the central African nation, where more than a decade of ethnic conflict has killed 300,000 people.
