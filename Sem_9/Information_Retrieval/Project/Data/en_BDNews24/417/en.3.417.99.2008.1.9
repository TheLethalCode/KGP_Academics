 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com Bangladesh Bank has asked Brac Bank for details of the theft from clients' lockers at its Dhanmondi branch in Sukrabad The central bank wrote to the managing director of Brac Bank requesting the information. Executive director of the central bank ATM Nasir Uddin told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "The central bank has taken the theft of wealth from lockers under cognizance as a priority." "The Banking Rules and Policy department has sent letter to the Brac Bank authorities asking them to inform us with all possible details urgently." "After getting the details the central bank will investigate the matter." Nasir Uddin added that the security at that branch of the Brac Bank was not sufficient. Mohammadpur police have already begun an investigation of the robbery. Investigation officer in the case, sub-inspector Abu Bakar Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "The robbers left behind some evidence." "Taking clues from the present investigation, we hope that the robbery case will soon be solved." The news of the robbery at Brac Bank Dhanmondi branch, Sukrabad, was published Sunday. A case was filed with Mohammadpur Police Station in this regard. Investigating officer, sub-inspector Siddiqui said Tuesday: "Some progress has been made in the investigation." "The bank is on the first floor of the six-storied Nidmahal Hotel," the IO said. "There is a door between rooms 103 and 104 (on the second floor). The robbers cut through the floor of room 103, entered into the bank lockers on the first floor and looted them." There are a total of 12 rooms on the second floor of the hotel, he said, adding that the robbers also rented three rooms adjacent to room numbers 103 and 104. The suspicion arises as all five rooms were vacated on the same day, sub-inspector Siddiqui said. He said the boarders of rooms 103 and 104 left the hotel empty handed on Sunday morning, and some of their gear was found in the two rooms. So, the question arises who carried away the looted goods, the investigating officer said. "It is assumed that a man and a woman who rented room 105 about seven days back were posing as a married couple. It is suspected that the woman took away the looted goods." Siddiqui said neither the hotel nor the bank authorities were being kept above suspicion. "Why the branch manager Monirul Islam was on leave from before the incident is being given emphasis in the investigation," sub-inspector Siddiqui said. "There are also indications that at least one of the locker subscribers might be involved with the incident." The lockers can be opened using duplicates of the keys supplied by the bank authorities, he said, adding that the lockers can be rented for a nominal amount. Mohammadpur Police Station officer in charge Shibli Noman told bdnews24.com: "We have photograph that is being used in the investigation." "It is the biggest help in our investigation. We are taking the photograph to different locations," said the OC. "Two mobile phone numbers have also been collected. It is assumed that the robbers used these two mobile phones to communicate between themselves." He said RAB, CID, Detective Branch and other law enforcing agencies are assisting the police in the investigation. Head of Brac Bank Marketing and Corporate Affairs Abedur Rahman Shikder told bdnews24.com: "The police are investigating the whole matter." "We have reached an understanding with the clients that if the looted goods cannot be recovered by police in 90 days bank authorities will try to compensate after evaluating their losses." He said from among those whose lockers have been looted by the robbers, only seven have submitted statements so far of the goods kept in the lockers. "We will send the statements to the thana." Asked about branch manager Monirul Islam's leave during the incident Shikder said it was his annual leave. "These year-end leaves are compulsory in banks," he added. The affected bank clients held a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club Tuesday. bdnews24.
