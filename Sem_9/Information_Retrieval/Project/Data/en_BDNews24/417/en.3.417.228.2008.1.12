<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam came down hard on state-run banks Saturday saying clients faced harassment in the banks. "Banks are not meant to play with the money of clients. Bankers' job is to ensure the highest services for clients," the adviser told a conference of branch managers of Agrani Bank at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. He said the state-run banks lagged behind private banks in competition despite having many advantages the private banks do not have. He said the bankers have to work with an "attitude to serve people". According to rules, the central bank has to be informed if any customer wants to withdraw more than Tk 7 lakh at a time. "But the banks harass the customers instead of informing the central bank about it," the adviser said. Azizul said the key loan-default cases were pending with the Money Loan Court. He asked the banks to take steps to realise the money. bdnews
