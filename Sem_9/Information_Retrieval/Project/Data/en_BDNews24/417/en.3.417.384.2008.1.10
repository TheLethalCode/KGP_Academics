<TITLE> Bush presses Mideast peace bid amid scepticism </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - George W. Bush on Wednesday began his first visit as US president to Israel and the Palestinian territories, saying he saw a new opportunity for peace and that both sides were ready to make tough concessions. No breakthroughs were expected in three days of talks following up on a US-hosted international conference in November that yielded promises from both sides to try to forge a two-state accord before Bush's term ends in January 2009. Accused for years of neglecting the Middle East's most intractable conflict, Bush strode down the red carpet at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport and spoke of a lasting peace that has eluded many of his predecessors. "We see a new opportunity for peace here in the Holy Land and for freedom across the region," Bush said at the welcoming ceremony before flying by helicopter to Jerusalem for talks with President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Bush spoke of guaranteeing Israel's security "as a Jewish state". Palestinians oppose Olmert's demand they recognise it as such, saying to do so could deny Palestinian refugees the right to return to homes they abandoned in what is now Israel. Bush is trying to nudge Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whom he sees in the Israeli-occupied occupied West Bank on Thursday, to move forward in a fragile peace process relaunched at Annapolis, Maryland, and which he hopes can reach a deal on a Palestinian state by the end of the year. "Both leaders are determined to make the hard choices necessary," Bush said after meeting Olmert for nearly 3 hours. "It's a historic opportunity to work for peace," he said. "I wouldn't be standing here if I did not believe that you, Mr. Prime Minister, and Mr. Abbas ... are serious." He added that Americans could not determine the outcome but he was ready to apply "pressure" to achieve progress. He described his visit alone as a "pretty significant nudge" that had pushed Abbas and Olmert to finally agree on Tuesday to open negotiations on the "core issues" in the 60-year-old conflict. But Olmert and Abbas are politically weak and analysts say chances are slim for a Palestinian statehood deal. Doubts remain about Bush's commitment and ability to act as an even-handed broker between U.S. ally Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians say Israel's refusal to honour a pledge to halt settlement in the West Bank shows bad faith from the outset. Bush last week called Jewish development an "impediment" to peace and on Wednesday said outposts -- small settlements not authorised by Israel -- "ought to go". Iran also looms large over Bush's travels, which will include visits to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies he hopes to enlist in efforts to contain Tehran's growing regional clout. "Iran is a threat to world peace," Bush said, adding that there would be "serious consequences" if Tehran's forces attacked U.S. ships in the Gulf, where Iranian vessels confronted US naval forces in a key shipping lane last week. Peres opened the visit by telling Bush at the welcoming ceremony of Israel's concerns about Tehran's nuclear programme -- worries that Washington shares. "Iran should not underestimate our resolve for self-defence," Peres said. Bush seems intent on using the waning months of his presidency to try to shape a foreign policy legacy not completely defined by the unpopular war in Iraq. He may also be hoping to use the Middle East stage to stay relevant as he competes for attention with the presidential race back home, a reminder to world leaders they will be dealing with his successor in about a year's time. "I come with high hopes, and the role of the United States will be to foster a vision of peace," Bush told Peres. But he put the onus on the two sides, saying they must "do the hard work" to make that vision a reality. (Editing by Giles Elgood)
