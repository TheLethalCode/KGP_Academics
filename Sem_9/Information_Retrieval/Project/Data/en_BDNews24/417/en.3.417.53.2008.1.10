<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday allowed the Anticorruption Commission to file a regular appeal against a previous High Court order that ruled illegal a notice served on former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. It means the Appellate Division will now hear arguments from both sides before making a decision on the High Court order. According to legal jargon, it means the court has accepted a petition for "leave to appeal" by the ACC. A seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division made the decision and fixed Feb 12 for the next hearing. The court also asked the ACC to refrain from taking further action in line with its notice on Hasina for her wealth statement. Hasina was arrested on July 16. A day later, the ACC served the notice, asking her to turn in details about wealth. On Aug 5, Hasina challenged the ACC notice in the High Court, which ruled the notice illegal in a Nov 22 order. On Dec 3, the Appellate Division stayed the HC order until Jan 2 after the ACC challenged the HC order. On Thursday's decision, Hasina's counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Huq said: "We are happy. It's normal that the court will deliver its verdict after hearing both sides." bdnews24.co
