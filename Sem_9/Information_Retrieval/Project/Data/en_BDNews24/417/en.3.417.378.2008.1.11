 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission has pressed charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and seven others in the Khulna Barge Mounted Power Plant extortion case, an official said Thursday. Former secretary Toufique Elahi Chowdhury and Summit Group chairman Muhammad Aziz Khan were also among the eight accused in the charge sheet. ACC director general (administration) Hanif Iqbal told reporters at a press briefing said the decision was taken at a meeting of the commission. The ACC approved two other charge sheets in the meeting - one against Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helal Uddin and wife Rupa Chowdhury and the other against two Rajuk officials. Hanif said the commission approved the chargesheet against Helal and wife in a case filed with Ramna Police Station for illegal earnings of Tk 7.6 crore.
