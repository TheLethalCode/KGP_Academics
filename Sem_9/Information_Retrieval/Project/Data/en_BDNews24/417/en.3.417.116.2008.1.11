<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juan Arango's second-half strike gave Real Mallorca a slender advantage after they beat Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid 2-1 at home in the first leg of their King's Cup last-16 tie on Thursday. Mallorca's Argentine striker Oscar Trejo stabbed home from close range at a corner in the 23rd minute, but two minutes later compatriot Gonzalo Higuain lashed a superb volley high into the net to level the scores. The home side had had a good shout for a penalty waved away, but early in the second half Venezuelan forward Arango fired in a long range effort to put the 2003 winners back in front. Both sides' goalkeepers pulled off spectacular reflex saves to deny Arango and Real substitute Javier Saviola as the half progressed, with Mallorca having the better of the game. Atletico Madrid may be left to rue their poor finishing after being held to a 0-0 home draw by Valladolid earlier in the evening. Atletico's Diego Forlan and Luis Garcia were guilty of the worst offences in an open contest which could have gone either way. Valladolid's Sisi was denied a last-minute winner by a fingertip save from reserve keeper Ismael Falcon. On Wednesday, Valencia secured a 2-1 away win over Real Betis, Getafe thumped Levante 3-0 and Recreativo Huelva beat Villarreal 1-0. Holders Sevilla and Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Espanyol, Real Zaragoza and Racing Santander all drew 1-1. The return legs are to be played next week
