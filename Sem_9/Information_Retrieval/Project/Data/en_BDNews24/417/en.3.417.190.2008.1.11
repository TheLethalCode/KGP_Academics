 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steady batting by Ashwell Prince helped South Africa build a huge first innings lead in the third test against West Indies on Friday. South Africa went to tea on the second day on 437 for four, a lead of 298. Prince was 73 not out with AB de Villiers on 36 in a stand of 63 for the fifth wicket. Prince's effort followed Graeme Smith's 147, a sturdy 69 by Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis's bustling 74. Smith and Amla resumed on 213-1, and a cloudless skies denied the West Indian bowlers the overcast conditions that had made their South African counterparts a rasping threat on the first day when the tourists were bowled out for 139. Medium pacer Darren Sammy struck in the ninth over of the day when Amla tried to work a delivery to the leg side and instead steered a catch to Dwayne Bravo at silly mid-off. Six balls later Jerome Taylor had Smith caught behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, who dived in front of first slip to end an innings of four hours in which Smith faced 165 balls and hit 27 fours. Kallis and Prince soon re-established South Africa's dominance in a stand that 122 before Kallis slashed at a ball from off-spinner Marlon Samuels and was caught by Runako Morton at slip. Prince and De Villiers dealt efficiently with the second new ball, and forged ahead until tea. The series is tied at 1-1
