 NAIROBI, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday rejected a government offer of bilateral talks to end a political crisis that has killed 500 people, saying that without international mediation they would be a "sideshow". "We will not attend the talks on Friday," Odinga told a news conference. "They are a sideshow." He said he would only hold negotiations under the mediation of African Union chairman John Kufuor of Ghana who is expected in Nairobi tonight but has not been invited to the Friday talks.
