 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Two advisers-in-waiting AF Hassan Ariff and Rasheda K Chowdhury Wednesday pledged to do their best to help the caretaker government to hold a free, fair election within the scheduled timeframe. Former BIDS senior research fellow Hossain Zillur Rahman, retired major general Golam Quader and former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali are the others who have been invited to the swearing-in ceremony at Bangabhaban at 6:30pm. "This is a big responsibility. I need everyone's cooperation," said Ariff, speaking to bdnews24.com, hours before taking oath in office. He said the government would transfer power to an elected government, which is its main responsibility. "We have to think about a legal framework for this," he said. Ariff worked under the four-party coalition government as attorney general since Oct 14, 2001 before he resigned on April 26, 2005. The main aim of Rasheda as an adviser to the caretaker government would be to present the nation a free, fair voting. She said she would be "very sincere" in properly discharging the responsibilities as an adviser. Prior to taking oath as an adviser she told bdnewds24.com at 4pm by telephone, "The main aim of the present caretaker government is to present the nation with a free, fair and neutral election. As an adviser my aim will be same too. "Besides I will try my level best to perform the responsibility which the chief adviser reposes on me." The CEO of the Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE), Rasheda, said her appointment as an adviser was confirmed by the high level of government Tuesday night. On Wednesday she went to her CAMPE office at Humayun Road in Mohammadpur as usual. After doing office work there for some time she returned to her Banani home. bdnews24.co
