 DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish authorities have foiled an attack by a group of Kurdish militants suspected of carrying out a bomb blast last week that killed six people, a provincial governor said on Friday. The number of arrests over the blast has risen to nine and all but one of those will appear in court on Friday, Huseyin Avni Mutlu, governor of Diyarbakir province in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, told a televised news conference . "Another disaster has been prevented at the last minute. The terrorists were awaiting orders to act." Police have seized explosives, two rockets, a laptop, CDs and mobile telephones in their counter-terrorist operation following the blast, he said. Some of the items seized were displayed on a table at the news conference. The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has signalled that PKK members working independently may have been behind the explosion, which targeted military personnel but occurred near a private school. Five of the six dead were school students. Turkish police have said the bombers took their orders from PKK commanders based in nearby northern Iraq. Turkey's military, the second largest in NATO, is bombing and shelling PKK targets in mainly Kurdish northern Iraq after the United States began sharing intelligence on the rebels' movements in the mountainous region. On Friday, Iraqi Kurdish officials said Turkish artillery had shelled targets on Iraqi territory but said there were no immediate reports of casualties or material damage. Last month, Turkish warplanes repeatedly struck PKK targets and troops conducted small-scale cross-border raids. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984. The United States and European Union, like Turkey, brand the PKK a terrorist organisation.
