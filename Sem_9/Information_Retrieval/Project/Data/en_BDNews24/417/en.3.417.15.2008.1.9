 WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States plans, most likely this week, to impose sanctions on an Iranian Qods force member for stoking violence in Iraq as well as on several Iraqi exiles in Syria and Iran, US officials said on Wednesday. The new sanctions, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, come amid fresh tensions this week between Tehran and Washington after Iranian speedboats confronted three US Navy ships in the Strait of Hormuz, actions US President George W. Bush called "provocative." A senior Bush administration official said the sanctions were being imposed on the Iranian and exiled Iraqis because "they are basically supporting the insurgency in various ways in Iraq." The official, who asked not to be named as the action had not yet been announced, said the sanctions would be imposed under an executive order Bush signed last year that is aimed at targeting individuals or organizations that promote or foster violence in Iraq. Another US official, who also asked not to be named because the issue was sensitive, said the sanctions could be announced as early as Wednesday. The Qods force is an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was dubbed a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction by the Bush administration last October. In addition, the US government imposed sanctions on the Qods force overall last October as a means of ratcheting up pressure on Tehran both over its activities in Iraq as well as its nuclear program, which Washington believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful power generation purposes. A Treasury Department spokesman declined comment on the planned new sanctions.
