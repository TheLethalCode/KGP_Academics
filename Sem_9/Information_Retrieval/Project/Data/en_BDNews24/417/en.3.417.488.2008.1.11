 BEIJING, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten people were missing on Friday after an illegal ferry struck the cable of an anchored vessel and then capsized and sank in thick fog near Shanghai, Xinhua news agency reported. The ferry, carrying 20 passengers and two crew, capsized at the Wusong pier and sank instantly, the report said. Twelve had since been rescued. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau and the East China Sea Rescue Bureau were organising a search and rescue effort. Shanghai, China's financial capital and a major port city, has been blanketed for days by heavy fog that has disrupted flights and snarled traffic.
