 PRISTINA, Serbia, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament endorsed a coalition government on Wednesday headed by ex-guerrilla Hashim Thaci on a promise to lead the Albanian majority province to independence from Serbia early this year. The 120-seat assembly voted 85-22 to approve the "grand coalition" of Thaci's Democratic Party (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), the territory's two dominant parties after a November election. Thaci, who led a 1998-99 guerrilla insurgency to end a decade of Serb repression under late strongman Slobodan Milosevic, says Kosovo will declare independence with Western backing within weeks or months, after talks with Serbia ended in December in deadlock. Kosovo's 2 million Albanians are counting on the West to overrule opposition from Serbia and Russia and recognise Kosovo as the last state to be carved from the former Yugoslavia. Thaci, 39, told the packed assembly that Kosovo was at "an historic crossroads" and that its next steps would be closely coordinated with the United States and European Union. "We are preparing to make Kosovo an independent and sovereign state early this year," he said. "We will turn our dream, and our right, into a reality." Thaci's Democratic Party emerged from the ranks of the guerrilla army that battled Serb forces, eclipsing the LDK's policy of passive resistance. Western diplomats hope a broad coalition of the two parties will steer Kosovo through what promises to be a turbulent transition to statehood after Russia blocked its secession at the U.N. Security Council. The two together hold 62 seats in the 120-seat assembly, which also voted to return LDK leader Fatmir Sejdiu for a second five-year term as Kosovo president, a largely ceremonial post. Serb forces pulled out of Kosovo in 1999 after 11 weeks of NATO bombing to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two-year Serb counter-insurgency war. Central to Serb history and identity, the territory has been run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO since. The West fears that continuing its limbo could trigger unrest after almost two years of Serb-Albanian negotiations failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. The United States and most of the 27 EU members are expected to recognise a unilateral declaration of independence, and the EU plans to take control of policing and justice. Kosovo Albanians are expected to wait until after a presidential election in Serbia on Jan 20 to declare independence, to avoid boosting the nationalist vo
