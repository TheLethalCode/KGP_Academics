 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Heads of the country's leading business groups Wednesday said the caretakers should have brought about the changes in the government at least six months ago. The present caretaker government, led by Fakhruddin Ahmed, has been facing a hostile reaction from the business community and the general public over decaying business confidence and continued escalation in prices of essentials. "The government has many success stories, but it failed abysmally to control the prices of essentials," Manzur Elahi, administrator of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told bdnews24.com. "People can't appreciate reforms that are not important to them if they don't get essentials at affordable prices," Elahi--who was himself twice an adviser to previous caretaker governments--remarked. The administrator of the country's apex trade body said the changes could have made six to seven months ago. Immediate past FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain said the latest changes in the government have been made recognising the public's perception. "The government has registered people's sentiment," Hossain said. On the present shuffling, he commented: "Better late than never." Hossain added that the government could have got better results if it took the decision earlier. Law adviser Mainul Hosein, health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, power and food adviser Tapan Chowdhury and industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury quit the Fakhruddin administration Tuesday. Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri preceded them by resigning his post on Dec 26 after two rare Vishnu statues went missing. Manzur Elahi said the government and the food adviser failed to understand the importance of food security thus throwing the country and its people into serious turmoil regarding staple foods. "If the government had adequate food stocks, businessmen would have been discouraged to stockpile and raise the prices," he said. The message that 'the government does not have adequate food stocks' is enough to encourage businessmen to hike the price of rice, he noted. Elahi, also a leading businessman, said: "You've to understand the mindset of the businessmen." He also criticised the commerce ministry for not playing its due role, including frequent interaction with the business community on price hikes of essentials. Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said: "We expect the new advisers will take steps to ease the soaring prices of essentials." All three business leaders said restoring business confidence would be another big challenge for the new advisers. "Long term investment depends on business confidence," the FBCCI administrator said. Elahi also asked the government to increase coordination, which he said now exists only at the minimum level, between the ministries. bd
