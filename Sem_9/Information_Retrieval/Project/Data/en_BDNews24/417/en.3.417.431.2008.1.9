 FRANKFURT, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares hit a seven-week low on Wednesday driven by retail stocks after Britain's Marks & Spencer reported its worst quarterly performance in two years and as worries about a US recession intensified. Britain's largest clothing retailer fell almost 20 percent after it reported that like-for-like sales at its UK stores fell 2.2 percent in the third quarter to Dec. 29, adding to signs of a slowdown in British consumer spending. The DJ Stoxx index of European retailers fell 5.2 percent, making it the worst performing sector in Europe. It has fallen 8.5 percent since the beginning of the year, after dropping of 11.5 percent in 2007. By 0944 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.4 percent at 1,446.88 points, erasing the previous days gains and temporarily hitting its lowest level since November 22. Investors are becoming increasingly nervous amid mounting signals that problems in the global credit market, which led to a worldwide equity sell-off in recent months, have begun filtering through to the real economy. On Wednesday, data also showed that German retail sales unexpectedly fell by 1.3 percent in November, their second consecutive monthly drop, suggesting household spending was a drag on overall growth in the last quarter of 2007. "There is certainly some profit taking involved as market players are trying to build up a cushion," said Klaus Schruefer, head of investment strategy at SEB. Sectors affected by insipid company news or macro data -- cyclical stocks in general -- would be the worst hit, he said. On Tuesday, US phone company AT&T warned of soft consumer spending, sending its shares down 4.8 percent and triggering a new wave of recession fears. US benchmark equities indexes fell between 1.8 percent and 2.4 percent. Banking shares, which have borne the brunt of the global credit market turmoil, chalked up losses again with Barclays falling 3.3 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland down 2.4 percent and Credit Suisse down 2.5 percent. Oil shares also weighed with BP down 3 percent, Total down 0.8 percent and Royal Dutch Shell shedding 0.6 percent. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 1.4 percent, dragged down by heavy declines in some of Europe's largest retailers, such as Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury and Morrison Germany's DAX index fell 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.2 percent. Investors preferred defensive stocks like utilities and pharmaceuticals with E.ON shares gaining 1.1 percent and Switzerland's drug giants Novartis and Roche up 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent respectiv
