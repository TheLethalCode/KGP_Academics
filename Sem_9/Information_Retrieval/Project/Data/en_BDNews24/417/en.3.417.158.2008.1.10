<TITLE> Tony Blair to join JPMorgan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair is expected on Thursday to join US bank JPMorgan as a senior adviser, according to a person familiar with the situation. JPMorgan declined to comment. The Financial Times in London first reported the move on its Web site, saying it would be the first in a series of positions Blair expects to take in the private sector. Blair, a key ally of US President George W Bush, was replaced last year by Gordon Brown as prime minister amid growing discontent over Great Britain's policy in Iraq. Details of Blair's duties with JPMorgan, the third largest US bank, were not immediately available. Blair's predecessor, John Major, joined a US finance company after leaving 10 Downing Street. After leaving office, Major joined U.S. private equity firm The Carlyle Group in 1998 amid that company's big push into the European market.
