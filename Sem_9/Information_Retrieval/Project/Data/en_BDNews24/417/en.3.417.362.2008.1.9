<TITLE> Political pessimism weighs on Japan policy outlook </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Even if worries about fallout from a US downturn and a strong yen were to vanish miraculously, investors pondering whether to put money in Japan would have another big hurdle to clear: pessimism about politics. With a parliamentary deadlock blocking reforms and critics charging both major parties lack vision, few pundits predict Japan will overcome daunting challenges and boost its global competitiveness. "Nobody trusts politics in Japan now," said Martin Schulz, a senior researcher at Fujitsu Research Institute. "Japan has potential. It always has had. But you can't unlock it without the appropriate policies and reforms," Schulz added. "You just have a country with a shrinking population, depressed consumers and depressed incomes being out-competed by the rest of Asia. This is not an illusion any more." Reflecting the gloom, the Tokyo stock market was the world's worst performer last year. It has dropped 20 percent in value since last July, the same month the ruling bloc took a huge beating in an election for parliament's upper house. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in December cut its growth forecast for the Japanese economy in 2008 to 1.6 percent, down from an earlier 2.1 percent. Analysts cite the legacy of five decades of virtual one-party rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a root cause of the political paralysis. The immediate obstacle to decisive action, though, is a divided parliament, where the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and smaller opposition allies control the upper house and can delay bills. PRESSING PROBLEMS, ELECTION CALENDAR The stalemate is preventing Tokyo from dealing with pressing problems such as reform of a creaking pension system, a tax system big companies say hurts their global competitiveness, and public debt worth about 150 percent of GDP. "Gridlock makes Japan look petty, preoccupied with its own little detailed administrative problems," said Jesper Koll, president of investment advisory firm Tantallon Research Japan. "The worst thing for investors is no decisions being made." The policy deadlock has prompted many to forecast that Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, a dour 71-year-old moderate who took over last September, will be forced to call a lower house election this year to seek a mandate, either after the national budget is enacted in late March or following a July Group of Eight summit. The budget can take effect without upper house approval, but related laws must be approved by both chambers, so the opposition could take those bills hostage to force a poll. No lower house election is required until September 2009 and Fukuda is in no hurry since the LDP and its junior partner are all but certain to lose their two-thirds majority, won in 2005 under charismatic pro-reform Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The huge majority allows the ruling bloc to enact bills rejected by the upper house, although the rarely used procedure is time-consuming and risks a public backlash. "If Fukuda can choose, I would expect it to be after the G8 summit meeting. The question is, can he last that long? I think it is possible," said Koichi Nakano, a Sophia University political science professor. Others argue Fukuda will not hold an election this year at all, given the high risk and probable low return. MORE GRIDLOCK OR REALIGNMENT? Chances an election would resolve the deadlock are slim unless the opposition wins a clear victory and ends more than 50 years of almost unbroken LDP rule. Analysts say that feat will be difficult given the DPJ's internal fractures and record of blunders at critical junctures, but not impossible in view of surveys showing voter preference for a new hand at the helm. The DPJ is an amalgam of former LDP members, ex-socialists and young hawks. "Japan needs a change of government, but are they ready for prime time?" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus. Analysts who expect an election say the government hopes a victory, even with a smaller majority, would allow it to force the opposition into cooperating by arguing it had public support. But opposition control of the upper house could last at least until the next election for the chamber in 2010, the main reason Japanese media refuse to let the idea of a grand coalition die. Analysts, though, argue that a less sweeping political rejig is more likely. "The preferred option for the LDP is to steal some people and get a majority," Nakano said. Post-election, the Democrats might start cooperating on some policy issues, but pessimism over the outlook for aggressive measures and broad visions runs deep. "At the end of the day, politics leads minds and gives you hope," Koll said. "No one dares hope anything here. They are just busy micromanaging
