 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  A devastating fire raced through a sprawling slum in the city's Rayer Bazar area, destroying some 2,500 huts. No casualties were reported immediately, though they are feared. A fire official quoting the slum dwellers said four children were missing but details were sketchy. The source of the fire at Nimtoli could not be confirmed. The flames were tamed after more than two hours of efforts, the officials and witnesses said. Residents used loudspeakers of a nearby mosque to ask the slum dwellers to issue alerts about any missing. Fire fighters struggled to control the blaze that broke out at 7:00pm, fire department control room official Kazi Sufia told bdnews24.com by phone. She said at least a dozen fire-fighting vehicles had been sent to the scene but the blaze was devastating. Fire brigade official ABM Nurul Haque told bdnews24.com at the scene that 2,000 to 2,500 homes were destroyed in the fire. Quoting the slum dwellers, Haque said they were yet to assess on their own but the destruction was widespread. Fire services department director general Brig Gen Abu Naim Mohammad Shahidullah said they made their highest efforts to protect the homes. He said most of the homes were built on raised bamboo structures. A gas line of Titas caught the fire and emergency officials from the Titas Gas rushed to the scene and doused the flames, Shahidullah said. The fire also spreaded to nearby homes in the neighbourhoods, bdnews24.com correspondent Golam Mortuja Antu reported from the scene. "It's huge. The residents are scared," he said. The neighbours also joined the firefighters to help douse the raging flames. Antu said the firefighters faced hurdles because of narrow access to the slum. He said there were also no adequate sources of water nearby. Flummoxed slum dwellers tried to save their valuables from the areas where the fire had not spread, he added. The inferno reduced slum dweller Jahanara Begum to tears. "I've lost everything. I've no money to buy medicines even for my daughter," Jahanara said as she sobbed. bdnews24.
