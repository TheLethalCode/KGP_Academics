 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The pro-Khaleda Zia BNP faction Saturday demanded national elections before the Election Commission deadline but its rival pro-reform faction sought the vote in line with the roadmap. Both factions however asked the government to prioritise the parliamentary elections over other elections and blamed arch-rival Awami League for the emergency rule clamped on Jan 11 last year. Detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia nominated secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and Hafizuddin Ahmed, acting secretary general nominated by the policymaking standing committee, held press briefings at their Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat and Banani home respectively. Delwar placed a seven-point charter of demands at the briefing while Hafizuddin rolled out a five-point recommendation to the government. Delwar demanded immediate unconditional release of Khaleda and AL chief Sheikh Hasina for restoration of an environment for election. His other demands include immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency, a stop to filing of cases against politicians for what he said was meant to harass them, allowing outdoor politics, withdrawal of cases against political detainees including Khaleda and release of the arrested teachers and students of Dhaka University. Hafizuddin said Jan 11 was a milestone in the national history. "The Awami League is responsible for the issuance of the state of emergency. The country will never go back to the pre-January 11 situation," he said. He said the reforms would bring qualitative changes to the political arena. Hafizuddin said the government's successes have been blurred by the price hike. In a five-point recommendation, he urged the government to create investment-friendly environment, shore up eroding confidence of businesses, take quick steps to boost the economy, build up food security and take steps to increase foreign currency earnings. He refuted acting AL president Zillur Rahman's allegation made at a press briefing Friday that BNP was responsible for the Jan 11 changeover. bdnew
