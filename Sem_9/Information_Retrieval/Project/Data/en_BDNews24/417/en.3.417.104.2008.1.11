<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Three cases were filed Thursday against three firms owned by former caretaker adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury and husband Nazim Kamran Choudhury and a security firm on charges of illegal occupation. The cases alleged that the three other firms owned by the couple and Group 4 Securities refused to vacate rented premises even though the rental agreement had expired. House owner Dr Mahbubul Islam and wife Farhana Islam filed the cases with the Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court. District judge AKM Ishtiaq Hossain took the cases into cognisance and summoned the accused persons to court. One case has been filed against Adcomm Ltd owned by Geeteara and Group 4 Securities owned by Salim Choudhury. The second case names Megavision and Signage, both owned by Nazim Kamran, and Group 4 Securities. The third case names Group 4 Securities alone. The complainants said the owners of Adcomm, Megavision and Signage rented premises at house no 7/A, on road no. 41 in Gulshan-2 on Oct 1, 2002, but they did not vacate the house even though the rental agreement ended on Sep 30, 2007. They alleged Geeteara misused her power as an adviser to aid her husband to continue to occupy the premises in flagrant violation of the agreement. Group 4 Securities also had been abetting in the illegal act. The complainants alleged when they moved to get the accused persons out of the premises, they had physically harassed them. They mentioned that a criminal case involving that incident was pending with a court. bdne
