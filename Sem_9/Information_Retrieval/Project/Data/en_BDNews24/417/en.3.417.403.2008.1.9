 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank has forecast Bangladesh's GDP growth at 5.5 percent for fiscal 2007-08, lower than domestic projections, on twin floods, cyclone and political tensions. Rising inflation and spiralling food and energy prices, threat to exports and pressure on external balance would affect the economy this fiscal year, according to the WB's Global Economic Prospects 2008 (GEP 2008) released globally Wednesday. Last month Bangladesh Bank revised down the GDP growth at 6.2 to 6.5 percent from 7 percent because of severe floods and the cyclone that badly damaged crops. Earlier, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank estimated that the GDP growth would clock below 6 percent. "Heightened political tensions and severe flooding were curbing demand in the second half of fiscal 2007 and will contribute to a full percentage point reduction in growth to 5.5 percent for fiscal 2008," the bank's outlook said: The report said weaker domestic credit growth and fall in export growth will also contribute to lower GDP growth, which was 6.6 in 2005-06 and 6.5 percent in 2006-07 fiscal years. It said sharp rise in international food prices is a growing concern in the South Asia where food imports accounts for 11-20 percent of total merchandise imports. "In case of Bangladesh, food imports represent 19 percent of its total imports," the report said, adding that rising international food prices are affecting Bangladesh and other poorest nations. The higher food prices could also affect government treasury and generate increased inflationary pressures, it warned. "Further increases in energy prices remain a risk for the region, which is highly dependent on oil imports." According to the GEP, South Asia's regional GDP was vibrant at 8.4 percent growth in 2007, easing only moderately from the 8.8 percent outturn of 2006. The regional growth is expected to pick up to 8.1 percent by 2009, as recovering growth in the OECD firms up external demand and receding oil prices ease pressures on the import bill. In 2008, global growth is expected to be 3.3 percent. bd
