 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The law enforcement official leading the investigation into corruption allegations against South Africa's police chief has been arrested on graft charges, the prosecuting authority said on Wednesday. Gerrie Nel, a senior official of the elite crime-fighting unit, called the Scorpions, was arrested at his home on Tuesday night. He has led the investigation of national police chief Jackie Selebi, an ally of South African President Thabo Mbeki. Moketedi Mpshe, acting head of the National Prosecuting Authority, told Talk Radio 702 that the arrest had nothing to do with Nel's conduct in the politically sensitive Selebi case and would have no bearing on whether the police chief is charged. The prosecuting authority has also charged Jacob Zuma, the newly-elected leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering and he is due to stand trial in August. Senior ANC leaders questioned the integrity of the prosecuting authority on Tuesday, saying there was a political motivation for the charges against Zuma -- who defeated Mbeki to win the party leadership election last month. Mpshe said the case against Nel dated back to a trial two or three years ago in which he testified against a member of the Scorpions, an FBI-style service. Nel was accused of "defeating the ends of justice" as well as corruption. "I was just shocked and disappointed," Mpshe said of Nel's arrest. Nel's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Asked if the arrest would influence the decision on whether to charge Selebi, Mpshe said: "Certainly not. It won't at all." He said a decision on whether to prosecute Selebi would be announced by the end of the month. The Selebi investigation has the potential to damage South Africa's reputation at a time when it is trying to persuade sceptics that it can reduce high levels of violent crime ahead of the 2010 soccer World Cup, which it will host. The embattled police chief, who is also the president of Interpol, has been accused of downplaying the severity of the country's crime problem and has raised eyebrows by acknowledging his friendship with Glenn Agliotti, a convicted drug smuggler. South African media have reported that Selebi has ties to criminal syndicates. He has denied the allegations. Mbeki has stood by Selebi despite calls by the opposition and media for his dismissal, prompting allegations he was being protected for political reasons. Selebi was an ANC activist in exile during the struggle to overthrow white minority ru
