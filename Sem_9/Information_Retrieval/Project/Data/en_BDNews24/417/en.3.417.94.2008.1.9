 TAIPEI, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan prosecutors on Wednesday made a final appeal against not-guilty verdicts in presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's corruption case, threatening the opposition leader's campaign for closer ties with China. Ma was found not guilty in August of corruption by diverting part of a special allowance to his own account while serving as Taipei mayor. He was cleared again by the High Court last month.

Ma stepped down as KMT chairman after he was charged but has always denied wrongdoing. "When the prosecutors were deliberating this appeal, they were considering reasons not related to the laws," Ma's lawyer, Song Yao-ming, said on Wednesday. "Some are political reasons." Current President Chen Shui-bian's wife, son in-law and aides are also fighting corruption charges as prosecutors probe Hsieh for any history of graft. Last week, Ma sued the Taipei district prosecutor accusing him of using false evidence to damage his reputati
