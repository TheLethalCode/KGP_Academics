 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Tuesday became runners-up in the National Cricket League one-dayer by virtue of net run rate, putting four-dayer champions Khulna behind after Rajshahi ensured their championship two rounds earlier. Last year's both- version champions Dhaka beat Rajshahi by 51 runs in the 10th and final round encounter at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium while hosts Khulna thrashed Barisal by seven wickets at Birshreshthho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Dhaka and Khulna finished the league having 12 points each from 10 outings and Dhaka were declared runners-up by virtue of net run rate while Khulna came third. Sylhet finished fourth despite conceding a seven-wicket defeat to Chittagong at Birshreshthho Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Sylhet and Barisal have eight points each from 10 matches, and Sylhet were declared third on the basis of head-to-head count where Sylhet beat Barisal twice. Chittagong with six points remained at the bottom of the six-team point table. Dhaka vs Rajshahi Chasing 255 runs for a win set by Dhaka, Rajshahi were all out for 203 with seven balls to spare in the face of excellent bowling from the opposition spinners. Rajshahi's top order was a miserable failure before middle order batsmen Mahbubul Karim (41), Nayeem Islam (43) and tail-ender Mohammad Shahazada (41) offered some challenge to the Dhaka bowlers. Ace spinner Mohammad Rafique led the attack with three for 29 while Mehrab Hossain Junior chipped in with two for 53. Pacers Mahbubul Alam, Mohammad Sharif and spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel took one wicket apiece. Earlier, Dhaka deciding to bat first posted a fighting total of 254 for eight in 50 overs riding on scores of Anwar Hossain (65) and Mahmudullah Riad (52), Nazmul Hossain (42 not out) and Nadif Chowdhury (34). Khulna vs Barisal Khulna raced to 268 for three in 47.4 overs in reply to Barisal's 265 for six in 50 overs. Opener Imrul Kayes led from the front with a defiant century after Khulna lost Nazmus Sadat (21), Mostafizur Rahman (36) and Monirul Islam (0) cheaply. Kayes blazed an unbeaten 133 while Sahagir Hossain struck 75 not out to propel Khulna easily home with 14 balls to spare. Asked to bat first, Barisal put up a fighting total, riding on a 133-run knock from Rakibul Hasan. Kamrul Islam (43) and Arafat Salahuddin (47 not out) helped the visitors go beyond the 250-mark. Chittagong vs Sylhet Faisal Hossain (71 not out) and Dhiman Gosh (73 not out) steered Chittagong to 202 for three in 30.1 overs, chasing a paltry target of 199 set by Sylhet. After being invited to bat first, Sylhet found themselves in difficulty with pacers Tareq Aziz (3/25) and Kamrul Islam (2/34) rattling the top and middle orders. Golam Mabud top-scored with 69, followed by Sharifullah on 28 and Rana on 20. Golam Rahman of Sylhet was fined 50 percent of his match fees by match referee ASM Roquibul Hassan for the breach of code of conduct during the match.
