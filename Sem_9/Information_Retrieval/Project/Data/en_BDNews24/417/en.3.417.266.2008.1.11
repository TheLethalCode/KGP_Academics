<TITLE> Sarkozy's ex-wife loses case to stop book </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The ex-wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday lost an attempt to hold up publication of a book in which she is quoted as describing her former husband in unflattering terms. Cecilia Sarkozy, 50, who divorced from Sarkozy in October, had taken judicial action against the publication of the book "Cecilia" by Anna Bitton, but a Paris court ruled against temporarily stopping the book's publication. "We'll appeal immediately," Cecilia's lawyer Michele Cahen told Reuters. The book "Cecilia" is one of a trio of books out this week, which describe Sarkozy's former wife as a powerful woman who was still yielding some influence over the president. Bitton had quoted Cecilia as commenting very negatively on Sarkozy's personality and parenting skills. Cecilia's lawyer had said Cecilia contested the comments attributed to her and the way "her intimate feelings were being put on display". The books on Cecilia received a lot of attention in France this week. Their publication coincided with strong hints by Sarkozy, 52, that he intended to marry his new girlfriend, Italian former model Carla Bruni. A magazine also reported that Sarkozy had offered the same kind of pink heart-shaped, diamond ring to Bruni that his ex-wife had been seen wearing last summer.
