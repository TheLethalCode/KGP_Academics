<TITLE> Nikkei hits 26-mth closing low on economy, Merrill </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's benchmark Nikkei fell on Friday to its lowest close since Nov. 2005, pushed down by fears about the Japanese economy and a report that Merrill Lynch will post larger-than-expected losses on the subprime mortgage crisis. Retailers and property shares tumbled, with Tokyu Land Corp down 7.6 percent, helping to make the real estate subindex the worst performer on the day. The Nikkei closed at 14,110.79, its lowest in over two years, after shedding 277.32 points. It has lost nearly 22 percent in the past six months, 7.8 percent of that since trade resumed on Jan 4. The broader TOPIX index fell 1.7 percent to 1,377.58, its lowest close since October 2005. The fall in Japanese shares came despite a rally on Wall Street after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged on Thursday that the economy faces increased risks and indicated that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates aggressively to support growth. Merrill Lynch is expected to suffer $15 billion in losses stemming from soured mortgage investments, almost twice the company's original estimate, the New York Times said on Friday. "People began selling on the Merrill report because this has increased worries ahead of next week's earnings reports by big U.S. banks and financial firms," said Yumi Nishimura, manager at the investment advisory section of Daiwa Securities SMBC. "On top of this, there's no guarantee that this will be the only bad news. Sentiment is just getting colder and colder." Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said on Friday the pace of economic growth was slowing, and additional gloom came from data showing that annual growth in Japanese bank loans slowed to the lowest in almost two years in December, reflecting companies' growing cautiousness in light of an uncertain economic outlook. "Domestic concerns appear to be trumping the hopeful expectations that boosted Wall Street," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist Shinko Securities. Investors were eager to dump shares ahead of a three-day weekend, afraid that too much will happen overseas. On Jan. 4, Japan's first trading day, the Nikkei tumbled 4 percent as investors dumped shares following a sharp advance by the yen against the dollar and surging oil prices, all of which took place as Japanese markets were closed for the New Year. "With a lot of key things happening overseas next week, nobody wants to risk the volatile moves that may result as the Japanese market tries to digest events in a hurry -- as happened after the New Year's holiday," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. REAL ESTATE AND RETAILERS Property shares tumbled, extending losses from Thursday, when Credit Suisse issued a note to clients in which it forecast that the credit crunch would lead to a slowdown in global funds flowing into Japan's real estate market. Tokyu Land was down 7.6 percent at 803 yen and Sumitomo Realty & Development Co slipped 7.2 percent to 2,300 yen. Mitsui Fudosan was down 5.2 percent at 2,085 yen. Property funds tumbled after Asset Managers Co cast a cloud over the outlook for the sector with a sharp downward revision to its profit forecasts. Creed Corp fell 18.7 percent to 174,000 yen and Kenedix Inc was down by 16.9 percent at 148,000 yen, helping to drag the real estate subindex down by 5.4 percent. The index has lost 14 percent so far this year. J.Front Retailing Co Ltd, Japan's top department store operator, fell by its daily limit to 833 yen, a fall of 10.7 percent, after slashing its full-year outlook on weak clothing sales. The nation's largest retailer, Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd, fell 6.3 percent to 2,885 yen. One rare bright spot was heavy machinery maker IHI Corp, which said on Friday it was in talks with steelmaker JFE Holdings Inc to merge their shipbuilding operations. IHI closed up 1.4 percent at 218 yen, but JFE Holdings was down by 0.55 percent at 5,460 yen. Trade was active, with 2.47 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, compared with the daily average of 1.98 billion in December. Declining shares beat advancing ones by nearly seven to one.
