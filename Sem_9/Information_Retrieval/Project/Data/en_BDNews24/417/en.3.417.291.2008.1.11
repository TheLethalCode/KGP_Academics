 TBILISI, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili won a Jan. 5 presidential election with a final tally of 53.38 percent of the votes, a Central Election Commission (CEC) spokesman said on Friday. "According to this data, Saakashvili has won in the first round and there will be no second round," Irakly Porchkhidze told journalists. He said Saakashvili's main rival -- leader of a nine-party opposition coalition Levan Gachechiladze -- received 25.67 percent of votes in the election, which the opposition said was rigged. Western monitors said the poll had been slightly flawed but was still competitive and fair. The CEC and local courts are still due to review complaints about the election, but the CEC officials say it would not change the final result of the poll. Earlier the CEC had said Saakashvili had won with 52.8 percent of the vote. Porchkhidze said 72.5 percent of Georgian voters backed the country's aspirations to join NATO in a plebiscite, also held on Jan. 5, while 69.9 percent supported bringing a parliamentary election forward from the autumn of 2008 to the spring. The date of the parliamentary election is due to be announced by the president.
