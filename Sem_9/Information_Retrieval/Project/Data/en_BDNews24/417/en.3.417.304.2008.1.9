 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Some locker clients at BRAC Bank's Dhanmondi branch in Sukrabad Wednesday said there were no signs that the lockers had been broken open. The police said there was no progress in the investigation into the overnight robbery. Mohammadpur police chief Shibli Noman told bdnews24.com that Nidmahal Hotel workers Shah Alam, Sujan, Supan Barua and Monir have been remanded in custody for questioning. Robbers swept clean 60 lockers of the bank Saturday night, but the incident which the clients alleged had been kept secret hit the media spotlight Monday. The thieves cut open the roof of the top floor of the bank, made an easy foray into the locker room and looted valuables from 60 lockers. Zinat Siraj, Sumana Islam and Fatema Rahim were among those whose lockers were looted by the robbers. They visited their lockers Wednesday and later told reporters that bank authorities allowed them to see the lockers three days after the incident had taken place. They opened their lockers and found them alright but said the lockers did not appear to have been ere robbed. They alleged the bank asked them to submit a list, not demand letter, but later accepted their demand letters under pressure. Head of the bank's marketing and corporate affairs Abedur Rahman Shikder told bdnews24.com that clients opened their lockers before the police. Two clients Wednesday took away their wealth from lockers, he added. He said 22 out of 60 clients submitted demand letters until Wednesday evening. He denied the allegation of having been pressured to receive the demand letters. Mohammadpur police opened an investigation into the burglary shortly after incident came to light Monday. A case was filed with Mohammadpur Police Station. Shikder Tuesday told bdnews24.com, "We have reached an understanding with the clients that if the police cannot recover the looted goods in 90 days bank authorities will try to compensate them after evaluating their losses." bdne
