 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)--The caretaker government supports the trial of war criminals, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday. "Of course, we want this (trial of the war criminals)," Iftekhar said in response to reporters' questions following a meeting with secretary-general of the Amnesty International Irene Khan at the foreign ministry. "Bangladesh can take lessons from the United Nations on the trial of war criminals. In Cambodia war criminals were tried after many years," Irene Khan told journalists. The AI secretary-general expressed concern over extra-judicial deaths under so-called "cross fire". She said the government had assured her such extra-judicial deaths had decreased in number. "It is not matter of reduction. It must be stopped totally," Irene Khan said. On media freedom the AI secretary-general said there were some provisions under the emergency rule for putting restrictions on media. "Though the restrictions have not been applied, the restrictions must go altogether," she said. The secretary general alleged that previous governments had not acted on their commitments to form a national human rights commission. "Unlike the previous government the caretaker government, I hope, will form a national human rights commission," Khan said. bdn
