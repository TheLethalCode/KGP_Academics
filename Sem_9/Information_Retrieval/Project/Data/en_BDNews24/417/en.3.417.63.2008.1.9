<TITLE> Japan PM, Ozawa clash over stalled Afghan mission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister and main opposition rival clashed on Wednesday over a naval mission in support of US-led forces in Afghanistan as the ruling bloc prepared to force an enabling law through parliament this week. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, squaring off in parliament with Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa for the first time since taking office, praised the navy's refueling mission as helping the global war on terrorism and urged the opposition-controlled upper house to vote on it before parliament ends on Jan. 15. The one-on-one debate had been set for last year but was put off after Japanese politics was thrown into turmoil by failed talks between Fukuda and Ozawa over a 'grand coalition' to break through the policy deadlock born of the divided parliament. "I think these activities contribute to international society," Fukuda said. "They are not for the sake of any specific country," he added, rejecting Ozawa's frequent charge that the mission was solely for the sake of close security ally, Washington. The lower house has already approved the bill to allow Japan's navy to resume refuelling of US and other ships patrolling the Indian Ocean for suspected terrorists, activities Washington says are vital but which were halted when an enabling law expired in November due to opposition party delaying tactics. The ruling bloc can use its two-thirds majority in the lower house to force through the bill, but only after it has been voted on by the upper chamber or after 60 days have lapsed from its initial approval by the lower house. That would be on Saturday. Kyodo news agency said the upper house, after some dithering by the Democrats, was now likely to vote down the bill on Friday. Ozawa insists the refueling mission violates Japan's pacifist constitution, a position Fukuda flatly rejected. "The dispatch of the military overseas must be based on truly proper rules and principles," Ozawa said. "To mobilise the military is the last political option and should not be done haphazardly," he added. The Democrats, who are pressing for an early general election but are probably not ready yet, appear to have dropped a plan to adopt the first-ever censure motion against Fukuda over the naval mission. The prime minister had made clear he was likely to ignore the embarrassing but non-binding motion. Many Japanese oppose the naval mission but are more worried about pocketbook issues such as pensions, so the opposition may want to save a censure for a topic closer to voters' hearts. The exchange over the naval mission was the only fireworks in a low-key debate mostly devoted to government botching of millions of public pension records. The pension blunder helped the Democrats and smaller allies win control of the upper house last July and more recently has contributed to a sharp fall in Fukuda's own support ratin
