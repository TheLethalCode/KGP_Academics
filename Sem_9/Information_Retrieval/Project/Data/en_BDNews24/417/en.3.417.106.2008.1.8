 LAGOS, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed groups in Nigeria's oil producing south are building up arms and supplies for a major attack on an oil facility in the world's eight largest exporter, militant and security sources said on Tuesday. The planned rebel offensive against Africa's largest oil industry comes after the collapse of a government peace initiative and in response to increased military raids on militant hideouts in the region. "There could be a massive attack on an oil installation in Rivers state," said Jonjon Oyeinfie, a former leader of ethnic rights group Ijaw Youth Council, in reference to Nigeria's largest oil producing state.
