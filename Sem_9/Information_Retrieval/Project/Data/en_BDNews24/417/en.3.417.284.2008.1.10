 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com) -- International human rights watchdog Amnesty International Thursday accused the military-backed government of human rights violations. AI asked the government to adhere to a due process and the rule of law, respect fair trial standards, end arbitrary detention and reinstate provisions for bail. "AI has seen some familiar patterns of human rights abuses continuing under this regime. AI has also found new patterns of human-rights violations emerging for which this caretaker government is responsible," Irene Khan, secretary general of AI, told a press briefing at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. She blamed the government for paying little attention to the protection of human rights and said: "Time has come to review the necessity of the emergency power rules." On the restrictions on politics, Khan said AI believes the government will open dialogue with political parties. "Dialogue with the political parties is necessary not only for political reform but also for human rights reform," she said. Khan, who made her first official visit to Bangladesh as Amnesty's secretary general, asked the government to end emergency rules as soon as possible. A high-powered delegation led by Khan concluded its week-long tour of Bangladesh to look at human rights issues on the eve of the government's anniversary of one year in power. The government led by former central bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed took over power on Jan 11, 2007 amid political chaos. AI has prepared a report detailing its suggestions on the human rights issues. The suggestions include prosecuting members of the Armed Forces responsible for human-rights abuses, an end to immunity to law enforcers and repeal of the Special Powers Act. bd
