 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University reopened Tuesday with teachers and students wearing black badges to demand the release of detained teachers and students. The campus buzzed with students returning after the winter vacation, most of them wearing black badges. Teachers with ties to the Awami League and left-leaning parties also observed the black badge programme. However, the Dhaka University Teachers' Association leaders said that they had not observed the programme. The teachers with links to the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami were not seen wearing black badges. Professor MM Akash of the economics department told bdnews24.com: "The teachers are observing the programme in a particular context." "At the DUTA meeting, held before Eid-ul-Azha, all teachers agreed to observe the programme together. Today we have revived it." They will stage a one-hour silent sit-in at the foot of the Aparajaya Bangladesh monument Wednesday, Akash said. The acting DUTA president, Prof Tazmeri SA Islam, said: "This is not a DUTA programme. Few teachers are observing the programme being backed by a particular party." The demonstrators said they observed the programme after the decision of the meeting held on Dec 30. Mizanur Rahman, a student of mass communication and journalism, said: "The teachers and students are observing the programme peacefully demanding the release of the detained teachers and students. I have worn a black badge to express my solidarity with them." Some 30 to 35 students staged a midday silent demonstration. Earlier, some teachers had placed a memorandum to the vice-chancellor Monday. In the memorandum, they alleged that a certain quarter was attempting to destabilise the campus in the name of a demonstration for freedom of the detained teachers. It also urged the authorities to be alert so that the academic career of the students might not face any threat for political interest. Four teachers and 15 students are in jail following campus violence in August. bdnews24.com
