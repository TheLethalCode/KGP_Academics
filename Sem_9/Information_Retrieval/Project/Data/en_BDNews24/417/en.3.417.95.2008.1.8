 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government has 5 lakh tonnes of urea fertiliser in stock to cultivate irri and boro paddy on 45.50 lakh hectares in a bid to recover the damage done by the two back-to-back floods and cyclone. Targeted production this year is 1.75 crore tonnes. "The production target has been raised to compensate for the shortfall. The government has enough preparation to help and support the farmers," agriculture advisor Dr CS Karim said to bdnews24.com. "Fertiliser will be distributed at more than 15,000 points through dealers. A dealer on average will sell fertiliser to 1,000 farmers," he said. "With one dealer 2, 3 or 4 people may be engaged. They all will sell fertilisers." He also said seeds had been prepared over 42,000 hectares to cultivate hybrid paddy on some 12 lakh hectares of land. To produce boro in 45.50 lakh hectares 4 lakh tonnes urea is needed in Jan, 4.95 lakh tonnes in Feb, 2,94 lakh tonnes in March and 89,785 tonnes in April. The government plans to meet the monthly requirements from its stock and with supplies from Kafco and other domestic industries, and through import. The government will have 90,196 tonnes in stock after providing the required 4 lakh tonnes of urea for Jan. Kafco will provide 60,000 tonnes and other industries will produce 1.38 lakh tonnes. Another 1.76 lakh tonnes will be imported. That would amount to a stock of nearly 4.59 lakh tonnes in Feb but the demand for the month will be 4.95 lakh. Although the month will start with a shortfall of 35,400 tonnes, with 60,000 tonnes coming from Kafco, 1.38 lakh tonnes from other sources and 85,500 tonnes from imports, demands for the month will be met with surplus remains. March will start with a stock of some 2.35 lakh tonnes and the demand for the month will be around 2.94 lakh tonnes. Kafco with 12,920 tonnes, domestic industries 1.38 lakh tonnes and imports of 25,000 tonnes will help offset the shortfall of 58,894 tonnes and the surplus will go to stocks. April will kick off with 25,000 tonnes surplus in the 1.14 lakh tonnes-stocks with a demand of 89,785 tonnes for the month. As much as 20,000 tonnes from Kafco, 1.38 lakh tonnes from domestic industries and 20,000 tonnes through imports will go to stocks. bdnews24.co
