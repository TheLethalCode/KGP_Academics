<TITLE> Bucknor dumped as ICC bows to Indian demands </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor has been dropped for next week's third test between Australia and India, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed told a news conference that New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden would stand in the West Indian's place following widespread criticism of Bucknor's performance in last week's second test at Sydney. "Steve's presence was becoming an issue and he accepts that this is the best course," Speed told reporters. "He accepts that in the interests of the game and this test match, it was better that another umpire was substituted in for him. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) had demanded Bucknor be sacked after the 61-year-old made a series of blunders during the second test in Sydney. The most significant occurred on the first day when Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds was incorrectly given not out caught behind on 30 before going on to make 162 not out. The ICC does not normally allow member nations to interfere or oppose the appointment of umpires but Speed said the change had been made to alleviate some of the pressure from the escalating row and ensure the series proceeds. ILL FEELING "What we have seen over the last week is a lot of criticism of umpiring decisions and a lot of ill feeling," Speed added. "We could have taken a letter of the law approach and said we appoint the umpires and Steve Bucknor has been appointed for this match and he will stand. "But what we need to do is to alleviate some of the tension that is focused on this match. One way to do that was to bring in an umpiring team that gives us the opportunity to move on." Jamaican-born Bucknor is the most experienced umpire in international cricket history, having stood in a record 120 tests and five World Cup finals. Speed said he expected Bucknor would remain on the ICC's elite umpire panel. "He is coming to the end of his career, an illustrious career that has seen some high profile matches (but) what we are seeking to do is take some tension out of the situation.
