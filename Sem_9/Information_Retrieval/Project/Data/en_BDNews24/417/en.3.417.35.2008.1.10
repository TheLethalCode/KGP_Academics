 KARACHI, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson wants to bring in a sports psychologist for his players. "I have made some recommendations to the Pakistan Cricket Board and one of them is having a sports psychologist with the team," the Australian told reporters. Lawson came under fire from former players after Pakistan lost series to South Africa and India in the last few months. The PCB also told Lawson it expected him to get more out of the team. "I agree it is the job of the coach to make the team work," said Lawson after returning from holiday in Australia. "I am in charge but I need professional help as well to assist me. "We had a lot of positives in India despite the defeats and I'm looking forward to the coming series against Zimbabwe and Australia." Pakistan plays five one-day internationals against Zimbabwe from Jan. 21 and than host Australia for three tests, five one-dayers and a twenty20 match in March and April. But while the Zimbabwe team has confirmed its tour, Australia's visit is still uncertain because of security concerns and political unrest in Pakistan. "I have no problems with the security in Pakistan," said Lawson. "I tried to clear some misconceptions and play down some hype about the situation in Pakistan during informal talks with Cricket Australia." Lawson said he was confident Australia's tour would go ahead. "We certainly need to play against Australia," he said. "It will help the team a lot in their overall development and it should be a great series." He also called on team captains to show more responsibility and sense in the aftermath of the acrimonious Sydney test between India and Australia. "There is a lot of history between the two teams and it is not just about the Sydney test," he said. "A lot of things led to the problems. "But there is greater responsibility on the captains to control their players and avoid such situations.
