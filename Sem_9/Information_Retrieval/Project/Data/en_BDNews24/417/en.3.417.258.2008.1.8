<TITLE> Sarkozy vows to change French economic landscape </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Tuesday he was determined to shape France's economic landscape, regardless of the international environment, and expressed hopes that 2008 would see the demise of the iconic 35-hour work week. At a time when high oil prices and financial turmoil sparked by problems in the U.S. subprime market are casting clouds over the economic outlook, Sarkozy told a news conference the real brakes on French growth were homemade. "The international situation is less good than you could have hoped for. But if it wasn't this problem it would be another, and anyway, what can we do about it," he said. "What do we want to do, subprime crisis or not, a mediocre international climate or not? Liberate the forces of work in France. France's problem is known, we don't work enough while others work more... What's subprime got to do with that?" Sarkozy's economic strategy has been founded on a drive to encourage people to work more and while his poll ratings have fallen in recent weeks, he did not flinch from traditionally taboo subjects, such as scrapping the 35-hour work week. Asked whether he hoped 2008 would mark the end of a flagship measure introduced a decade ago when the opposition Socialists were in power, Sarkozy gave his clearest indication he wants to dismantle fully the work time limit: "To say what I think, yes." Plans are already in the pipeline to continue the piecemeal erosion of the 35-work week implemented by successive centre-right UMP governments, for example with a proposal to make some firms exempt from the limit in return for wage rises. ACTION ON ALL FRONTS The opposition Socialists criticised the two-hour news conference for being skimpy on concrete proposals to address the French public's prime concerns, such as purchasing power. But with recent polls showing voters' growing disenchantment with government action on such issues, Sarkozy was at pains to pre-empt such attacks. "Purchasing power is an expectation but that's not the only thing. Reducing political debate to the sole question of purchasing power is absurd," he said. Fielding a wide range of questions, including on whether he planned to marry former model Carla Bruni, African representation in international organisations, and the health service, Sarkozy sought to burnish his image as a man of action. Vowing to help French firms defend themselves from sovereign wealth funds and private speculators, he said state bank Caisse des Dpts would play a role in implementing the strategy. "There is no question of France not acting... France will make the political and strategic choice to protect its companies, to give them the means to defend themselves and to develop," Sarkozy said in comments that echoed the economic patriotism championed by the last centre-right UMP government. He also proposed scrapping advertising on public television channels and imposing a levy on the advertising revenue of private television channels to help fund the shortfall -- an idea which lifted shares of France's main commercial channels. The proposal comes at a time when an overhaul of French broadcasting rules is already planned to allow the emergence of bigger domestic media groups that could compete with global telecoms and Internet giants. Sarkozy also showed he had no qualms about changing the rules if they did not suit, unveiling plans to ask a high-level committee of experts headed by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz to look into a new way of measuring growth. "If we want to favour another type of growth, we must change our instrument for measuring growth," he said.
