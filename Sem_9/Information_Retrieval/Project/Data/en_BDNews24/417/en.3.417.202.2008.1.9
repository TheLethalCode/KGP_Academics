 Moscow, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One woman died and up to 15 more are feared missing after a suspected gas explosion in an apartment building in the Russian city of Kazan on Wednesday, local emergencies services said. The body of one woman in her fifties was discovered in the rubble following the partial collapse of the building and two more people were taken to hospital, but emergency services fear many more could have been killed. "There could be 12-15 people under the collapsed building because this was the number of people in the building at the time," said an emergency services spokeswoman in the city, around 800km (500 miles) east of Moscow.
