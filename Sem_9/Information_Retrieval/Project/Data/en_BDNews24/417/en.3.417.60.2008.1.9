<TITLE> Japan stocks up on bargain-hunting, US tax report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei rode a wave of bargain-hunting to its second positive close in a row on Wednesday after earlier hitting an 18-month low, helped by a report the US government is considering new economic steps. A wide range of investors emerged to snap up bargains in defensive shares, with drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc and similar companies posting hefty gains along with construction firms and convenience stores. The Wall Street Journal reported that the administration of US President George W Bush is considering tax rebates of about $500 for households and tax breaks for businesses to help the economy avoid a recession. In a volatile day, the Nikkei tumbled 1.7 percent shortly after the opening to 14,271.67, its lowest since June 2006 and marking a loss of more than 1,000 points during 2008 trade alone, depressed by growing fears that the United States was heading for an economic slowdown. But some market participants said there were growing expectations of U.S. measures to address the problem. "It's now becoming much more clear that the situation in the United States isn't good, and this is raising expectations of new policies -- an earlier-than-predicted Federal Reserve rate cut, say, or even more sweeping measures," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities. "Investors are stepping out to test the waters and scoop up bargains. But this isn't really a rise, it's merely that the market's stopped falling and prices seem good." The market gained some impetus from the Wall Street Journal report, though players said its impact was limited as the news had still only filtered through to a small fraction of investors. "Basically, the market had just fallen to a place where the buying was good, with yesterday's rises showing that gains were possible and reassuring investors," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. The dollar surged against the yen rising to around 109.50 by midafternoon with help from the tax cut report and boosting exporters in turn. Defensive buying led the market for much of the day, but commodities-linked firms began to rise on record-high gold prices and a rebound in oil, while other companies rose on individual factors such as a ratings upgrade for construction firms and good earnings reports for convenience stores. The benchmark Nikkei gained 70.49 points or 0.49 percent to 14,599.16, its second positive close in two days, after ranging nearly 400 points during the session. The broader TOPIX was even stronger, jumping 1.51 percent to 1,424.29. Despite this, the Nikkei has still lost 20 percent over the last six months -- 4.6 percent of that in the first four trading days of 2008. CONSTRUCTION FIRM, PHARMACEUTICALS HIGH Obayashi Corp and other construction firms surged after Morgan Stanley raised its industry investment rating on Tuesday to "attractive" from "in-line", saying construction prices were rising more than costs. It raised ratings for Obayashi and Shimizu Corp to "overweight" from "equal weight", putting three of the top four firms in the category. Obayashi climbed 6.4 percent to 615 yen and Shimizu advanced 6.9 percent to 530 yen. Kajima Corp, which retained its "overweight" rating, still managed to climb 3.9 percent to 378 yen. The pharmaceutical sector continued to gain, as it has for the past few days, and played a leading role in leading the market higher. Astellas Pharma Inc climbed 3.5 percent to 4,690 yen, with Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd and Eisai Co Ltd also helping to buoy the market. Astellas Pharma climbed 3.5 percent to 4,690 yen, Daiichi Sankyo rose 3.6 percent to 3,500 yen, and Eisai was up 3 percent at 4,410 yen. Japan's major convenience store chains Lawson Inc and FamilyMart Co Ltd jumped on Wednesday after they reported solid profit growth for the nine months to November, with Lawson up 5.9 percent at 3,930 yen and FamilyMart up 5.2 percent at 3,460 yen. Itochu Corp surged by 4 percent to 1,095, buoyed by high commodity prices, gains mimicked by other trading houses. Oil developer INPEX holdings rose 5 percent to 1.26 million yen Trade was active, with 2.24 billion shares changing hands on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared with an average 1.39 billion for the final week of December.
