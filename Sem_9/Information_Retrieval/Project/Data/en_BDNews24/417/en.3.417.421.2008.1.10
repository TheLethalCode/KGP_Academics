 COLOMBO, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels vowed on Thursday to fight a full-scale civil war if the government wages one after scrapping the remains of a tattered ceasefire, and called on Norway to stay on as mediator. In their first reaction since President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government announced a week ago it was formally scrapping a 6-year truce that degenerated into renewed war two years ago, the Tigers said they would mount large scale counter-offensives if the armed forces try to capture their de facto state. "If full-scale war is thrust upon us, we will face it and the Sri Lankan armed forces will face the same fate that they have faced in 1997/1998," S. Puleedevan, head of the Tigers' peace secretariat, told Reuters by telephone from the northern rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi, referring to the bloodiest stage of a 25-year war. He said the Tigers' new political wing leader, B. Nadesan, appointed after the government killed his predecessor with an air raid in November, had written to Norway's Foreign Minister requesting they continue as mediator. "We are shocked and disappointed that the government of Sri Lanka has unilaterally abrogated the ceasefire," he added. "We are calling on Norway to remain as facilitator, and have told the SLMM (Nordic truce monitors) we are ready to implement all the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, line by line." The Tigers have been blamed for a raft of ambushes, bombings and assassinations in recent months, and Nordic truce monitors say the Tigers have violated the terms of the ceasefire thousands of times. Asked if his statement on the truce meant the Tigers would no longer violate the ceasefire terms, he said: "We are not saying that. What we are saying is we tried our best to implement (the truce)." "The Sri Lankan government, the defence secretary, the President ... these people are all beating the war drums and saying we will go for a full-scale war, so that's why we've informed the international community: Please understand the mindset." The government, which has also been blamed for a raft of ceasefire violations, has vowed to wipe out the Tigers militarily, setting the stage for what many fear will be a bloody battle for the north as a death toll of around 70,000 people since the war erupted in 1983 climbs daily. The military has evicted the Tigers from vast swathes of territory the rebels held in the east, and now seeks to make inroads into their northern stronghold. The government's move to annul the ceasefire has shocked the international community and is seen ruining any hope of resurrecting peace talks any time so
