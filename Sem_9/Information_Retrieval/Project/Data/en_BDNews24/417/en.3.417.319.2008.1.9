 ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan angrily rejected on Thursday remarks by the UN nuclear watchdog chief that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of Islamist militants. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), expressed his fears about Pakistan's nuclear weapons in an interview with the pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat. His comments were widely reported in Pakistani newspapers on Wednesday and follow similar concerns raised by some US nuclear experts and politicians as militant violence and political turmoil rock the government of President Pervez Musharraf. But the Foreign Ministry dismissed ElBaradei's remarks as "unwarranted and irresponsible". "Pakistan rejects the statement by Dr ElBaradei," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told a regular news briefing. "As head of the IAEA, which is a UN body, he has to be careful about his statements which ought to remain within the parameters of his mandate." Pakistan is a key ally in the US-led campaign against global terrorism but deteriorating security in the country, particularly after last month's assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, has raised international concern about the safety of its nuclear weapons. Some security experts fear that nuclear materials could fall into the hands of Islamist militants if the country descended into chaos. ElBaradei echoed that concern. "I fear that chaos ... or an extremist regime could take root in that country which has 30 to 40 warheads," he was quoted as saying in the interview. "PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN" Sadiq said a section of the international media was waging a propaganda campaign against Pakistan, adding that fears about the safety of its nuclear weapons was misplaced. "Pakistan is a responsible nuclear weapon state. Our nuclear weapons are as secure as that of any other nuclear weapon state," he said. Despite the concerns raised by nuclear experts, especially since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, Washington believes Pakistan's arsenal remains secure. US military and defence officials say the weapons are safely under Pakistani military control. Sadiq said a three-member US Congressional delegation visiting Pakistan this week had met officials of the military-led Strategic Plans Division, which has oversight for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. He gave no details. The security of Pakistan's nuclear programme, begun in the early 1970s, has been of international concern since the 1990s when suspicions emerged that A.Q. Khan, the head of the programme, was trading nuclear know-how. Khan confessed on national television in 2004, admitting that Iran and Libya had been among his clients. The next day he was pardoned by Musharraf. Despite the proliferation breach, the United States imposed no sanctions. Pakistan has emerged as a hot topic in the United States as politicians compete in their parties' primaries in the run-up to the November presidential election. Sadiq said Pakistan would maintain its important ties with the United States no matter which party came to power. "The government of Pakistan would deal with any government which comes into power, any administration which comes into power in Washington," he said. "The Pakistan-US relationship is a very important relationship. It's not only important for the United States or for Pakistan but it's also important for the peace and stability of the whole region."
