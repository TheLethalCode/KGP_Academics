 JAKARTA, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The condition of ailing former Indonesian President Suharto, who ruled with an iron fist for more than three decades, is still unstable with excess fluid in his lungs, a member of his medical team said on Thursday. Suharto, 86, was admitted to Jakarta's Pertamina Hospital last week suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems, and his condition has fluctuated since then.

The sudden deterioration in his health over the weekend prompted some senior politicians and one of Suharto's daughters to call for legal proceedings against him to be dropped. But the attorney-general said on Monday his office would press ahead with a civil case against Suharto.
