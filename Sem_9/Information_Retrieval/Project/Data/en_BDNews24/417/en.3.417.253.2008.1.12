<TEXT>
 Tehran, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the UN nuclear watchdog meets Iranian leaders on Saturday to push for swifter cooperation in resolving questions about the Islamic Republic's atomic activity, which the West fears will be used to make bombs. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei will, for the first time, meet Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on nuclear policy. A senior Iranian official said on Friday, after talks with ElBaradei, that the meeting with Khamenei would involve an "important exchange of information". He did not elaborate and no time has been has been announced for the meeting. ElBaradei will also meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili on Saturday. His two-day trip to Tehran, which began on Friday, coincides with renewed tension between Iran and the United States over a naval incident in the oil-rich Gulf last Sunday. Washington is seeking to isolate Iran over atomic activities it suspects have military aims. Iran says it only wants to generate electricity and has refused to heed demands to halt sensitive nuclear work despite two rounds of U.N. sanctions. ElBaradei, seeking to help defuse the stalemate, urged Tehran to boost cooperation with his agency in talks with Iran's atomic energy chief Gholamreza Aghazadeh on Friday. "I asked Mr Aghazadeh to give us maximum transparency and provide assurances about all present nuclear activities," ElBaradei told reporters. The Vienna-based IAEA has long sought to verify that Iran's uranium enrichment programme is geared solely to producing civilian energy, not atomic bombs as Western powers suspect. A diplomat close to the IAEA said before ElBaradei's visit that an IAEA inquiry stonewalled by Iran for years until August had entered a final phase with Iran addressing U.S. intelligence about past, covert attempts to "weaponise" atomic material. Iran said in August it would answer outstanding questions about its nuclear past but an end-of-year target for completing the process passed with the sensitive issues still unresolved. ElBaradei's visit coincides with a Middle East tour by U.S. President George W. Bush, who has called Iran a "threat to world peace" and is seeking Arab support to rein in Iran. In Washington on Friday, the top U.S. military officer said last Sunday's tense encounter between U.S. Navy ships and Iranian boats in the Gulf showed Iran poses a threat and that the United States was ready to counter it.
