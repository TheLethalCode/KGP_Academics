<TITLE> India aims to conclude IAEA pact talks this month </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Friday it hoped to wrap up talks this month with the UN nuclear watchdog for a safeguards pact needed to advance a controversial civilian nuclear energy deal with the United States. The deal has been virtually written off by analysts following opposition from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's communist allies, who have threatened to end their support and force early elections if the government pursued it. Government ministers and bureaucrats, however, say they have not given up on it and are trying to convince the communists while going through the steps needed to clinch the deal, even as it is running out of time. Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon said Indian experts had held three rounds of talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a pact to monitor civilian nuclear reactors that would be opened to scrutiny under the deal. "We hope to have another round in the middle of January in Vienna where we hope to wrap it up," he told a news conference. "The discussions are proceeding smoothly and they will continue, we hope, to a rapid and satisfactory conclusion." The deal aims to give India access to U.S. nuclear fuel and equipment for the first time in more than 30 years even though New Delhi has tested nuclear weapons and refused to join non-proliferation agreements. It has been hailed by both governments as a symbol of their growing friendship, but Indian communists oppose it, saying it draws New Delhi into Washington's strategic embrace and compromises India's sovereignty. The deal must also get clearance from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), whose members work to prevent nuclear exports for peaceful purposes from being used to make atomic weapons. After those steps, it must be finally approved by the US Congress, considered a tall order in a U.S. election year, and even more uncertain under a new U.S. administration afterwards. Menon said the Indian prime minister would seek old rival China's support for New Delhi's nuclear energy ambitions during a visit to Beijing next week. China, an NSG member, was initially seen to be uncomfortable with the deal as it signalled an apparent alliance between the United States and India to counter Beijing's growing might. It has, however, gradually mellowed and indicated it will not oppose the deal, as it does not want to be seen as the biggest hurdle to the deal and hurt relations with India, analysts say. "We have raised the subject with China during previous visits. We will certainly raise the subject again," Menon said. "We have been in touch with them in between as well, and we have explained to them what we see as the potential and the importance of civilian nuclear cooperation between us and the rest of the world."
