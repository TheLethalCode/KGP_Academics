 ISTANBUL, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish police have detained an eighth person suspected of involvement in a blast in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey last week which claimed six lives, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday. Turkey's Interior Minister Besir Atalay said on Tuesday seven people had been detained over the incident, which authorities have blamed on PKK Kurdish militants. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has signalled that group members working independently may have been behind the bombing, which security sources said targeted military personnel though most of those killed were school students. The agency had said that the first suspect detained in the blast told police he had received training in PKK camps in northern Iraq. Police detained several people last week but they were later released. The Turkish military, the second largest in NATO, has been waging an aerial bombing campaign against PKK targets in northern Iraq after the United States began sharing intelligence on the rebels' movements. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since 1984 when it took up arms to fight for an ethnic homeland in southeastern Turkey. The United States and European Union, like Turkey, classify the PKK as a terrorist organisation.
