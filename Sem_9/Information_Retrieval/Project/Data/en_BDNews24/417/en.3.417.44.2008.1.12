 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka Stock Exchange saw fewer investors last week ahead of the Jamuna's debut on the capital market. Trading was dominated mostly by banks, along with power companies, pharmaceuticals, mutual funds, life insurers and Jamuna Oil. Retail investors sold off holdings to keep cash ready to buy into the state-owned oil company Jamuna, leading to lower transactions and a decline in the indices. On the third day of trading, however, indices closed slightly higher and the market began to heat up from Jan 9 as Jamuna began trading on the spot market. The week recorded a 10.44 percent increase in turnover at Tk 5.45 billion from Tk 4.93 billion a week ago. Market capitalisation on the country's prime bourse on Jan 6 was Tk 754.39 billion, rising to Tk 789.15 billion on Jan 10. The benchmark DGEN or general index was at 2979.49 on the first day of the week and rose 13.67 points or 0.46 percent on the last day to 2993.16. The DSI or all share price index closed at 2508.13 on the first day and surged 0.58 percent or 14.61 points on the last day to 2522.74. IFIC Bank, AB Bank, UCBL, Square Pharma and Summit Power ruled as the top five companies by turnover. The week's major events included the much-awaited launch of Jamuna on Wednesday, which perked up the bourses. Jamuna Oil with a book value of only Tk 10 shot up to Tk 952, the day's highest rise on the DSE, and closed at Tk 600. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, Jamuna started trading at Tk 591 and surged as high at Tk 780.10 before closing at Tk 601.30. A total of 158,200 shares of the oil company were sold on the DSE while 16,400 were sold on the CSE. The government is aiming to raise Tk 135 million by selling a 30 percent stake in the company. It raised Tk 116 million on the first day of trade by selling just only 3.88 percent of the company. Market analysts termed the price unusually high and cited this as the reason for institutional investors remaining on the sidelines. "Retail investors just went mad, they brought (Jamuna shares) at irrational prices that don't match Jamuna's brass tacks, " said Yaweer Sayeed, managing director and chief executive officer of AIMS of Bangladesh. On its second day on the market (Thursday), only 7,600 shares were sold on both stock exchanges. Selling agent ICB Securities Trading Company sold only a handful of the more than 1,175,000 shares in spite of bids from retail investors. Unwilling to place bids at the price level, institutional investors were absent from the market on the second day of Jamuna's trading. Its shares fell below Tk 550 on Thursday. Opening at Tk 551, the price dropped as low as Tk 528 before closing at Tk 529 on the DSE. On the CSE, starting at Tk 601.30, the price came down to as low as Tk 530 before closing at Tk 532.60. Selling of Jamuna shares will be suspended Sunday (Jan 13) and normal trading will start again Monday (Jan 14). Jamuna is the third government entity to be listed with the bourses under the direct listing regulations, after Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh offloaded their shares in 2006. State-run Meghna Petroleum will also make its debut on the market through spot transactions on Jan 14. Meghna will release 1,200,000 shares worth Tk 120 million. bdne
