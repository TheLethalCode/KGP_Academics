<TITLE> Wild elephant kills one in Lalmonirhat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A wild elephant straying into a village in Lalmonirhat district trampled a man to death and injured at least 15 people on Friday, police and forest officials said. The incident occurred about 350 km (215 miles) north of Dhaka near the Indian border. "The elephant apparently broke from its herd and lost its way and entered the village from the nearby Indian forest," a Lalmonirhat police official said. Elephants, an endangered species in Bangladesh, kill 15 people on average countrywide annually. In recent years their forest habitats have shrunk due to encroachment by the rising population. One of the world's most densely populated nations, Bangladesh has forest cover of only 17.5 percent. There are around 400 elephants in the country -- including 100 in captivity.
