 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court Wednesday ordered attachment of all movable and immovable property of Globe Janakantha Industrial Group in an income tax dodge case. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque issued the order at 5pm Wednesday. The judge ordered attachment of the movable and immovable property of the Group and Globe Construction managing director Atiqullah Khan Masud's wife, their two sons, and chartered accountants of the two groups in connection with two separate cases filed by the National Board of Revenue on Jan 6. The same judge on Jan 6 issued arrest warrants against all the accused. But the police after failing to arrest them submitted the report to the court Wednesday. In the report, Kafrul police sub-inspector Abdul Hakim said police had gone to the 74 Cantonment Bazar Road home of Atiqullah Khan Masud under Kafrul Police Station but did not find Atiqullah Khan Masud's wife Shamima A Khan, their two sons Mishal Atiqullah Khan and Jishal Atiqullah Khan. They do not live there and have gone into hiding, police said.
