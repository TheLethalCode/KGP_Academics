<TITLE> Ousted Thai PM`s wife returns home to fight charges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The wife of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand after months of exile on Tuesday, a trip her spokesman said was meant to pay respect to the king's late sister and to fight her corruption cases. Immigration police arrested Potjaman as she landed at Bangkok airport but she was released later on bail. Thai insiders said her return from Hong Kong was aimed at appeasing Thaksin's foes to pave the way for a coalition government led by People Power Party (PPP), which backs Thaksin while he remains in exile. "Without clearance from those supra-constitutional forces, the PPP-led coalition government won't last long," a PPP adviser said, referring to elements in the military and the royalist establishment. The party's firebrand leader, Samak Sundaravej, has accused a "dirty invisible hand" of meddling in the post-election process, widely interpreted as a reference to chief royal adviser Prem Tinsulanonda, who Thaksin supporters say organised the 2006 coup. After landing at Bangkok's international airport, Potjaman was arrested by immigration police on charges of false stock disclosure and official misconduct. She was taken to the Supreme Court for a bail hearing where she was freed on a five-million-baht ($150,000) bond ahead of a Jan. 23 start to her trial and told she would have to get court permission to travel overseas. "It is the best time for Khunying Potjaman to return to fight her cases since the country has returned to normal," family lawyer Noppadon Pattama told reporters, 15 months after the military ousted her husband in the bloodless putsch. Potjaman planned to attend the funerary rites of Princess Galyani Vadhana, who died last week, Noppadon said, and reunite with her son and two daughters. After his ouster, Thaksin was investigated by military-appointed graftbusters for presiding over alleged rampant corruption during his five-year government, but he and his family have faced few formal charges. The Asset Examination Committee probing the couple's involvement in a Bangkok land deal has accused them of violating anti-graft laws that prevent serving politicians from doing business deals with state agencies. If convicted, Potjaman and Thaksin, a telecommunications billionaire whose lawyer says he may return to fight the charges in April, could face up to 10 years in jail. After receiving bail, Potjaman reported to the Department of Special Investigation, which has accused the couple of conspiring to conceal holdings in the family's listed property firm. Noppadon said she would seek bail in that case. Potjaman returned weeks after Thailand's Dec. 23 general election in which the PPP came within a whisker of winning an outright majority. The PPP is negotiating with five smaller parties to form a coalition government, but it faces a high number of fraud complaints against its winning candidates as well as court cases seeking to disband the party.
