 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim Wednesday said that there was no need for apprehension about elections following the resignation of the four advisers. "The elections will be held in line with the scheduled roadmap," he told reporters at his office. "We will continue our work in the same way even after the resignations." "Our task is to handover power to the elected representatives. We will carry out our jobs accordingly." In the reply to a question CS Karim said: "If the posts were to be vacant for long, there would be the possibility of a pause in the process." "But the posts will be filled immediately," he added. Asked whether the stepping down of the two advisers who were in charge of power and industry would interrupt production in the coming boro season, the agriculture adviser said: "The ministry has addressed the matter." "Those who will come to theses posts will assist in these sectors," he added. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters at his ministry Wednesday that there might be a brief hiatus due to the resignation of four advisers but work will go on. "Work never stops for anybody," he said. "A team spirit will again be built up, though there has to be a little pause due to the resignations." "But the incident of the resignations will have no impact on the next election," Anwarul stressed. The local government adviser added: "Those who come now will need a little grooming. I hope a cohesive team will emerge in a short time. This team would carry forward the government's work." bdnews24.com/ahd/ehb
