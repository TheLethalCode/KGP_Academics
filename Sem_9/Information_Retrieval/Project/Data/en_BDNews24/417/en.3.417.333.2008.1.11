<TEXT>
 London, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell early on Friday to hit their lowest level in nearly five months as broker downgrades hurt Unilever and L'Oreal, while fears of more US subprime losses also weighed on sentiment. Unilever was the biggest percentage loser on the pan-European index, down 6.3 percent after Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation to "underweight" from "equal-weight". Within the food producers sector, Nestle shed 2.3 percent and Cadbury Schweppes dipped 1.4 percent. By 0931 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,430.91 points, after losing more than 2 percent in past two sessions. A Credit Suisse sectoral downgrade also weighed on semiconductors, with Infineon losing 4 percent, ASML down 3.4 percent and STMicroelectronics falling 2.5 percent. French cosmetics group l'Oreal shed 4.6 percent after dealers said Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating to "sell" from "hold". The dollar dipped against the yen as renewed worries about U.S. financial institutions' losses from credit market turmoil eroded investors' risk appetite. A newspaper report said Merrill Lynch may post larger-than-expected subprime losses, and Swiss bank UBS said in a letter to shareholders that it could not predict the full impact of the mortgage crisis. UBS advanced 0.9 percent, but HSBC slipped 1.4 percent and Deutsche Bank was down 0.1 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also said the Fed was ready to take substantial additional action to boost the economy, though the central bank was not forecasting a recession. "There is an increasing concern that if you cut rates, it's like pushing on a piece of string. It may not have any effect," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. "There is a greater concern that politicians will again buy their way out of it ... The market will be looking at more concern over greater risk coming out of the States, particularly the banking sector." French engineering group Alstom was the top percentage gainer after Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating to "neutral" from "sell". The stock was up 3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 percent, France's CAC-40 eased 0.2 percent but Germany's DAX gained 0.1 percent.
