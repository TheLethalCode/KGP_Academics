<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chris Rogers boosted his chances of a call-up to the Australia test team with a half-century against India on Friday. Rogers, who is the leading candidate to replace Matthew Hayden if the opener fails to recover from a hamstring problem, made 60 for the ACT Invitational XI at Canberra's Manuka Oval. University student John Rogers top-scored with 98 as the ACT team reached stumps on day two on 292 for eight in reply to India's 325-9. Paceman Ishant Sharma was the pick of the Indian bowlers, capturing three wickets, while Rudra Padra Singh grabbed two. With only one day to go, the match is heading for a draw with the tourists likely to spend the last day looking for some batting practice ahead of next week's third test in Perth. Rogers said he expected the Australian selectors would give Hayden until the last-minute to prove his fitness but he felt he was ready to make his debut if called upon. "I just have to wait and see what happens and if Matty's not fit, what the selectors go for," he said. "I've been waiting for this moment for a while ... I feel pretty good and I feel ready to step up and make my debut." Rogers said he was impressed by Sharma and expected the paceman to be a handful on the bouncy WACA pitch. "If you are tall and you can bowl pretty quick then it's always a good place to bowl," Rogers said. "I'm sure he'll enjoy the experience if he gets a go. Looking at how he bowled today I'd say he's a pretty good chance." Hayden, speaking to reporters in Brisbane, said he was confident of playing but Rogers would make a good replacement. "We well and truly have our foot on their throat and we are looking at going in and playing well," he said
