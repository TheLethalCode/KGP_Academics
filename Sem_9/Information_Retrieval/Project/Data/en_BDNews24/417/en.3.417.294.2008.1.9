<TITLE> BA to launch first US "open skies" flight in June </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Airways said on Wednesday it plans to fly new routes between mainland Europe and the United States from June, taking advantage of a new transatlantic liberalisation pact. The launch is the first salvo in a renewed battle for business travellers, which has seen fierce competition in recent years with business-class-only carriers entering the fray. BA said it will start with one Boeing 757 aircraft flying daily between New York and either Brussels or Paris Charles de Gaulle airports, with a second starting flights to the other destination later in the year. "It signals our determination to lobby for further liberalisation in this market when talks between the EU and US take place later this year," Chief Executive Willie Walsh said. The move follows the Open Skies agreement last March, which will allow European Union airlines to fly from any city in the 27-nation bloc to any city in the United States and vice versa, replacing restrictive bilateral arrangements that date back to World War Two. But European airlines have complained the deal unfairly favours US rivals, and EU states have agreed to scrap the deal if Washington does not agree by 2010 to a second phase allowing foreign airlines to buy more voting rights in U.S. carriers and permitting them to run domestic US services. BA plans to put six of its 757s onto routes between the US and mainland Europe by the end of 2009. The aircraft will carry up to 82 passengers: 24 on business class seats that convert into flat beds, 28 in premium economy and 30 in economy. Competition is fierce on transatlantic routes, forcing all-business-class airline MAXJet Airways to file for bankruptcy protection over Christmas.
