 ABAI, Kazakhstan, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion killed at least seven coal miners on Friday and left another 23 missing in a Kazakh mine owned by the world's largest steel maker, Arcelor Mittal. Rescue workers battled an underground fire at the Abaiskaya mine in central Kazakhstan as they searched for the missing miners, government and emergency officials at the site said. At least 12 other workers were injured in the explosion, which struck at around 9:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) when 190 miners were working below ground. Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Arcelor Mittal, said an investigation had been launched. "We are doing everything we can to locate those still missing and to assist the bereaved," he said in a statement. An explosion at another mine owned by Arcelor Mittal in the same region, the Lenin mine, killed 43 workers in 2006. Two earlier blasts, in 2002 and 2004, killed more than 30 miners. Coal mining accidents occur frequently in the former Soviet Union, where safety practices are often less strictly observed than in Western mines. Explosions in coal mines are most often the result of a build-up of methane gas, although emergency officials did not confirm the cause of Friday's blast. Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Umirzak Shukeyev, visiting the site of the accident, told reporters rescue work would continue all night and that the fire had not yet been extinguished. The Kazakh government said it has formed a commission to investigate the accident. Prime Minister Karim Masimov had visited another Arcelor Mittal coal mine a day earlier. Arcelor Mittal operates several coal mines around the city of Karaganda. Many supply the company's steel plant in nearby Temirtau, which was among the Soviet Union's largest steel mills and is now the Central Asian country's only steel producer. The company said it had invested in improving safety at its Kazakh coal mines. "The safety of our workers is our number one priority and there has been a significant capital expenditure, change in operating practices and a change in management to improve health and safety at our mines in Kazakhstan," Mittal said. He also told reporters last month the company planned to invest $400-$500 million to raise coal output in Kazakhstan. A Temirtau-based company spokesman said Friday's accident would not affect steel output at the mill. "I don't think this will affect the overall output. We have a solid stock (of coal)," the spokesman said. Arcelor Mittal's Amsterdam-traded shares declined 1.7 percent by 1350 GMT to 44.53 euros.
