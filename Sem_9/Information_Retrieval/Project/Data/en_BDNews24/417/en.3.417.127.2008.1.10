 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested four people Thursday with suspected links to the BRAC Bank locker robbery and seized 200 Bhori (2 kgs and 332 grams) of gold ornaments in Dhaka and Munshiganj. The Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police raided several areas on a tip-off by phone and recovered 141 Bhori gold ornaments, 13 Bhori silver and three diamond rings, a piece of diamond and Tk 3 lakh in cash. DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed told reporters at a press briefing that three of the arrestees were of a family. The arrestees are Raja Mia, Majnu, Moyna and Muhit. Majnu and Moyna were siblings and Raja Mia was their brother-in-law, Naim added. He said one of them was arrested in Dhaka and two others from Munshiganj. Muhit was arrested from Mirpur with one kg of gold, he added. The commissioner said the arrestees admitted that the gold and the other valuables were looted from the lockers at BRAC Bank's Dhanmondi branch in Shukrabad in the city. Deputy police commissioner Alamgir Kabir, who joined the operations, told bdnews24.com that Raja Mia and Moyna were arrested from Laskarpur village under Sreenagar Police Station in Munshiganj. Detectives arrested Majnu in Jatrabari in the city. The gold and diamonds were seized from Munshiganj. Detectives seized fake keys and key-mating tools, screw driver, SIM cards and four phone sets from Majnu's rented home in Jatrabari. A DB officer who took part in the operation told bdnews24.com on the condition of anonymity that DB started investigation into the BRAC bank robbery along with local police. They first got two mobile phone numbers used by the arrestees to communicate while staying at Hotel Nid Mahal. He said the recovered ornaments were part of the total valuables looted from the bank. The total property was divided into 18 portions. He said Raja Mia was one of the ringleaders, but there were many other ringleaders. The arrestees sold out some ornaments from the booty. Kabir, the deputy commissioner, said police made the arrest only after they were sure about their links to the incident. The detainees do not have any other business but own a luxurious two-storey building in Munshiganj. The home interiors in the house were expensive, he added. He hoped the ringleaders would be arrested soon. bdnews24
