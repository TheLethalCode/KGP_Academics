<TITLE> Noriega loses new round in extradition fight </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega lost another round on Wednesday in his battle against extradition to face money laundering charges in France. Lawyers for the 73-year-old Noriega have sought to block his extradition on grounds the French government would not respect a ruling from his 1992 US drug trafficking trial giving him "prisoner of war" status and special protections under the Geneva Conventions. But US District Court Judge Paul Huck ruled that Noriega would still be awarded the benefits of POW status after his extradition, which was approved by a federal court in Miami last August.
