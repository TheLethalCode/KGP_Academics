 MUMBAI, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's cricket board has withdrawn its threat to pull out of the current Australian tour if a ban on Harbhajan Singh was not overturned by the International Cricket Council. "There is no question of the tour being called off," board spokesman Rajiv Shukla quoted president Sharad Pawar as saying on Saturday. "He (Pawar) said the two boards intend to maintain good relations as there is no problem with the two," Shukla said. Harbhajan was banned for three tests after being found guilty of making a racist remark to Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during last week's controversial second test in Sydney. However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and its players have denied any racist remark was made by Harbhajan, with the board threatening to pull out unless the player was exonerated on appeal. The ICC has appointed New Zealand High Court judge John Hansen as appeals commissioner but has yet to set a date for the hearing. Pawar has said the Indian board would like the appeal to be heard before the one-day series in Australia starts on Feb. 3. India is to play in a triangular series in Australia, also involving Sri Lanka, next month after the conclusion of the four-test series
