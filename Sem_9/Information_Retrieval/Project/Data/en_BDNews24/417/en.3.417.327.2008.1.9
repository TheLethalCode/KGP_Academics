<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian markets bounced back from earlier three-week lows on Wednesday on a media report the United States is considering tax rebates, easing recession concerns in Asia's top export market. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that the US government was looking at options such as a $500 tax rebate for households and tax breaks for business. The dollar rose against the yen but uncertainty about the global economy remained, with oil prices extending gains in Asia. Safe-haven gold hit a record high. European stocks were expected to open sharply lower, according to financial bookmakers, with Britain's FTSE 100 seen down 66-67 points and Germany's DAX 66-78 points lower. "It's now becoming much more clear that the situation in the United States isn't good, and this is raising expectations of new policies," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities. MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up 0.6 percent at 0710 GMT, after earlier touching its lowest since Dec. 21. The index began the day with steep losses after AT&T Inc warned of soft U.S. consumer spending, heightening U.S. recession fears. Perceptions that some shares, such as South Korean chip maker Hynix Semiconductor Inc, were oversold also helped markets recover. The MSCI index has dropped 2.2 percent so far this year, on reports the U.S. may be heading for a sharper-than-expected slowdown at a time when investors are already concerned about the condition of global credit markets. Data last week showed Singapore's export-driven economy shrank for the first time since 2003 in the fourth quarter. Japan's benchmark Nikkei bounced back from an 18-month low to end up 0.5 percent as exporters rallied on the dollar's gains that help boost the value of their overseas earnings. South Korea gained 1 percent after earlier hitting a six-week low, while Hong Kong also rose 1 percent. But financials, including South Korea's Kookmin Bank, retreated as bankruptcy rumours at U.S. lender Countrywide Financial, later denied, sparked fears of a wider fallout from the U.S. subprime crisis. SAFETY STILL SELLS Spot gold sprinted to a record $891 an ounce in Asian trade, topping the previous high set overnight. "Gold is bullish. Funds are pouring into markets as they are performing well when stocks are slumping," said Tatsuo Kageyama, an analyst at Kanetsu Asset Management. "The speed of gold's rise is very fast, but the market is focusing on taking gold towards $900 in the near term." Other safe-haven bids also did well, with Japanese government bond futures hitting a one-month high. Oil prices extended their gains in Asia, after rising $1 overnight on the threatened disruption of Nigeria's oil supply and lower US crude stocks. US crude futures rose to $96.77, while London Brent Crude traded up at $95.85. The dollar was at 109.63 yen pulling away from a six-week low of 107.90 yen hit last Friday. Traders in Tokyo said the dollar was also supported by corporate demand and buying from Japanese institutional investo
