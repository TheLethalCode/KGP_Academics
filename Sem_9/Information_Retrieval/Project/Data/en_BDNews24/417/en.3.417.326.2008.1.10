 NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - US stocks were higher in the later part of a tug-of-war session on Wednesday, as investors piled into sectors seen as resistant to economic contraction, such as health care and staples, amid talk of recession. Goldman Sachs was the latest to sound the recession alarm. The investment bank said US real gross domestic product would contract by 1 percent on an annualized basis in the second and third quarters. Defensive issues on the rise included drug maker Merck & Co, up 2 percent to $60.77, and the world's No. 1 soft drink maker, Coca-Cola Co, which rose 2.4 percent to $65.15. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 105.75 points, or 0.84 percent, at 12,694.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 13.73 points, or 0.99 percent, at 1,403.92. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 21.20 points, or 0.87 percent, at 2,461.7
