 JAKARTA, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's former President Suharto, who has been critically ill in hospital for more than a week, is conscious but remains on a ventilator, doctors said on Saturday. The 86-year-old Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for more than three decades, suffered multiple organ failure on Friday, but by Saturday morning doctors said his condition had improved and that he was showing a response. Indonesia's Attorney-General, who visited the ailing Suharto and his family in hospital overnight, told reporters that the government would still seek an out-of-court settlement in a graft case against the former general. After he quit office, Suharto was charged with embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars of state funds, but the government later dropped the case due to his poor health. Last year, state prosecutors filed a civil suit seeking a total of $440 million of state funds and a further $1 billion in damages for the alleged misuse of money held by one of Suharto's charitable foundations. "The President gave instructions to me to pursue the family of Suharto to finalise an out-of-court settlement of the civil case," Attorney-General Hendarman Supandji told reporters at the hospital, adding that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had issued the request during his official visit to Malaysia. Suharto and his family deny any wrongdoing. The sudden deterioration in Suharto's health last weekend prompted some senior politicians to call for legal proceedings against him to be dropped. But the attorney-general said his office would press ahead with a civil case. Suharto was rushed to Pertamina hospital a week ago suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems. His health worsened on Friday as doctors said he appeared to have a lung infection. Suharto came to power after an abortive coup on Sept. 30, 1965 that was officially blamed on the communist party. Up to 500,000 people were killed in an anti-communist purge in the months that followed. Some Indonesians, though, look back with nostalgia to the Suharto era, when Indonesia was one of Asia's tiger economies, and refer to him fondly as the "Father of Developmen
