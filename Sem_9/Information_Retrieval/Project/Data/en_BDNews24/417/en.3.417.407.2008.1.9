 Niamey, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The director of a private radio station in Niger was killed when his vehicle ran over a landmine in Niamey, the first such attack in the capital since the start of a Tuareg-led rebellion almost a year ago. Dozens of military police and mine clearing experts surrounded the charred wreckage of the Toyota car in which Abdou Mahaman Jeannot was killed after his vehicle drove over the mine shortly before midnight (2300 GMT) on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said. A woman who was also travelling in the car was seriously injured and taken to hospital, witnesses said. Niger's government said in November that Tuareg-led rebels who launched a revolt in the north last February were planning to widen their campaign from attacks on desert army patrols and remote garrisons to include "acts of urban terrorism". The Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ), led by light-skinned Tuareg nomads, has killed at least 49 soldiers since launching its uprising to demand greater autonomy for their ancestral homelands in the barren, uranium-rich north. The government accused the group of widening its offensive to towns and cities in December, when two civilians were killed by landmines -- one in the central town of Tahoua, another in Maradi, some 550 km (340 miles) east of Niamey. The MNJ denied responsibility for those attacks, blaming them on "Niger army militias" they said were aiming to discredit the insurgency and justify a security crackdown. Civilian deaths during the rebellion have fuelled anger against the Tuaregs and other nomadic northerners among non-Tuareg sectors of Niger's racially mixed population.
