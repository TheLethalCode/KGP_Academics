 NAIROBI, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's government blamed the opposition on Thursday for failed efforts by African Union chairman John Kufuor to mediate a solution to their dispute over President Mwai Kibaki's re-election. "The government had offered dialogue which was to be facilitated by President John Kufuor but Orange Democratic Movement leaders have not been responsive," said a statement from Kibaki's office minutes after the opposition blamed him for intransigence.
