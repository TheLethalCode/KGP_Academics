 LONDON, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Restaurant Group reported a sharp slowdown in underlying sales on Wednesday and said it was expecting a subdued 2008, sending its shares down 20 percent in a broadly weaker retail sector. The group, which runs chains such as Frankie & Benny's, Chiquito and Garfunkel's, said like-for-like sales rose just 1 percent in the last quarter of 2007, having been up 7 percent after 36 weeks of the year.

Page said he expected a "quiet" 2008 but did not believe market conditions were going to get much worse. The chief executive also said the group had no intention of cutting back on its new openings programme, which would see a further 30 to 35 new restaurants opened in 2008, after opening 36 new restaurants had been opened during 2007.
