 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of three garment factories Saturday took to the streets at Sheorapara in Mirpur demanding pay hikes and overtime payment. Angry workers of Outwear Ltd, Outright Ltd and Outfit Unit-2 blocked the road and stopped traffic on Rokeya Sarani. The protests trapped thousands of people in gridlock. Security was tightened in and around the area. Workers of Outright Ltd started the demonstration at 8:00am. Later the workers of the two other factories joined them. Deputy police commissioner for Mirpur zone Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that they were trying to control the situation. "The situation may come to normal if factory owners sit with the workers for negotiations," he said. bdnews
