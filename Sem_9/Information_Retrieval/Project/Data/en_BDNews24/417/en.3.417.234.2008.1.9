<TITLE> Bangladesh approaches Pakistan for rice import </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh has approached Pakistan on the issue of rice procurement, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Wednesday. Iftekhar said that he had telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Inam ul Haque the previous evening to discuss the export of rice to Bangladesh. "The details of the possible rice procurement from Pakistan are to be worked out," Iftekhar told reporters on the headway of the initiative. Pakistan is the third country that Bangladesh has approached for rice imports. Last week, the foreign adviser requested Thailand and Vietnam to export rice to Bangladesh at lower rates. The foreign ministry approached the two Southeast Asian nations after India--which had earlier agreed to export 5 lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh--unilaterally increased the price of rice to US $500 from $425 per tonne. According to government estimates, Bangladesh needs about 2 million tonnes of grain (rice and wheat) by March to face possible food shortfalls. The government says it has over 4 lakh tonnes of rice stocks at present. bdn
