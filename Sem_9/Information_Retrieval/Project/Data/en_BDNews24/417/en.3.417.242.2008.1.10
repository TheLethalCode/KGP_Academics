<TITLE> Kenya parties to work with African panel: AU </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's president and opposition leader agreed on Thursday to work together with an African panel headed by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to end turmoil that has killed 500 people, the African Union said. But a source close to the talks said negotiations had collapsed, casting doubt over the prospects for a lasting deal. Controversy over President Mwai Kibaki's re-election in a Dec. 27 vote triggered bloodletting that displaced over 250,000 people, dented the stable reputation of east Africa's biggest economy and disrupted essential supplies to nearby countries. AU head and Ghanaian President John Kufuor, Washington's top Africa diplomat Jendayi Frazer and the envoys of France and Britain met opposition leader Raila Odinga on Thursday as they piled pressure on him and on Kibaki to reach a deal. "The parties agreed to work together with a panel of eminent African personalities headed by Mr Kofi Annan ... towards resolving their differences and all other outstanding issues including constitutional and electoral reforms," Kufuor said. "Both sides agreed there should be an end to the violence and they also agreed there should be dialogue," he told reporters as he left the hotel. Officials said Kufuor was headed to the airport to leave the country. In a sign tensions were still high after two weeks of violence on Thursday, police fired teargas at pro-opposition women who held a protest march. Kibaki watched a core cabinet sworn in behind closed doors. The ministers' appointment on Tuesday prompted more violence in Nairobi slums and western towns dominated by opposition chief Odinga, who says Kibaki's win was rigged. Kufuor spent Wednesday shuttling between Kibaki and Odinga. Odinga's spokesman said the opposition leader had discussed forming a transitional or coalition government, a vote recount and a new poll as possible options to end the crisis. Kibaki has insisted that the poll results would stand despite inviting Odinga to direct talks on Friday -- an offer the opposition leader has dismissed unless it is internationally mediated. Kibaki has cast Kufuor's mission as fact-finding rather than mediation. OPPOSITION WOMEN TEARGASSED Around 70 pro-opposition women marched and blocked a main road in Nairobi's Hurlingham suburb on Thursday. Some lay down, stripped to their bras and shouted "Shame on you" at riot police who tapped their batons on their plastic shields. Police fired teargas to disperse the women, including one who clutched a small baby to her bosom as she fled. Previously regarded as a gentlemanly leader with a passion for golf, Kibaki has shown a steely side to Odinga, a former political prisoner and wealthy business owner who helped Kibaki win a 2002 poll but was sacked from government in 2005. Even as he welcomed Kufuor on Tuesday, Kibaki named half his new cabinet in a pre-recorded TV announcement, making it hard for any power-sharing deal and igniting further ethnic violence. American envoy Frazer spoke to Kibaki about naming the cabinet, a U.S. State Department spokesman said. "The perception was he was trying to put in place a political fait accompli," the spokesman said. "We expressed our displeasure, we were quite disappointed." He said Kibaki told Frazer the step was intended only to keep the government running during a negotiated settlement. Kenya's state-funded National Commission on Human Rights presented a petition to police on Thursday demanding a criminal investigation into alleged abuses by the electoral commission. Washington and Britain have both said the poll was flawed. Both Kibaki's and Odinga's parties say they will be able to mobilise a majority in parliament. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has threatened to occupy the government side of the chamber when parliament opens on Jan. 15. The official death toll from election-related political and ethnic violence is 486, although aid workers put it at more than 500, and the opposition say the toll could be nearer 1,000.
