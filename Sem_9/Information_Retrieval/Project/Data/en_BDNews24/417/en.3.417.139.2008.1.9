<TITLE> CA to get consultants: spokesman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) An initiative is underway to appoint up to seven consultants for chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, a government spokesman said Wednesday. "Six to seven consultants will be appointed in the next few days," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters at the Bangabhaban. Asked to explain the status of the consultants, the press secretary said the government was examining the laws. The consultants will be appointed as the council of advisers cannot be expanded because of constitutional constraints. Rumours were rife that the interim cabinet would be expanded to ease workload. The government sought the opinion of the the Law Commission on whether the constitution would be violated if some more advisers were appointed. The government later gave up the plan as the Law Commission pointed to legal barriers to the appointment of more advisers, officials said. Munaim said a special meeting of the council of advisers would be held Thursday to distribute portfolios among the new advisers. bdnews24.com/
