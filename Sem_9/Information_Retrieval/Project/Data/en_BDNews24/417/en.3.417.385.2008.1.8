 Jerusalem, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel on Tuesday, causing damage but no casualties, Israeli police and military officials said. The salvo against the border village of Shlomi jarred Israel, which came under rocket barrages from Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas during a 2006 war and is on high alert ahead of a visit by US President George W Bush that begins on Wednesday. "Two Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel last night from Lebanon," police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, who earlier said the predawn blasts in Shlomi may have been caused by the detonation of leftover ordnance, later agreed with the police conclusions. Violence on the border has been rare since Israeli forces overran Hezbollah strongholds in the 2006 offensive. The war led to the expansion of a UN peacekeeper force as well as the deployment of a Lebanese army garrison along the frontier. In Beirut, Hezbollah declined comment on the incident. The UNIFIL peacekeeper force said it was investigating, while a Lebanese army spokesman said he would "have nothing to do with conflicting Israeli reports". Several Palestinian militant groups have a presence in Lebanon and have at times launched attacks across the border. Bush's visit aims to encourage peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Shlomi Mayor Gabi Naaman told Israel's Army Radio that the rocket landings took place during an overnight rainstorm and that residents mistook the explosions for thunderclaps. The rocket fragments were discovered after daybreak, he said
