 Almaty, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Seven miners died on Friday in central Kazakhstan in a blast that ripped through a coal mine owned by steel giant Arcelor Mittal, emergency officials said. The bodies of four pit workers had been brought to the surface at the Abaiskaya mine, in the Karaganda region. Three dead remained underground, officials said. Of some 190 miners who had been working below ground at the time of the blast, which struck at around 0930 local time (0330 GMT), most had been brought to the surface. Around 20 remained unaccounted for. Russian news agencies, quoting mine officials, said the blast had set off an underground fire. "Rescue work is being hampered by thick smoke, and the fire has not been put out yet," Interfax news agency quoted a mine duty official as saying. Arcelor Mittal is the world's largest steel maker and is controlled by Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal. The company, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, had no immediate comment. In Kazakhstan, the company operates the former Karmet steel plant in Temirtau, which was one of the Soviet Union's largest steel mills and is now the Central Asian nation's only steel producer. Arcelor Mittal said last month it plans to invest $400-$500 million raising coal output in Kazakhstan and a further $200 million doubling long product capacity at Temirtau.
