<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Thursday demanded a high-powered judicial committee investigate the allegation of torture on Tarique Rahman during remand. "There is no provision in the law that anyone can be tortured during remand. Tarique was tortured illegally. The government should stop it," Delwar, nominated by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as secretary general, told reporters at his NAM flat. Tarique, BNP's senior joint secretary general, Wednesday asked a court for the security of his life alleging he was physically tortured when he had been remanded in custody for questioning. "Tarique Rahman is a first division prisoner. He is a politician and son of a former president and a prime minister." "Such torture is not acceptable even in the case of a common prisoner." "It is sad that the family members of (late president) Ziaur Rahman are being tortured in jail. We don't know in what condition our leader is in jail." In the reply to a question Delwar said, "The power of the judiciary has been violated under the emergency powers rules." The emergency rule should be lifted immediately, he said. Earlier, a BNP delegation met Amnesty International secretary general Irene Khan at the BRAC Centre Inn and told her about the torture on Tarique. The delegation was led by Reaz Rahman, former foreign secretary and adviser to the BNP chairperson. bdnews24.
