 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)-The Election Commission has unveiled a plan to re-demarcate parliamentary constituencies, the chief election commissioner has said. The commission has made the effort to restructure the constituencies on the basis of the distribution of population, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said at a news briefing Tuesday. The work on the re-definition of the boundaries of 300 parliamentary seats began in December, and the commission hoped to conclude it by June, Huda said. Metropolitan areas such as Dhaka and Chittgaong would see a significant increase in the number of constituencies, as each constituency would represent some four lakh people, he said. According to the 2001 population census report the country's total population is about 12.43 crore, he said. If the population is divided into 300 seats, each seat would represent over four lakh, he said. Small district, however, would have at least two seats. "The main work on the re-demarcation can be complete in one month. After that the opinion of the people's representatives will be taken. If anybody has any objection, it will be taken into account for a final decision," the CEC said. The commission faced legal obstacles during previous efforts to re-demarcate the constituencies, he added. Asked whether the commission would face such troubles this time, Huda said: "If the commission wants to stay above controversy on the matter, it will have to fix a yardstick and strictly follow that." "If the policy is right and acceptable to all, I don't think anybody will object to that." On people's apprehensions that the expected elections might not take be held in time, the CEC said: "We can't say what's in people's mind." "But we've no doubts in our mind. There's no doubt either in the government," Huda stressed. "Rather top people in the government are asking me when we'll be ready to hold the polls." "We've always maintained that if we can complete the voter list before schedule (October), the voting can be held earlier than the expected schedule." bdnews24
