Capitalising on a left-side cross from Mostafa Sharifuzzaman, Sanwar Hossain hit the board in the seventh minute to give Army a lead in the fast-paced encounter, but Army's lead was short-lived as the Bank equalised the margin six minutes later. Striker Jahidul Islam Rajon converted their first penalty corner with the combination of Musa Mia and Shahidullah Titu to bring Sonali Bank back in the match before the national striker made it 2-1 in the 27th minute. Rajon took an angular hit from the left and the ball found the back of the net with a sharp deflection of a fellow Army defender's stick. National defender Mamunur Rahman Chayan converted their second penalty to give Bank a 3-1 lead two minutes into the second half before Jamal Hossain reduced the margin for Army in the 48th minute converting a penalty corner. Chayan was named the highest scorer (nine goals) in the six-team tournament.
