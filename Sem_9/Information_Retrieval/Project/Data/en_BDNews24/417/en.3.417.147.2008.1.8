<TITLE> Serbia must meet war crimes goal for EU deal: Rehn </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brdo, Slovenia, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia must fulfil a condition of full cooperation with the UN war crimes tribunal before the European Union can sign an agreement on closer ties with Belgrade, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday. Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said earlier on Tuesday he was in favour of signing the agreement -- the first step on Serbia's road to EU membership -- as soon as possible and preferably this month. Rehn told reporters during talks with the EU's incoming Slovenian presidency that he would consult the new UN chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz soon on Serbian cooperation with the Hague tribunal. "It is essential everyone in Serbia realises this condition remains and is essential for concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement," Rehn said.
