 Dhaka, (bdnews24.com)Managing directors of four insurance companies are over 67 years-old but still in office, despite a regulatory decision that bars anyone over the age limit to hold the positions. On June 18, 2007, the Office of the Chief Controller of Insurance issued a circular setting the age limit of 67 for managing directors of insurers. The regulatory body issued a warning letter last December to the top officials of five companiesPragati Insurance, Green Delta Insurance, Bangladesh General Insurance, Eastland Insurance and Karnaphuli Insuranceasking them to make necessary arrangements regarding the circular. In response to the letter, Md Aliuzzaman of Karnaphuli Insurance resigned from his position. But the restRafiqul Islam of Pragati Insurance, Azizul Haque of Bangladesh General Insurance, Nasir A Chowdhury of Green Delta and Azmal Haque of Eastland Insurancedefied the decision, while a writ petition was filed with the High Court against the government's decision. The petitioner, Nasir A Chowdhury, said the order lacked proper authentication from the government. "The order has been proscribed without any vetting from the law ministry," said the MD of Green Delta. Azmal Haque, MD of Eastland, echoed him saying the order was illegal. "Since, there is no vetting by the law ministry it is illegitimate," he told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, a senior regulatory official said the High Court has ordered the letter issued to the four managing directors to be on hold. "Until disposal of the case, the court said the letter would be seen as 'on hold'," Roy Debdash, controller of insurance, told bdnews24.com. Both life and general insurance companies have mushroomed in recent years, contributing substantially to the economy. The premium growth of the industry was almost 23 percent from 2005 to 2006, according to statistics by the Bangladesh Insurance Association. bdne
