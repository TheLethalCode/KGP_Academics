 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  A senior special judge Monday took into cognisance the charges against 28 people in a case relating to August 21 grenade attacks and issued arrest warrants against eight fugitives. Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque heard the report that had formally charged 28 people in the case filed under the Explosives Act. The judge ordered the police to submit a report on the warrants on July 24. Fazlul Kabir, senior assistant superintendent of police (CID), submitted the chargesheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on June 11. Former BNP deputy minister for education Abdus Salam Pintu and banned militant outfit Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan were among the people charged. Six people have been dropped from the chargesheet, as two of them died and four were found not linked to the incident. The four were Omar Faruque, Shuvo, Ferdous and Babu. In another case on the same incident, the CMM's Court for Dhaka summoned eight fugitives to appear in court on June 26. The eight fugitives are Morsalin, Mottakim, Pintu, his brother Moulana Tajuddin, Khalil known as Jangi Khalil, Jahangir alias Badar, Iqbal, Selim and Moulana Liton. Morsalin and Mottakim are now behind bars in India. In the grisly attack, more than 20 people died in 2004 during the BNP-led coalition government when the Awami League organised an antiterrorism rally in front of the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attacks. bdnew
