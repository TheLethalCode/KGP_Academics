 BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga was jeered by the crowd as his side were held to a 0-0 home draw by Argentina in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Argentina played the more flowing football and will be much happier with the result than the hosts, despite a double miss by Lionel Messi in stoppage-time. The visitors ended a run of defeats by their arch-rivals, having lost the previous three meetings by three-goal margins, and went second in the South American group with 11 points, two behind leaders Paraguay. Brazil, beaten 2-0 by Paraguay on Sunday, are fourth on nine points after completing their third game without scoring and narrowly avoiding a first-ever home defeat in a World Cup qualifier. "It was a bad result at home," Brazil striker Robinho told the Sportv cable channel. The Mineirao crowd lost patience with Dunga in the second half, chanting "Goodbye Dunga", among other things, and "Donkey, donkey" when he replaced Adriano with Luis Fabiano. Dunga, who had no previous coaching experience, was appointed after the 2006 World Cup. Julio Cruz and Sergio Aguero missed gilt-edged chances for Argentina and Brazil's disorganised midfield struggled to string passes together. Argentina's Jonas Gutierrez, one of four changes made by coach Alfio Basile to the starting line-up from Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ecuador, set up the first chance for Julio Cruz, whose header was saved by Julio Cesar. ABBONDANZIERI SAVE Brazil created their best chance when Robinho broke down the right and the ball fell to Julio Baptista but his shot was turned away brilliantly by Roberto Abbondanzieri. One minute later, Abbondanzieri rushed out of his penalty area and was rounded by Robinho but the Argentina defence got back in time to smother the danger. But Brazil lost their rhythm after midfielder Anderson twisted his knee and was replaced by Diego. The visitors had an excellent chance shortly before halftime when Fabricio Coloccini sent a long ball forward to Messi, who broke clear but mis-hit his shot across the face of the goal. Argentina had another chance in the 56th minute when Juan Roman Riquelme's pass found Cruz free in the area but the target man fired over. Messi beat two defenders before his shot was deflected and Riquelme had another effort saved by Julio Cesar as the visitors continued to press forward. Julio Baptista was Brazil's most dangerous player, forcing Abbondanzieri to tip away a free kick and make another difficult save with a hooked shot. But Argentina, with Riquelme stroking the ball around confidently and Messi taunting the Brazil defence, looked more dangerous and Aguero wasted another chance by firing over the crossbar. Messi nearly snatched victory in stoppage-time when he unleashed a shot which was well saved by Julio Cesar and the forward fired wide from the rebound
