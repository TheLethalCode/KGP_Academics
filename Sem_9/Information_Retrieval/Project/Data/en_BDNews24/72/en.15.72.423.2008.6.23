 LANDIKOTAL, Pakistan, Mon Jun 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected pro-Taliban Militants kidnapped 17 Pakistani policemen from posts on the road through the Khyber Pass, the latest insecurity on the vital supply route for Western forces in Afghanistan. Militants attacked four checkposts on the winding road through the pass that leads to the Afghan border on Sunday night, kidnapping the policemen and wounding one in a brief exchange of fire, a senior government official in the region said. "Our 17 khasadar are missing," said the official in Landikotal, the main town in the Khyber region, referring to members of special police forces raised in ethnic Pashtun tribal agencies. "The attackers appear to be outsiders, maybe militants from Mohmand," said the official, who declared to be identified, referring to a neighboring region where Taliban fighters operate. No militant group claimed responsibility and no ransom demand had been received, said the official. Khyber had been virtually free of militant violence until this year but security has deteriorated sharply in recent months. Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan was kidnapped in February while traveling through the Khyber Pass. Taliban militants freed him in May. Several aid workers were also kidnapped in the region. Rival militant factions have also been battling to control the area but according to officials, those militants have no links with the allies of al Qaeda and the Taliban fighting elsewhere along both sides of the Afghan border. Up to 15 people were killed and dozens wounded in fighting in the region over the weekend. Many supplies for the US military and other foreign forces in landlocked Afghanistan go through two crossing points on the Afghan-Pakistani border, one at the top of the Khyber Pass and the other to the southwest, at the Afghan town of Spin Boldak. The government has vowed to restore order in Khyber. Separately, authorities in the Kurram tribal region, to the west of Khyber, found the bodies of eight truck drivers kidnapped when Sunni Muslim militants attacked a food convoy going into a Shi'ite region last week, said government official Atta-ur-Rehman. Four drivers were killed in the initial attack last Thursday and security forces backed by helicopter gunships retaliated killing five of the militants
