His club side Bayern Munich later said on their website (www.fcbayern.de) that he was due to have an operation in Munich on Thursday. The statement said he would be out for seven to eights weeks and was a doubt for the start of the German Cup and Bundesliga in August.

Ribery was injured in a challenge on Gianluca Zambrotta and was carried off on a stretcher 10 minutes into the Group C game in Zurich on Tuesday. Italy qualified for the quarter-finals while France were eliminated
