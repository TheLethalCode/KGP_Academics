 VIENNA, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain meet world champions Italy in the last Euro 2008 quarter-final later on Sunday (1845 GMT) with their flying forwards sure to trouble an unusually creaky Azzurri defence. The winners will play Russia in the second semi-final in Vienna on Thursday after Guus Hiddink's team beat Netherlands 3-1 after extra time in Basel on Saturday. Luis Aragones's Spain side won all three of their group games and boast arguably the most exciting front pair at the finals in David Villa and Fernando Torres. Villa has scored four goals, including a hat-trick in the opening 4-1 win over Russia, while Torres has looked a constant threat. The duo are also well-rested after skipping the 2-1 win over Greece in the final group match. "Spain are playing well, we are winning easily and have a lot of alternatives," Torres said. "We expect to have the ball for long periods against Italy but we will have to be patient." In contrast Italy have stuttered into the last eight. They were humbled 3-0 by the Dutch in their first group match, scraped a 1-1 draw with Romania before beating 10-man France 2-0 thanks to a penalty and a deflected free kick. The error-prone defence has sorely missed Fabio Cannavaro, who was ruled out of the tournament with ankle ligament damage. Main striker Luca Toni is goalless despite a hatful of chances while midfielders Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso are suspended for the game in Vienna. Italian fans remain confident, however, given they are traditionally slow starters and Spain have never beaten them in a major tournament outside the Olympics. Germany play Turkey in the first semi-final in Basel on Wednesday
