<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia captain Niko Kovac hinted he was likely to hang up his international boots after their astonishing Euro 2008 quarter-final defeat by the tournament's surprise package Turkey on Friday. "I'll give my decision a night's sleep to make it with a clear head but there are younger lads out there ready to take over," said the 36-year old defensive midfielder. "I said before the tournament I was more likely to retire after Euro 2008 than carry on and I haven't changed my mind." Croatia were seconds away from a semi-final clash with Germany after substitute Ivan Klasnic gave them a 1-0 lead a minute before the end of the normal period of extra time. But Turkey equalised with the last kick of the game through Semih Senturk in added time and won the shootout 3-1 after many of Croatia's shell-shocked players declined to take a penalty. "They say that luck favours the brave, we were brave tonight and were not rewarded for our courage," said Kovac, who has scored 14 goals in 80 games for Croatia. "We wanted to get a second goal and got punished for it, this outcome must have been preordained and I will never be able to get over the last few moments of the match.
