 WASHINGTON, Thu Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson played host at a breakfast meeting on Wednesday to introduce recently installed top Chinese officials to members of Congress, a Treasury spokeswoman said. The meeting followed two days of high-level economic talks between Bush administration Cabinet officials and their Chinese counterparts at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The Chinese delegation is expected to visit some key senators later on Thursday, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat. Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin declined to disclose the participants of the breakfast meeting but said they included members of Congress "from both sides of the aisle." The fourth round of so-called "strategic economic dialogue" talks concluded on Wednesday with the United States and China agreeing to begin formal negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty that will make it easier to invest in one another's corporations. The Chinese delegation was led by Wang Qishan, recently installed as China's vice premier. Senior Democratic lawmakers immediately criticized the plan, warning the Bush administration that they have serious concerns about moving forward with investment talks in the waning months of the Bush term
