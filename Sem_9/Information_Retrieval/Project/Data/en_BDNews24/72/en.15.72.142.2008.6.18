<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia claimed Wednesday that the popularity of the incumbent government has fallen to less than zero due to its "biased attitude". "The government's popularity has come down to 'minus zero'. They should hand over power by holding elections immediately," Khaleda told her lawyers, in the presence of reporters, at the Niko graft case hearing in special court. The detained BNP chairperson questioned the neutrality of the government. "The government is not behaving equally towards all. They are showing a biased attitude." Referring again to the failing health of her sons, Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, she said: "My two sons are sick. But they are not being sent abroad for treatment." Khaleda demanded all ailing political detainees be sent abroad for better treatment. The former prime minister said the country was experiencing a "famine". "The situation of the country is becoming worse day by day. The prices of essentials are rising. But the government cannot do anything." "The government should hand over power immediately. For that I suggest withdrawing the state of emergency and holding the elections by October." Khaleda continued: "We will accept whoever comes to power. We want a proper election with the participation of all parties." Judge Khondoker Kamal Uzzaman set the next hearing date for June 26, after rejecting a motion by the defence to stay the charge framing proceedings. Khaleda's lawyer Abdur Razzak submitted two requests to the court: for permission to appeal to the higher court and for two weeks time to do so. State counsel Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told the court that the prosecution had not yet been given the opportunity to present the charges. The court should know why the case was filed, he said. The accused had caused the state coffers a total of Tk 13,700 crore in losses, though there are different allegations against all of the accused, the prosecution lawyer said. Khaleda was taken back to the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex around 1:30 pm. She was earlier produced in the special court shortly after 10 am, along with other accused in the case; they include former law minister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam, former BAPEX managing director Mir Moynul Hoque, former BAPEX secretary Md Shafiur Rahman, controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun and former Dhaka Club president Selim Bhuiyan. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year, pressing charges against Khaleda and 10 others in the case on May 5 when the case was also brought under emergency powers rules. Khaleda and 10 others stand accused of costing the state coffers Tk 13,777 crore in losses, by conniving with Niko Resources Ltd in an "illegal" joint venture agreement soon after the four-party alliance assumed power in October 2001. The case alleged that Canadian company Niko was "very inefficient" in different aspects of operations, including technical know-how for oil explorations, but the deal was approved in violation of proper procedure. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 last year, and faces a number of corruption cases. The Niko case went to court on May 26. bdnews24
