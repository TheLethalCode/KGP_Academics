 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national cricket team left Dhaka Saturday afternoon for Pakistan hoping to qualify for the second round of the six-team Asia Cup, beginning on June 24. The Tigers will start their campaign taking on minnows the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on June 24 at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore while they will face favourites Sri Lanka on June 25 at the same venue. "The target is at least one win in the first two matches. And then we will go to the second round where I expect just to play really good cricket," coach Jamie Siddons told reporters on Thursday. India, Pakistan and Hong Kong were drawn in Group B. Top two teams from each group will qualify for the second round where each of four will face each other and the top two, play the final, scheduled for July 6 at the National Stadium in Karachi. Bangladesh cricket board members Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby and Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu saw off the 15-member squad at the Zia International Airport. Bangladesh's statistics in the Asia Cup is not so good because the tigers won just one out of their 21 previous matches and the lone win came against lowly Hong Kong in the 2004 meet in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Mahmudullah Riad, Tamim Iqbal, Alok Kapali, Abdur Razzak, Farhad Reza, Shahriar Nafees, Nazim Uddin, Roqibul Hasan, Shahadat Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehrab Hossain Jr., Dollar Mahmud and Musharraf Hossain Rubel. Officials: Shafique-ul-Haque Heera (manager), Jamie Siddons (coach), Sarwar Imran (bowling coach), Mohammad Salah Uddin (bowling coach), Grant Trafford Luden (strength and conditioning coach), Darryn Lifson (physio), Nasir Ahmed (computer analyst) and Rabeed Imam (media manager).
