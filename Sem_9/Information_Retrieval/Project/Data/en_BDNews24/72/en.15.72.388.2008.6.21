<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday repeated his demand for scrapping of the schedule for local government polls. The schedule for the Aug 4 elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities, announced by chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Friday, sparked protests from the two major political parties. "The government wants to hold the elections by force. The government and the Election Commission will be responsible for any untoward incident in the country," the leader of the divided party told BNP leaders from Joypurhat in his NAM flat. Delwar alleged that the government and the EC had violated the constitution by announcing the schedule for the local polls. "Their job is to hold only parliamentary elections." Delwar said the four-party alliance and the Awami League and other parties had already demanded the withdrawal of the schedule. Terming the election a "farce", he said: "People will not join the elections." Delwar asked the party leaders to stay alert to what he said was a blueprint by the government to hold on to power. "The government is putting politicians to farcical trial only to bar them from contesting the elections. They want to stay in power by any means," Delwar alleged. "Everybody should be aware of it." The BNP leader demanded the release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia and sending her two sons abroad for better medical treatment. "The government is keen to send Khaleda Zia abroad, not her sons. She should not be sent abroad without them." "The leader has said she will receive treatment at home." bdnew
