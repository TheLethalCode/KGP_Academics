 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh and Workers Party have reacted cautiously to the Election Commission's announced schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities. The two leftist parties said they would decide on participation in the local polls after discussions. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan told bdnews24.com: "This schedule should have been announced much earlier. The government has delayed." "We consider this election important." "However, it has to be kept in mind that the national election must not be delayed under any circumstances," said Manzurul. Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said: "We think the national election should be held before any other." "Some sections of the emergency powers rules have been relaxed, it has been said, but the state of emergency has not been lifted." Both leaders said that their participation in the announced polls would be decided after discussions with their own and like-minded parties. bdnew
