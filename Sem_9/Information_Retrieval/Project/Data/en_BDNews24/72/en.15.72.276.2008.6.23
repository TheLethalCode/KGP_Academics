 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government has carved out over 12,000 posts for the two public limited companies created from the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, a senior government official said Monday. Telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmood told bdnews24.com that the establishment ministry had approved 12,636 "supernumerary" posts for the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL) and the Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL) set to start operating as public limited companies from July 1. Current BTTB officials will be appointed to the new posts. A senior official of the telecoms ministry said the new boards of directors of the two companies would decide the pay of the staffers. The companies would follow the present salary structure until otherwise decided, he said. The BTCL will give employees scope for voluntary retirement after two years of its launch. Authorities would examine the efficiency of the BTTB employees during the period. The post and telecommunication ministry formed separate board of directors for the two companies. Secretary to the ministry would work as chairman of both the boards. Members of the BTCL board are one joint secretary of the finance ministry, one of the information ministry and one of the post and telecommunication ministry, an army officer of brigadier general rank, Professor Zafar Iqbal of Shahjalal Science and Technology University, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry and president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh.

Call beyond a district would cost Tk 1 during peak hours and Tk 0.70 during off-peak hours. BTCL subscribers have to pay Tk 0.80 during peak hours to talk to other fixed line operators and Tk 0.70 during off-peak hours.
