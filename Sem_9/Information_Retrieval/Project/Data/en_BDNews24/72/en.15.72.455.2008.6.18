<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Wednesday that no impediment remained for the release of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia. "There is no problem with releasing Khaleda Zia now," Quader said prior to joining the government dialogue with JSD at the chief adviser's office. "It took some time to analyse various legal procedures. It cannot be termed a 'delay'," said the adviser. On what steps the government had taken to bring Awami League and BNP to dialogue, he said: "The AL has already sent a list of delegates. We will finalise a date with them in line with the schedule." The adviser said he hoped that BNP would also join the dialogue within the given timeframe. "There will not be any extension. The whole dialogue process will be finished on schedule." "We are passing a very crucial time," Quader said. "Any small misinterpretation of our (the caretaker government's) words or sentences might turn into a great crisis." "Because of this, we are not making many statements about the dialogue process. But we are acting on schedule," he said. bdnews24
