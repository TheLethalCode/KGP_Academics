<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP minister Moudud Ahmed Sunday won a Supreme Court order after he challenged a previous High Court ruling that cancelled a writ petition in a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Chamber judge Tafazzal Islam of the Appellate Division put freezes on the HC order for two weeks. Moudud filed the writ petition challenging the legality of the graft case against him last year. The HC cancelled the appeal on June 19. Earlier, the HC halted the proceedings of the case on Oct 29, 2007, but the Appellate Division ordered a final hearing on the writ petition after the ACC appealed against the HC ruling. ACC deputy director Sahiqul Islam Siddiqui filed the case on Sept 16 last year, accusing Moudud of amassing illegal wealth and concealing information about his property. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq and another lawyer, Mahbub Uddin Khokon, defended Moudud in court Sunday. bdnew
