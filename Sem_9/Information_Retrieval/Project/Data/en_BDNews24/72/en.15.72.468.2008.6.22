 Manila, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Philippine ferry with more than 700 people on board capsized during a typhoon and all but a handful of those aboard have been accounted for, officials said on Sunday. Rescuers had not yet reached the scene where the MV Princess of Stars sank near Sibuyan island in the centre of the country as a Typhoon Fengshen pounded the area. "The ship is upside down. We are waiting for rescuers but there are none so far. Our pump boats are all broken," Ricardo Aligno, a town councilor from the coastal village of San Fernando, told local radio. The coast guard expected one of its ships to arrive in the area in the next few hours. The ship sank about three kilometers from shore. The bodies of two women were recovered and children's' slippers washed ashore. Before dawn on Sunday, some villagers heard warning sirens from the ship, which had 626 passengers and 121 crew on board. At least four people aboard are known to have died. "We were told that at around 5 a.m. the captain sounded the abandon ship signal," said Lieutenant-General Pedro Inserto, military commander in the Visayas, the central region of the Philippines. "We were told the passengers and crew transferred to another ship. But we still do not know which ship," Inserto told Reuters. Dozens of relatives, some in tears, crowded into the offices of Sulpicio Lines, the ship's owner, in the central city of Cebu, looking for information. The company said it had lost contact with the ferry, which was en route to Cebu from Manila, at around 12.30 p.m. EDT on Saturday. WORST DISASTER Fengshen, with gusts of up to 195 kph (121 mph), tore through the centre of the archipelago on Saturday, devastating the province of Iloilo, where officials said at least 59 people had been killed in floodwaters more than two meters high in places. "Iloilo is like an ocean. This is the worst disaster we have had in our history," Neil Tupaz told local radio, adding he feared the death toll could rise. Tupaz said tens of thousands of people were marooned on their roofs waiting to be rescued. In total, Fengshen has killed at least 80 people, including an 8-year-old girl and her grandfather who were buried in a "trash slide" at a rubbish dump in the southern city of Cotabato. More than 20,000 people were being housed in evacuation centers in the centre and south of the archipelago, where the storm had triggered flashfloods, landslides and ripped up trees and power lines. The typhoon pelted Manila with torrential rain and high winds on Sunday, triggering power outages in many parts of the capital. The international airport was relying on generators for power and passengers continued to cram into the departure terminal despite most flights being either delayed or cancelled. Fengshen, the sixth typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, is headed north and expected to hit Taiwan in the next few days, according to storm tracker website www.tropicalstormrisk.com.
