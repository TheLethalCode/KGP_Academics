 BERLIN, Thu Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A German court on Thursday sentenced an Iraqi man to three years in jail for distributing messages by al Qaeda leaders on the Internet.

German security experts have highlighted the growing importance of the so-called "virtual jihad", saying militant Islamists have turned to Internet chatrooms in their efforts to recruit young followers. Siolek said Thursday's sentence was also meant as a warning to others.

Defense lawyers had sought an acquittal on the grounds of freedom of speech and religion
