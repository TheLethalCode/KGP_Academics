<TITLE> Colombian oil pipeline closed by attacks: source </TITLE>

 Bogota, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia's Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline has been closed by rebel bomb attacks carried out on Saturday and Sunday, a source at state petroleum company Ecopetrol told Reuters. "The pipeline has been paralyzed by the two attacks," said the source, who asked not to be named. The pipeline, which has capacity to carry 225,000 barrels per day, was transporting an average of 96,000 bpd from Arauca province to the Caribbean coast. Occidental Petroleum shares output with Ecopetrol at the Cano Limon oil fields. The pipeline was shut down for several days by another guerrilla bomb in May. But such attacks and other violence related to Colombia's war have declined under President Alvaro Uribe's U.S.-backed crackdown on the rebels, who are fighting a four-decade-old Marxist insurgency.
