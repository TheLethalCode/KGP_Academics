 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited look to bounce back from an embarrassing drubbing by Nepal Police FC in the AFC President's Cup by beating favourites Regar TadAZ of Tajikistan Tuesday at the MPPJ Stadium, Selangor, Malaysia. "After having seen the match between Regar and Pakistan's WAPD yesterday (Sunday), I didn't find any difference among the four participating teams," Abahani manager Sattyajit Das Rupu told bdnews24.com by phone Monday. "It is tough but not impossible to beat Regar and we will try to comeback in the tournament," said the Abahani manager. Bangladesh's B. League champions were routed by Nepal Police 4-0 in the inaugural Group A encounter while Regar beat Pakistan WAPDA 2-1 in the second match. "The players are a bit down morally and I told them to forget it and they are gearing up for Tuesday's match." Rupu said. The former Bangladesh international termed the first match result 'unfortunate' and blamed the defenders on a rain-socked pitch. "It never seemed that those apparently harmless moves by the opponents would covert to goals, but unbelievably they hit the target," said Rupu. Rupu said two out of four goals were scored due to mistakes of the defence marshalled by Nazrul Islam, Wali Faisal, Ibnul Siraji and Ghanaian Samad Yousuf. He said they would strengthen their backline by playing five defenders against the last year's champions Regar. The Abahani manager said they would keep faith in the strike pair of Jahid Hasan Emily and Ghanaian Ibrahim in the second match though they missed open nets four times against the Nepalese.
