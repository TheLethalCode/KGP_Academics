 Dhaka, Jun 19 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended down on the closing day of the week, as jittery investors were engaged in sell-offs to lock in profits, according to market observers. "We dealt with huge selling orders; buying was very low today," said an official of brokerage house Anwar Securities. Investors were feeling insecure about the market, which led to sell-offs and lower transactions, added the official. The twin bourses of the country witnessed a decrease in turnover and trading volume. Market analysts welcomed the day's price correction but doubted its sustainability. "We are not unhappy with the price correction, but it is induced by fears of interventions," Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of a private asset management company told bdnews24.com. He doubted the price correction would last long as it was not a natural one. "We are still in some uncertainty about the market's direction and taking a very cautious stance on trading," said the top official of AIMS of Bangladesh. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed said the correction came as investors became aware of market inquiries by stock exchange officials. "But scrips were still overpriced after the price fall," he told bdnews24.com. The DGEN or general index rose at the opening bell.
