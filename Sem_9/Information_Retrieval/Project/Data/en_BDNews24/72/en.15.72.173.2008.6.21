<TITLE> Bribery down at Chittagong Customs House: TIB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Instances of blatant bribery in the Chittagong Customs House have decreased thanks to reforms introduced in the last one year, but the practice is still prevalent outside the port and customs areas through agents, TIB said in a report Saturday. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) identified 10 sectors and 30 bribe-taking spots in Chittagong customs area and made a 19-point recommendation for further reforms. The report said there had been a change as a result of some reforms in the system and strict surveillance by joint forces after the promulgation of the state of emergency in 2007. The report mentioned that Tk 1,450 crore more revenue was collected by the Chittagong Customs House in the current fiscal year than last year after bribery declined. The report expressed apprehension saying that though there was a visible change in the Customs due to a systematic reform, the situation may revert to the previous condition if there were no sustainable changes alongside basic reforms. TIB research officer Tanveer Mahmud presented the report at a roundtable on the transparency and accountability of Chittagong Customs House at the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry auditorium Saturday. The report was based on a study conducted from November 2007 to May 2008. TIB trustee board chairman Prof Muzaffer Ahmad presided over the discussion. The report said that in the Chittagong Customs House development work was being hampered for lack of efficient manpower. There had been no direct appointment in the organisation since 1982. Prof Muzaffer Ahmad said that the tax sector was one of the top sectors where corruption had decreased in the last one year. "Corruption in the sector might be brought down further through overall coordination," he said. If a civil watch body were formed, the surveillance of the joint forces would not be necessary in the Chittagong Customs House, the TIB chairman said. Customs commissioner (import) Nasiruddin said transparency of work at the Customs had increased. He told reporters that positive communication with the stakeholders had increased. He differed with the TIB findings of an increase in bribery and corruption. Businessmen at the meeting demanded introduction of complete automation, reforms to the PSI system and appointment of efficient manpower in the Customs House on a priority basis. bdnew
