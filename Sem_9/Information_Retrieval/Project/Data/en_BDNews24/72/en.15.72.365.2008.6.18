 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has deferred the verdict of a graft case against former president HM Ershad to July 2. Judge Md Golam Mortuza of the Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court had earlier set Wednesday (June 18) as the verdict date in the case involving purchase of electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case on Feb 29, 1992, pressing charges on Oct 27 the same year. According to the case details, the national transmission authorities were ordered to purchase an ENG set at Tk 2.93 crore in 1989, while Ershad was in the office. Ershad is accused of abusing his power to misappropriate money from the state coffers to purchase the equipment for his own office, even though all broadcasting facilities were available at his secretariat. The trial was concluded with closing arguments on June 8. The former president faced numerous cases after he was deposed in 1990. In 2006, he was acquitted in four graft cases following his announcement of joining the BNP-led four-party alliance. He was also acquitted in a corruption case and a gold smuggling case earlier this year. bdnews24
