"For every automaker who can sell a zero-emissions car, we will commit a $5,000 tax credit for each and every customer who buys that car," he will say. "For other vehicles, whatever type they may be, the lower the carbon emissions, the higher the tax credit." McCain will say that the existing financial penalties levied on car makers for not complying with fuel efficiency standards -- known as US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) -- are too low.
