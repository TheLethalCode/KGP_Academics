 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com)  A BNP faction led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three allies have set a rally for June 30 to protest the government's plan to hold local government polls ahead of national elections. The announcement came from an indoor rally, organised by the four-party alliance at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium to press holding the national polls first. "The caretaker government does not have the authority of holding local government polls. The four-party alliance will not accept the polls," Delwar told the rally, the second in a week. Referring to a report on corruption released Wednesday by the Transparency International Bangladesh, Delwar said the caretaker government should not stay in power as TIB said corruption increased during its rule. The BNP leader, appointed secretary general by BNP chief Khaleda Zia before her arrest, asked the government to hold a parliament election first and stay away from "polls-fixing". Delwar demanded the release of Khaleda and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami for an environment conducive to holding free and fair polls. He said the alliance would chalk out more programmes to press the release of the leaders. Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said people would not accept "selection" in the name of election. Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) chief Andalib Rahman Partha and Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami were present at the rally. bdnew
