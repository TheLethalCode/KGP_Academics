<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's players and management will never get over their penalty shootout defeat by Turkey, coach Slaven Bilic said on Friday. "This is a match that not only we will not forget but that will haunt us for the rest of our lives," he said after Croatia's Euro 2008 quarter-final exit. "Penalties of course are something special but speaking for myself I have no misgivings for my players," added Bilic after Turkey won 3-1 on penalties after the match ended 1-1 following extra time. "I am proud of them but at the same time we are unhappy because we thought we could make it to the end of this tournament." STOPPAGE TIME Ivan Klasnic put Croatia ahead in the 119th minute but Bilic's team were rocked when Semih Senturk dramatically equalised two minutes into stoppage time. "It was a shock for us, it seemed as if it was all over, and then we concede a goal and go on to the penalty shootout, that was certainly a psychological advantage for the Turks," said Bilic. Croatia trio Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Mladen Petric then missed their spot kicks. "I can't say what was on the players minds but they were not focused on the shootout, mentally they must still have been in extra time and seeing that conceded goal again. That must have affected them," added Bilic. "I can't blame any of the players who missed. Those who stepped up to take the spot kicks were the ones who were strong enough to do it. "There were players who didn't want to take the penalties and I have no complaints against them either.
