<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany midfielder Torsten Frings remains doubtful for Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final against Turkey in Basel. Frings missed the 3-2 win over Portugal in the quarter-finals after fracturing a rib in the previous game against Austria. "Of course we want Frings fit but we have to wait and see," team manager Oliver Bierhoff told a news conference on Sunday. "So far he's only been running in training. We still haven't seen how it goes with tackling and challenging for the ball. He's burning to play but we need more discussions with the medical staff." With Frings unavailable, Germany coach Joachim Loew changed his midfield formation to good effect against Portugal. He brought in Simon Rolfes and Thomas Hitzlsperger to play as holding midfielders and gave captain Michael Ballack freedom to get much further forward. "You'll have to ask the coach about who will be playing against Turkey but as far as I'm concerned we will only pick players who are 100 percent fit," Bierhoff said
