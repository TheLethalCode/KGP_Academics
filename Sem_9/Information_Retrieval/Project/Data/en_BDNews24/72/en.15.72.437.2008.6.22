 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal have demanded a probe commission over the alleged torture of Khaleda Zia's two sons in detention. The front organisation of BNP threatened to go for tough moves if the demand was not realised within 48 hours. It asked the government to release BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia immediately and send Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for better medical treatment. "The government has brought false charges against Khaleda Zia and her sons as a part of its blueprint to destroy the nationalist forces," the organisation's president Sohrabuddin told reporters at the NAM Flat residence of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "Tarique was in good health when he was arrested. But he was tortured in remand. Two bones in his spine were broken during this time," Sohrabuddin alleged. He claimed that Coco has also suffered torture in detention. Referring to BNP founder Ziaur Rahman as the declarer of the nation's independence. Sohrab said: "Countrymen and freedom fighters will not tolerate the destruction of [Zia Rahman's family] by ill-motivated people." "The torturers will have to be identified and measures must be taken to punish them by forming a probe commission." The organisation also demanded holding of national elections by Oct 30 and withdrawal of the state of emergency.
