 Dhaka, Jun 22 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited, Bangladesh's B. League champions, Sunday suffered an embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Nepal's Mahendra Police FC in the inaugural Group A match of the AFC President's Cup at the BMPJ Stadium, Selangor, Malaysia. Jumanu Rai slammed a hat-trick while Anantha Thapa netted the other goal as Mahendra Police FC, last year's runners-up of the meet, kickstarted their campaign on a high. Thapa put his side ahead in the 15th minute while Rai doubled the margin three minutes later, according to a message received here. After the breather, Rai struck his second goal in the 56th minute and completed the treble from a spotkick in the 70th minute. Abahani face Group A favourites and last year's champions Regar-Tadaz of Tajikistan Tuesday at the same venue. They will play their last match against Pakistan's WAPDA on June 26. bdn
