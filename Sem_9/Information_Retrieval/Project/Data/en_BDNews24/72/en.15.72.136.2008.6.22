 BANGKOK, Sun Jun 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej defended himself and his administration on Sunday in the face of thousands of demonstrators camped outside Government House calling for his resignation. In his first public comments since Friday's march on the seat of government by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the 73-year-old Samak, who was elected in December, left no doubts about his desire to remain in office. "The way I got into power was legal and my government is in line with the law," the firebrand right-winger said in a weekly television address. Despite his determination, he said he would not send in either the police or army to dismantle the PAD stage outside Government House, a move that would trigger concern among investors in a country terrified of political violence. "I'll be patient for our country and will see who can be more tolerant. I am confident that I can handle the situation. I will avoid a clash with the PAD. On Monday, I will work at Government House. There are other doors for me to enter," he said. Samak, who won millions of rural votes on a pledge to revive the populist policies of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, triggered fears of another coup last month when he vowed to smash the four-week PAD campaign. He later backed off when the police and military made it clear they had no stomach for a fight. Over the weekend, thousands of mainly middle-class Bangkok residents set up camp outside Government House after police let columns of PAD marchers through barricades on Friday rather than use force to repel them. The atmosphere was jovial with the crowd clapping and cheering speakers on a hastily erected stage as police looked on. After Samak's comments, the PAD reiterated its intention to continue with the protests until the resignation of Samak and his cabinet, which the PAD views as an illegitimate proxy for Thaksin, despite its comfortable election victory in December. "The protest will continue," PAD leader Pipob Thongchai told reporters. "Our standpoint is that Samak, who is a nominee of Thaksin, has to resign because his mismanagement is damaging the country." The PAD led the 2005 and 2006 street protests that ended with Thaksin's removal in a coup. Samak said the government had agreed to hold a debate in the Senate on Monday and parliament would hear an opposition motion of no-confidence against him and seven other ministers on Tuesday, helping to ease the political tension. With a huge majority in parliament, Samak's six-party coalition is in little danger from the censure motion. However, the agreement to hear the complaint is major shift from his previous stance that any censure motion should not precede the annual budget debate
