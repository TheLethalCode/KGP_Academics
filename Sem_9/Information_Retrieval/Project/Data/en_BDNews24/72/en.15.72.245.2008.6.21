 VIENNA, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey coach Fatih Terim said he did not give up even when Croatia went 1-0 ahead with one minute of extra time left in their pulsating Euro 2008 quarter-final on Friday. "I saw some of our players lying on the pitch. I told them to pick the ball out of the net. I wasn't giving up," a jubilant Terim told reporters after Turkey snatched a 3-1 win on penalties after the tie ended 1-1 following extra time. "You should never give up until the very end, until the referee blows the final whistle. That is why football is an interesting game." Ivan Klasnic put Croatia ahead in the 119th minute but Slaven Bilic's team were rocked when Semih Senturk dramatically equalised two minutes into stoppage time. Turkey's players agreed that Terim inspired them from the touchline as the team came from behind to win for the third game running. "Our coach looked at us and his look spurred us on," said midfielder Kazim Kazim. Forward Nihat Kahveci said: "We never lost faith even when they scored. I kept believing in the team. We also showed it against the Swiss and the Czechs. We have soul." LAST SECOND Fellow attacker Mevlut Erdinc said: "We fought until the very last second and did not give up. It showed how strong we are when we are united." Terim said Turkey's equaliser represented a terrible body blow to Croatia. "We conceded a goal at a critical moment but then scored ourselves at a critical moment," said Terim. "To lose an opportunity to win in such a short time is a serious mental blow to any team. I thought we would have a chance and it wouldn't be easy for Croatia." Turkey, through to the European Championship semi-finals for the first time, meet Germany in Basel on Wednesday
