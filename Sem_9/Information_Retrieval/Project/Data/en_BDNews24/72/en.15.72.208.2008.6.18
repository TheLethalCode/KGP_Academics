 TENERO, Switzerland, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany will leave it until the last possible moment before deciding whether Torsten Frings has recovered sufficiently from a rib injury to play in Thursday's Euro 2008 quarter-final against Portugal. "We won't decide until just before we have to hand in the team sheet," Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff said at a news conference on Wednesday. midfielder Frings did not even notice he had fractured a rib in Monday's 1-0 win over Austria in Germany's final Group B match until the next day, when it was confirmed by an x-ray. "If the medics say there is even a slight chance of a serious injury then we won't risk it," Bierhoff said. "But I have to give credit to him. He's eager to play." Germany's other injury worry is forward Lukas Podolski, who has a problem with his calf. "Things have improved greatly over the last 24 hours but with muscle problems you never know," Bierhoff said
