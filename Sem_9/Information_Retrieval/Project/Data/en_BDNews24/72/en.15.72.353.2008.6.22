 TENERO, Switzerland, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germans worried that Jens Lehmann was too old, too slow and too unreliable for Euro 2008 but the 38-year-old keeper has proved that reports of his decline were wildly overplayed. Lehmann looked so distracted in Germany's final two matches ahead of the tournament that he became an obvious target. "I'm going to stay standing up and give you all more surface area to aim at," he said to the assembled media when he walked in for his first news conference at the team's training base. It is clear enough why the goalkeeper was the big worry for fans, reporters and even the coaches. Lehmann lost his place in the Arsenal team last season, was without a club to go to and came into the tournament desperately short of the sharpness that only comes from playing regularly. He looked nervous at the start of Germany's first game against Poland, twice failing to come out and collect crosses in the first few minutes, but he gradually settled and has continued improving as the tournament has gone on. There was nothing much he could do about the goals in the 2-1 defeat by Croatia and against Austria he led by example, coming out for every cross and taking them all cleanly as Germany went through with a 1-0 win. FAULTLESS FORM He was even better in the 3-2 win over Portugal in the quarter-finals, despite conceding another two goals. Again, he was immaculate on crosses and dealt easily with a series of shots from outside the area in the second half. "I didn't share your criticism," Germany's goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke told a news conference on Saturday. "We've seen some blunders from other keepers at this tournament but none from Jens. I'd say he's performing exactly the way we hoped he would and thought he would." Lehmann will be under pressure to quit the German team after the tournament, with outstanding young keepers like Rene Adler, Manuel Neuer and Michael Rensing waiting for chances. This is Lehmann's second major tournament as number one and the second time he has helped them reach the semi-finals. At the 2006 World Cup he became a national hero for his match-winning display in the penalty shoot-out with Argentina, though he could not prevent Italy winning the semi-final. This time they face a seemingly weaker side in Turkey in Wednesday's semi-final in Basel and the chances of Lehmann signing off from international football with a showpiece final in Vienna on June 29 look better than ever. "This is certainly my last chance of a European Championship win," said Lehmann, who will return to the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart next season. "I'm going to give it everything I've got.
