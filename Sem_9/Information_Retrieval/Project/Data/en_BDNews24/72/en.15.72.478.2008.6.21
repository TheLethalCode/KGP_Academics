<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany can scarcely wait for Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final but after watching Turkey's latest great escape against Croatia no one is underestimating how hard it will be to finish them off. "We've seen now that Turkey just never give up," Germany defender Arne Friedrich said on Saturday. "In terms of skill and the quality of their build-up play, Croatia were the better team but you can never write Turkey off." Germany will reluctantly take on the role of favourites for Wednesday's game in Basel after Turkey surprised everyone with their victory in Friday's quarter-final. Croatia were almost through after Ivan Klasnic struck in the 119th minute only for Semih Senturk to blast the ball home with the final kick of extra-time and force a penalty shoot-out that Turkey won comfortably. Friedrich plays for Hertha Berlin and he said the semi-final would produce a special atmosphere back in the German capital. "As everyone knows there are a lot of people of Turkish origin in Berlin and everyone is looking forward to it," said Friedrich. "It will be a huge party zone, and hopefully a peaceful one. "I prefer to play Turkey because I think they're a better style for us. Croatia are so compact, so well organised. They stifle your attacks and they're very difficult to play against. "Turkey haven't been so convincing and look less of a threat than Croatia. I'm very optimistic." Striker Miroslav Klose, who scored Germany's second goal in their 3-2 win over Portugal in the quarter-finals, agreed that the three-times winners would look forward to the next match with real optimism. "We are very well prepared to play Turkey," the striker said. "If you saw Turkey play they have great will power and determination. It's important for us to match that.
