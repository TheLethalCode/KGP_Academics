<TITLE> Donadoni hopes for hairy dividend after Italy win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZURICH, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said he hoped some of his hair would now grow back after his side reached the Euro 2008 quarter-finals by beating France 2-0. The win, coupled with Romania's 2-0 defeat by Netherlands in Tuesday's other Group C match, was enough to put the world champions through despite a shaky start to the tournament. A 3-0 drubbing by the Dutch and 1-1 draw with Romania had left Donadoni under pressure but he can now look forward to Sunday's last eight match with Spain in Vienna. "Yesterday I said there was some hair on my pillow. Now I'm hoping my hair will grow back a bit," the 44-year-old told a news conference. The former Italy midfielder was frustrated his side failed to push on after France defender Eric Abidal was sent off and Andrea Pirlo put them ahead with a 25th minute penalty. The game was only settled when man-of-the-match Daniele De Rossi's deflected free kick flew in just after the hour. "Even as a footballer I was used to achieving things through hard work and sweat. I can't do that anymore so I have to trust the boys," Donadoni said. "When we went 1-0 up there was a bit more tension than I expected but it is only human. In those moments as a coach you want to go on the field and help. I can't do it anymore, because if I run 40 metres I get a tear in my thigh." Bookings for midfielders Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso mean they will miss the Spain game but Donadoni said Massimo Ambrosini and Mauro Camoranesi could fill in almost as well. "Certainly it is not good news but I trust the other players," he said. "Ambrosini and Camoranesi have played and will fight really hard. I don't consider them as players who sit on the bench." Donadoni said he had shown his team a letter from a fan who needs a blood transfusion to try to inspire them. "The players have to look beyond their ivory towers. The boy gave us an incentive," he said
