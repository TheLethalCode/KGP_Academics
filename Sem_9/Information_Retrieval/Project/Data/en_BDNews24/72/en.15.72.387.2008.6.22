 BRISTOL, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Teenager Tim Southee took four wickets to lead New Zealand to a 22-run win against England in the third one-day international on Saturday. New Zealand had appeared to be heading for a comprehensive defeat earlier after they slumped to 49 for five but after taking 50 runs from their last five overs to reach 182 all out, Southee ripped through England's middle-order. He returned career best one-day figures of four for 38 as the home team were bowled out for 160 with 22 balls left. Paul Collingwood top scored for England with 34. The teams are now all square at 1-1 in the five-match series after England won at Durham and the no result at Edgbaston. The next match is at The Oval on Wednesday. It was Southee, 19, who turned the game with a three-wicket burst for no runs as England slumped from 62 for two to 64 for six. That passage of play ultimately cost England their opportunity to go 2-0 up. Southee removed Ravi Bopara, Owais Shah and Tim Ambrose in the space of eight balls and England never recovered from his deadly spell. "Everyone knows he is going to be a really good bowler and one-day cricket is about giving him experience. We just have to keep putting faith in him as he's a natural talent," New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said of Southee. England failed to gain any momentum from the outset, losing opener Luke Wright to the fourth ball of their innings and Kevin Pietersen followed in the fifth over. Southee had showed his potential against England on his test debut in March when taking five wickets and blasting 77 not out in a losing cause, with nine sixes. Bopara was athletically caught at point by a diving Jamie How for 27, Shah departed in Southee's next over when he attempted a cover drive to a ball that bounced more than he expected and he could only offer a simple catch to Scott Styris at second slip. Four balls later Ambrose edged Southee to Ross Taylor at first slip for a duck. New Zealand were earlier thankful to top scorer Grant Elliott, called up from English club cricket on Monday as cover for the injured Jacob Oram, for his 56. Kyle Mills chipped in with 47 from 40 balls to boost the Kiwis' total and earn the man of the match award. "We are very disappointed that we didn't take an opportunity to be ruthless and go 2-0 up," said England captain Collingwood. "We kept losing wickets and it was a disappointing run chase.
