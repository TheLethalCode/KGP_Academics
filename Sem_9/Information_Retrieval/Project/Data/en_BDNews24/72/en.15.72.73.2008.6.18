 Dhaka, Jun 18 (bdnews24.com)Stocks finished up Wednesday as investors regained some confidence in the market, according to market observers. Turnover and trade on the country's twin bourses also witnessed an increase from the previous day. Meanwhile, DSE officials continued their interventions in a bid to cool down the market, by halting trade of 2nd and 3rd ICB mutual funds and BSC for market inquiry, according to a web post.
