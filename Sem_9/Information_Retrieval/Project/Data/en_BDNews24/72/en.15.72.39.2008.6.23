 TENERO, Switzerland, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew spoke warmly on Monday of his experience living and working in Turkey and said he hoped Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final would go peacefully on and off the pitch. Loew took charge of Fenerbahce in the 1998-99 season, early in his coaching career, and also had a spell with Adanaspor. "The experience of living in Turkey and coaching Fenerbahce left an incredible impression on me," Loew said at a news conference on Monday ahead of the match between Germany and Turkey in Basel. "Turkey is a cherished experience for me and I learned what it was like for people to be truly identified with a club. Now there is an entire nation backing the Turkish national team with their whole hearts. "The other thing I remember is the incredible hospitality and great human warmth of Turkish people. No matter where I went I was welcomed with open arms and it was an immensely gratifying experience." Germany is home to more than two million people of Turkish origin and when Turkey qualified for the semi-finals, fireworks exploded in the sky over Berlin and other cities as tens of thousands of people celebrated in the streets. "I dearly hope that there is no provocation surrounding this game," Loew said. "We live together in Germany. "I hope the game itself, and the experience of watching it, will be a peaceful affair. This is just football. I've got to know Turkish people well and they're a superb people.
