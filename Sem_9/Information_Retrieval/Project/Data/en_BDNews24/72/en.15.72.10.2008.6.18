 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)Only teachers of educational institutions with the government's monthly pay order will get a 20 percent dearness allowance announced in the new budget, an adviser said Wednesday. Teachers of schools, colleges and madrasas without MPO will not get the 20 percent allowance. Teachers of community primary schools will not get the extra pay either, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters. The budget proposed for fiscal 2008-09 will be approved with a few minor changes, he said, after a meeting with UK's minister for international development Shahid Malik at the National Economic Council. Mirza Aziz said he would sit with officials Thursday to discuss the proposed budget further. "There will be no major change in the proposed budget as 10 business bodies have not recommended anything big," the adviser said. "The opinions of people have been reflected in the proposed budget. I think I have prepared a realistic budget by holding discussions with people from different professions," Mirza Aziz said. The adviser announced the budget on June 9.
