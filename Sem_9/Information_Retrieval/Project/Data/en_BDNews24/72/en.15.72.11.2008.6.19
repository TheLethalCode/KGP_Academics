<TITLE> Umpires right to abandon game, says match referee </TITLE>

 BIRMINGHAM, England, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Match referee Javagal Srinath defended the umpires and cleared England of time-wasting after the second one-day international with New Zealand at Edgbaston ended in a farcical no result on Wednesday. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori indicated his team were denied a victory because the umpires failed to put an end to England's "gamesmanship". "The umpires did a commendable job under pressure, they had to be consistent with the way they interpreted the regulations," former India bowler Srinath told reporters. "There will be no action (against England) as there were circumstances that led to the over rate like injuries and other delays." England lead the five-match series 1-0 after their victory at Durham on Sunday. With rain falling in dull conditions, umpires Ian Gould and Steve Davis took the players off when only one more over was needed to be bowled to constitute a contrived result by the Duckworth-Lewis calculation. A tense finish was likely. New Zealand were 127 for two after 19 overs chasing 160 in 23 overs. They needed to reach 134 with the same wickets down after the 20-over mark to win. England bowled 19 overs in 83 minutes. Vettori was disappointed his team were not able to complete what he felt would have been a Kiwi victory to square the series. "I think we would have won if we were allowed to have gone through to that 20th over," Vettori told reporters. "There is a sense of disappointment in our dressing room and it almost feels like a loss. "England's over rate was particularly slow but if we were in their position we would have probably done the same thing. We needed the umpires to hurry it up. That's what it comes down to. There was a bit of gamesmanship going on and that's all part of the game." England skipper Paul Collingwood defended his team's over rate but said he was surprised the umpires allowed a 30-minute break between innings in a match that began four hours late. "To have a 30 minute break was surprising," Collingwood said. "We had all had our lunch before the game started and we were ready to go out 10 or 15 minutes after (our innings). It's a regulation so you can't change it but it needs to be looked at. "(Our over rate) was not a tactic," Collingwood added. "We were chasing the ball a lot and I didn't realise it was that slow." The third match of the series is at Bristol on Saturda
