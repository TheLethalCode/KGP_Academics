 Jaipur, India, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Gujjar community, demanding job quotas, called off its violent campaign on Wednesday after authorities agreed to reserve more jobs for them, community leaders and officials said. At least 40 people have been killed since the Gujjars, who are demanding access to state jobs and college quotas, began their protests last month in the western state of Rajasthan. Most of the dead were rioting Gujjars shot by the police in the days after Gujjar campaigners lynched a policeman. "It is a historic day," K.S. Bainsla, leader of the protesting Gujjars, said on Wednesday. "We are fully satisfied with the talks, which have been successful." Vasundhara Raje, chief minister of Rajasthan, said an additional 5 percent of local government jobs and seats in state-run colleges would be reserved for Gujjars and three other groups. Members of the community had demanded that their place in the Indian caste system be downgraded, making it easier for them to qualify for government jobs and university places reserved for such groups. India reserves about half of all government jobs and seats in state colleges for people born into lower castes and tribal groups, who tend to be poorer than other Indians. Last year 25 people died when Gujjars fought police and members of another caste that qualifies for job quotas. After those protests, a state government committee decided Gujjars should not be downgraded but the government should spend 2.8 billion rupees ($67 million) improving schools, clinics and roads in Gujjar areas. Gujjar leaders rejected the offer.
