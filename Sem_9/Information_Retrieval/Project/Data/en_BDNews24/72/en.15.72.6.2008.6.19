 Dhaka, June 19 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission Thursday described the TIB report on corruption as constructive. "The report was not meant to undermine any organisation. It is constructive. The ACC has started work to assess whether corruption has increased or come down after 1/11," ACC director general Hanif Iqbal said in a press briefing. "The ACC does not believe corruption will disappear overnight. It is not possible for any agency alone to free the country of corruption. It requires a collective effort." The ACC will intensify its work on "highly corrupt organisations" on the basis of the report released Wednesday by Transparency International Bangladesh. Iqbal ducked a question on a comment of Prof Muzaffer Ahmad that corruption at a small scale increased after the 1/11. But he disagreed with another remark by the chairman of the TIB's board of trustees that the ACC had no plan for future. "ACC has many plans against the spread of corruption in future in the country," Iqbal said. Meanwhile, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam claimed that the number of major corruption cases declined in Bangladesh during the present caretaker government. "Field-level corruption might have remained unchanged." "I am sure that corruption in the upper echelons of the government has come down. None of the advisers, special assistants to the chief adviser, and senior government officials is tied to corruption," Mirza Aziz told reporters at the planning ministry in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The adviser refused to comment on the TIB report. "What I said was my observation and analysis. I will not make any comment on the TIB report as an adviser of the government." Mirza Aziz said corruption should not be scaled on the basis of figures. "Where corruption had taken place and who had done it have to be published." "Corruption, a big problem for Bangladesh, disrupted development. We cannot come out of it overnight. The government can consider a pay hike of government employees to curb corruption," the adviser said. bdnews24.com contacted home adviser MA Matin, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman for comment on the TIB report. None of them agreed. bdnews24.com
