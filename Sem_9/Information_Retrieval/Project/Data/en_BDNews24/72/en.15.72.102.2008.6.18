<TEXT>
 BERNE, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adrian Mutu's penalty miss against Italy will haunt Romania for a long time, said defender Cosmin Contra after his team's elimination from Euro 2008 on Tuesday. "This penalty is the reason we are going home. We had an opportunity to beat the World Cup winners in the 81st minute and didn't take it," Contra told Reuters after Romania lost 2-0 to Netherlands in their final Group C game. "We will think about this penalty a lot. We will think about it when we go home, we will think about it in our sleep," he added, referring to their 1-1 draw with world champions Italy last Friday. Defeat by the Dutch coupled with Italy's 2-0 win over France in Zurich meant it was the Azzurri who qualified to face Spain in the quarter-finals in Vienna on Sunday. Group winners Netherlands meet Sweden or Russia in the last eight in Basel on Saturday. "Holland were the better team tonight and the better team in the group," Contra said. "We had our chances to progress. People didn't give us a chance beforehand so we had a good tournament. "I think we will go home with a lot more experience. We have a tough group to qualify for the 2010 World Cup but I think this tournament will give us a better chance.
