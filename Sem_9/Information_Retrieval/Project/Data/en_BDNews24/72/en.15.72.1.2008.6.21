<TITLE> Middle East 'Quartet' to meet in Berlin on Tuesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The quartet of Middle East peace mediators will meet in Berlin on Tuesday for their first gathering since Egypt brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the US State Department said. The quartet, which comprises the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States, will meet on the sidelines of a German-hosted conference to support Palestinian "civil security and rule of law." The United States hopes to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement by the end of the year despite the weakness of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government and the divisions among Palestinians. As part of its efforts, Washington has sought to strengthen security forces under Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah movement holds sway in the West Bank but lost control of Gaza to Hamas fighters a year ago. Abbas is seeking to strike a peace deal with Olmert while the Islamist Hamas movement opposes the negotiations.
