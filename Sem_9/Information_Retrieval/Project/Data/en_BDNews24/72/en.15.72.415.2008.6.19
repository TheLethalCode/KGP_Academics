 BIRMINGHAM, England, 19 June (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The second one-day international between England and New Zealand ended in a no result at Edgbaston on Wednesday after rain prevented a finish. New Zealand were set 160 from 23 overs according to the Duckworth-Lewis calculation used in weather-shortened games, altered from 165 from 24 because of continued rain after England were 162 all out in their 24-over allotment. New Zealand had reached 127 for two after 19 overs when the umpires -- England's Ian Gould and Australian Steve Davis -- took the players off the field due to steady rain. There has to be 20 overs bowled to decide the match with New Zealand required to reach 134 for two after 20 overs. England captain Paul Collingwood, unbeaten New Zealand batsmen Brendon McCullum (on 60 off 51 balls) and Scott Styris (19) appeared frustrated when they were told to leave the field. McCullum's innings was his 13th one-day international fifty while England took more than an hour to bowl their first 14 overs. Earlier, debutant Grant Elliott claimed three wickets to restrict England. The medium-pacer took three for 23 from his five overs after being called up from English club cricket this week following a hamstring injury to Jacob Oram. Opener Luke Wright top scored for England with 53 from 38 balls after New Zealand won the toss in murky and damp conditions and elected to bowl. The Kiwis trail 1-0 in the five-match series after England took the lead with a comfortable 114-run win at Durham on Sunday
