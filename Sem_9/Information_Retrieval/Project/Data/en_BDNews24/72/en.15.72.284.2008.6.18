 MALABO, Wed Jun 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Accused British mercenary Simon Mann told a court on Wednesday that Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was part of the "management team" of a 2004 coup plot in Equatorial Guinea. Mann, an Eton-educated former special forces officer, was giving testimony at his trial in Malabo about his role in the failed plot to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in the small, oil-rich West African nation. He told the court that Mark Thatcher, who has denied knowing about the conspiracy, "was not just an investor". "He came on board completely and became part of the management team," Mann said, adding that a London-based millionaire, Eli Calil, was "the boss" of the plot. Answering questions from both the prosecution and defense, Mann also said the governments of Spain and South Africa knew about the conspiracy. "By January 2004, the operation was like an official operation because the Spanish government and the South African government were both giving the green light," he said. "Their involvement was clandestine and they will never admit it," he added. Equatorial Guinea's Public Prosecutor Jose Olo Obono told Reuters the next step for the West African state's authorities would be to seek the extradition of Thatcher and Calil. "I am very, very sorry for what I have done. I am also very happy that we failed ... I think that the people that were seriously involved in this and have not faced justice, they should do so," Mann said. The prosecution has asked the court to jail Mann for nearly 32 years for his role in the coup plot, which he has admitted being part of. His defense lawyer has said he was a "mere instrument" in the plot, not a ringleader
