 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda stressed Friday that local polls were "non-political elections", reiterating that the Election Commission will not act in any way to hamper the national election. "Local government elections are non-political. I hope there is no political objection in this regard," he said at a press briefing at the EC conference room immediately before the announcement of the local polls schedule. "The announced roadmap for national election by December has been applauded at home and abroad," he added. Huda said he hoped that with the announcement of the local polls schedule, a proper environment for elections would start to come about in the country. "The country should now become election orientated," he said. "With the new voter lists being used and new election laws having been implemented, these local polls should provide experience before the national election," said the CEC. With the government's move to relax emergency powers provisions in the poll areas to ease campaigning, the candidates can go to the people, he said. Whether the rainy season would be an impediment to holding the four city corporationa and nine municipal elections, the CEC said they would not be hampered as the scheduled elections are town-based. Huda went on to formally announce the schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities to be held on August 4. The CEC announced the date at the press briefing, amid objections from the two major political parties and their allies who oppose the move to hold local polls before the national election. It will be the first elections to be held by the present Election Commission, which has set a deadline for submission of nomination forms by July 3 and withdrawal of candidature by July 13. The four city corporations are Barisal, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet. The municipalities are Manikganj Sadar, Sreepur in Gazipur, Fulbaria in Mymensingh, Chudanga Sadar, Shariatpur Sadar, Sitakunda in Chittagong, Nawhata in Rajshahi, Dupchanchia in Bogra and Golapganj in Sylhet. Schedules for other municipalities and Dhaka City Corporation will be announced later in phases, the CEC said. Asked his reaction to the four-party alliance protest programme against the holding of local polls, he declined to comment on Friday. A BNP faction led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain, and its three allied parties, had already announced a protest programme to be held on June 30 in opposition to the EC's move to hold local government polls before the national election. At a meeting of the four-party alliance Friday, Delwar said protest programmes would continue. Awami League met the CEC's announcement Friday by demanding "withdrawal" of the local poll schedule, terming it "a farce" and "a conspiracy". However, AL leaders have recently said that the party has yet to take a final decision on whether to contest the local government polls before the national polls. The CEC along with election commissioners M Sohul Hussain, M Sakhawat Hussain took office in February last year, in the wake of 1/11. In May, the EC embarked on the massive undertaking to properly enlist and photograph all eligible voters in the country. According to an election roadmap previously announced by the EC, elections to the city corporations and municipalities were supposed to be held in mid-July this year. There are a total of six city corporations and 308 municipalities in the country. Elections to Khulna and Rajshahi city corporations were last held on April 25, 2002, and to Sylhet and Barisal on March 20 2003. The government has already formulated an ordinances relating to local polls. CEC Shamsul Huda said Friday the electoral code of conduct must be followed strictly during the local elections. The Election Commission would remain strict in enforcing the laws, he said. Though the government has announced relaxation of emergency powers rules to ease campaigning by candidates, election shows- of- strength, multi-coloured posters, illuminations, setting up of camps and erecting arches are banned by the EC, Huda said. The CEC warned the candidates against violation of these rules. Huda also pledged a smooth national election, which he said would come after the upazila parishad elections. Election commissioners M Sohul Hussain, M Sakhawat Hussain and EC secretary Md Humayun Kabir were present at Friday's press briefing. bdnews
