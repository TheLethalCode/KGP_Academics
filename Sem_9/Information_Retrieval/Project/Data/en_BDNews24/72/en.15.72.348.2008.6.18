 BERNE, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania return home after a rollercoaster journey which took them to within touching distance of the quarter-finals and sending world champions Italy crashing out of the tournament. Drawn alongside the Italians, France and Netherlands, most people gave them little chance of progressing from the tournament's toughest group, with some questioning whether they would even manage a point at the finals. They managed two points, holding both Italy and France to draws. But had striker Adrian Mutu converted a 81st minute penalty against the Azzurri, the world champions would have been packing their bags early and the eastern Europeans would have been favourites to reach the last four alongside the unbeaten Dutch. "If we had scored with a penalty against Italy, we could have qualifiedwe would have qualified," coach Victor Piturca said. But despite the 1-1 draw against Italy, Romania still held the second qualifying spot in Group C in their own hands going into their final match against Netherlands. WELL ORGANISED After two previous robust and well organised defensive performances, Romania ran out of ideas and also seemed to run out of steam against a Dutch team with nine changes. "We ran a lot in the first games, we have ran a lot at this tournament, maybe we just couldn't run any more," captain Cristian Chivu told Reuters following the 2-0 defeat to the Dutch. But Chivu was a lot more pragmatic about the importance of Mutu's missed penalty. "The penalty was one kick, we had 90 minutes to decide our own destiny and win the game to qualify," he said. Captain and coach both agree Romania, who had not qualified for a major tournament since Euro 2000, would go home with their heads held high and taking a lot of heart going into their 2010 World Cup qualification campaign. "The experience we gained here will be very important," Piturca said. "Life goes on, this tournament will be over and then we'll have to think about the World Cup." If Piturca's side make it to soccer's greatest stage in two years, the key lesson they must take to South Africa is that, no matter how well you defend, you must score goals to advance. Romania were very well organised, showed gritty determination but in their three games they never looked like a team who could light up the tournament or score many goals
