 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  The autopsy report on the death of Bangabazar shop employee Aminur Rahman Rana, allegedly killed by his employers, found signs of torture on him, police said Sunday. Sub-inspector Md Quaiyum of Shahbagh Police Station, the investigation officer, told bdnews24.com that the autopsy report confirmed that Rana had been murdered. Shahbagh police received the report Saturday. Rana, who worked for SK Traders, died on June 15. His death prompted a street protest by employees of a number of markets near Gulistan as they believed Rana had been killed. They demanded punishment to his killers. Police launched drives to arrest SK Traders owners Kamal Hossain and Siraj Uddin. The victim's brother, Afsar Ali Sarkar, who filed a murder case with Shahbagh Police Station against the two, said they would often torture their employees. Rana had been buried at Azimpur graveyard but the body was later exhumed by police for autopsy after the case had been filed. bdnew
