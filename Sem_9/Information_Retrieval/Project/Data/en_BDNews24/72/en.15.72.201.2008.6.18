 ZURICH, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 quarter-finalists Italy finally found some luck in the 2-0 win over France but they can not get too excited given suspensions to two key players and Luca Toni's troubles in front of goal. The world champions meet Spain in the last eight in Vienna on Sunday after joining Netherlands in qualifying from Group C. Fortune had not been on Italy's side earlier in the month, with injured defender Fabio Cannavaro being ruled out of the tournament and controversial offside calls going against them in a 3-0 defeat by the Dutch and 1-1 draw with Romania. It all changed, though, in the repeat of the 2006 World Cup final. France playmaker Franck Ribery looked a huge threat in the first 10 minutes before being forced off with a knee injury. Eric Abidal was then sent off, giving Italy a big advantage and Andrea Pirlo the chance to score from the spot. Daniele De Rossi's second-half free kick also took a hefty deflection on its way into the net while the already-qualified Dutch did their job by beating Romania 2-0 in the other game. "It is great to go through and there is a little bit of extra happiness given our difficult start and how we were criticised," De Rossi told reporters. However, the night was not all positive. Midfielders Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso picked up bookings and miss the Spain clash. 'GREAT CHAMPIONS' The pair have not been at their best this season but the Azzurri will still miss their experience and Pirlo's set plays. "We will be without two great champions but there are another two that can do their work," De Rossi added. Coach Roberto Donadoni, whose job was on the line if they lost to France, has already hinted Massimo Ambrosini and Mauro Camoranesi will take their place alongside De Rossi, who was a rock in the holding role on Tuesday. Whoever does come into the lineup must try to supply some more incisive passes to the forwards after Italy again took a more English approach against France, often relying on crosses and long balls rather than their traditional quick movement. Main striker Toni did manage to be on the end of several balls but missed a number of good chances and has yet to score in the tournament. His luck will have to change too if Italy are to stand a chance against a vibrant Spain
