<TITLE> Mississippi flood levees strain, Bush to visit </TITLE>

 QUINCY, Illinois, Thu Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Volunteers and relief workers fortified levees on the rising Mississippi River on Thursday to prevent more flooding that has caused billion-dollar losses and ignited global food inflation fears. Nearly two dozen levees on the key US commercial waterway have overflowed as floodwaters swamped small towns and thousands of acres of fertile farmland. Grain and meat prices have soared on concerns about short supplies. Jeff Steinkamp, chief engineer for the town of Quincy, Illinois, where the flooded river is expected to crest at 32.2 feet on Friday, said days of sandbagging levees had paid off so far. "Everything is holding for now. So far, so good," he said. The slow-rolling disaster, the worst flooding in the Midwest in 15 years, has swamped vast sections of the US farm belt and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. The cost of the disaster may end up rivaling that of 1993 Midwest floods that caused more than $20 billion in damage and 48 deaths. This month's flooding has caused few deaths and the damage has yet to be fully assessed. Political pressure was rising to provide relief. President George W. Bush will travel to Iowa on Thursday to survey flood damage in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City and meet with emergency workers and state and local officials. Republican presidential candidate John McCain will also be in the state to inspect the damage and response. His Democratic rival in the November presidential election, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, was in Quincy earlier this week. Upriver at Dallas City, about 50 sandbaggers made up of volunteers and National Guard troops worked into the night on Wednesday. "We've had a little relief because the levee breaches lowered the river level a little. But it's coming up again. We're not done yet," said Kathy Dougherty of the Hancock County Emergency Services Agency. The Army Corps of Engineers, which operates river locks and dams, said 22 levees along the Mississippi had failed this week, including 12 on Wednesday. It said 48 levees protecting more than 285,000 acres of cropland from Dubuque, Iowa, to St. Louis, Missouri, were overflowing or at high flood risk. Estimates are that 5 million acres across the Midwest have been ruined and will not produce a crop this year. The prospects of smaller crops have jolted commodity markets, food producers and exporters. Chicago Board of Trade corn prices traded at a record $8.07 a bushel. For 40 years, CBOT corn has traded mostly in a range of $2-4 a bushel
