 BASEL, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel has been banned for two matches and will miss their Euro 2008 quarter-final against Croatia and a possible semi-final, tournament organisers UEFA said on Wednesday. Volkan was red carded in stoppage time in Turkey's dramatic 3-2 Group A victory over Czech Republic on Sunday after he pushed striker Jan Koller to the ground in an off-the-ball incident. Turkey coach Fatih Terim backed Swedish referee Peter Frojdfeldt and said 2002 World Cup keeper Rustu Recber would take Volkan's place against Croatia in Vienna on Friday. UEFA said the Turkish soccer federation had also been fined 44,000 Swiss francs ($42,150) due to the "improper conduct of supporters, players and officials" during and after the Czech Republic match. UEFA spokesman Rob Faulkner said Turkey could appeal against both the ban and the fine "in writing within 24 hours." Turkish transgressions included Volkan sitting on the bench after his dismissal when he should have left the technical area, around 25 unaccredited people present in the Turkey dressing room after the match and some fans trying to reach the pitch. Terim's side has been hit by injuries and suspensions affecting seven players in the 23-man squad. Defensive midfielder Mehmet Aurelio is suspended for the quarter-final after picking up a second yellow card against the Czechs and captain Emre Belozoglu has a hamstring problem and has not played since an opening Group A defeat by Portugal. Central defender Emre Gungor, who was carried off in the second half of Sunday's match, has a calf strain and is out of the tournament
