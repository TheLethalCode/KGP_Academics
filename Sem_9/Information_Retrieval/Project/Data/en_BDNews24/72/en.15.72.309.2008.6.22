 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)The government Sunday named 22 Commercially Important Persons (CIPs) for 2008 but was forced to drop as many for their failure to pay taxes or repay debts. The list included special assistant to the chief adviser for industries Mahbub Jamil, who himself handed CIP cards to the 22, at a low-key ceremony where the ubiquitous TV crew was not present. The CIP (industry) status recognises contributions to industries, manufacturing and production, employment generation and enhancing the economy. Father, former major general Amjad Khan Chowdhury of Pran Group, and son, Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, both made the list. Another family was fortunate to have two CIPs: Md Mujibur Rahman, managing director of BRB Polymer, and his son-in-law Md Mijbar Rahman, managing director of Kiam Metal Industries. The lone woman on the list was Nasreen Awal, wife of former FBCCI chief and Multimode Group supremo Abdul Awal Mintoo. She was chosen as head of the women's trade group, Women's Entrepreneurs Association of Bangladesh (WEAB). Heads of trade bodies such as FBCCI, CCCI, FICCI, BCI, NASCIB and BTMA became CIPs. Seven people were made CIPs ex-officio, eight for founding major industrial units and five for their contributions in the medium industry. Two persons were small industry owners. All will be entitled to receive first-class medical care, access to facilities offered by VIP lounges at airports and other privileges for a period of one year. After the ceremony, Jamil said that 44 people had been nominated initially. "After applying the eligibility criteria, we left loan defaulters and tax evaders out. We submitted the remaining nominations to the commerce and home ministries seeking necessary clearances," he said. "The selection process marked 22 for CIP status." "After a long gap of six years, we took the initiative this year to honour eligible industry figures of different levels," Jamil said. "The current process will see new CIPs selected in January 2009, unless the next democratic government nullifies it." The special aide pointed out that the state rewards those who have distinguished themselves in 14 select fields of music, literature, sports and others, but industrial entrepreneurs are missed out in such national performance medals. "I took this opportunity to draw the chief adviser's attention to the matter so that future industrialists may be rewarded and recognised." After receiving his CIP credentials, chairman of Deshbondhu Sugar Mills Golam Mostafa said: "Industrial entrepreneurs will be encouraged further if such recognition by the government is repeated every year." "I'd also request the government to reduce bank loan interest rates for encouraging industrial growth." After receiving her CIP status, Nasreen Awal Mintoo said: "Women entrepreneurs across the country will be much encouraged at the government recognising a woman as a CIP." "I'd request the government to introduce banking facilities and services for women with a view to encouraging them to join the entrepreneurs' ranks." The ex-officio CIPs selected for 2008 are the acting president Bangladesh Chamber of Industries MA Shahid, president of Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry Oliur Rahman Bhuiyan, president of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, National Association of Small and Cottage Industries of Bangladesh president Mirza Nurul Ghani, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association president Abdul Hai Sarkar, Bangladesh Women Entrepreneurs Association president Nasreen Awal Mintoo and FBCCI president Annisul Huq. The eight CIPs selected from the big industry sector are Deshbondhu Sugar Mills chairman Golam Mostafa, Berger Paints Bangladesh managing director Masih Ul Karim (now adviser to the company), Bangladesh Steel Re-rolling Mills managing director Ali Hussain Akbar Ali, Epyllion Group managing director Riazuddin Al Mamun, Jalal Ahmad Spinning Mills chairman Md Shahjahan, FS Sweaters managing director Muhammad Golam Faruque, Agricultural Marketing Company director Ahsan Khan Chowdhury and Singer Bangladesh managing director Mahbub Jamil. The five CIPs selected from the medium category industries are Pran Foods managing director retired Maj Gen Amjad Khan Chowdhury, BRB Polymer managing director Md Mojibar Rahman, Sagar Garments director Md Nurul Haque, Kiam Metal Industries managing director Md Mijbar Rahman and MP Sweaters managing director M Miraj Hussain. The two small industrial entrepreneurs are MB Garments managing director Mahmudur Rahman and Tusuka Fashions chairman Arshad Jamal. Calling upon entrepreneurs to invest more in the northwest of the country, special aide Mahbub Jamil said: "Despite the construction of the Jamuna Bridge and the availability of cheap labour and land, the northwestern region of Bangladesh haven't been able to attract many investors over the past decade." bdnews24.
