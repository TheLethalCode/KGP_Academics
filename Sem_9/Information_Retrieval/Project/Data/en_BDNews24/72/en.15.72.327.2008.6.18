<TEXT>
 KARACHI, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday that it will closely monitor security conditions in Pakistan ahead of September's Champions Trophy. Australia postponed their planned tour of Pakistan in March because of fears over the safety of their players after a spate of suicide bombings but the ICC's acting chief executive Dave Richardson confirmed it will host the eight-team tournament. "So far it has been decided to go ahead with the event in Pakistan," Richardson told a news conference in Lahore, insisting that safety concerns expressed by the Federation of International Cricketers' Association (FICA) were premature. "We might expect some concerns from the players and we understand that security of players, media and all stake holders is the responsibility of the ICC. We're monitoring the situation on regular basis." Richardson added that if the majority of the executive board members wanted the Champions Trophy to go ahead in Pakistan then any country backing out for any reason would have to face the consequences and penalties. Ray Mali, the ICC president, led a delegation of the council to Pakistan on Wednesday for the launch of the Champions Trophy logo and to oversee facilities at tournament venues in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Delegates also met with interior ministry officials in the capital Islamabad to discuss security plans for the event. "Pakistan has vast experience of hosting big events and I have felt safe wherever I have gone," Mali told reporters after a visit to the Pindi cricket stadium. "The Asia Cup which they host this month will be their preparation ground for the Champions Trophy." An ICC team of security experts also visited Pakistan last month and Sri Lanka has been kept as a standby venue for the event
