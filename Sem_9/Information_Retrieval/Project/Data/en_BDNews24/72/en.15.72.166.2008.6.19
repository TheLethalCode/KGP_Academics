<TITLE> Obama: US should avoid making bin Laden a martyr </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, JUne 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama says if Osama bin Laden is captured alive, the United States should bring him to justice in a way that avoids turning the al Qaeda leader into a martyr. After meeting a team of foreign policy advisers, including some seasoned diplomats he has newly recruited in the run-up to November's election, Obama hit back at efforts by his Republican rival John McCain to paint him as weak on fighting terrorism. McCain allies including Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States by al Qaeda in 2001, have accused Obama of having a "pre-9/11 mindset" that focuses on law enforcement in the war on terror. But Obama linked McCain's national security approach to that of President George W. Bush, calling it "disastrous" and citing the failure to capture bin Laden as evidence. "The record shows that George Bush and John McCain have been weak on terrorism," Obama told reporters. "Their approach has failed. Because of their policies, we are less safe, less respected and less able to lead the world." Asked by a reporter how he would proceed if bin Laden were caught during his presidency, Obama said, "we may not be able to capture him alive" and that he may be killed. "It does not make sense for me to speculate in terms of what the best approach would be in trying him and bringing him to justice," Obama said. "I think what would be important would be for us to deal with him in a way that allows the entire world to understand the murderous acts that he's engaged in and not to make him into a martyr." Also key, the Illinois senator said, was "to assure that the United States government is abiding by basic conventions that would strengthen our hand in the broader battle against terrorism." Obama, who has sharply criticized the use of the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba to hold suspected terrorists, talked of the Nuremberg trials set up after World War II to prosecute Nazi war criminals as an example of how justice could be administered in keeping with a "universal set of principles." In a series of exchanges reminiscent of the 2004 campaign, McCain's advisers have pounced on Obama for saying terrorism suspects could be treated as criminals "within the constraints of the Constitution." 'POLITICAL BLUDGEON' In an ABC News interview on Monday night, Obama contrasted the indefinite detention of Guantanamo Bay detainees with the criminal prosecution of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers. Giuliani and other allies of McCain, an Arizona senator, countered that the fight against terrorism was mishandled prior to Sept. 11. The approach at that time was a "critical mistake," Giuliani told reporters in a conference call, because it dealt with terrorism "as a defensive matter." "When the 1993 attack took place at the World Trade Center, the response to it was a criminal prosecution but nothing beyond that," he said. McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Obama's national security approach was "ideologically driven" and criticized him for opposing last year's troop buildup in Iraq. Obama has accused the McCain campaign of using the Sept. 11 attacks as a "political bludgeon" in an effort to distract from the failed policy of pursuing the Iraq war, which the Democrat said had made America less safe by shifting resources away from stabilizing Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban and pursuing al Qaeda militants. "I refuse to be lectured on national security by people who are responsible for the most disastrous set of foreign policy decisions in the recent history of the United States," Obama said. "The people who were responsible for murdering 3,000 Americans on 9/11 have not been brought to justice," he said. "They are Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and their sponsors -- the Taliban." Obama spoke after meeting with a newly configured panel on national security that includes several seasoned hands from the administration of former President Bill Clinton, including former secretaries of state Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher. The panel also includes members of Obama's existing inner circle, such as Susan Rice, one of his top foreign policy advisers, and former national security adviser Anthony Lake. Some of these advisers could fill Cabinet posts or other senior jobs if Obama becomes president.
