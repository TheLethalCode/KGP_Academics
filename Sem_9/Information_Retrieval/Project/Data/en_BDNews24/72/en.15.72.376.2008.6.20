<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain has termed the Election Commission's announcement of a local government election schedule "impulsive" and "unconstitutional". Following the EC's announcement of the schedule, the party's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The secretary general on behalf of the four-party alliance has rejected the announcement of the schedule." "He has called it an impulsive decision. Not only that, he said it is unconstitutional, motivated and part of an ill-design." "People will not accept this election schedule. We reject this decision of the Election Commission," said Rizvi. He reminded all of the four-party alliance's decision to hold a countrywide protest programme on June 30, in opposition to the EC's announced schedule for local polls. Delwar himself had earlier on Friday sounded a warning to the government against holding local government polls before the national election. He said the government and the Election Commission would be responsible for any unexpected situation in the country in the wake of the announcement of local government polls schedule before the national polls. "No election should be allowed before the parliamentary election," the Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general told a meeting of local representatives of Bangladesh Khilafat Majlish, a member party of the BNP-led four-party alliance. He asked all leaders and workers of the four-party alliance to be united. "Unity is essential for us. We will not accept any polls before the national election by any means," he said, demanding the national polls by October. He asked the Election Commission to announce a schedule for the national polls immediately. bdnew
