 BAGHDAD, Wed Jun 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from a devastating truck bombing in Baghdad rose to 63 on Wednesday and US forces blamed a rogue Shia militia for the attack. Four children and five women were among those killed by Tuesday's blast near a crowded market in the predominantly Shia neighborhood of al-Hurriya in northwestern Baghdad, Iraqi police said.
