 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday asked bank owners to put in place efficient management to safeguard depositors' interests. "Banks are established on depositors' money, so they have to ensure depositors' interests are not hampered by any means," the interim government head was quoted by his press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim as saying. Munaim briefed reporters after a delegation of Bangladesh Association of Banks met the CA at the Chief Adviser's Office. The bank owners briefed Fakhruddin on problems facing the sector including the one relating to tenure of directors. According to the Banking Companies Amendment Ordinance 2007, a person cannot hold the post of director for more than six years at a time. The ordinance says a private bank cannot appoint more than 13 members to its board of directors and stipulates a three-year tenure for a director. The law that came into effect on October 8 last year also allows no director to continue in office for more than two consecutive terms. Those who completed their six years as director last year were given one year to step aside. BAB chairman Nazrul Islam Majumder said the owners demanded the time be extended two years more as 160 efficient directors of different banks would have to quit due to the law that they said had hit the sector hard. The CA asked the bank owners to talk to the governor of Bangladesh Bank over the issue. "An ordinance on the matter has already been promulgated. I have nothing to do with it. The Bangladesh Bank governor is directly linked to the matter," the CA was quoted as saying. The bank owners also sought the CA's intervention in cutting corporate tax of banks down to 40 percent from 45 percent. The CA said the finance ministry is the right authority to look into that. Majumder, also chairman of EXIM Bank, told bdnews24.com that they had told filled the CA in about problems in banking sector. bdnews24.com/
