 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com) - Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury has termed the relaxation of emergency powers rules in the four city corporation and nine municipality areas for a period leading up to local elections "a good sign". However, he added, it would be better if the state of emergency were completely withdrawn. He told bdnews24.com, after the Election Commission's and government's announcements regarding the local polls: "If the other political parties participate in the local government election, Bikalpadhara will do so also." At an earlier function at the party's central office in Segun Bagicha, the former president had said: "We think the upazila elections should also be held before the parliamentary election. " "After the upazila system became non-functional, no government has arranged any upazila election. So we would urge this government to hold the upazila elections before the parliamentary election." Claiming that the popularity of Bikalpadhara was increasing, he cited a recent private survey that said the Awami League enjoyed 38 per cent popularity, BNP 28 per cent and Bikalpadhara 18 per cent. bdne
