 BASEL, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands coach Marco van Basten said Russia were worth their victory in Saturday's Euro 2008 quarter-final because they were the better side. "The Russians deserved to win. They played much better, they created chances. So I can live with that," said the Dutch manager who is now leaving for a career at Ajax Amsterdam. The Dutch were overwhelmed by the hard-running Russians who scored twice in extra-time to overcome their flagging opponents 3-1 after the game had finished 1-1 in normal time. "At the start, we had some good moves but, unfortunately, we weren't able to do what was needed," said Van Basten. "We didn't have the match under control. Russia made it difficult for us. We had physical problems. The players didn't have the conditioning anymore at the end." The Dutch, who sailed through the group stage with high-scoring wins over Italy and France, had their problems before the match against Russia had even kicked off. ROBBEN INJURY "We were unlucky as Arjen Robben picked up an injury yesterday (Friday) and could not start," said Van Basten, who added that they were not helped by early substitutions. "We were forced to make three substitutions during the 90 minutes and therefore we had physical problems in extra time." "Russia really were stronger then and we could only hold the 1-1 draw until 10 minutes from time." The Dutch started the match as favourites after comfortably winning their three Group C games but they were never allowed to reach the heights they had achieved against Italy and France. "I have no idea why we didn't start as well as in previous matches but the team looked a bit nervous," said Van Basten. "We had a lot of problems with (Russia playmaker Andrei) Arshavin and that really kept us out of the match." Van Basten, in charge for the last time before starting at Ajax on July 1, said they had started the tournament well but that it was just not their day against the Russians. He added that he felt sorry for goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who had said before the match that he would finish his international career after the tournament. "Edwin had a great international career and really deserved to end it by winning the final of a tournament like this," said Van Basten of the Manchester United keeper who has won 128 caps
