<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  A faction of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal Wednesday urged the government to hold elections to local government bodies ahead of the year-end national polls. Leaders of the Nur Alam Ziku-led JSD faction placed a 10-point proposal during the dialogue with the government at the Chief Adviser's Office. Demands for formation of a commission on constitutional reforms and a national security council figure in the proposal. After the talks, JSD general secretary Abdul Malek Ratan told reporters that the party leaders had demanded a bicameral parliament be formed. Ratan led the JSD delegation to the dialogue as party chief Nur Alam Ziku was ill. Ratan said they asked the government to declare listed criminals, corrupt people and war criminals ineligible for contesting the polls, and continue the drive against crimes and corruption. The JSD asked the government to hold a referendum to prepare a national charter and take steps to end dynastic politics. In a news briefing, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, who attended the dialogue, said the emergency rule would be relaxed shortly before local elections in the voting areas. The local polls will not affect the national polls, the adviser said. "The Election Commission will take necessary steps about Upazila elections." The adviser said steps about the formation of a commission on constitutional reforms should be taken without delay on the basis of a consensus as some other political leaders made a similar demand. Preparations for regional dialogue in Chittagong scheduled for June 28 were almost complete but no decision was taken yet on whether chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed would be present there, he said. bdnews24.c
