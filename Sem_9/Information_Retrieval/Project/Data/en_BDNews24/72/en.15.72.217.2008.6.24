<TITLE> Safiuddin discovers limitless beauty in lines </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  The one-man show by outstanding, reclusive artist Safiuddin Ahmed opened Monday at the Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, packed with art lovers. Safiuddin was not present at the launch of the exhibition, his first in Bangladesh, as he was ill. "It is my first exhibition in Bangladesh. But I could not be present there for my ill health," Safiuddin said in a written statement. The solo exhibition, titled "Limitless Luminosity of Lines", marks his 86th birth anniversary. The self-absorbed artist has always stood apart from popular trends. "Painting is something of devotion for me. I have never worked for publicity. I thought publicity would ruin my devotion," Safiuddin said, explaining his long aloofness from the public glare in his career. In the statement, he said he did not want to sell artworks. For him, an artwork was a milestone to measure his progress in his journey ahead. The exhibition comprising only drawings was launched among a host of luminaries led by former chief justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. The show meant to shine the spotlight on his lifetime devotion will continue until July 13. Safiuddin broke new ground in line drawings of the 1990s. From 1992 to 1995, he experimented exclusively with black. "Black is the most powerful colour to him. An artist who can use black with mastery can easily handle any other colour," says Syed Azizul Haque, a teacher of the Fine Arts Institute, in a critique on Safiuddin. "At times the forms become unidentifiable, abstract. We notice a resurgence of images first used in prints in the fifties. Together with those images, Safiuddin Ahmed has also used the lines found etchings," Haque says. bdn
