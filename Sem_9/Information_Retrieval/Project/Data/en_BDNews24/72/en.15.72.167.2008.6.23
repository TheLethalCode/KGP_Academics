 NEUSTIFT, Austria, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Being given the responsibility of taking the crucial penalty in the shootout victory against Italy gave Cesc Fabregas the chance to dispel any doubts about his ability to produce the goods for Spain. "It has been difficult for some people to have confidence in me when I play for Spain, but I know that life sometimes give you the chance to prove yourself," Fabregas told a news conference at Spain's training base on Monday. "People have been discussing my role in the team and my status as a substitute so scoring that goal meant a huge amount to me," he added. After Sunday's match at the Ernst Happel stadium had ended in a 0-0 stalemate after extra time, Fabregas was chosen by coach Luis Aragones for Spain's fifth penalty despite the fact he does not take them for his Premier League club Arsenal. Although team mate Dani Guiza missed his spot kick, keeper Iker Casillas saved those from Italy's Daniele De Rossi and Antonio Di Natale, giving Fabregas the chance to clinch a place in the semi-finals with his penalty. "The boss came on to the pitch and gave the names out," said the midfielder. "I've always felt that he has faith in me, and he showed that by naming me number five which is normally the crucial penalty. SUPERSUB ROLE "I just wanted to shoot to score so that everything could come to an end. I wanted to make him (Gianluigi Buffon) think I would shoot to the left as I do in training and then I put it to the right. It was my first penalty in a match since I was 15." Aragones said he chose Fabregas because "I knew he was going to score". Fabregas, who has started on the bench for three of Spain's four matches at Euro 2008, said he was content with the 'supersub' role given to him by Aragones as long as it benefited the team. "I just want to help the team and if that means coming on in the last half hour that is fine," he said. "I don't want the glory just for myself, I want it for Spain." Victory over Italy means Spain will face Russia, who they beat 4-1 in the group phase, in their first semi-final at a major tournament in 24 years. But Fabregas said Thursday's showdown would be completely different from their previous encounter. "We haven't done anything yet," he said. "And if we think Russia will be the same as the opening match we will be very mistaken. We need to keep our feet on the ground if we want to join the teams that have won this tournament.
