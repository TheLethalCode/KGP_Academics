<TITLE> Turkey show again they will never, ever give up </TITLE>

 VIENNA, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey coach Fatih Terim said this week their greatest strength was they never give up but even he must have feared it was all over with a minute left of extra time in Friday's Euro 2008 quarter-final with Croatia. Ivan Klasnic's 119th minute goal seemed to have decided the game in favour of the Croatians, yet, unbelievably, there was still time for the absolute substantiation of Terim's faith when Semih Senturk struck a stunning equaliser in the 122nd. Turkey then won the match in a penalty shootout to earn a semi-final meeting with Germany in Basel on Wednesday that had looked beyond them at almost every stage of the tournament. Having lost their opening game to Portugal they were drawing 1-1 with Switzerland going into added time in their second until Arda Turan planted a shot into the net to win the game. There looked no way back in the final group match, though, as they trailed Czech Republic 2-0 after 74 minutes and were still 2-1 down with three minutes remaining. Nihat Kahveci then took centre stage as he bundled home an equaliser and then curled in a wonderful 89th-minute winner. After falling behind in all three games the Turks had vowed to come out fighting on Friday and were true to their word. However, they were gradually pegged back by the skilful Croatians and were lucky to get to 90 minutes goalless. With so many first-choice players out injured or suspended and with Croatia's first team fully rested after a week off, it seemed that extra time would suit Slaven Bilic's team. ENERGY RESERVES Yet Turkey seemed to find hidden reserves of energy from somewhere and forced themselves back into contention. Tuncay Sanli, who often looks exhausted by halftime in his English Premier League forays for Middlesbrough, was a man possessed while Hamit Altintop was similarly tireless. But when Croatia midfielder Luka Modric seized on Rustu Recber's error to set up Klasnic to score, the Turks could have been forgiven for thinking their day was done. They kept going, though, as they always do. The clock had ticked beyond the allocated extra minute when Rustu, with what he must have imagined would be the last kick of his 14-year, 117-match international career, sent a clearance 70 metres down the pitch. Two Croatia defenders were underneath it and a clean header by either would have settled the issue. Emre Asik, however, had other ideas as he forced his weary body into one final monumental leap that flattened both of them and allowed the ball to drop to the floor. Semih did not have time to wonder about his luck and lashed it into the net to breathe life into the dying team yet again. It was a body blow from which Croatia never recovered. While Terim quickly settled his team and began calmly organising his penalty takers, a furious Bilic was still complaining to officials about the extra minute and the fact that he had been unable to get his third substitute on. It was no surprise then that two of the first three Croatian penalties went wide as the Turks thumped theirs unerringly home. It was poetic justice that Rustu, recalled only because of Volkan Demirel's suspension, should spark the celebrations by saving from Mladen Petric to secure the 3-1 shootout victory
