<TITLE> Dramatic late goals no accident says UEFA's Roxburgh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Late goals that have turned around matches at Euro 2008 are no accident but the result of coaches making bold use of substitutions, UEFA's technical director Andy Roxburgh said on Monday. Roxburgh, who watched all 16 teams in the tournament, said other trends had also been noted such as swift counter-attacking play and ploys to defend against being caught on the break. But he added: "When we talk about trends and developments you can't take one 31-game tournament in isolation, you look at the World Cup, the Champions League and the European Championship. "These three competitions are the benchmark for trends in the game. "What we are seeing in the Champions League, and also here, is people keeping their gunpowder dry. Coaches are changing things late on to influence the outcome. "We saw it in the Champions League and we are seeing it here, their decisions are having an enormous influence in the last 10 to 15 minutes and this is producing the late drama." Roxburgh said that seven goals have been scored in stoppage time added on for injuries at the end of 90 minutes and that the late goals are naturally producing plenty of dramatic matches. TURKEY DRAMA "It has been a very good championship, and we have had plenty of drama. The matches here are easily on a par with the top Champions League games." As well as the late goals, he said another emerging trend from both the last World Cup and the Champions League was counter-attackingand how teams defend against it. "You have the classic counter coming from the back but also from midfield areas, a kind of collective counter where they win it in midfield and a group of players break at speed, catching out defenders. "One of the trends too, is countering the counter-attack, and this is where you now get screening players, one sometimes two. "You are now seeing teams, even when they are in possession, keeping four or five players behind the ball. The best teams are now trying to exploit the space when it is there, when it opens up, by playing a high intensity game, running at pace." He said one surprising aspect so far was that of the 68 goals scored, only one had come from a direct free-kick: Michael Ballack's thunderbolt against Austria in their final Group B match in Vienna last Monday. "Less than 25 percent of goals have come from set pieces, even less when you take penalties away. Perhaps defences are becoming clever and not giving so many free kicks away in dangerous areas," said the Scotsman
