<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh look to ease to Asia Cup's second round berth when they take on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Tuesday in one of two tournament openers at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. A win against the ICC associate member will not only confirm the Tigers' second round berth but also put an end to their seven-ODI losing streak and do their confidence a world of good before the crucial encounter against favourites Sri Lanka on June 25. The Tigers have remained winless since their last hurrah against another ICC associate member, Ireland, in March this year at home. They managed only three wins against minnows Ireland out of 24 ODIs they had played after their historic triumph against South Africa in 2007 ICC World Cup in the West Indies. No doubt Bangladesh will have the upper hand against the UAE, but they were not taking the opponents lightly, a fact evident in the words of Bangladesh coach Jaime Siddons. "If we play to our ability then we should be too strong for them (UAE)," Siddons was quoted by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as saying. "We have to be mindful of the fact though that they would also go out there trying to win. We want to get past UAE and then plan for the next opponent," said the Australian coach. Captain Mohammad Ashraful was also confident of winning the match against UAE, which is comprised of mostly Pakistan and India-born cricketers. "We'll take it one game at a time. We are definitely stronger than UAE and we know that a win on Tuesday would take us into the next round. We are very confident," Ashraful was quoted as saying. However, there was no complacency in the Bangladesh camp, as the UAE have players who have the ability to turn the match in their favour. It was the UAE, who made Bangladesh's mission tough to qualify for the ICC World Cup after handing them a six-wicket defeat in the group-stage match of the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya. In the second round, Bangladesh were routed by Kenya and Netherlands to be thrown away from the title race. "We don't have footage of them. We have some statistics and we'll try and get an idea of how they go about playing," said Siddons. Gaddafi Stadium has been a batting paradise of sorts for all teams with an average of 5.7 runs scored per over in ODIs since 1978. For Bangladesh most recent memories have also been encouraging as they racked up 285/7 runs in their April tour of Pakistan, but folded for 129 runs, chasing Pakistan's imposing 322/5. The Tigers had a skills training in evening under the floodlights at the Gaddafi Stadium. b
