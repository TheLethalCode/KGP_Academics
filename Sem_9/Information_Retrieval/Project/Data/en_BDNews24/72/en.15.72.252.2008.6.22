 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has taken brief programmes as it did last year because of the state of emergency to observe the 59th founding anniversary of the party Monday. The anniversary is going to be observed in the absence of party president Sheikh Hasina. The central leaders will lay wreaths at the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in front of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi at 8am. Another party delegation will pay their respects to Bangabandhu at his grave at Tungipara in Gopalganj. A discussion will be held at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB) at 3pm Wednesday. The then East Pakistan Awami Muslim League was established through a conference of a faction of the then Bengal Provincial Muslim League led by Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashim at Rose Garden at KM Das Lane of Tikatuli in Dhaka on June 23, 1949. In course of practising secularism and absorbing the spirit of non-communalism, the party later shed the word "Muslim". The founding anniversary of the Awami League is observed on June 23 every year. bdnew
