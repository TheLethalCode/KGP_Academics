 MADRID, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona president Joan Laporta faces a confidence vote from club members on July 6, the Primera Liga side said in a statement on Wednesday. The referendum was forced by member Oriol Giralt after he collected more than 9,000 signatures in favour of the motion. The Barcelona president has been heavily criticised for the way he has run the club in the past two seasons with fans staging several protests calling for his resignation after the team failed to win any silverware for a second year in succession. The club has responded by sacking coach Frank Rijkaard and appointing ex-captain and Nou Camp favourite Pep Guardiola as his replacement. In an attempt to revitalise the squad, they have signed former youth team player Gerard Pique from Manchester United, Mali midfielder Seydou Keita from Sevilla, and Uruguay centre back Martin Caceres from Villarreal. A deal for Sevilla's Brazil fullback Daniel Alves has been agreed in principle, according to the player, but not yet completed. Guardiola said at his presentation on Tuesday that Ronaldinho, Deco and Samuel Eto'o formed no part of the club's future plans. Laporta's opponents need the support of more than two-thirds of voters with a minimum turnout of 10 percent of members entitled to vote, if they are to force a presidential election
