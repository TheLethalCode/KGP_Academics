 LEOGANG, Austria, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia players who have thrust themselves into the Euro 2008 spotlight by grabbing a quarter-final place could catch the eye of some top clubs, coach Guus Hiddink said on Thursday. Only one of the 23-man squad, Ivan Saenko of German side Nuremberg, plays his club football abroad. With their attractive attacking style of play, Russia brushed aside Sweden 2-0 on Wednesday in their final Group D match to set up a last-eight encounter with Hiddink's native Netherlands at the St Jakob Park stadium on Saturday. Playmaker Andrei Arshavin's creative touch and pace has led to speculation he could leave Zenit St Petersburg, whom he helped win the UEFA Cup last season, and he has been linked with possible moves to various English Premier League clubs. Others who have performed well include striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, who has scored twice and looked dangerous on many other occasions, and midfielder Konstantin Zyryanov who has worked tirelessly and unselfishly to set up others. Asked if their good showing here could see some of Russia's players signed by big clubs, Hiddink told reporters: "It's up to the clubs, it's up to the Russian clubs and the players too. "But many players have proven they are capable of playing on a high, high level." Hiddink said he was pleased to have achieved the target he set before the finals of making the knockout phase but now it was time to set the bar even higher. "We have reached our goal, which was not easy, which was to qualify for the quarter-finals but we are not satisfied with that because I want Russian football and the Russian team to make its progress step by step," Hiddink said. "Now we are going to look for the next step." He said he was looking forward to Saturday's match in Basel against another team that has an exciting style of play. "It's an interesting match," he said. "I have worked with several of them (Dutch players). It's a clash between two nations who like to play football.
