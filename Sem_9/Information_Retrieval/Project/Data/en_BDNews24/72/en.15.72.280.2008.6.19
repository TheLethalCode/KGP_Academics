 BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's players were unhappy with the spectators who jeered coach Dunga and the team during the 0-0 World Cup qualifying draw with Argentina on Wednesday. Frustrated by their side's performance, the 52,000 fans at the Mineirao stadium also applauded Argentina's Lionel Messi when he was substituted in stoppage-time. "The Brazilian supporters need to give encouragement," defender Gilberto told reporters. "But Argentina come to play in Brazil and the Brazilian supporters applaud Messi. "When Messi went off there were 40,000 people applauding him." "I feel bad because I left my wife and two daughters at home and came here and did my best. Maybe I didn't play well and we didn't win but it's very bad to hear them booing the Brazil coach. "When we're playing at home, we need the support of the fans. It's a cultural thing. When you play in Paraguay, everyone is supporting Paraguay." Striker Luis Fabiano said: "It's unpleasant for us, we want to do our best and some people come here and jeer." Dunga said he was not bothererd about being insulted but wanted encouargement for the team. "It's normal for there to be pressure," he told reporters. "The public wants to win, there was a party before the game but we had a game to play against tough opposition." "They can insult me, but the booing started at a moment in the game when the players most needed their encouragement.
