<TEXT>
 Sujoy Dhar KOLKATA, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of people queued up in the Darjeeling hills on Monday as the Gorkha community, pressing its demand for autonomy, began a massive recruitment drive. Gorkhas, who are ethnic Nepalis, called an indefinite strike in the region on June 10 and are demanding a separate state of "Gorkhaland" be carved out of West Bengal to protect their culture and heritage. The strike has badly hit the tourism and the tea industry, two mainstays of the local economy. A tea industry official has warned exports of premium Darjeeling tea could fall 20-25 percent this year. On Sunday the Gorkhas relaxed the strike for two days to allow people to stock up rations and join the enlisting drive. Hundreds have so far braved a steady drizzle and cold weather to throng a stadium and get their names registered. "I have come to join the force because we want Gorkhaland," Gitika Gurung, a 23-year-old woman said. "I am not here for money, but for a separate state which we will realise at any cost," said Gurung, who queued up with others. At least 1,200 people died in the first Gorkhaland campaign in the 1980s, but protests ended a few years later after Gorkha leaders accepted limited autonomy. This time around Gorkha leaders insist their campaign will be peaceful, but police and intelligence officials were sceptical. "So far they have said the men and women will act as volunteers in the hills, but we are closely watching their every move," Raj Kanojia, a top Indian police officer, told Reuters from Kolkata. At least 2,000 men and women will be recruited in the next few days and they will undergo martial arts training, with some allowed to carry kukris, a traditional knife, Binoy Tamang, a Gorkha leader said. "We are strictly following rules applied by the army, while taking in volunteers," Tamang added. The Gorkha population in West Bengal is around one million out of 80 million people, although the overwhelming majority are concentrated in Darjeeling.
