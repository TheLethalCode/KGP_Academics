<TEXT>
 INNSBRUCK, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's streetwise football was enough to beat Sweden 2-0 and reach the Euro 2008 quarter-finals but they need to convert more of their chances to make real progress, coach Guus Hiddink said on Wednesday. Russia, who now face Netherlands on Saturday, dominated from the off in their final Group D match and had plenty of opportunities to make the victory more emphatic. "The only criticism you can makeis that we don't score enough with the opportunities we have," Hiddink told a news conference. "Nevertheless I think this team has made tremendous progress. They were so committedit was what we call adult and more streetwise football." He said his young players had come on leaps and bounds since what he branded a naive display in their opening 4-1 defeat by Spain, when their eagerness to attack left them repeatedly exposed at the back. "Flight or fight, it's the choice we offered (the players)  they chose to fight," he said. The Dutchman said he was looking forward to facing his fellow countrymen on Saturday, although he wished his team had had as long as Netherlands to prepare for the match. Netherlands were able to field a second-string side in their final Group C game against Romania on Tuesday, having already qualified. "It's a special game, I know the players, I know the coachso it's special. It will be an exciting clash," he said. "It is very difficult for our team, it may be our problem that we have two days to prepare. We don't have 23 players who can replace each other." Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game in Basel, Hiddink said this tournament had already been a triumph. "It's already a success, if you see where Russia has come from, if you see the FIFA and UEFA rankings from a year ago or two years ago it means that we are coming up," he said. "I am very proud of the team for the achievement of tonight.
