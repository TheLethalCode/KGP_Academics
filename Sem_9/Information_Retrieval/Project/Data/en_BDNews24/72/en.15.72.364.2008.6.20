 KARACHI, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif arrived home on Friday after Dubai prosecutors dropped charges against him of possession of an illegal drug. Asif, who spent 19 days in detention in Dubai, returned to Karachi and caught a connecting flight to Lahore where the Pakistan Cricket Board headquarters are located. The PCB said in a statement that the attorney general of Dubai had issued instructions to release Asif and send him back to Pakistan. "The PCB welcomes this decision and is relieved this ordeal is over. We appreciate the professional manner in which this whole issue was dealt with by the Dubai Police prosecution department and the UAE authorities," the statement said. Asif, who has played 11 tests, was detained on June 1 while returning from India after playing in the Indian Premier League. Authorities found him to be in possession of a small quantity of contraband which was later found to be a recreational drug. The PCB still intends to conduct an internal inquiry into the matter. "As soon as we get the detailed reports about the case from Dubai authorities we will hold our own internal inquiry," an official told Reuters. The official said the drug tests conducted on Asif after his detention were clear. "But we will have to see why he got into this mess in the first place," he added. Asif's release came two days after a Senate committee on sport asked the President and Prime Minister to intervene. Asif, 25, has also played 31 one-day internationals and had just returned to fitness after six months out with an elbow injury when he was detained in Duba
