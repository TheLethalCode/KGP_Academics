 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.comAwami League has demanded the withdrawal of the schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities, announced by the Election Commission Friday. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman, speaking reporters at his residence after the EC's announcement, called the schedule a "farce". "We think the Election Commission's announcement of a local polls schedule is a conspiracy. The announcement is not right. The government has acted against the public opinion," said the AL leader. "We want to make it clear that no election can be held amidst a state of emergency," Zillur said, urging the Election Commission to "withdraw" the schedule announcement. Asked whether Awami League would participate in the local elections, however, Zillur said: "We will act according to the situation." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said of the announced polls schedule: "Its consequence will not be good." "A free, fair and acceptable to all election can not be held amid a state of emergency," he also said. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had earlier in the day announced the election schedule at a press briefing at the Election Commission, giving August 4 as the simultaneous voting date in the four city corporation and nine municipalities. The government at the same time announced a relax on the ban of processions, rallies and meetings in the poll areas to ease candiadate's campaigning activities. bdnews
