<TITLE> Frings fit for Germany's game against Turkey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Torsten Frings has recovered sufficiently from a fractured rib and could return to the Germany team to face Turkey in Wednesday's Euro 2008 semi-final, coach Joachim Loew said on Monday. "I'm fortunate to be able to say that all 23 players trained today and are fit," Loew said at a news conference. "Torsten trained completely normally, but with a protective bandage. He said he had no major problems. He will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play, yes." Frings, one of Germany's most experienced midfielders, broke his rib in the 1-0 win over Austria in their final group game. That kept him out of the quarter-final against Portugal, when Loew changed his system to 4-5-1. Thomas Hitzlsperger and Simon Rolfes stepped in with excellent performances in the centre of midfield and if Frings is indeed fit the coach will be faced with a tricky decision over his lineup for the semi-final in Basel. "Frings is an important player and could return but, you know, we also say you should never change a winning team. I haven't put my mind to the lineup yet," said Loew
