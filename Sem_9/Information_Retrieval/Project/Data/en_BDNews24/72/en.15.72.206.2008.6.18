 MUMBAI, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth has been asked by the national cricket board to explain an altercation he had with the staff of a Bangalore hotel during the weekend. Domestic media reported Sreesanth, out of this month's Asia Cup due to injury, got into an argument at the hotel where he was staying to attend a camp at the national cricket academy. "We have written to Sreesanth and the hotel management seeking details about what exactly happened," the board's chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty told Reuters on Wednesday. The player shifted to another hotel the following day. An executive at the hotel confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday the incident involving Sreesanth took place and that he had lodged a complaint against the player with his supervisor. Sreesanth could not be reached for his comments. Last month, the board warned Sreesanth to improve his behaviour following an incident where he was slapped by India team mate Harbhajan Singh at the end of a domestic Twenty20 league game. Off-spinner Harbhajan was banned for the rest of the league games and then suspended for five one-dayers
