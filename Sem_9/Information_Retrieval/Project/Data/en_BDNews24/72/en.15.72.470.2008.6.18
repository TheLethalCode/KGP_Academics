 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Forensic experts said in an autopsy report Wednesday that Bangabazar shop employee Aminul Islam Rana had died from torture. Shop employees at Bangabazar in Old Dhaka took to the streets on Monday over the death of Rana, allegedly in the hands of his employer. Police launched a hunt for Kalam, owner SK Traders, who was blamed for his role in the death of Rana. The body was exhumed Tuesday for an autopsy in the wake of allegations from his family and colleagues that Rana had been tortured to death. A board was formed Wednesday with three teachers of the forensic department of Dhaka Medical College. They are the forensic department's chief Dr Mizanul Haque, assistant professor Dr Zobaidur Rahman and senior lecturer Dr Rafiqul Bari. "Torture marks were found on the body of Rana," a member of the board told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. The 37-year-old employee of clothes store SK Traders at Annex Tower died in "unclear circumstances" Sunday, which prompted the shop employees to launch protests. A murder case has been recorded, Shahbag police chief Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com. bdnews
