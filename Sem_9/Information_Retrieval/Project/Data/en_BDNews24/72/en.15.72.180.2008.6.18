 BEIJING, Wed Jun 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's heir-apparent Xi Jinping told North Korea's leader on Wednesday the country had a new opportunity to resume stalled talks on nuclear disarmament, Chinese state media reported. Xi's June 17-19 visit to Pyongyang is his first trip abroad as vice president and is aimed at shoring up ties with China's difficult and isolated neighbor. It is the latest diplomatic effort toward restarting the six-party talks that Beijing hosts and that include the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia. "Presently, the six-party talks are facing an opportunity to overcome temporary difficulties and again move forward," Xi told North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, according to Chinese state television. Xi is seen as the most likely successor to President Hu Jintao, and making North Korea the first country he visits since taking up the vice presidency in March shows the importance China attaches to relations with its old Communist ally. "We hope the parties can continue to act correspondingly and make joint efforts to implement the second phase actions in a comprehensive and balanced manner to push forward the six-party talks to a new phase," Xi said. Under an agreement reached at during the six-way talks, North Korea, which tested a nuclear device in 2006, has shuttered the Yongbyon plant at the heart of its atomic program. But completing the next phase of the agreement demands it disable the Yongbyon nuclear complex and declare all of its nuclear activities, steps that have been frustrated by Pyongyang's failure to provide the promised declaration. Kim gave no hint on the chances for renewed talks, saying only that the six countries had reached some "important consensus" despite twists and turns, and telling Xi that he appreciated China's role. In another effort at breathing life into the deal, US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, Washington's envoy to the talks, is to holds talks in Japan with Japanese and South Korean officials on Thursday, before traveling to China on Friday for consultations. After North Korea, Xi visits Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen
