 BASEL, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Guus Hiddink said Russia still had room for improvement after they outclassed Netherlands 3-1 on Saturday to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2008. "The players are still going through a process of improvement," Dutchman Hiddink told a news conference after their convincing extra time victory. "They are young players but it's amazing they have learned the tactics of international soccer so quickly," he added. "They are very coachable and very keen and they have the quality." Hiddink said he was "extremely proud" of their win, especially considering they had only full two days to recover after playing Sweden in their final Group D game on Wednesday. "We had almost no time to prepare tactically," Hiddink said. "But we were better than our opponents in every area of the game tonight, technically, tactically and physically," he added. As for criticism of Russia's performance, Hiddink said his players had committed too many unnecessary fouls and could have shown better finishing. "We didn't defend well against the only weapon the Dutch had which was their free kicks," he said. "We also found it easy to make the combinations in defence and midfield but were unable to finish the moves off. We had a lot of chances to decide the match earlier." Russia's semi-final on Thursday in Vienna will be against either world champions Italy or Spain, who meet in the last quarter-final on Sunday in the Austrian capital
