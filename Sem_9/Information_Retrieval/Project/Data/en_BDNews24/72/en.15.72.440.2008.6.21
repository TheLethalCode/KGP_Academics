 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com) The liquidity crisis has prevented businessmen from investing in new projects, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry said Saturday in an observation, discounted by the finance adviser. "Banks are not disbursing loans. Even a syndicate of banks could not pay a loan of Tk 50 crore," FBCCI president Annisul Huq said at a discussion meeting, organised by the Economic Reporters Forum at the National Press Club. The chief of the country's apex trade body urged the central bank to open an investigation to find out if banknotes with Tk 500 denomination had been stockpiled in "border areas". Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam denied the allegations and rejected the proposal for an investigation. "Banks have more than Tk 12,000 crore lying idle," the adviser said. The banks might have refrained from paying loans to particular entrepreneurs for faults with the projects, he added. "Reviewing the latest data of Bangladesh Bank, I have found that there is Tk 12,000 crore in different banks. The call-money rate was between 10 percent and 12 percent. Neither Bangladesh Bank nor any other bank informed the government about the liquidity crisis." Mirza Aziz asked businessmen to raise funds from the capital market if banks refuse to pay. "Why do industrialists and entrepreneurs run only to banks for money? Why don't they raise money from the capital market?" the adviser said. The adviser said the government would however consider demands of businessmen relating to the budget. Annisul Huq claimed that he had not received loans from a bank for a new project despite several requests. "I was told that the bank did not have money. I then checked with other banks and came to know that even the banks' syndicate cannot pay Tk 50 crore in loan." The business leader said the government's target of mobilising about Tk 14,000 crore from the banking sector to finance the budget deficit would hurt investment in the private sector. The adviser opposed it. "There is nothing to worry about it." Huq said: "It will slow the credit flow to the private sector, reduce investment and affect the economy." Mirza Aziz came down hard on businessmen on their demand to cut duty. "Businessmen demanded further duty cuts on raw materials on the excuse of higher prices on the global market, but never say a word about the price hikes of the products they produce out of the raw materials," he said. The adviser said he had proposed to cut import duty on raw materials in the budget for fiscal 2008-09. A four-tier duty structure was proposed in line with businessmen's proposals. It was not possible for the government to persistently subsidies a particular industry, the adviser said. "If the government continues to subsidise a sector already developed, new industries will not develop." bdnews
