 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)Leaders of the two major political parties, opposed to any polls ahead of national elections, greeted the Election Commission's announcement of a polls schedule for city corporations and municipalities with protest on Friday. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain termed the EC's local government election schedule "impulsive" and "unconstitutional", while Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman, it a "farce" and a "conspiracy". BNP's acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The secretary general on behalf of the four-party alliance has rejected the announcement of the schedule." "[Khandaker Delwar Hossain] has called it an impulsive decision. Not only that, he said it is unconstitutional, motivated and part of an ill-design." Awami League reacted with immediate demands for withdrawal of the schedule. Speaking to reporters at his residence after the EC's announcement, Zillur Rahman called it "a farce". The party's "We think the Election Commission's announcement of a local polls schedule is a conspiracy. The announcement is not right. The government has acted against the public opinion," he said. "We want to make it clear that no election can be held amidst a state of emergency," Zillur said, urging the Election Commission to "withdraw" the schedule announcement. Asked whether Awami League would participate in the local elections, however, Zillur said: "We will act according to the situation." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said of the announced polls schedule: "Its consequence will not be good. A free, fair and acceptable to all election can not be held amid a state of emergency." The four-party alliance led by BNP's Delwar faction had already, prior to Friday, declared a countrywide protest programme to be held on June 30. Ahead of the EC's announcement on the day, Delwar again sounded a warning to the government against holding local government polls before the national election. The government and the Election Commission would be responsible for any unexpected situation in the country in the wake of the announcement of local government polls schedule before the national polls, he said. "No election should be allowed before the parliamentary election," said the Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had earlier in the day announced the election schedule at a press briefing at the Election Commission, giving August 4 as the simultaneous voting date in the four city corporation and nine municipalities. The government at the same time announced a relax on the ban of processions, rallies and meetings in the poll areas to ease candidate's campaigning activities. Other political parties and leaders were more cautious in their stance on the local polls announcement. The Communist Party of Bangladesh and Workers Party said that their participation in the announced polls would be decided after discussions with their own and like-minded parties. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan told bdnews24.com: "This schedule should have been announced much earlier. The government has delayed." "We consider this election important. However, it has to be kept in mind that the national election must not be delayed under any circumstances," said Manzurul. Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said: "We think the national election should be held before any other." Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president Prof Badruddoza Chowdhury has termed the relaxation of emergency powers rules in the four city corporation and nine municipality areas for a period leading up to local elections "a good sign". However, he added, it would be better if the state of emergency were completely withdrawn. He told bdnews24.com, after the Election Commission's and government's announcements regarding the local polls: "If the other political parties participate in the local government election, Bikalpadhara will do so also." bdnews24.com
