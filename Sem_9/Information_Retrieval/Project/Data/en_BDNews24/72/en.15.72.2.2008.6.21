 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  Low-lying areas off the Teesta river went under water after India opened the Gojal Doba barrage in the upstream, Water Development Board officials said Saturday. The WDB's flood forecasting and warning centre (FFWC) said though the river waters had risen at several points there was no flood situation anywhere in the country. River waters increased at 57 of the 75 monitoring points, but remained static at one. Duty officer Md Ariful Islam of FFWC told bdnews24.com the lower areas off the Teesta had been inundated as India suddenly opened Gojal Doba barrage. Water started swelling from Friday night and Teesta waters crossed the danger mark at Dalia point Saturday morning. He said the water would start receding by Saturday afternoon. The water in rivers of India rose due to monsoon rains for the last few days. In the Brahmaputra basin the water of Teesta rose by 68 centimetres at Dalia point and was flowing 37 cm above danger level, according to FFWC statistics. The Dharla waters rose by 42 cm at Kurigram. The waters of Brahmaputra and the Jamuna recorded rise at different points. The Dhaleswari swelled by 14 cm at Rikabibazar while the Surma rose by 76 cm at Kanaighat, 38 cm at Sylhet and 39 cm at Sunamganj. WDB officials said the swelling rivers eroded land at several points, forcing authorities to use sand bags and concrete blocks to prevent erosion. bdnews
