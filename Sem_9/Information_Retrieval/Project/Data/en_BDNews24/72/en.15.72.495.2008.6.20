 LAHORE, Pakistan, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Partners in Pakistan's ruling coalition led by the party of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto failed on Friday to agree on a strategy to remove President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf, a major U.S. ally who seized power as army chief in 1999, has seen his authority wane since his allies were trounced by Bhutto's party and the party of another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in a February general election. The two parties formed a coalition, raising prospects that the unpopular Musharraf would soon be out of office, either forced to resign or impeached, but the parties have failed to agree on a strategy. "We don't have complete understanding between us," Khawaja Mohammad Asif, a close aide to Sharif, told reporters after the latest talks between Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and political successor who leads her party. "One or two more rounds of talks will be held to narrow down the differences," he said. The question of Musharraf's fate, and a related issue of the restoration of judges he dismissed last year, has preoccupied the fragile coalition despite growing economic difficulties and the threat of militant violence. Uncertainty over Musharraf's fate and prospects for coalition and the economy has undermined investor confidence and Pakistani shares fell 1.8 percent on Friday to a more than a 14-month low. Zardari has been reluctant to confront the unpopular Musharraf, which could lead to more turmoil in the nuclear-armed country. The United States fears instability in Pakistan, a partner in the war on terrorism whose support is crucial to NATO efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. DIGNIFIED EXIT Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in 1999, wants to see Musharraf impeached, and has even raised the possibility of him being hanged for treason. Zardari says he considers Musharraf an unconstitutional president but his party is trying to work out a dignified exit for him, hoping he steps down, party officials say. The Pakistan People's Party planned to replace Musharraf with its own candidate as president, Zardari said on Thursday. "The day is not far off when we will call upon a People's Party man to become the president of Pakistan," he told party activists in Lahore, but he did not say how Musharraf would be removed. Presidents in Pakistan are elected by members of the two houses of parliament and four provincial assemblies. Since the February election, the lower house and the provincial assemblies are dominated by parties opposed to Musharraf though his foes lack the numbers in parliament to impeach him. Musharraf's spokesman Rashid Qureshi declined to comment on Zardari's remarks but said the president had no plans to quit.
