 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Thu Jun 19, (bdnews24.conm/Reuters) - Afghan and NATO-led forces cleared out Taliban militants from the outskirts of Kandahar city on Thursday, killing or wounding hundreds of the insurgents, the provincial governor said. But a spokesman for NATO's Afghan force was more cautious, saying he could not confirm that hundreds of Taliban who infiltrated into the Arghandab district of orchards and farms had been driven out. Kandahar provincial governor Assadullah Khalid told a news conference the district just to the northwest of Kandahar city was clear. "The Taliban have been cleared totally from Arghandab district," Khalid said. "They have suffered hundreds of dead and wounded and many of their casualties are Pakistanis," he said, adding that troops were searching the area for militants who could be hiding in villagers' houses. Earlier on Thursday, NATO and Afghan forces attacked Taliban militants dug in around the district for the second day, in one of the biggest battles in Afghanistan in recent years. The offensive, which NATO said it expected to last until the weekend, is aimed at an estimated 600 Taliban fighters who had slipped into the valley, and comes days after the Taliban freed hundreds of their comrades from the main jail in Kandahar city. About 800 Afghan government troops, backed by hundreds of mainly Canadian NATO soldiers, are fighting the Taliban insurgents who seized seven villages in the district on Monday. On Wednesday, NATO helicopter gunships and troops had blasted Taliban positions in the valley. Many of the militants are believed to have been freed during the Taliban raid on the Kandahar jail last week. Analysts said the raid on the jail and the infiltration into Arghandab showed the Taliban were confident just as a steady toll of foreign troops killed and wounded led to more questions being raised in their home countries about the Afghan mission. "TACTICAL SUCCESS" A NATO spokesman said the alliance had not heard about the developments Khalid had reported. "I think he says that on the basis that there has been no engagement," said the spokesman, Captain Mike Finney. The Taliban could not be reached for comment. Earlier, a NATO spokesman could not confirm Afghan government accounts that dozens of militants had been killed. On Wednesday, the commander of NATO forces in south Afghanistan, Major-General Marc Lessard, said the infiltration of Taliban into Arghandab was a setback for NATO. "There are setbacks ... the prison breakout and the Arghandab operation, and there will be setbacks in the future," Lessard told Reuters in an interview. "They've definitely managed to achieve some kind of tactical success, there's no doubt there." A Taliban spokesman said before the assault started that the group had set its sights on Kandahar, the birthplace of the austere Islamic movement which seized the power in 1996 and was driven from power by U.S.-led forces in 2001. The al Qaeda-backed group has made a comeback since 2006 and is largely active in southern and eastern areas along the border with Pakistan where the militants have bases and support. Security has deteriorated despite the presence of about 60,000 foreign troops and about 150,000 government troops. The insurgents have been defeated every time they have tried to hold positions and defend against foreign forces and in response have stepped up suicide bomb attacks and ambushes. The commando-style attack on the Kandahar jail is seen as part of their guerrilla tactics. In January, the militants attacked a luxury hotel popular with Westerners in Kabul and in April they attacked a military parade as President Hamid Karzai was watching
