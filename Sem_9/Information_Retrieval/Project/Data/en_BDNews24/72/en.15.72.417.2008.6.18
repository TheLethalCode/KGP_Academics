<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 18 (dbnews24.com) -- The government will in future go for public-private partnership in setting up large capacity power plants, said a special aide Wednesday. The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources Prof M Tamim said: "We have almost finalised a policy paper for installing major power plants in public-private partnership." "The government will no longer go for setting up large capacity power plants alone," he said, addressing the seminar on 'Needs of Energy Producers and Government Perspective', organised by the International Business Forum Of Bangladesh (IBFB) at a city hotel. Tamim said the government was developing another policy paper on 'merchant power plants', which would allow anybody to produce power. "This is a kind of free market initiative. We will impose no restraints." The government will not interfere in the production and pricing of electricity, said Tamim. "The producers can import whatever fuel they want. We also allow local private entrepreneurs to rehabilitate old power plants." "We will open up the distribution system," said the special aide. "And we can guarantee the purchase of the power." On the gas sector, Tamim said: "We have been able to create a huge market for gas consumption. But over the last 10 years, there has been no drilling for gas." "We have to prioritise the supply of gas, especially for industry, CNG-run vehicles and fertiliser production." However, he added, not everybody needs subsidies. "Subsidies have to be gradually lifted. We are in the process of doing that. The government role is to serve the poor," Tamio said. "I believe the crisis of energy in our country is temporary. We have 20 years of energy security ahead of us," the special aide said. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed, Chevron managing director Steve Willson and Ajay Gandiani of Cairn also spoke. bdne
