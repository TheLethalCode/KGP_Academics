 MOSCOW, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia celebrated well into the night after its team unexpectedly reached the Euro 2008 semi-finals on Saturday with a thoroughly deserved 3-1 extra-time win over Netherlands. Thousands of Muscovites poured onto the streets within minutes of the final whistle in Basel where Russia, coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, stunned their much fancied opponents with a great display of attacking football. "We finally did it. Congratulations to everyone," yelled a young fan, wrapped in the Russian flag as he walked along the Manezh Square. Others praised Dutch-born Russian coach Hiddink. "Guus, Guus, Guus," the fans shouted into the warm night air. According to Moscow police, nearly 500,000 fans joined the celebrations. "In the city centre alone we had more than 200,000 people celebrating the Russian victory," a police spokesman was quoted as saying by Russian media. Russia President Dmitry Medvedev also congratulated the team on their superb win. "It was a great game and a great victory," the Kremlin press office quoted him as saying. The city centre came to a complete standstill as thousands of jubilant fans, waving national flags and yelling "Rossiya, Rossiya," blocked traffic along the main roads. Motorists honked their horns while some climbed on top of their cars and others set off fireworks. It is 20 years since Russia, who next play Spain or Italy, last reached the semi-finals of a major tournament. In 1988, as part of the Soviet Union, they made the European Championship final in Germany but lost 2-0 to the Dutch, whose current coach Marco van Basten was on the scoresheet. Thousands of riot police were on guard throughout Moscow on Saturday to keep the celebrations under control but there were no major disturbances or serious injuries reported
