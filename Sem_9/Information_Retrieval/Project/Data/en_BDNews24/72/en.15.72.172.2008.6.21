<TITLE> Bush didn't know about CIA leak: former spokesman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Andy Sullivan WASHINGTON, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush did not know about a White House effort to leak the identity of a CIA agent but tried to protect staffers who were involved in one of the biggest scandals of his administration, former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan told Congress on Friday. McClellan said he did not think Bush was involved in a 2003 effort to blow the cover of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, whose husband had accused the administration of twisting intelligence to justify the Iraq war. But Bush, through his chief of staff, ordered McClellan to tell reporters that White House staffers Karl Rove and Lewis "Scooter" Libby were not behind the leak, even though they both turned out to be involved, McClellan told the House Judiciary Committee. Vice President Dick Cheney's involvement in the leak might have been greater, McClellan said. "I do not think the president in any way had knowledge about it," McClellan told lawmakers. "In terms of the vice president, I do not know. There is a lot of suspicion there." McClellan, who was White House spokesman between 2003 and 2006, recently released a book that accuses the White House of conducting a propaganda campaign to make the case to invade Iraq. He says Libby and Rove deceived him about their role in the Plame leak. The book caused an uproar in Washington and raised new questions about whether Bush and Cheney directed staffers to smear war critics, like Plame's husband, and then block a subsequent investigation. That investigation ultimately led to a 2 1/2-year prison sentence for Cheney's top aide, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, on obstruction and perjury charges. Bush, who had promised to fire anyone in his administration found to have committed a crime during the leak, commuted Libby's sentence. "To those who would dismiss the significance of today's hearing, I'd say that concerns about possible obstruction of justice are not trivial and clearly warrant this committee's attention," said committee chairman John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat. Republicans and the White House have harshly criticized McClellan for writing the book and then discussing his conclusions in a series of TV appearances. White House spokesman Tony Fratto, traveling with Bush in Florida on Friday, dismissed McClellan's remarks. "I think Scott has probably told everyone everything he doesn't know, so I don't know if anyone should expect him to say anything new today," Fratto said. The hearing highlighted the former insider's pariah status. The committee's top Republican, Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, questioned McClellan's motives and said he had sold out Bush "for a few pieces of silver." That remark drew an objection from McClellan's attorney. Smith asked McClellan whether liberal publishers had sensationalized his book and come up with its title, "What Happened -- Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception." "Actually, this is my book. I wrote this book," McClellan said.
