 BASEL, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The strategy behind the Dutch team's spectacular form at Euro 2008 was hatched in a meeting between coach Marco van Basten and several senior players. Adopting a highly effective and organised 4-2-3-1 system, Van Basten's side swept through the group stages in stunning fashion with a 3-0 win over world champions Italy, a 4-1 romp over World Cup runners-up France and a 2-0 victory over Romania. The new strategy evolved at a meeting last year when Van Basten, goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and others agreed to abandon the 4-3-3 and 4-4-2 tactics that had been tried before. Van Basten now employs a regular back four of Khalid Boulahrouz, Andre Ooijer, Joris Mathijsen and Giovanni van Bronckhorst ahead of Van der Sar. Protecting the defence are holding pair Orlando Engelaar and Nigel de Jong, whose job it is to support the creative midfield trio of Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart and Dirk Kuyt or Robin van Persie. But the key to making the system work is the tireless Van Nistelrooy in attack. In the new formation the Real Madrid striker drops back deeper than before, links more closely with the creative trio, feeds the ball wide and yet is still as dangerous as ever in the penalty box. Long-term injuries to wingers Van Persie and Arjen Robben have also helped dictate the changes. Now, with Van Persie and Robben fit again and scoring at these finals, there is even more firepower in the Oranje armoury. PATCHED UP Van Nistelrooy's role developed when he patched up his differences with Van Basten and returned to the side last August after missing the previous 12 internationals. He has been re-installed as first-choice striker and, although he has scored only once in the tournament, he has worked diligently for the team. Van Basten's substitutions are also helping to pressurise opponents and keeping the counter-attacking momentum going. Against Italy, Van Persie and the talented 22-year-old creative midfielder Ibrahim Afellay came on. France faced Van Persie and Robben as substitutes, and both found the net. The Dutch also showed their strength in depth and adaptability against Group C rivals Romania on Tuesday. Despite making nine changes to the side that thumped France, Van Basten's men saw off the Romanians with plenty to spare. The Dutch may not be playing the 'Total Football' they showed the world for the first time in the 1970s but Van Basten and his boys are certainly making their title rivals sit up and take notice. Their supporters are also more than satisfied with the team widely regarded as championship favourites. According to a survey of 52,600 Dutch fans carried out by economists at ING Group, 58.5 percent said they believed the team could lift the trophy at the June 29 final in Vienna
