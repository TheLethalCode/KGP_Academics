 Dhaka, Jun 23 (bdnews24.com)Stocks continued to close downbeat Monday as panic-stricken investors were reluctant to bet money, according to market observers. An official of brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com that trading was very low. "Most small-scale investors either sold or did not trade at all, some large scale investors were however, buying in the wake of falling prices," added the official. Meanwhile, the country's twin bourses continued to witness a fall in turnover. Market analysts said that investors were still nervous about making any move, thus leading to lower transactions and trading. "Investors are hesitating to trade, and as a result, turnover and volume are falling," said investment consultant Bashir Ahmed who is with brokerage house Stocks & Bonds.
