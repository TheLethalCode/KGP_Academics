 VEVEY, Switzerland, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A decision on whether Raymond Domenech remains France coach after their group stage exit at Euro 2008 will be made on July 3, the French Football Federation (FFF) said on Wednesday. Domenech, whose side lost 2-0 to Italy on Tuesday to finish bottom of Group C with one point and one goal from three matches, said after the FFF announcement that his personal fate was not important. "It is necessary to take time to analyse the reasons and the consequences of France's early elimination and to sum up the work done (by Domenech) over the past four years," the FFF said in a statement. FFF president Jean-Pierre Escalettes will meet Domenech and the federation's technical director Gerard Houllier before giving his decision at a meeting of the ruling body on July 3. Though French media have called for Domenech to resign after his team's failure at Euro 2008, the 56-year-old would not be drawn when asked about his future. "I will not answer that question," he told a news conference. "My personal fate is not important. I try to do my job the best I can. The rest does not belong to me. "I believe this team have potential and have a future," he added. "As for my own situation, it doesn't bother me. It's the team I care about." WRONG MIX Domenech was appointed in the wake of France's quarter-final exit from Euro 2004 and guided the team to the 2006 World Cup final, which they lost to Italy on penalties. At Euro 2008, he failed to find the right mix between ageing stalwarts and promising youngsters and faces criticism of his tactical choices after France leaked six goals and scored just one. "The project is the 2010 World Cup but you can't build a team with just young players," he said. "You need older players to pass on their experience and to explain to the younger players what it means to play for France. "I accept that people will regard this as a failure and maybe I didn't send out the right message," he added. "I should have made clear that this tournament was a step towards 2010." If Domenech were to be axed, the favourite to replace him would be Didier Deschamps, the captain of France's 1998 World Cup-winning team, who was quoted a saying in a newspaper column this week he would be interested
