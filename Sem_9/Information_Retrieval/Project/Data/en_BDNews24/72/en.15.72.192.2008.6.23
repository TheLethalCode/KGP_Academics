 BAGHDAD, Mon Jun 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's prime minister pledged to maintain law and order in the southern city of Amara on Monday, days after a security crackdown that the movement of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said unfairly targeted them. Iraqi forces have taken control of Amara and the surrounding province of Maysan, seizing heavy weapons and arresting wanted men in an operation aimed at stamping government authority on an area where Shia militias had exerted considerable influence. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki toured Amara on Monday. "Military forces will not withdraw from (Amara) until we make sure the criminals and killers can never come back again," Maliki told local tribal leaders in a speech broadcast live on Iraqiya state television from Amara. "We will not stop using force against those who revolt against the will of the nation." Maliki was expected to meet security leaders in Amara to get an update on the operation, which was launched last Thursday. Security forces have met no resistance from Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, which was under orders from the cleric to cooperate. Many residents have said they feel safer since the offensive involving thousands of Iraqi soldiers got under way. But followers of the anti-American Sadr say they were singled out. Amara's mayor Rafea Abdul-Jabbar, a Sadr supporter, was detained, along with other officials with ties to Sadr's movement
