 TBILISI, Wed Jun 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia said on Wednesday it had released four Russian peacekeeping troops detained a day earlier near its breakaway region of Abkhazia on suspicion of transporting weapons without proper documents. Georgian officials said on Tuesday they had detained 14 Russian peacekeepers but later revised the figure to four. Russia has had peacekeeping troops in Abkhazia since the end of a separatist war in the 1990s and the region is a source of friction between the two countries. "Last night, after interrogation, all four Russian peacekeepers were freed," Shota Utiashvili, head of the analytical department of Georgia's Interior Ministry, told Reuters. "We also plan to give the Russians back their truck. But the weapons will remain here until an investigation is complete and after that we will decide what to do with them," he said. Russia's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday its peacekeepers were carrying the necessary documents and their detention was unlawful. It demanded the return of the vehicle and ammunition. On Tuesday, Georgian television showed police scuffling with armed Russian soldiers after stopping their convoy, then wrestling them into waiting jeeps. Moscow alleges Tbilisi has been preparing to attack Abkhazia but Georgia's pro-Western government, which has been promised eventual NATO membership, says it has no such plan and accuses Moscow of trying to annex the region
