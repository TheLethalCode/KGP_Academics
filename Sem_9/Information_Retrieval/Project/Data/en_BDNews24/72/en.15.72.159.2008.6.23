 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League is commemorating its founding anniversary for the second time under the ongoing state of emergency. The party began its 59th anniversary programme by placing floral wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in front of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the city's Dhanmondi area. The AL is observing the day solemnly, seeing many challenges ahead in the run up to the national polls and with its party chief Sheikh Hasina being seeking medical treatment abroad. After the party's senior leaders led by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury laid their wreaths, its front organisations did the same. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam recalled the contributions of Bangabandhu and the people who sacrificed their lives for freedom and democracy, saying: "The nation's hopes and aspirations hinge on this party and we must go forward to realise that." In reply to a question, Ashraful said that the people would not like to see a recurrence of 1/11 in the country. Asked if he thought political parties have failed to fulfil the people's aspirations, Ashraf said: "I don't think so." "It was always political parties that strengthened and guided people in foiling the tyrannical designs to perpetuate in power." The party's senior leaders will later visit Tungipara to pay homage to the memory of Bangabandhu. bdnews24.com/
