 BASEL, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA general secretary David Taylor praised the players and coaches for their sporting attitude in Euro 2008 on Thursday despite the fiercely competitive nature of their group phase matches. Only three players have been red carded in the opening 24 matches, although German coach Joachim Loew and his Austrian counterpart Josef Hickersberger were both sent to the stands for their behaviour when their sides met in Vienna on Monday. "I have been very pleased to see the way the players have been fiercely competitive but there have been no really major incidents of any significance and the general approach of players and coaches has been first class," Taylor said at a news conference on Thursday. "We are having a great tournament. We have seen some great games. We have had 24 matches and only one 0-0 draw. The football really has been entertaining. "First and foremost this is due to the attitude of the players. In high level competition the stakes are high but the players have shown respect for each other, the game and the referees. BETTER ATTITUDE "Now there are always going to be incidents, we are never going to be clear and perfect in all of this but this tournament has been marked by a much better attitude all around. "We have to show the best of football, not just in terms of the quality of the game but in the way the game is played. "This is a special tournament and any of the last eight national teams can win it, and this is what gives this tournament its special appeal." Taylor also said the fan zones were continuing to be a great success and UEFA was delighted with the number of fans from eastern Europe who have travelled to Switzerland and Austria for the event. "The fans are mingling with each other, and perhaps this is something the club game could learn from. It is a very noticeable and a very welcome trend. Seeing signs like "Sweden loves Russia", "Sweden loves Greece2", these sorts of banners are very positive. "The numbers of fans coming from eastern Europe is a new development and a very positive one too.
