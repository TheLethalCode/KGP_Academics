<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer began his quest for a modern-era record sixth consecutive Wimbledon title with a 6-3 6-2 6-2 demolition of Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty on Monday. Federer, extending his unbeaten streak on grass to 60 matches, eased into the second round with a confident performance on Centre Court. The Swiss, with a morale-boosting tournament win on grass in Halle last week after a crushing French Open final defeat by Rafael Nadal earlier this month, was never extended by Hrbaty who battled hard but lacked the firepower to pressure the top seed. "As long as I pass the rounds I don't really mind if it's five or three sets. I really don't," Federer told reporters. "I did feel a little pressure about two minutes before I went on court. I felt like, wow, okay, here we go. Let's try to get off to a good start. I did, I don't think think I dropped a point in the first few games that was a great start." The top seed, who next faces big-serving Swede Robin Soderling, was in imperious form against an opponent who had won their only two previous encounters, the last four years ago on a hard court in Cincinnati. He is one of only three active players who boast a winning head-to head record against Federer. With a radiant sun beating down, Federer was swiftly into the groove, holding his first service game to love and racing into a 3-0 lead after winning the first 11 points against the rusty Slovak. Playing his first game on grass since last year's tournament after an injury-hit season and competing here under a protected ranking of 70, rather than his true one of 272 after undergoing elbow surgery, Hrbaty held serve at the second time of asking to sympathetic cheers. He earned one standing ovation for an audacious lob at full stretch that left Federer flailing but the champion was in no mood to let his flying start slip. Working his opponent around the court with a mix of precise groundstrokes, crisp volleys and a remorselessly-accurate serve, Federer was able to hit his stride back on a court that he has made his own. The Swiss was put under pressure for the only time in the seventh game, Hrbaty forcing three deuces but no break points, but held firm and took the opening set in 25 minutes. Fully into top gear, Federer raced away with the second set after breaking Hrbaty twice and, having barely broken sweat, had little trouble clinching the match for the loss of a further two games
