<TITLE> Van Basten's magic goal back in focus 20 years on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Netherlands meet Russia in Euro 2008 on Saturday, the Dutch coach will not be the only one nostalgically recalling one of the greatest moments in soccer history almost exactly 20 years ago. Marco van Basten will direct his team from the bench in Basel but in Munich in 1988, when the Dutch side he played in beat what was then the Soviet Union in the Euro final, he was on the pitch to score a goal many regard as the best ever. It was a magic moment when audacity, artistry and accuracy combined to create a thing of great beauty and wonder. It was THAT goal and it happened on June 25, 1988. The Dutch, spurred on by a crowd which seemed to be almost all attired in orange, were leading the Soviet team 1-0 when Van Basten struck early in the second half to kill the match for his team, steering them to the only major trophy they have ever won. Nine minutes after the break, Arnold Muhren sent over a looping cross from the left towards the big Dutch striker who was only a few yards from the goal line on the far side of the penalty area. With two defenders between him and the goal and Rinat Dasayev, widely regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world at the time, perfectly placed at the near post, Van Basten had only one obvious choiceto pass back to one of his team-mates. But, high on the confidence generated by a sublime hat-trick against England and a magnificent late winner to knock out hosts West Germany in the semi-finals, Van Basten had other ideas. He decided to attempt what looked impossible from such a narrow angle, striking a fearsome right-foot volley which rose like a missile over and out of Dasayev's reach and then dipped sharply to find the tightest of gaps between the crossbar and the far post. TOTAL DISBELIEF Those lucky enough to be in the Olympiastadion sat stunned and stared at each other in total disbelief for a second or two before a huge roar went up from the Dutch supporters. Van Basten himself seemed unaware of the magnitude of what he had done and the almost outrageous technique he had used to pull it off. "The excitement about the goal, I did not really understand it and what I did," he said. "You can see that in my reaction (at the time). I am asking 'What is happening'?" For him, it was the goal which granted him instant status as one of the greatest strikers of all time. Van Basten had started the tournament as a promising but unproven goalscorer, who had netted plenty in the Dutch league but who had struggled against injury and Italian defences in his first season with AC Milan. The Dutch lost their opening group game to the Soviet Union 1-0 and Van Basten, who came on as a second half substitute in that first game, was given the nod to start the next match against England. A magnificent hat-trick in which he totally humiliated the English defence in a 3-1 win made him a fixture in the national team from then on. "That was a very nice memory and a very important game for me, Holland and for my career", he said. Of the famous goal in the final, Van Basten recalls: "It was in the second half and I was a little tired. The ball came from Arnold Muhren and I was thinking, okay, I can stop it  or I can take a risk and shoot. "You know you need a lot of luck with a shot like that. Everything went well. It was one of those things that sometimes just happens." Or maybe the kind of luck that could only happen to a man with magic in his feet
