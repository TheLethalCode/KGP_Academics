 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government will not fight with the political parties over the elections to the local government bodies which it hopes to complete by October, education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday. "The government will not engage in any conflicts with the political parties over the elections; it will end holding all local polls within October," said Hossain Zillur after meeting with Ghulam Quader, the communication and public works adviser. The adviser said the government was ready to do anything to resolve any deadlock because of misunderstanding over any issue. "To create a congenial atmosphere prior to the national polls, the local government elections will be held, which will hopefully generate general trust and a sense of well-being across the country," said the education adviser. "Though the political parties will not be contesting the local government polls directly, the grass-roots leaders of different parties will run for the local government positionsat least that's how these polls pull through, (that's what) we've seen in the past." "These elections are not being held to enable any select people to assume any chosen chair at the local levels. The local polls should be quite transparent." Calling upon the political parties to participate in the forthcoming elections, Hossain Zillur said the polls would be held as per the 'democratisation roadmap' announced by the government Asked to comment on certain political parties vowing to boycott and resist the polls, the adviser said, "Well, I guess the government's efforts to dispel the negative culture of resisting (the democratic process) will see success through holding these elections." Asked if the emergency should be lifted soon, he said, "The emergency may be lifted in phases, which is the rational approach in this case." The adviser said the emergency rule had been relaxed at places on the eve of the local government polls and measures would be taken prior to the national polls. Asked why the government is taking so long to release former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her sons Tarique and Arafat Rahman from prison, Zillur said, "We're working on the legal tangles to handle the matter smoothly. Every piece will be fitting into the right slots in phases." On the regional dialogue , Zillur said, "The regional dialogues will be starting on June 28 in Chittagong, where two working sessions will be held with the rural and urban delegates. The chief adviser will attend both." He said some advisers would be travelling to Khagrachhari region on June 27 to consult with the smaller communities there and gather their perceptions on the state of affairs. Adviser Quader said, "Keeping in view the national elections to be held in December, all activities initiated should be conducted in a concerted manner." bdnews24.
