 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday assured teachers of schools and colleges with the government's monthly pay orders that they would get a 20 percent dearness allowance. An organisation of MPO teachers withdrew a protest programme following the adviser's assurance at a meeting. In his budget speech on June 9, the finance adviser proposed a 20 percent dearness allowance for government employees and pensioners, but did not specify whether MPO teachers would receive the same. "The teachers of MPO schools and colleges will get a 20 percent allowance along with government teachers and employees," the adviser told representatives of a teacher-employee group at a planning ministry meeting. "The proposed budget offered government employees a 20 percent dearness allowance. Confusion arose as there was no declaration for the teachers of private schools and colleges under MPO," said Mirza Aziz. Steps will be taken to meet other demands in discussion with related ministries, the adviser said. Chief coordinator of the National Teacher-Employee Front Kazi Faruk Ahmed, who led the representatives at the meeting, told reporters: "We have demanded the 20 percent dearness allowance for teachers of private educational institutions as well, because of soaring prices of essentials." "We have now withdrawn our movement programme following the assurance of the finance adviser." The representatives also placed 52 proposals to the government for the development of the standards of education in private schools and colleges. According to Faruk, the adviser assured that the demands would be discussed with related ministries. There are some five lakh teachers and employees of MPO schools and colleges in the country. bdnews24.c
