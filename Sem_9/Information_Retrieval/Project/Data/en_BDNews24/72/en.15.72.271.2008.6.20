 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  Three giants  Mohammedan Sporting Club, Brothers Union and Muktijoddha Sangsad  turned up Friday the closing day of the footballer transfers of the B. League, to complete formalities. It was reported that Mohammedan and Brothers were going to form strong sides for the title race of the second edition professional football league and they proved it Friday, but it was all but uncertain for Muktijoddha to form a team this time. However, Muktijoddha, the third finishers of the first edition professional league, got rid of the Dhaka Metropolis Muktijoddha Unit at the eleventh hour to form a mediocre team as most of the players left the freedom fighters' side to join the giants as the Central Unit was reluctant to form the team citing financial crisis. The black and white outfit, Mohammedan, formed a balanced squad roping in 15 players outside the tent and confirming their six old men. The players came to the Bangladesh Football Federation riding horse carts. The Motijheel-based outfit signed up Muktijoddha's goalie Aminul Haq, Ranaji Kanta Barman, Hasan Al Mamun, Arman Aziz and Maruf Ahmed along with Jewel Rana of Brothers Union, Mofazzal Hossain Saikat of Chittagong Mohammedan, Abdul Baten Komal of Fakirerpool, Mohammad Robin of Farashganj. Aminul Haq returned to his old outfit after 11 years as the country's number one goalkeeper started his career in 1994 playing in Mohammedan while former national skipper-cum-defender Hasan Al Mamun joined Mohammedan for the first time as he played for Muktijoddha Sangsad for last 10 years. "I think our side is a balanced side considering its goalkeeping and striking zone and I hope that we would be able to represent spirited game this time," said Mamun. Brothers Union, the fifth finishers in the inauguration B. League, have also formed a strong side with signing up Mohammedan's Jahid, Arif, Sheikh Russel's Zia, Shakik, Mishu, Rikto, Abahani's Abdullah Parvez, Muktijoddha's Motiur Munna and Mohammedan's strikers Manju and Farhad. The Gopibagh-based outfit, Brothers, also confirmed the services of their old men Shuvro, Masud Rana, Shakik, Liton Khan, Rezaul Karim Liton and Topu. They also roped in Farashganj's Ashraful, Akramuzzaman Liton, Arup, Roni Islam and Arambagh's Juku. "We have picked the best local players and I think we have formed a good side," said Brothers manager Amer Khan. Khan said that they were communicating with those foreign players who had played for them last season and believed that the latter would make the difference among the teams. Muktijoddha Sangsad signed up 15 players outside and confirmed their five old guys  Firoz Mahmud Titu, Rokonuzzaman Kanchan, Arifuzzaman Himel, Aziz Al Arman and Azmal Hossain Biddut. They also roped in Brothers' Nizam Mazumder, Shahinur Rahman Rony, Jalal Uddin, Mohammedan's Rezaul Karim Biplob, Masud Alam, Abdur Kaiyum Sentu, Walid Khan, Farashganj's SM Razib, Rahmatganj's Murad Ahmed Milon, Wari's Maksudur Rahman Mostak, Khulna Abahani's Moshiur Rahman Biplob, Tajul Khan, Asif Yousuf and Wanderers' Ashraful Islam. "Though Mukijoddha is suffering from financial crisis, we all have agreed to play for Muktijoddha to honour the freedom fighters," said defender Titu. "The officials told us they would try their best to pay, and would increase the remuneration if they could overcome the financial crisis," said Titu, who all but confirmed playing for Abahani Limited this season.
