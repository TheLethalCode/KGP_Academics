<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France winger Frank Ribery has backed coach Raymond Domenech, who has been widely criticised after their group stage exit from Euro 2008. "I think Domenech must not go. He must keep on working with this squad," he was quoted as saying in L'Equipe on Monday. "If some mistakes were made, Domenech was not alone. Frankly, I'd like him to stay," he added in the French daily. French media have been speculating about Domenech's future since France bowed out of Euro 2008 after finishing bottom of Group C with one point and one goal from three matches. Members of the 1998 World Cup-winning team have lobbied for their captain, Didier Deschamps, to be appointed France coach. Deschamps gained experience as a manager at Monaco and Juventus and is available after leaving the Serie A team in 2007. "It's true someone who could replace the current coach is clearly Didier Deschamps," former France playmaker Zinedine Zidane told a news conference in Vienna on Sunday. "He's got everything it takes. He knows the group, he knows football very well and I think it's quite in order for him, one day, to take over." However, like Ribery, several members of the current squad have defended their coach. "I'm rather in favour of stability. We must not throw everything out of the window," captain Patrick Vieira told French media last week. "The responsibility of what happened belongs to the players," added the midfielder, who did not pkay in the tournament because of a thigh injury. A decision on Domenech's fate should be taken when the French Federation board meets on July 3
