 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Police will ensure strict security measures during upcoming local government polls, the Inspector General of Police said Sunday. "Intelligence agencies are already busy collecting relevant information in the polling areas. Appropriate security measures will be put in place 15 to 20 days before the election day," IGP Noor Mohammad told reporters after a meeting with local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal at the latter's secretariat office. "The police have decided to deploy a three-phase security plan, for the pre-poll, polling and post-poll periods," he said. Replying to reporters' questions, Noor said: "I'm yet to receive any news of unrest anywhere; but we'll assuredly take immediate steps to quell any reported demonstration or riot." Asked if any more arrest drives will be launched ahead of the polls, the IGP said: "Necessary measures will be taken in case of any harassment taking place anywhere." Since the government has lifted the ban on holding meetings, rallies and processions in the designated election areas, the police will ensure that all such gatherings are held safely, he said The IGP said he did not expect that opposition by political parties against the holding of local polls would pose any serious law and order threat. bdnews24.
