 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League will decide in its presidium and central working committee meetings whether the party will take part in the city corporation polls, a senior leader said Monday. "A joint decision will be taken regarding the city corporation polls following meetings of the presidium on June 24 and central working committee on June 26," acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters. "The party is prepared for elections," Ashraful said after paying tribute at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at Dhanmondi's Road 32, to mark the party's founding anniversary. "We will discuss in the meetings how we can make the party stronger." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "We think no election will be acceptable to the people amid the state of emergency." "The central working committee will decide whether we will participate in the city corporation polls. The AL will resolve all problems jointly as it has before. " "The elections should be held after the withdrawal of the state of emergency. A proper election cannot be held amid the emergency," Tofail reiterated. He also said a congenial atmosphere for the elections should be created after withdrawing all cases against party president Sheikh Hasina. bdnews
