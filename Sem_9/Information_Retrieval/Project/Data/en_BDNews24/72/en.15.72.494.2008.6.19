 INNSBRUCK, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The return of playmaker Andrei Arshavin on Wednesday transformed Russia from a pedestrian and predictable Euro 2008 team into a slick-passing unit able to overwhelm Sweden with two superb goals. Few believed coach Guus Hiddink when he said he might not start with his deep-lying attacker due to a lack of match fitness after the inspirational Arshavin was forced to sit out the first two Group D games through suspension. But nobody could have envisaged what an impact the midfield schemer would make within minutes of joining the party as Russia beat Sweden 2-0 to set up a quarter-final with Netherlands. Operating in a productive no-man's land between Sweden's midfield and defence, Arshavin roamed left, right and centre, collecting the ball from deep, probing, passing and driving into the box with menace. His team mates, who looked flat in their first two games, seemed to be lifted by his presence and suddenly passes were zipping in and around the Swedish box with hitherto unseen zest. Midfielder Konstantin Zyryanov was everywhere while striker Roman Pavlyuchenko rediscovered the touch and confidence that destroyed England in qualifying but then deserted him to the point that Hiddink threatened to leave him at home. FIRST GOAL Both were involved in the first goal after 24 minutes, one of the best here so far, when Zyryanov and Alexander Anyukov neatly set up Pavlyuchenko to fire in a crisp first-time shot. Arshavin got the second just after the break when he ran 50 metres to finish off another sweeping move and, along with several of his team mates, should have scored again in the final quarter as Sweden's defence was punctured time and again. Suddenly, from looking like tournament makeweights, Russia were transformed into a team who look capable of giving any defence a grilling and the return of the number 10 was key. "Arshavin is a player who can decide very, very fast where he can create danger he can turn left, right, he knows where an opponent is so he is a very smart player," Hiddink said. "You can see he can make the difference, not for himself by the goal but for the other guys on the field. "We tried to play with him between their defensive line and their two defensive midfielders and he's very smart to play in that area because we knew from the analysis that the Swedish team was not covering there." The Dutch, who have been revelling in their own attacking performances, might pay now more attention to their defence in the next few days becauese Arshavin's presence means Saturday's showdown in Basel suddenly looks a lot more interesting
