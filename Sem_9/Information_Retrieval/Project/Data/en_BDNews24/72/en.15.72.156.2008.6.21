 vienna, june 20 (bdnews24.com/reuters)  VIENNA (Reuters) - Turkey beat Croatia 3-1 on penalties after their Euro 2008 quarter-final finished 1-1 following extra time on Friday. Turkey will meet Germany, who beat Portugal 3-2 on Thursday, in the first semi in Basel on Wednesday. Extra time had finished in dramatic fashion with two goals in the last minute. Ivan Klasnic headed Croatia in front at the near post after a good run and cross by Luka Modric in the 119th minute. But there was still time for comeback kings Turkey, who twice rallied from behind to win in the group stages, to equalize in breathtaking style as Semih Senturk scored with the last kick of the game. Croatia then made a mess of the penalty shootout, with Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic missing the target before Turkey's victory was clinched when Rustu Recber saved from Mladen Petric.

Niko Kranjcar then headed the rebound over to the anguish of the Croatian contingent of fans inside the noisy Ernst Happel Stadium, where several flares were lit during the game. Mehmet Topal sent a 30-metre piledriver just wide towards the end of the first period in a rare effort for the Turks. Croatia went close at the start of the second half when Gokhan Zan's weak back header let in Olic, who nodded over Rustu but failed to add the finishing touch with two defenders on the line. Olic had two more chances and Darijo Srna forced Rustu into two saves from free kicks late in the 90 minutes but Turkey hung on to take the game into extra time during which substitute Semih shot over and Tuncay Sanli fired narrowly wid
