<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 21 (bdnews24.com)  The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources M Tamim has said the government would try to tackle the issues affecting the construction industry. "We are passing through a crucial time at the moment. The prices of copper, aluminium and iron have gone up a lot. The price of the energy used for building construction materials has also increased. "The price of energy has increased by about 1,400 percent on the international market. It is normal that the impact of this will be heavily felt by a developing country like Bangladesh," Tamim said at the inauguration of "Construction Industry Exhibition" Saturday. "I'm sure the government will consider the problems of this sector. The government has already taken some steps in this regard. It has reduced the duty and allowed import. However, the price must be coordinated with the world market as the raw material comes from abroad." Tamim warned that this industry would die if the businessmen were greedy. All the stakeholders would need to play their role properly if the construction industry was to survive, he said. Acting president of Bangladesh Association of Construction Industries Nazrul Islam said, "The construction industry is facing problems. The government will have to try to keep the prices of all commodities including construction materials under control." Thirty-three organisations have set up 51 stalls at the exhibition to disseminate information about the construction industry. The show ends on June 23 and remains open from 10am to 9pm every day. bdnew
