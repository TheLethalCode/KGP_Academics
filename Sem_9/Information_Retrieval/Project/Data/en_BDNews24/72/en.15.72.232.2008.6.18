<TITLE> Croatia's Vlaovic takes memory lane to Turkey match </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAD TATZMANNSDORF, Austria, June 18(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former striker Goran Vlaovic will re-live one of Croatia's memorable sporting moments when he joins the fans for Friday's Euro 2008 quarter-final against Turkey. What will distinguish him from the other Croatia supporters at Vienna's Ernst Happel stadium is that he scored in their 1-0 win over Turkey in the Euro 96 group stage in England. "It was one of the most significant goals I ever scored because it went down in history as the first goal Croatia scored in a major event as an independent country," the 35-year-old Vlaovic told Croatia's official HINA news agency. "Although the Turks will need no additional motivation to reach the semi-finals I suppose their media and fans will go down that memory lane too and it will put extra pressure on their shoulders." Vlaovic, who scored 16 goals in 52 international appearances, believes Turkey's ability to improvise will make them tough opponents. "They have no pattern of play and it makes them that much more difficult to break down because they also work hard and never give up," he said. "They came back twice from a very difficult situation and that can't be accidental. They rely on the inspiration of individuals and are very awkward to defend against." The teams reached the last eight in highly contrasting fashion. Croatia won all three Group B matches and were able to rest first-choice players for their 1-0 victory over Poland, having earlier beaten co-hosts Austria 1-0 and pre-tournament favourites Germany 2-1. Turkey lost 2-0 to Portugal in Group A before rallying from 1-0 down against co-hosts Switzerland to win 2-1 and beating Czech Republic 3-2 after overturning a 2-0 deficit
