 DADAAB, Kenya, Thu Jun 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East is increasing refugee numbers worldwide and undermining efforts by aid agencies to manage multiple disasters, a senior UN official said on Thursday. Speaking in northern Kenya where thousands of Somalis are sheltering in dusty camps, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said his organization desperately needed more funds. "Look at what is happening in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and the Pakistan border, in Darfur, Chad, Congo and Somalia... It is really very difficult. The refugee numbers keep rising," he told Reuters "We made a few investments but it's not enough ... I'm trying to divert funds," said the former Portuguese prime minister, adding that he had cut 26 UNHCR international jobs to raise money. Guterres's organization says 11.4 million people were classed as refugees last year, up from 9.9 million in 2006. He was visiting Dadaab ahead of World Refugee Day on Friday to bring attention to the plight of displaced groups like the Somalis who have fled violence in their Horn of Africa homeland. At least 1 million people have been uprooted in Somalia since the start of last year by fighting between Somali-Ethiopian forces and Islamist insurgents. Thousands have been killed. The United Nations says 4,000 Somalis are entering Kenya each month, swelling numbers in Dadaab by 20,000 this year to 200,000. The camp also hosts refugees from Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most live in broken-down shacks and survive on food aid. Guterres said there were another 110,000 Somali refugees sheltering in Yemen. Despite the spiraling figures, he said, UNHCR would continue to do as much as it could. "We are never successful, but we are committed to support people who have suffered a lot," he said
