 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet on Sunday approved a proposal to limit the government's responsibility to recovering only public lands from illegal occupation, a spokesman said. The government will not take any initiative on its own to recover private or individually-owned plots from grabbers, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The latest decision means the government has reversed an early decision to amend the Government and Local Authority Lands and Buildings (Recovery of Possession) Ordinance 1970. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed presided over the meeting in his office. The cabinet meeting also approved in principle a proposal to ratify the Cape Town Convention and a related aviation protocol. The Cape Town Convention, also called treaty, include aircraft sales, security agreements, lease agreements, conditional sales and aircraft liens. The Cape Town Convention that went into effect on March 1, 2006 applies to many twin-engine and most jet aircraft. "The government will sign the convention after final approval. Twenty-one countries have signed the convention. The agreement will give Bangladesh special benefits in buying or taking aircraft on lease," Munaim said. In another decision, the council of advisers returned Ombudsman Amendment Ordinance 2008 to the law ministry for further scrutiny. bdnews24.c
