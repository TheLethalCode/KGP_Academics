 NEUSTIFT, Austria, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain have no negative thoughts ahead of Sunday's Euro 2008 quarter-final in Vienna despite having a poor record against Italy in major tournaments, said coach Luis Aragones. "I don't detect any feeling the players doubt their ability to win this game. We have no hang-up about this," Aragones told a news conference on Thursday. "I'm happy with our team because we have worked very well but what I'm interested in most is having the team as strong and fresh as possible and with the attitude they will win at all costs. "Of course anything can happen in a football match but those who are convinced they can win normally end up winning. Negative thoughts are bad for the player himself and for the team in general." Although Spain overcame four-times world champions Italy 1-0 in a friendly in March, they have never beaten the Azzurri at a major tournament outside the Olympic Games. "The psychological aspect is an important part of our work," added Aragones. "I don't think what has happened in the past will weigh on the players. TOUGHEST RIVALS "Italy are one of the toughest rivals to play against and their record says everything, even though there are other teams who are playing well in the tournament. A team that wants to beat Italy or Netherlands has to be convinced they can do it." Ruben de la Red, who scored his first goal for Spain in their 2-1 comeback win over Greece on Wednesday, said the manner of the victory had boosted their confidence. "The fact we went a goal down, then fought back and won the game says a lot about this team," said the midfielder. "We all know we've now got the definitive test coming up and Italy are very difficult to play against but we've got a lot of confidence. "The statistics say they are the favourites as they have always beaten us but we are the form side and if we carry on playing the way we have done and stay firm at the back then we can win.
