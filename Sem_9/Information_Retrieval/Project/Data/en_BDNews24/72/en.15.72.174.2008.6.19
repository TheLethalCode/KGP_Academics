<TEXT>
 DHAKA, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is hopeful his players can harness their individual skills to recapture their World Cup form in the Asia Cup starting in Pakistan next week. Bangladesh have failed to win a match against a major side since they reached the Super Eight stage in West Indies last year, knocking former champions India out in the process. "The players haven't done it yet," Siddons told a news conference in Dhaka on Thursday, referring to his team's inconsistency. "I am hoping that this tournament (Asia Cup) will be where we do that." The Bangladeshis faced United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka in the group stage on June 24 and 25 and their Australian coach, who took over from compatriot Dave Whatmore in November, fully expects them to progress into the second round. "Against UAE ... it is a game that I think we will win. And then Sri Lanka is a team which we can beat if we play to the best of our ability," he said. "Whether we will win after the first round I am not sure, but I am looking forward putting our best game together.
