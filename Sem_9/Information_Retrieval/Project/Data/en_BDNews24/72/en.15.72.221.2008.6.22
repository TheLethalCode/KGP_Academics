<TITLE> Croatia defeat kept Germany on high alert - Bierhoff </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TENERO, Switzerland, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defeat by Croatia in the group phase ended up working in Germany's favour as it kept their Euro 2008 squad on high alert, manager Oliver Bierhoff said on Sunday. Portugal, Croatia and Netherlands all qualified for the quarter-finals with a game to spare and took the opportunity to name shadow sides for their third matches. All three teams then found they had lost their momentum and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. Spain, in a similar situation, will attempt to buck the trend when they face Italy later on Sunday. "It can be a disadvantage if you reach the knockout phase too early," Bierhoff told a news conference. "It's hard to keep up the same level of tension. "In hindsight losing (2-1) to Croatia was no bad thing because it meant we stayed on alert." Bierhoff was part of the side that won the European Championship in England in 1996. "When I was in the team I loved playing every three or four days at a tournament rather than having a week's rest," said the former striker. Germany, runners-up to Croatia in Group B, beat Group A winners Portugal 3-2 in their quarter-final on Thursday and return to Basel for Wednesday's semi-final against Turkey. The players were given the choice of aqua jogging, biking or yoga in place of their usual training sessions over the weekend. "We gave the players time off after Thursday, time away from a football, but we'll be back fully concentrated from Sunday's evening training session," Bierhoff said
