<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 23 (bdnews24.com)Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hasan said Monday he was yet to perceive any major progress in the process of releasing former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her two ailing sons. Amid repeated demands by the BNP and its allies for their release, the IG prisons told reporters: "We are all ready to implement whatever decision comes from the government. But it'll be difficult to tell you when they will be finally released." "We're awaiting the government's decision for our next action," he said, after attending a meeting at the ministry of home affairs. Meanwhile, a home ministry official said the meeting had discussed establishing prisons at Keraniganj and Kashimpur and expansion of the country's existing prison facilities. Home secretary Abdul Karim chaired the meeting, while senior officials from police and other departments were also present. bdnews24.co
