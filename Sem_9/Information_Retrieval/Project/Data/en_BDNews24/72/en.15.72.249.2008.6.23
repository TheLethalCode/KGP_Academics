 NEW DELHI, June 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A wave of nostalgia is sweeping across India as the nation marks the 25th anniversary of the team's stunning 1983 World Cup victory at Lord's. Batting stalwart Sunil Gavaskar led the initiative to reunite his former team mates by organising a dinner at the site of the final in London on Wednesday, the meal coinciding with the date of India's first and only World Cup victory.

Although reigning champions Australia have won four one-day World Cup titles, India regard the win as special because it lifted a nation starved of sporting success. It triggered a cricket revolution in India, boosting millions of sports fans dejected by the decline of the men's hockey team and helping the nation become the game's global commercial hub.

Sunday's function by a wealthy board contrasted with that of a cash-strapped body in 1983, which raised the players' prize money only after celebrated Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar agreed to stage a free concert
