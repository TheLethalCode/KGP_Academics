 BASEL, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew has been banned from the touchline for Thursday's Euro 2008 quarter-final with Portugal after being "sent off" in their last Group B match, the German football federation (DFB) said on Wednesday. Loew was ordered to watch the second half of Germany's win over Austria on Monday from the stands after arguing with the fourth official just before halftime. Austrian counterpart Josef Hickersberger was similarly banished from the touchline. "I have to acknowledge the UEFA decision and would not like to comment on it.

DFB president Theo Zwanziger said: "It certainly wasn't an easy decision for UEFA and they spent a lot of time considering the issue before reaching their ruling.
