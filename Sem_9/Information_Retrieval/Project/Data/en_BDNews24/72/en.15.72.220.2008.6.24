 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Khaleda Zia was produced in the court Tuesday morning for charge framing hearing in Gatco graft case. Khaleda was taken to the Special Judge's Court-3 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban complex at around 10:25 am from the special jail in the same area and her son Arafat Rahman Coco was carried in an ambulance from his prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Other accused in the case former ministers Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar, Motiur Rahman Nizami and others were also produced in the court. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC later pressed charges, on May 13 this year, against some 25 people. The name of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, one of the original accused, was dropped from the chargesheet after his death. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. The case was initially set for trial under metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque, but the case proceedings were later shifted to the special court on security grounds. bd
