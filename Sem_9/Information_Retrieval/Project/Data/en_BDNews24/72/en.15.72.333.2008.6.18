<TEXT>
 BERNE, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands striker Robin van Persie said it was tough to break down Romania's stubborn resistance in their Euro 2008 match on Tuesday. "It was difficult in the beginning as they had eight players behind the ball," Van Persie told reporters after the Dutch finished with a 100 percent record in Group C thanks to a 2-0 victory at the Stade de Suisse. "But after the 54th-minute goal by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar I had the feeling they collapsed. Then we really got into the match and started to play some good football." Van Persie sealed the win in the 87th minute with a fierce left-footed drive. "As a team we really did great, especially when you consider we took a maximum nine points in a (testing) group like this," said the Arsenal player. "As for my own performance, I was satisfied but I also could have done better on some aspects. There was some sloppiness in my passing for instance." The Dutch, who made nine changes to their starting lineup on Tuesday, now meet Sweden or Russia in Saturday's quarter-final in Basel
