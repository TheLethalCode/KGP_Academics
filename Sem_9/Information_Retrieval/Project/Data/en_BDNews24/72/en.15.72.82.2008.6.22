<TITLE> Van Basten fails his big test as Dutch coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 22 (Reuters) - Marco van Basten failed to achieve as a coach the heights he reached as a player 20 years ago after his Netherlands team were upset by Russia in the Euro 2008 quarter-finals. The Russians, coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, outclassed Netherlands on Saturday despite starting as underdogs and their 3-1 extra-time victory at St Jakob Park brought a quicker than expected end to Van Basten's spell as coach. Earlier in the tournament it looked as though he was going to lead the Dutch to their first success since 1988. Back then he helped them become European champions having scored with a superb volley in the final against the Soviet Union. Van Basten put pressure on himself when he started the job as coach in 2004 saying this was the tournament Netherlands could win by playing dominant and attractive football. At the time, he also said the 2006 World Cup finals would come too early and he was proved right as they went out in an infamous second round match against Portugal in Nuremberg which produced four red cards and saw another 12 players booked. WINNING FOOTBALL The world did this time get a glimpse of the attractive football he wanted in the opening two matches in Berne when they beat world champions Italy 3-0 and 2006 runners-up France 4-1. But despite all the international acclaim, the Dutch never completely dominated and had to rely on outstanding goalkeeping from Edwin van der Sar and a fair share of luck too. After the defeat to Russia, the 43-year-old Van Basten reflected on his time in charge and divided it into two periods. "In the first two years we had a good qualifying campaign for the World Cup, where we survived the group of death before we lost against Portugal. "Then for the last two years we struggled through our qualifying campaign, but had a good start to the tournament." LACKED RHYTHM The Dutch lacked rhythm against Russia, who had only two clear days to prepare for the quarter-final, while Van Basten rested his complete first choice team against Romania. But those five days of extra rest seemed to deflate the Dutch rather than give them the extra energy they hoped for in what was a draining 120-minute test of endurance. "I was surprised by our physical problems, especially because my starting team had so much more time to recover," Van Basten said after the match. "In the group matches we started with a lot of enthusiasm, but that never came out today." Van Basten seemed not to have learnt his lesson from the World Cup two years ago when he also rested players once the Dutch had secured qualification from the group stage after two matchesand then went out to Portugal. He was always going to leave the national job after Euro 2008 to take over at Ajax Amsterdam next season and has a four-year contract to prove his coaching qualities. This tournament proved Van Basten is not yet the finished article as a coach. On Saturday's evidence, the 61-year-old Hiddink remains the Dutch master while the young pretender
