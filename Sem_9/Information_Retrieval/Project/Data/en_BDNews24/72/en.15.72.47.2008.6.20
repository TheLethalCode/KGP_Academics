<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cartoon character Tinkerbell, singer Shakira and "Iron Man" Robert Downey Jr. and actress Cameron Diaz were among a diverse group of 25 stars named on Thursday to join the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said the celebrities will each get their star on its Walk of Fame next year, but the dates have not been announced. The Walk of Fame is a stretch of sidewalk lining either side of Hollywood Boulevard on which celebrities in music, movies, television and other entertainment arenas have their names emblazoned in brass set into large, pink terrazzo stars. For celebrities, a star can be a memorial that lasts for decades, and millions of tourists who visit downtown Hollywood annually get to see the names, talk about their favorite actors and actresses and take pictures near the stars. A committee of the Chamber of Commerce chose the 25 stars from among hundreds of nominations. Others on the list include director Tim Burton, and actors Sir Ben Kingsley, William H. Macy and Hugh Jackman. Among the television stars are Macy's wife, Felicity Huffman, producer Mark Burnett and music stars include Kenny "Baby Face" Edmonds and disco-era band The Village People.
