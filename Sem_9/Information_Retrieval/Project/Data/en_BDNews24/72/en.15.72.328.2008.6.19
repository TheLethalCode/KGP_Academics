<TEXT>
 KARACHI, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani selectors have dropped experienced wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal for the Asia Cup tournament, which starts next week. Akmal was omitted from a list of 20 players picked to attend a short training camp, from which a 15-member squad will be named for the June 24-July 6 contest in Pakistan. India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong are the other countries taking part. Akmal, 26, has been axed after being ever-present since 2004 although he was rested for three one-day games last year in which the selectors tried out young keeper Sarfraz Ahmed. "Kamran remains our number one keeper but we also wanted to give chances to others and we felt Kamran also deserved to take a well deserved rest," chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed told reporters. Akmal who has played in 38 tests and 88 one-dayers, has been told to get over a extended period of inconsistent form behind the stumps. The final squad is due to be named on June 22. The selectors had no other surprises for the tournament although pacer Mohammad Asif will not take part as he remains in detention in Dubai on suspicion of carrying illegal drugs. Pakistan squad: Shoaib Malik (Capt), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Rao Iftikhar, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Asad Rauf, Yasir Hameed, Bazid Khan, Mansoor Amjad, Naumanullah, Saeed Ajma
