 ROME, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Italian press delighted in Tuesday's 2-0 win over France and hailed the Dutch for making the world champions' passage to the Euro 2008 quarter-finals possible by beating Romania by the same score. "Viva L'Italia," beamed the front of Corriere dello Sport on Wednesday. "A great Azzurri night in Zurich." "Too Beautiful!" read the front page of La Gazzetta dello Sport besides a photo of midfielder Andrea Pirlo celebrating the penalty that set Italy on their way. Victory over France would have been no use to the world champions if the already-qualified Netherlands had lost to Romania. But Marco van Basten's team emphatically disproved pre-match suggestions that they might not put up too much resistance with a dominant display that enabled Italy to book themselves a last-eight meeting with Spain on Sunday. 'FORMAL APOLOGIES' "Today the Dutch ambassador to Italy should be called and given formal apologies for the air of suspicion that disturbed the eve (of the match)," wrote Candido Cannavo in La Gazzetta dello Sport. "The Netherlands won for themselves, for honesty and, as a consequence, for us." Italy coach Roberto Donadoni was also praised after being blasted for losing 3-0 to the Dutch in the opening match and drawing 1-1 with Romania, with the media speculating that 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi would soon be back. "Donadoni has taken the national team among the eight best sides in Europe with pride, conviction and unity that recalled the World Cup in Germany," wrote Gianluca Moresco in Rome-based daily La Repubblica. "Lippi's shadow has been distanced, for five days at least." Moresco was not the only pundit to see echoes of Italy's Germany 2006 triumph too. "The World Cup spirit reignites on the last bend," wrote Mario Sconcerti in Corriere della Sera. "France go back home, we go forward and we start to see a bit of a team too.
