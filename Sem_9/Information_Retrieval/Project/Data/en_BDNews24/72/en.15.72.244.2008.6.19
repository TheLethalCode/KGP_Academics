 BASEL, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The emergence of Netherlands and Spain as title contenders, superb displays by Portugal and Croatia and a scrap for survival by world champions Italy were among the highlights of the opening phase of Euro 2008. The first 24 matches of the tournament produced 57 goals but, perhaps more importantly, almost every one of the 16 finalists came with a positive, attack-minded approach that has produced a memorable and outstanding group stage. As expected neither of the co-hosts Austria or Switzerland made it to the last eight, although at least the Swiss won their first match in three European finals with a consolation victory over already-qualified Portugal who fielded a reserve side. Greece also went out, ending their unlikely four-year reign as European champions in the more familiar position of being bottom of their group. They scored just one goal and failed to collect a point even against a second string Spain side. France, European champions in 2000 and World Cup runners-up to Italy two years ago, also finished bottom of their group. Their early elimination brought down the curtain on the international careers of Lilian Thuram, 36, who retired having played an all-time record 142 matches for the French side, and Claude Makelele, 35, who won 71 caps. REMARKABLE MATCH Koebi Kuhn, the 64-year-old coach of Switzerland, and Czech Republic manager Karel Brueckner, 68, also stepped down, the latter after the most remarkable match of the opening phase. With 75 minutes played against Turkey, the Czechs were coasting to a 2-0 victory and a place in Friday's quarter-final against Croatia in Vienna. Just 15 minutes later they were out. Turkey struck three times in the closing stages with two goals in the last four minutes from captain Nihat Kahveci, to secure an unlikely and astonishing comeback. That game not only marked the end of Brueckner's six-year spell as national coach but also ended Jan Koller's international career with 55 goals in 90 appearances, leaving the stage as the Czechs' all-time leading scorer. Turkey will meet Croatia in the last eight, attempting to end the 100 per cent record of Slaven Bilic's men. The Croatians underlined their title potential with a gritty, tactical 2-1 win over Germany to seal first place in their group with a maximum nine points. EXCITING DUTCH Marco Van Basten's exciting Dutch side, though, have emerged as favourites after winning all three matches including a 3-0 victory over world champions Italy and a 4-1 win over France. They look capable of lifting their first title since 1988 while Spain have also played some superb football, raising hopes among their fans of a first major trophy since 1964. Guus Hiddink's Russia made a late run to reach the last eight and have been boosted by the return of playmaker Andrei Arshavin from suspension but will surely fall to the Dutch. Portugal, who went close on home soil four years ago, beat Turkey and Czech Republic with a swagger and confidence that could take them all the way to a first senior success. Germany are in the knockout phase after failing to reach it in 2000 and 2004 but will find a Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired Portugal tough to beat in the quarter-finals. Italy flirted with elimination but, after beating France 2-0 on Monday, made the last eight and are unlikely to play as badly against Spain as they did versus Netherlands and Romania
