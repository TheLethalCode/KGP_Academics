 BASEL, June 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands became the third group winners to crash out of the Euro 2008 quarter-finals despite the apparent advantage of having rested key players before their match. Just like Portugal and Croatia, Netherlands fielded a second string side for their last group stage match after having already secured top spot with two opening wins. Just like Portugal and Croatia too, the Dutch saw their supposedly refreshed players beaten by quarter-final opponents who had finished second in their respective groups with no chance of easing up themselves after just two days' rest. "We didn't have the match under control," Netherlands coach Marco van Basten acknowledged after seeing his team outrun and outclassed by a tireless Russian side on Saturday in Basel. "Russia made it difficult for us. We had physical problems. The players didn't have the conditioning any more at the end." In Netherlands' defence, Russia boast the youngest squad at Euro 2008. The architect of their success, playmaker Andrei Arshavin, had also enjoyed an unwanted rest of his ownhaving missed Russia's first two games through suspension. Nevertheless the fate of Portugal, Croatia and Netherlands begs the question whether coaches should maintain the momentum of a winning team rather than opt for a mid-tournament break. Further evidence in favour of the former approach could be presented on Sunday when Group D winners Spain are expected to field a similarly refreshed team against the battle-wearied world champions of Italy
