<TITLE> Russia's transformation comes at just the right time </TITLE>

 INNSBRUCK, June 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia have taken just days to transform a sieve-like defence into an alert back four and become a side who coach Guus Hiddink said deserved the respect of Euro 2008 quarter-final opponents Netherlands. Russia will take on Hiddink's compatriots after finishing second in Group D with Wednesday's 2-0 win over Sweden in which they dominated from the start, looked calm in defence and threatened on the attack. "The way we play we get respect, we like to play in this concept of the way football should be played and I think they (Netherlands) do the same," Hiddink told a news conference. Wednesday's performance was a far cry from the woeful defending in last week's opener against Spain, when a tendency to throw players forward and leave just a couple of defenders back was punished by a 4-1 hammering. Hiddink lambasted his players' naivety and conducted some tough training sessions. The result was a much-improved performance in a 1-0 win over Greece where they looked in control at the back and should have scored more goals. The return of playmaker Andrei Arshavin for the Sweden match added spark to a team who had shown the makings of a promising attacking style in their previous matches. He inspired them to link moves better and his pace added extra danger. Such qualities will be particularly valuable against the Dutch on Saturday in Basel. "I'm very proudof the progress made in a few hours, in a few days," Hiddink said. "We were not very alert to the danger which can occur in a team and now in the last two games we were." Hiddink's one criticism was the failure to convert more of their chances, with Konstantin Zyryanov, Yuri Zhirkov and Roman Pavlyuchenko all missing clear opportunities. "I think we should have scored one more goal in each half," he said. "That is the only small criticism but they executed very well what we talked about in training.
