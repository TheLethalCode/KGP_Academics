 Dhaka, June 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain has once more warned against holding local government polls before the national election, hours before the government is set to annouce the schedule for four city corporation and nine municipality elections. Delwar said the government and the Election Commission would be responsible for any unexpected situation in the country in the wake of Friday's announcement of local government polls schedule. "No election should be allowed before the parliamentary election," the Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general told local representatives of Bangladesh Khilafat Majlish, a member party of the BNP-led four-party alliance. Speaking at a meeting at the Diploma Engineers Institute auditorium, he asked leaders and workers of the four-party alliance to be united. "Unity is essential for us. We will not accept any polls before the national election by any means," he said, demanding a general election by October. He asked the Election Commission to announce a schedule for the national polls immediately. bdnew
