 BAD TATZMANNSDORF, Austria, June 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia striker Igor Budan will miss the rest of Euro 2008 with a knee injury, coach Slaven Bilic said on Wednesday. "He will undergo arthroscopic surgery in Italy and unfortunately he will not be able to help us for the remainder of the European Championship," Bilic told a news conference at the team's training base. "We will consider calling up a replacement but only after our quarter-final match with Turkey, should we progress to the semi-finals," he said. Croatia, who play the Turks in Vienna on Friday, have already lost defender Dario Knezevic to a knee injury after he limped off in their 1-0 Group B win over Poland on Monday. Midfielders Darijo Srna and Ivan Rakitic are nursing minor knocks and should be fit for the match with Turkey
