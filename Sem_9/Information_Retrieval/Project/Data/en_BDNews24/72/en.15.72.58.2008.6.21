 VIENNA, June 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Decimated by injuries and suspensions, Turkey go into their semi-final match against favourites Germany on Wednesday with the same never-say-die attitude, hoping it will be enough to carry them to the final. The Turks beat Croatia on penalties on Friday after equalising a late extra-time Croatia goal with the last kick of the match. Semih Senturk, known among his club Fenerbahce fans as "The Lifeguard" for his late decisive strikes, scored in stoppage time in the second half of extra time to take the match to penalties where Turkey won 3-1. But their victory comes at a high price and when they take the field against Germany, even more players will be missing than against Croatia. Coach Fatih Terim had only 15 outfield players to choose from for their quarter-final. That could seem like a luxury. After picking up their second yellow cards, midfielder Arda Turan, forward Tuncay Sanli and defender Emre Asik are suspended against Germany. First choice keeper Volkan Demirel is also serving out a two-match suspension for a red card against the Czech Republic, with an appeal to have it shortened to be ruled on Monday. Captain Emre Belozoglu is extremely doubtful, nursing a hamstring injury since their opening game and injured central defender Servet Cetin said he would not be fit by Wednesday. Defender Emre Gungor is out for the rest of the tournament with a calf problem while inspirational midfielder Tumer Metin's participation is also doubtful due to a groin injury. NO FEAR "Sure, we have a lot of good players out with injuries and we face a formidable opponent in Germany," said Nihat Kahveci, who also left the field clutching his thigh but should be ready to play against Germany. "But the players who will be asked to come on will be good because this team fears nothing. They have to be good because we have no other choice," he said. Coach Fatih Terim will at least have midfielder Mehmet Aurelio back in the squad, who served out his one-match suspension. But even with the growing injury and suspension list, he said his team was up to the task. "I think the Turkish team can do even better," Terim, who is known as the 'Emperor' back home, said. "If only we could have all the injured players back on the team. But even without them, we do have that something extra special." Midfielder Hamit Altintop said a win against Germany was on the cards. "Our team can play well not just against Germany but any team and win," he said. "It is important to believe in ourselves, and if we continue doing that there is no reason to be afraid of any opponent.
