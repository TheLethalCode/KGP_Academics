 Dhaka, June 18 (bdnews24.com)  The state of corruption in Bangladesh did not improve last year, according to a report released Wednesday by Transparency International Bangladesh. Findings of the National Household Survey 2007 on Corruption in Bangladesh have revealed that corruption in education, health, land administration local government and NGO increased in 2007. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said: "Severity of corruption we have seen during the past two governments still exists." "It is very disappointing." Law-enforcement agencies and the judiciary were among the sectors witnessing less corruption in 2007 than in 2006, TIB says. But law-enforcement agencies were still on top of the corruption list, according to the report. A staggering 96.6 percent of households interacting with law enforcement agencies experienced corruption, the report said. Muzaffer Ahmad, chairman of the TIB board of trustees, said: "The rate of petty corruption increased after 1/11." "The report found corruption reduced in some sectors. It also showed many sectors with a higher rate of graft too," he said. Distribution of bribery was found most prevalent in land administration, according to the report. Officials in the sector received a total of Tk 1,606 crore in bribe in one year. The judiciary came second with officials taking Tk 671 crore in bribe in one year, according to the report. Overall 66.7 percent of households experienced corruption in interactions with different services sectors, the TIB report said. Bribery and neglect of duty were the two most frequent forms of corruption experienced by the surveyed households, with the two together claiming 76.9 percent of the total. The survey carried out on 5000 households spotted corruption in six common forms: bribery, neglect of duty, nepotism, embezzlement, deception and extortion. bdnews
