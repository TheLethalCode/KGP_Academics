<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday sought intervention of United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon in probing the allegations of torture on Tarique Rahman in jail. "Tarique Rahman has suffering from twin spinal cord injuries suffered in jail, but the government has not launched any probe into it. The government is delaying the plan to send him abroad for better treatment. We seek your intervention," Delwar said at a discussion in Purana Paltan. He also urged the United Nations to open an investigation into violation of human rights in Bangladesh. Sachetan Jubo Forum organised the discussion on the role of young people in establishing a corruption-free society. The Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general described the schedule of local government polls as part of the government's blueprint to consolidate its power through a farcical election that would elect their agents. Delwar alleged that some countries had been helping the government to implement its conspiracy in phases. "They embarked on a mission to file false cases against politicians in order to make them ineligible for the polls." He stressed creating public awareness, stimulating a sense of morality among people and establishing justice to stop corruption. Delwar asked all to make a success the BNP-led four-party alliance's programme to protest the local polls schedule. Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said any move to fix the polls had to be resisted. "Otherwise, those agents would go to power and consolidate corruption." Moulana Mohiuddin Khan, senior vice president of Islami Oikya Jote, presided over the discussion. bdne
