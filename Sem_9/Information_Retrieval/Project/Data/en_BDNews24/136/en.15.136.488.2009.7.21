 Maruf Mallick, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)--Great Italian astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilee lost his sight at old age because of his relentless vigilance of the space. According to scientists, people may lose their eyesight partially or completely while watching a solar eclipse. However, no harmful rays radiate from the sun during eclipse, they now say. But, invisible rays like x-rays and ultra-violate and infrared rays are always released from the sun with its visible rays of light which can cause damage to the eye. Looking at the sun for a long time is the reason for losing eyesight, say experts. The lens of an eye concentrates the rays of the sun in the retina just like a magnifying glass, crippling light-sensitive eye cells. The intense light can hurt the cornea, the white portion in the outer part of an eye and contract the pupils, reducing its capacity to take in light. On the other hand, the pupils dilate in the dark. They are strained between dilation and contract during an eclipse because of the frequent changes from shadows to light. So, looking at the sun during the eclipse with bare eyes is quite a risky business. Filters able to absorb visible light at least one hundred thousand times should be used to see the sun. Seeing the reflection of the sun is an easy way to enjoy the beauty of the cosmos. CDs, floppy discs, black sunglasses, film negatives, used part of x-ray films are not usable as filters, said Bangladesh Science and Technology Museum official. The sun cannot be directly viewed through binoculars, telescopes or cameras. But pictures can be taken by sticking a filter in front of those. However, the viewfinder of the camera cannot be looked through. Welding glasses can be used as solar filters. But, looking at the sun through any medium for five seconds at a stretch can be injurious, and better be watched between intervals, say experts. The reflection can be made on the surface of turmeric-mixed water collected in a basin. bd
