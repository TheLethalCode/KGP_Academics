<TITLE> Diplomats backed CG, didn't prompt 1/11: Meyke </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Outgoing German ambassador Frank Meyke has praised the former caretaker government for its role in restoring democracy in Bangladesh, but stressed that diplomats in Dhaka played no part in prompting a state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007, which preceded the interim administration's unprecedented two years in office. "The democratic structural reforms of the last caretaker government and the general election of December 29, 2008, has opened up the perspective of a stable democracy and middle income country for Bangladesh," said Meyke in a Meet the Press gathering at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Sunday. He said the election, with over 87 percent turnout, was a "great positive element" for the international image of Bangladesh. Meyke rejected allegations of any diplomatic role in the '1/11' declaration of emergency to clamp down on political turmoil and violence ahead of scheduled elections. "But once it happened, we supported it," said the diplomat. "At the time, there was no better solution as there was no conducive environment for holding a free and fair election." Meyke, who represented the EU presidency at the time, said the 27 countries of the European Union believed "bloody developments" would have taken place if the election that was scheduled for Jan 21, 2007, had gone ahead. His statement comes at a time when some in the ruling and opposition parties have been talking of bringing the leaders of the 1/11 changeover "to justice" for imposing emergency rule and installing a two-year interim regime without constitutional basis. British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans earlier this month also refuted the allegation that the diplomatic community in Bangladesh had a hand in "calling the army out of barracks" in January 2007. He spoke in defence of his predecessor Anwar Choudhury who is considered by some as one of the players behind the 1/11 events. Evans also stressed that the state of emergency was imposed at the time as an "internal dynamic" in Bangladesh. Meyke said on Sunday, "We as diplomats are here to provide, and we do provide, the views of our government. "The only contribution we have made in context of the state of emergency was  providing the concerns, information and the position of the European Union." Asked to comment on the Awami League government's moves for trial of 1971 war criminals, Meyke said his country and other European countries held the view that all war criminals must be tried wherever they were. "We wish all war criminals to be prosecuted," he said. 'Positive political signals needed' Meyke said positive political signals were now needed to attract foreign investment in Bangladesh. He said Bangladesh was still considered a "country of floods, poverty and corruption with massive bureaucratic tangles, frequent power cuts and political uncertainties". "Positive political signals for German investors would be measures and reform activities promoting intra-party democracy and accountability of party finances." Germany is the largest market for Bangladesh goods in Europe and the second largest export market for Bangladesh worldwide. In 2008, bilateral relations between the countries neared  2 billion. He said there was huge potential in Bangladesh for German investment, subject to "positive" steps. 'Investment environment growing' "A number of positive steps have been taken to improve the business environment in Bangladesh," said Meyke. "These include regulatory reforms, strengthening the capacity of the board of investment, encouragement of the public private partnership, especially regarding infrastructure projects, and the establishment of a special economic zone." He said ship building was going to be a promising new field for Bangladesh export to Germany.
