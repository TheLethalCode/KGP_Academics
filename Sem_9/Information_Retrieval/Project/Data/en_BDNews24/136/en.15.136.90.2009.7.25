<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  A quickfire half-century from stand-in captain Mushfiqur Rahim took Bangladesh to a 16-run victory over University of West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI at Benjamin Park in Dominica on Friday. In a match reduced to 25 overs after rain delayed the start until 1:45pm local time (12:45am Bangladesh Standard Time), Rahim slammed an unbeaten 82 off 59 balls to propel the Tigers to 167 for six after they won the toss and batted. The Tigers had rested captain Shakib Al Hasan, opener Imrul Kayes and pace bowler Rubel Hossain in the match. UWI VC's XI captain Omar Phillips then stroked a cameo 49 at the top of the order but the Vice Chancellor's XI fell short of their target, reaching 151 for eight from their allotted overs. Bangladesh had slipped to 38 for three after fast bowler Gavin Tonge, who finished with two for 18 from his five overs, had snatched two early wickets. Rahim and Roqibul Hassan, who struck 34, added 53 for the fourth wicket to revive the innings, the first of three partnerships that pushed the Tigers to their eventual score. The 21-year-old Rahim pummeled four fours and three sixes off just 59 balls while Roqibul smote two fours and two sixes in a knock that required 33 balls. Rahim added a further 40 with Mehrab Hossain (10) for the fifth wicket before putting on another 34 for the seventh wicket with Naeem Islam (four not out). The left-handed Phillips then dominated a 31-run, opening stand with Kieran Powell (2) as the Vice Chancellor's XI got off to a flying start. Devon Smith, drafted in the Windies ODI squad to face Bangladesh, then made a run-a-ball 16 in adding 30 with Phillips, whose knock comprised four fours and two sixes and came from 41 balls. When both batsmen fell to leave the Vice Chancellor's XI on 86 for three, Chadwick Walton hit 21 from 16 balls and Crafton Clarke cracked an unbeaten 29 from 19 balls, but the hosts came up short. Spinners Abdur Razzak, Mahmudullah Riyad, Naeem, Mehrab and paceman Syed Rasel were among the wickets for Bangladesh. The first ODI starts at Windsor Park on Sunday followed by the second at the same venue on Tuesday. The third and final ODI is at St. Kitts on Jul
