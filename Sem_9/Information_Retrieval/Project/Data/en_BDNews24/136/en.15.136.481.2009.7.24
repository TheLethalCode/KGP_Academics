 Mustak Ahmed, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked supporters to be tolerant of others and not to wreak vengeance on the rivals for years of persecution. "We are in power, so we have to be patient. We should not go for revenge," the prime minister said, kicking off the daylong national council on Friday at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Hasina urged the supporters to not do anything that may erode public confidence in the party. She thanked supporters who were on the streets during the 2007-08 emergency rule. "You were on the streets all the time. Some gave in to coercion or enticements. Some simply were not strong enough to withstand the tortures." Hasina also highlighted her government's achievements. "We had pledged in the election manifesto to cut prices of essentials and reduce inflation, which we have already fulfilled. Currently the foreign currency reserve has gone up to seven billion dollar." "We have also cut prices of diesel and fertiliser. Initiatives are taken for irrigation to keep agricultural production smooth. Rationing system has been launched for the people with limited income and we will not let anyone starve." "We have taken programme to create employment for an active youth from each family. A pilot project for the youth is also initiated to boost their skills. Besides, the street children are also given preference to be prepared for work." She also pledged to work for the people and earn their love. Her party's only goal will be to ensure the welfare of the people, she said. The council started with the slogan '60 years of struggle and success' at 10:30am with the reiteration of the campaign pledge to build a digital Bangladesh. At the beginning of the ceremony, she paid respects to independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibar Rahman, four national leaders and the martyrs of the freedom and democratic movements. She also commemorated AL founder Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and general secretary Shamsul Haque. The AL was founded to achieve the independence of Bangladesh and it has contributed to all achievements of the country, she said. "There was an attempt to destroy the Awami League during the rules of the BNP-Jamaat coalition government and the caretaker government but that attempt was foiled by the active role played by innumerable leaders and workers." "When I was detained in prison attempts were made to get me out of politics. There were conspiracies. When I was abroad warrant was issued in cases against me. "I was barred from coming back to the country. I was told that I would be shot at the airport but I said if I was to die then I would rather on the soil of my country," said Hasina. She thanked AL workers, non-resident Bangladeshis and foreign friends for their support for her comeback. "I never bowed my head before injustice. I will go on struggling for the people of the Bengal. The only thing I will desire will be the love of the people of Bangladesh," she said. The party is hurriedly holding the council to approve and submit a final constitution to the Election Commission by Saturday's deadline. New electoral laws stipulate a permanent constitution for mandatory registration. The council will elect a new leadership for the party. The business end of the council session began at 3pm, which will be followed by a cultural programme. This is the 20th council, with the last one being held in 2002. This time the number of councilors is 5,253, said office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan. Hasina, who has been leading the party since 1982, is set to retain the presidency for a sixth term but the post of the general secretary is still open. Syed Ashraful Islam was unanimously selected acting general secretary at the party's central working committee meeting on July 22, a day after Abdul Jalil resigned his general secretary post for his 'grievances' for being ignored. Jalil came to the ceremony at around 11:15am and spoke to Hasina. The daylong council kicked off amid hoisting of the national flag by Hasina. Ashraf hoisted the party flag. Hasina then formally inaugurated the event by releasing a flock of pigeons and barrages of balloons. The AL leaders and activists chanted 'Joi Bangla' slogan simultaneously. The stage has been arranged in front of the main building of the centre. Central leaders are seated there. Guests and other leaders and workers of the party and its affiliated organisations have taken seat in front of the stage. Hasina was seating behind a bulletproof glass and delivered her speech from behind a bulletproof shield on the dais. In the giant banner behind the stage are pictures of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibar Rahman, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Hossain Shahid Suhrawardi, Tajuddin Ahmed and other late leaders. The historic speech of March 7 is being played through the megaphone since the morning. The Quraan, Geeta, Bible and Tripitok were recited at the beginning of the ceremony and a condolence motion was raised by office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan for those died since the last council. The welcome speech was given by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury. The programme was directed by publicity secretary Asaduzzaman Noor. Artists from the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro led by Ajit Roy sang popular songs that inspired the people during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Diplomats, political leaders, observers and representatives from all over the country attended the council of the 61-year- old party. A BNP delegation of former MPs Fazlul Huq Milon, Shirin Sultana and Shimul Biswas, assistant private secretary to party chief Khaleda Zia, attended the inaugural ceremony. Workers' Party leader Rashed Khan Menon, president of Communist Party of Bangladesh Manjurul Ahsan Khan and secretary Mujahidul Islam Seleim, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haq Inu, general secretary of Sammobadi Dal industries minister Dilip Barua and president of Gonotontri Party Mohammad Afzal were present among the dignitaries. Security has been beefed up in and around the conference centre. Gateways have been erected at the entrances of the city wishing the success of the council. The last meeting of the current central executive committee was held on Thursday. Since its birth in Dhaka on June 23, 1949, the biggest party of Bangladesh has led the Bengali nation in the struggle of self-determination to independence. After independence, the first government of the country was formed by Sheikh Mujib in 1972. After the bloody coup of Aug 15, 1975 in which Sheikh Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated, the party came back to power in 1996 under Hasina's leadership. She became the prime minister for a second time after the AL-led Grand Alliance swept the elections last year. bdnews24.co
