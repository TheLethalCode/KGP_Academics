<TITLE> World Cup bid race is toughest yet: England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Competition to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the fiercest ever but the home of the Premier League is the ideal venue for the tournament, according to the head of England's bid. Andy Anson said the football infrastructure and huge domestic passion for the game made England the perfect choice, but he warned against complacency with nine other countries bidding hard for the right to host the tournament. "We believe we can put on an incredibly exciting World Cup, and we strongly believe we can win this bid," Anson told Reuters on Thursday during a visit to Thailand. "We have a very compelling case to win but it's incredibly competitive, more than there has ever been for a World Cup. You can't afford to be complacent, we have a nine countries bidding very aggressively." Australia, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the United States have bid for both the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, along with two joint proposals from Belgium and the Netherlands and Spain and Portugal. South Korea, Indonesia and Qatar have confirmed their interest in staging the 2022 finals. FIFA will decide on the hosts in December 2010. BIGGEST RIVALS England has only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966, and the former commercial director of Manchester United would not be drawn on who the biggest rivals were. "We can't talk about individual competitors, but that's helpful, because there's no point focussing on any one competitor," he said. "There are so many in the field, it makes you more determined to do a good job." Although England has bid for both the 2018 and 2022 finals, Anson said the target was to stage the tournament as soon as possible. "We want 2018 and are very focussed on that, we feel we have the stadium, infrastructure and fans, we believe we can put on a great World Cup in 2018 so why would we want to wait until 2022?" England had learned from the unsuccessful "football's coming home" bid to stage the 2006 finals, Anson said, and was travelling the world to listen to the opinions of FIFA member countries. POLITICAL INFIGHTING Despite rumours of political infighting between different sectors of the lucrative English game, Anson said all parties involved had fully backed the bid. "We've made it our priority, we have to communicate heavily to everyone to make sure we're all in the loop and in the decision-making process," he said. "I've not met anyone who doesn't want to be on board or support this bid. It's hard to see why England shouldn't have it, we now have to convince the rest of the world." Fifteen cities are aiming to earn the right to stage matches, including lesser-known soccer outposts like Hull, Bristol, Derby and Milton Keynes, alongside the traditional strongholds of London, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. There will be a shortlist of 64 venues across the country, 32 of which will be selected as base camps for the teams. One aim is to spread the tournament to as many parts of the country as possible, he added. Plans to build new stadiums for Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, in addition to established arenas of clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle meant the bid had more capital to channel into strengthening other areas. "It's one of the attractions from this bid from an English point is we don't have to develop anything major," Anson said. Anson said he also believed the 2012 London Olympics would serve as a launchpad. "It's huge asset and the six years between is positive because of resources, skills and infrastructure," he said. "We have a great showcase in the Premier League, great stadiums and fans who are committed and passionate. We have such a fantastic base to build a bid
