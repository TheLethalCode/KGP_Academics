 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has admitted that some ruling party men have been involved in snatching tenders in some places. The parliamentary standing committee on the communications ministry also recommended amendments to the public procurement regulations (PPR) to stop such practices. "Yes, we have discussed this issue. In two or three places such incidents indeed took place. "We will not let it turn serious," Sheikh Mojibur Rahman, the committee chairman, told reporters at the parliament's media centre on Sunday after a committee meeting. He said as per the rules, tender boxes must be placed in one place. "Therefore, the committee has decided to make suggestions at its next meeting to amend the PPR. "We will ask the government to make a provision for keeping tender boxes in four to five places so that none can capture tender boxes," said Rahman. Omar Faruk Chowdhury, another committee member, said, "If this provision is made, muscle flexing over tender will automatically go." "Even we will recommend sending tender documents by post," he said. The committee also said it has asked the ministry to revise the policy to protect interests of the local contractors.
