<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  A heroic undefeated 130 from captain Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka save the third Test against Pakistan on Friday with the draw giving them a 2-0 victory in the three-match series. Sri Lanka resumed on 183-3 chasing an improbable 492-run target and, led by Sangakkara, defied Pakistan's bowlers throughout an enthralling final day, closing on 391 for four after a rearguard performance lasting 134 overs. Sangakkara's marathon 303-ball innings, his 19th Test century and first since taking over the captaincy, spanned nearly eight hours and included seven boundaries.

Sangakkara was dropped the previous evening having scored 40, but his innings on Friday was chanceless. Samaraweera was the most fluent of the batsmen, scoring 73 off 143 deliveries with 11 boundaries, his highest score of the series on a day when he was recalled to the ODI squad. Mathews was also impressive in only his third game with a mature and intelligent 64 from 148 balls that included seven fours and one six. Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, the most threatening of their bowlers in the Test, finished with 2-114 from 36 overs. However, Ajmal had the heaviest workload of the Pakistan bowlers, taking one for 95 from
