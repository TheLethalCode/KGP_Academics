 TEHRAN, Jul 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's police chief accused the opposition on Tuesday of "inciting sedition" after last month's disputed election and said his force would act firmly to uphold the law, the official IRNA news agency reported. "Some people who failed to realize their election goal go on spreading doubt (about the election result) in different ways and then turn that ... into inciting sedition," Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam said, without mentioning any names. "This group of individuals voice the slogan of law abidance but they themselves do not observe the law ... they are sheer liars," Ahmadi-Moghaddam said.
