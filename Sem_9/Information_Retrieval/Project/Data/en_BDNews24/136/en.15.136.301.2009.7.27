<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has asked the government to explain why the former NSI director general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury and former director Mohammed Shahabuddin will not be granted bail in the Chittagong 10-truck arms haul case, a lawyer said. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastgir Hossain and Mohammed Raisuddin on Monday ordered the government to answer on Haider's bail appeal in 10 days and on Shahabuddin's in two weeks. Shahabuddin submitted his prayer for bail on July 20, while Haider filed his in the same court a day earlier. Habibul Islam Bhuiyan argued Shahabuddin's case during the hearing of the bail appeal. Bhuiyan said at Monday's hearing that Shahabuddin deserved to be out on bail at this stage of investigation as he had been named neither in the case statement nor in the charge sheet. He was unlikely to abuse the bail if given, the lawyer told the court. After the court orders, he told reporters that the High Court has issued a rule on the government. The court later heard Haider's bail prayer. Former attorney general AJ Mohammad Ali in the hearing questioned Haider's detention on the basis of someone else's confessional statement implicating him. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and additional attorney general AKM Zahirul Alam opposed the two bail prayers. Deputy attorney general Jahid Sarwar Kajol assisted him. Shahabuddin was arrested in Dhaka on May 3 and Haider on May 16. On the night of April 1, 2004, 10 truckloads of sophisticated arms were seized at Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty. On April 4, an arms haul and an arms smuggling cases were filed with Karnafuli Police Station. bdnew
