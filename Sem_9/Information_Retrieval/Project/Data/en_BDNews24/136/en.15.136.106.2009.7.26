 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Hundreds of laid-off workers of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, who have been pressing the national carrier to reinstate their jobs, suspended an ongoing protest programme for 10 days following talks with Biman authorities on Sunday. The Biman board, meanwhile, says it has formed a committee to review the lay-off of nearly 2,000 workers. The former workers allege that they were forced into 'voluntary retirement'. The ex-employees were observing a sit-down protest in front of Biman headquarters in the capital on Sunday morning, when a team of their representatives met with Biman CEO and MD Muhammed Zakiul Islam. "The authorities have assured us of reinstating our jobs within 10 days, so we've suspended the protest," said KM Shah Alam, convener of the protest group, after the meeting. But Biman CEO and MD Muhammed Zakiul Islam said only that the committee, formed by the company's board on Saturday, would "come to a decision" within 10 days. Biman reviewing lay-offs Biman was transformed into a public limited company in July 2007, since when some 1,863 employees have been laid-off with redundancy pay-offs. A Tk 300 crore loan was taken from the World Bank to pay for the redundancy package. The Biman board has formed a committee to look at the situation, its chairman told bdnews24.com on Saturday. "The committee will submit its report after considering the feasibility of reinstating the former employees," said Biman chairman Jamal Uddin Ahmed following a board meeting. "The committee will forward the report to the government to make a final decision on the matter," said chairman Jamal Uddin Ahmed. Workers 'ready to return' redundancy pay-offs To date, 530 of laid off workers have petitioned the High Court for reinstatement of their jobs. The court has ruled on about half the petitions, ordering Biman to reinstate them. The rest are pending. The protesting workers say the Biman authorities have made no move to reinstate any jobs despite the High Court orders. Jamal told bdnews24.com on Saturday, "As the High Court verdicts have ordered reinstatement of some of the employees, it would not be fair to the others if similar action was not taken on their behalf." "But we can't reinstate the workers without governmental approval, or decide on what amount of redundancy money would be recouped from the former employees." KS Shah Alam, spokesperson for the laid-off workers, said they are ready to return their redundancy payments. The Biman committee is headed by AFM Mesbahuddin, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and a member of Biman's executive council. Biman's CEO and MD Mohammad Zakiul Islam, Iqbal Ahmed of Dhaka University's Institute of Business Administration and chartered accountant Shah Mohammad Zakaria Bhuiyan are also members. bdnews
