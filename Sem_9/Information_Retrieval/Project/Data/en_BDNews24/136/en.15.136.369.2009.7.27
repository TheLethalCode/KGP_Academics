 BEIRUT, Mon Jul 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah threatened to attack Tel Aviv if Israel were to bomb Beirut's southern suburbs, a bastion of the powerful Shi'ite military and political group. Hezbollah fought against Israel three years ago in a 34-day war after the group captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid.

The United Nations, which has peacekeepers based in the south, said there are signs the stockpile belonged to Hezbollah, and added that the presence of these arms were a violation of Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the war. Israel has also said the arms cache belonged to Hezbollah. A Hezbollah lawmaker would only say the blast was a one-off accident that involved the explosion of an arms cache that had been in place before the 2006 war. He denied the explosion was a violation of resolution 1701. Lebanon has also arrested recently more than 50 people, including three Lebanese army colonels, for spying for Israel. Lebanon has described the arrests as a major blow to Israel's intelligence gathering and has formally complained to the UN Security Council about its findings. There has been no official word from Is
