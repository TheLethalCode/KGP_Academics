 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)The High Court allowed interim bail for former president of the BNP-backed Doctor's Association of Bangladesh, AZM Zahid Hossain, in a lottery fraud case on Sunday. The bench of justices Md Abdul Wahab Mia and Md Abdur Razzak granted Hossain, now behind bars, interim bail against his appeal in the case for the duration of the proceedings. The court also asked the government to answer within four weeks why Hossain should not be given permanent bail. Hossain's lawyer Ahsanul Karim told reporters the High Court had previously granted him bail in an illegal wealth case, in which he was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in May last year. "There is no barrier for him to be free as he secured bail in the only other case against him today," said Karim. Hossain was sent to jail after his surrender to a Dhaka court in the illegal wealth case on May 13 this year. A fraud case, accusing him of involvement in a lottery scam at Dhaka Shishu (Children's) Hospital, was filed against him with a special judge's court on June 16. bd
