 Dhaka, Jul 21 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun returned home Tuesday night after undergoing medical treatment abroad. She landed in Dhaka at around 11.45pm, on a Singapore Airlines flight, after a three-week absence. "The home minister is fully recovered," the ministry's public relations officer Shahenur Miah said the day before her return. Sahara left for Singapore on July 1 to be admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, after she injured her right sight in a fall at her home on June 29. With her departure, and the absence of junior minister Tanjim Ahmed, the home ministry had been without a minister at its head for 21 days. Tanjim, popularly known as Sohel Taj, departed for the USA at the start of June following rumours of his resignation. The home ministry said at the time Tanjim had taken leave. He was expected to return by July 3. Media reports on Sunday quoted Tanjim, speaking from the US, saying he had not returned to Bangladesh as he had filed his resignation on May 31, prior to his departure. bdnews
