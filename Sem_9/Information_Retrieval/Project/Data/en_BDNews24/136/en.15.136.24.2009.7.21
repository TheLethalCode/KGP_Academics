<TITLE> WDB to start dredging Jamuna at Sirajganj </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Water Development Board is going to start capital dredging of the Jamuna river channel in an attempt to protect the already breached Sirajganj town flood barrier from further damage and avert any risk to the guide embankments of the Jamuna Bridge, officials said Tuesday. An 11-member team of BWDB officials, led by additional director general Md. Habibur Rahman Zinnah, began bathymetrical, or hydrographic, surveys Tuesday morning, of the Jamuna river on the eastern side of the damaged portion of the Sirajganj embankment's Hard-Point. After completing the emergency survey, the BWDB will start dredging the channel on a pilot basis to avert the river-course on the east side of the Hard-Point. 'If the project is successful, Sirajganj town as well as the guide embankments of the Jamuna Bridge will be protected from erosion," Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com. BWDB director general Md. Abul Kalam Azad held an emergency meeting with water board officials, including Rahman and chief engineers, at Sirajganj on Monday night. Azad said, "After receiving an urgent order from the prime minister through the water resources ministry, we organised a meeting to prepare for the bathymetric survey of the river-flow and subsequent capital dredging." He said it would be "very tough and costly" to dredge the Jamuna river as it carries a huge amount of sediment every year. "But we hope to continue this project in a permanent way, to prevent the channel filling up with sand and the scouring of the embankment." Md. Jashim Uddin, chief engineer (design) said they were already prepared for the dredging project in Sirajganj as the prime minister had given directives in recent months for capital dredging of all major rivers in the country. Chief engineer (dredging) Md. Sultan Mahmud said, "A dredger has already been brought to Sirajganj district to dredge at least 400-cubic metres of sand per hour and another will arrive soon." "It's not really the usual time for dredging the Jamuna. It is best to start such work from November to February as the Jamuna is now rain-fed with the monsoon. " In the mean time, many shoals have arisen including two big ones on the south and the north side of the Jamuna Bridge. BWDB engineers also think these shoals could be affecting the flow and current of the river and may have caused the sudden erosion and collapse of the Sirajganj embankment. Two breaches this month, on July 10 and July 17, led to the collapse of a 1000-foot section along the Hard-Point of the town's flood protection barrier. The water resources minister after visiting the site of the second breach gave the prime minister an alarming report, said officials. Md Wahiduzzaman, secretary of the water resources ministry, after his visit to the site said the current technology for bathymetrical, or hydrographic, surveys was inadequate to deal with the Jamuna, known as one of the world's most unpredictable rivers. "We have to understand the laws of nature first. The Jamuna is one of the most unpredictable rivers in the world and it will not follow our commands," he said. Korean construction giant Hyundai gave a 100-year guarantee for the 2.5 km long Sirajganj barrier's Hard-Point, built in the 1990s at a cost of Tk 335 core on a design by Sir William Halcrow & Partners Ltd of Belgium.
