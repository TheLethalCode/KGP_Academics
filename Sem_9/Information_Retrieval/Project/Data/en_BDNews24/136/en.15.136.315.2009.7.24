 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)  It was a different kind of homecoming for Bangladesh captain Masrafe Bin Mortaza who had to fight off emotion and take comfort from a historic triumph on his return to Dhaka on Friday, albeit rather prematurely, half way through the series in the West Indies. Mortaza, out of action with a knee injury suffered during the first Test, arrived with team-mates Shahadat Hossain and Sahagir Hossain in the morning. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr, the other player not part of the Tigers' ODI squad, has stayed back in England to consult an eye specialist and will return on Monday. The three players were greeted with applause the moment they came out into the VIP terminal of Zia International Airport with the waiting media and Airport staff hailing the members from Bangladesh's first overseas Test series winning squad. A far cry from the unsavory response players had experienced after the disappointment of the ICC World T20. People scurried for photographs while those who couldn't get near waved from a distance and the cricketers responded. "This is normal life for an international cricketer. There will be criticism when you don't play well. We don't play cricket to prove people right or wrong. Thankfully the players took the disparaging reaction after the loss to Ireland in the World T20 positively. We decided to forget about Ireland and turned things around in the West Indies. That made me most happy," Mortaza was quoted as saying by TigerCricket.com, the official website of Bangladesh Cricket Board. "We had been playing good cricket for seven-eight months. We pushed teams like New Zealand and Sri Lanka really close and the players were confident that a result was just around the corner. One Twenty20 loss to Ireland doesn't wipe out the good cricket we played before that." Mortaza appreciated the effort of the top-order batsmen in the series. "That had been one of our areas of concern in the past but Tamim (Iqbal) was excellent in the opening slot. Imrul (Kayes), Junaed and some others may not have made big runs to show but balanced that by staying at the crease for long periods. Spending time at the wicket is decisive in Test cricket." About the supposed pressure after the T20 defeat to Ireland and facing a relatively unknown West Indies side Mortaza said the team's planning never changed. "We had planned for Gayle and Co. but then their line up changed. We couldn't do anything about that and decided to stick to the same plan against players we didn't know much about. We executed our plan really well and it worked." Regarding the injury to his right knee Mortaza informed that he would be seeing his surgeon Dr David Young in Australia. "I'm still not sure about the extent of the damage. I've heard that there could be a bit of internal bleeding probably. I will have to travel abroad and get it checked and we'll see whether surgery is required or not. But I'm confident that I would return to cricket pretty soon." The skipper refused to call himself a lucky captain despite the team's achievement in the Caribbean in his presence. "Luck didn't really smile on me did it? Otherwise I would have been on the field now. But it was a fantastic moment. We did something which never happened to Bangladesh cricket. I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I was not playing for most part. Our cricket could only go forward from here. We are not going to win every game from now on but I believe you will see more consistency because the boys have confidence and belief in their abilities." An all-smiling Shahadat described how wonder-struck he was when Shakib Al Hasan blasted that six to seal the whitewash for the Tigers. "I couldn't tell what was going through my mind and then Mushie (Mushfiqur Rahim) shook me up and told me 'do you realise that we have won the series'?" Shahadat also saw the Bangladesh spinners having a say in the ODI series starting Sunday while admitting it wasn't a memorable Test series for the Bangladesh pacers. "I am disappointed with my bowling. We played on wickets where you had to bowl long spells to get wickets. I didn't do that and that's probably the reason why I wasn't successful. The pitches are slow in the Caribbean and we have Shakib who is super and then (Abdur) Razzak, Riyad (Mahmudullah) and Naeem (Islam). I expect the spinners to do well in the ODIs." Rookie of the team Sahagir Hossain didn't get a game in the West Indies but was proud to be part of history nevertheless. "Obviously I would have been happier if I had played but the feeling of winning a Test series on my first trip with the National teamit is still a most memorable experience," said the wicketkeeper. There was also another thing Sahagir would cherish for the rest of his life. He was first out of the blocks to get on to the field after Shakib had taken Tino Best's wicket in the first Test to give Bangladesh victory but was beaten to the stumps by Enamul. He wasn't to be denied at Grenada though. "He (Enamul) beat me in the race to get hold of a stump in the first Test but Riyad had kept one for me at Gren
