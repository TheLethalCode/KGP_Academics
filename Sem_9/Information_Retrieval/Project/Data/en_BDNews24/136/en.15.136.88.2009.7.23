 PHUKET, Thailand, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A loud blast near a major Asia security meeting in Thailand on Thursday was caused by a suspicious motorbike being destroyed, Thai security officials said. The officials told reporters the bike had been left unattended near the venue of the meeting on the resort island of Phuket and the owner could not be found. It was destroyed with water cannon, they said. Among the participants at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) gathering inside a luxury hotel complex was US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Some 10,000 Thai troops have enforced tight security around the venue to prevent an embarrassing repeat of the last regional gathering in Thailand in April, when anti-government demonstrators breached security to scuttle the East Asia Summit, forcing half the leaders to be evacuated by helicopter
