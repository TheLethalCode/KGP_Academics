 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of former Biman Bangladesh Airlines staff, made redundant since the national carrier turned into a public limited company two years ago, were staging their second sit-down protest in a week in front of Balaka Bhaban, the Biman headquarters, on Sunday morning. The Biman board, meanwhile, says it has formed a committee to review the lay-off of almost 2,000 employees. "Our programme will go on until our demands are met," said KS Shah Alam, convener of an action group for reinstatement of the jobs, during Sunday's protest. The former employees began their sit-in from 9am. They held a similar protest exactly a week before. Biman was transformed into a public limited company in July 2007, since when some 1,863 employees have been laid-off with redundancy pay-offs. A Tk 300 crore loan was taken from the World Bank to pay for the redundancy package. The disgruntled former employees allege that they were forced to go into 'voluntary retirement'. Biman now reviewing lay-offs The Biman board has formed a committee to look at the situation, its chairman told bdnews24.com on Saturday. "The committee will submit its report after considering the feasibility of reinstating the former employees," said Biman chairman Jamal Uddin Ahmed following a board meeting. The committee is headed by AFM Mesbahuddin, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and a member of Biman's executive council. Biman's CEO and MD Mohammad Zakiul Islam, Iqbal Ahmed of Dhaka University's Institute of Business Administration and chartered accountant Shah Mohammad Zakaria Bhuiyan are also members. "The committee will forward the report to the government to make a final decision on the matter," said chairman Jamal Uddin Ahmed. To date, 530 of laid off workers have petitioned the High Court for reinstatement of their jobs. The court has ruled on about half the petitions, ordering Biman to reinstate them. The rest are pending. The protesting workers say the Biman authorities have made no move to reinstate any jobs despite the High Court orders. Jamal told bdnews24.com on Saturday, "As the High Court verdicts have ordered reinstatement of some of the employees, it would not be fair to the others if similar action was not taken on their behalf." "But we can't reinstate the workers without governmental approval, or decide on what amount of redundancy money would be recouped from the former employees." KS Shah Alam, spokesperson for the laid-off workers, said they are ready to return their redundancy payments. b
