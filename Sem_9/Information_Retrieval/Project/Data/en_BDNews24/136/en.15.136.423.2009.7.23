 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has assured entrepreneurs of the country's budding software industry of a supportive legal framework. "The government will enact proper laws to protect the industry and allow it to flourish," he said at the inauguration of a two-day workshop for entrepreneurs on the legal aspects of IT export. Shafique mentioned that at least 50 Bangladeshi companies are currently exporting software to more than 30 countries throughout the world including USA, Canada and Japan. "IT is playing an important role in the world economy and has created enthusiasm among our young entrepreneurs," he said. He acknowledged that proper laws were necessary for protection of their intellectual property rights, international trade marks and registration to protect the developing industry against piracy. "These laws are especially significant for signing product-export treaties and financial transaction these," he said. The workshop, part of an ongoing four-year (2008-2012) coaching programme, was jointly organised by Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries and the Netherlands-based Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries . DCCI president Zafar Osman said the knowledge and skills from the training programme would help entrepreneurs involved in outsourcing IT and understanding the legal aspects of export to Europe. Netherlands Ambassador Bea Ten Tusscher, CBI consultants Laszlo Klucs and Dimdtri Timme, DCCI senior vice president MM Shakil Chowdhury and vice president Sirajuddin Malik were present among others. b
