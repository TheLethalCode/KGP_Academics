 ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Wednesday renewed calls for the United States to provide his country with advanced military technology and weapons to help in the battle against Taliban militants in the northwest. During discussions with visiting U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, Gilani said the United States should share "real-time, credible and actionable intelligence" with Pakistan and provide drone technology as well as better military equipment and ammunition to help it fight militants on its own. He also called for the early passage of a bill by the U.S. Congress that would triple U.S. aid to Pakistan, and asked for money to help more than two million people displaced by the fighting in the northwestern Swat valley over two months ago to go home. "The prime minister urged the U.S. and other friendly countries to come forward in a big way to help Pakistan in the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase," a statement from Gilani's office said. The United Nations has so far received only 43 percent of an appeal it made in May for $543 million in aid to avoid a humanitarian crisis, according to a U.N. statement on Tuesday. Holbrooke said the United States was committing $165 million of the $330 million already pledged. "The disbursement of these previously pledged fund will boost the capacity of critical programmes to meet changing needs of displaced families in Pakistan," he told a news conference. Holbrooke's visit comes as U.S. forces gear up for a major offensive in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, having in the first three weeks of July suffered their worst monthly casualty toll in the eight-year-war. U.S. PLEDGES SUPPORT Pakistan has moved forces to its southwest province of Baluchistan to support the U.S. strategy and stop Taliban fighters fleeing across the border from Helmand. The army is also preparing for its own campaign against Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in the South Waziristan tribal region. But the main fighting continues in Pakistan's northwest, following the offensive launched by the army nearly three months ago against a Taliban stronghold in the Swat valley. That operation is in its final stages, but there pockets of resistance remain and the army has inflicted heavy casualties on militants who have fled to neighbouring Lower Dir district. The Pakistani military said on Wednesday it had killed 27 militants in the past 24 hours, mostly in Lower Dir, where troops killed over 50 militants in fighting on Sunday and Monday. The military says it has killed nearly 1,800 militants since the Swat offensive began. Independent estimates are unavailable and critics say few guerrilla leaders have been eliminated. Violence across northwest Pakistan and the spread of Taliban influence have heightened concerns about insecurity in the nuclear-armed country, a key ally in the West's mission to stabilise Afghanistan and destroy al Qaeda. U.S. President Barack Obama has put Afghanistan and Pakistan at the centre of his foreign policy agenda, and made Holbrooke his special envoy for the two countries. Holbrooke also met army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, and was due to also meet with President Asif Ali Zardari and the head of the military's Inter-Services Intelligence, Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shujaa Pasha. The U.S. House of Representatives last month approved tripling U.S. aid to Pakistan to about $1.5 billion a year for each of the next five years in a key part of U.S. strategy to combat extremism with economic and social development. "The administration I am representing, the administration of Barack Obama, is committed to supporting Pakistan and its people during this complicated, challenging time," Holbrooke said.
