 SEOUL, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Manchester United never considered cutting their Asia tour short in the wake of the hotel bombings in Jakarta and the team remains committed to its "exceptional" fanbase in the region, coach Alex Ferguson said on Thursday. The English champions had to skip the Indonesia leg of their tour after deadly suicide bomb attacks on the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels killed nine people and injured 53. The United team had been due to stay at the Ritz-Carlton two days later. "Never there was at any time a suggestion for us to go back home," Ferguson told a news conference. "We did not have any players wanting to go back home. "We're committed to be here for the duration and that's what we came here to do."

Park went on to become the first Asian to play in the Champions League final when United were beaten by Barcelona in May, but had to overcome the massive disappointment of being dropped by Ferguson a year earlier for the glittering European final against Chelsea. "Here he's developed technical and tactical ability and become an important player for us. These are the reasons why I think he's fantastic with us." David Gill, the club's chief executive officer, confirmed United were looking to extend Park's contract but did not provide further det
