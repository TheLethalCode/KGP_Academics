 KABUL, Mon Jul 27(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan has struck a ceasefire deal with Taliban insurgents in a remote province, a presidential spokesman said on Monday, the first move of its kind amid an escalation of violence ahead of elections next month. The truce was reached on Saturday in northwestern Badghis province, near the border with Turkmenistan, spokesman Seyamak Herawi said. The government wanted to make similar deals with the Taliban in other parts of the country in a bid to improve security for the Aug. 20 presidential election, he said. "As long as the ceasefire holds, the government does not have the intention to attack the Taliban (in Badghis). And the Taliban can also take part in the elections," Herawi told Reuters. Violence across Afghanistan has escalated since thousands of US Marines began a major offensive in southern Helmand this month. Attacks have been less frequent in remote Badghis compared with Taliban strongholds in the south and the east. The truce was arranged after mediation between Taliban leaders in Badghis and tribal elders and other influential figures in the province, Herawi said. Under the deal, the Taliban agreed not to attack election candidates in the province and to allow them to set up campaign offices. President Hamid Karzai is a clear front-runner to win the election, Afghanistan's second direct vote for president. The Helmand offensive is the first major operation under US President Barack Obama's new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and its militant Islamist allies and stabilise Afghani
