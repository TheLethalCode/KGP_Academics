 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Royal Chinese astrologers Hi and Ho were awarded death sentences for not being able to portend the solar eclipse in 2159 BC. We too have many superstitions in our society regarding solar eclipse. It was once forbidden for anyone to eat during an eclipse and food cooked during the eclipse had to be disposed of. Some still say, if an expectant mother eats something during an eclipse her child will be born a glutton; is she cuts or chops anything, especially fish, the child will be born with damaged lips, ears or nose; if she breaks or twists the branches of a tree, the child will be born with polio. Even, watching the eclipse is forbidden by many in fear of the rahu , a mythical beast, that eats up the sun. Today, we know that the eclipse takes place because the moon comes between the sun and the earth. The Babylonians, over 4000 years ago, discovered that an eclipse takes place somewhere on earth every 6,585 days or 18 years 11 days and one-third of a day. It is assumed that the Greek philosopher Thales could presage a solar eclipse by learning from the Babylonians. Between 310320 BC another Greek, Aristarchus, first imagined that the earth and other planets move round the sun. Later, due to the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle and the dominance of church the geocentric theory that the sun moves round the earth became predominant. Nicholas Copernicus first presented a scientific heliocentric model explaining the movements of planets around the sun, seasonal changes and other significant cosmic events. Later, the discoveries and struggles of Tyco Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilee established the theory. For their contribution many of them had to face the wrath of the religious leaders for heresy. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) was burned at the stake and Galileo Galilee (1564-1642) was impounded in a dungeon. bd
