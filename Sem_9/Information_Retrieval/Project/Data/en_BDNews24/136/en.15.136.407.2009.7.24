 ISLAMABAD, Fri Jul 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A proposed partnership between France and Pakistan on civilian nuclear energy will be limited to nuclear safety and security, a senior French official said on Thursday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in May that France had agreed to transfer civilian nuclear technology to Pakistan, giving it a deal similar to the one its rival India had obtained from the United States. Such a move would cause concern in the international community. A Pakistani scientist was at the centre of the world's biggest nuclear proliferation scandal in 2004, and fears remain that sensitive technology could leak out again. Anne-Marie Idrac, minister for foreign trade, on Thursday clarified what would be the scope of any cooperation deal. "What we propose is something very important, which is the possibility for technical people to discuss very precisely what can be done in terms of safety and security for the existing civil nuclear plants," she said during a visit to Pakistan. "This question is to be settled within the framework of the international commitments to which France is a party, and any cooperation is subject to international agreements." The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group, which was created after India tested its first nuclear weapon in 1974 and seeks to keep nuclear technology from falling into the wrong hands, agreed in September to lift a ban on nuclear trade with India. The waiver, won after years of lobbying by the United States, paved the way for a US-India nuclear deal under which India can receive sensitive nuclear technology even though it has not signed up to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Pakistan, which has also not signed the NPT, has dismissed concerns about the safety of its nuclear arsenal and its proliferation history and insists it too is worthy of such treatment. Scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, revered by many Pakistanis as the father of the country's nuclear bomb, confessed to selling nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya in 2004. He was pardoned at the time by the government and put under house arrest, but a Pakistani court released him in February. Idrac said France and Pakistan were also discussing agreements in areas such as defence and security, trade and investment. Some deals could be signed when President Nicolas Sarkozy visits Pakistan later this year, she added. French companies are looking at projects in the transport, energy, water treatment and food sectors, including a government-backed water project in the eastern city of Lahore by French utility group Veolia, she
