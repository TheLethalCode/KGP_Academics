 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)The Netherlands is interested to work on climate change adaptation and disaster management with Bangladesh in international forums, the outgoing Dutch envoy says. "Like Bangladesh, the Netherlands is a big delta and also under the threat of climate change," Bea ten Tusscher said at a farewell meeting with food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak at his office on Tuesday. She also praised Bangladesh for its success against natural disaster management and climate change. On the recent meeting of the food minister with ambassadors and representatives of development partners, she said, "Development partner countries and organisations knew about Bangladesh's disaster management strategy from the meeting and it has created the scope for discussion on probable assistance from those countries." Razzak said alongside other natural disasters Bangladesh was also at earthquake risk. The government was raising a volunteers' group in risky Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet zone to face the post-earthquake situation. "Now the volunteers group is undergoing training." "The government has already handed over some post-earthquake operational equipment to the armed forces, fire service and civil defence. A Tk 70 crore proposal for equipment procurement has been approved by ECNEC," he added. On ambassador's proposal for a solution to unresolved Rohingya refugee problem, the minister said, "Bangladesh cannot bear the burden of Rohingya problem for an indefinite period. It should be resolved quickly. The Netherlands could provide assistance on the issue." bd
