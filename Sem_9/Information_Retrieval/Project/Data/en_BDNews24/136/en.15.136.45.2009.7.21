 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has recommended formation of an industrial intelligence unit to resist labour unrest, especially in the ready-made-garments sector. The parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment also urged garment owners to change the culture of non-payment of wages, considered to be the main cause of labour strife. "We have asked the ministry to take measures for the formation of an industrial intelligence unit to operate at every industrial establishment," committee chairman Shajahan Khan told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "This unit, if formed, will be able to report in advance to the government so that authorities can thwart the disreputable groups like the jhut (rag) traders who are mainly responsible for troubles in the ready-made-garment factories," he said. Khan, a labour leader, said the innocent workers were in no way involved in vandalism in the garment industry. The standing committee made the recommendations as vandalism and ransacking of garment factories have become regular features in Bangladesh. Last month, three days of rioting in an industrial zone on the outskirts of the capital left two workers dead and a factory ablaze. "The committee has also suggested garment factory owners stop the jhut trade, one of the main causes of labour vandalism, at the factories." "The rag products of all factories should be deposited and sold at designated sites," said Khan. He said the committee had also asked the ministry to work with garment factory owners to set up a hostel for female garment workers in Narayanganj. Khan told bdnews24.com his committee members would visit a site in Narayanganj on August 4 to view a possible plot for construction of the hostel. "If the hostel is built, at least 1,200 women workers will get lodging facilities there," said Khan. "The place is at present under illegal occupation," he said. The committee chairman said the ministry should work closely with the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and development partners to built the hostel for female workers. Committee members Shahiduzzaman Sarker, Israfil Alam, Rowshan Jahan Shathi, Mosharraf Hossain, Monoranjan Shil Gopal, Noni Gopal Mondal and Abdus Sattar attended the meeting.
