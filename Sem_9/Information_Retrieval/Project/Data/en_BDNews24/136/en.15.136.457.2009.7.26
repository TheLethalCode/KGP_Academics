 LONDON, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Inter Milan's former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira wants to join Tottenham Hotspur and would be a great role model, said manager Harry Redknapp. "He can stay at Milan but he's willing (to come). "He's thinking: 'I had a great time at Arsenal and now I want to come and be a great player for Tottenham for a couple of years'," Redknapp told reporters. The 33-year-old France international had a distinguished career at Premier League Tottenham's north London rivals Arsenal and such a move would be highly controversial. Vieira played 406 games for Arsenal in nine seasons, winning three league titles and three FA Cups, and it would be a major surprise for the fans of both clubs if he joined Spurs. Asked if he was surprised Vieira wanted to come, Redknapp said: "Yes, it's a courageous move isn't it?". "If he comes and plays well the fans will love him, why shouldn't they, and they'll probably think they've got one over on Arsenal because we've taken one of their great players. "It will even it out with Sol Campbell perhaps," he added, referring to the ex-Spurs captain and England defender who joined Arsenal in 2001 on a free transfer sparking an outcry among angry Tottenham fans who felt betrayed. The Spurs manager believes Vieira still has a lot to offer and it would be a real coup if he could sign him. "I think Patrick would improve us. He would give us a real presence in the team. He's been there, he's done it all, he's a fantastic professional. He's a leader," said Redknapp. "You need people who have been there and done it and won it and that's what he would give you. "He's got a good contract there (Milan) but he's definitely interested and I'm interested in him coming. The players will respond to him. He's a proper professional. "He was a legend at Arsenal and he wants to come to Tottenham to play, not for the money. The money is probably a third of the money he was earning at Milan. "He wants to come because he wants to play football. He would bring an awful lot to our football
