 Pabna, July 23 (bdnews24.com)--A Pabna public prosecutor, also a local Awami League leader, was stabbed by a gang of assailants on Thursday reportedly due to a local party feud, the police and locals said. Belayet Ali Billu, 45, the joint secretary of Pabna district AL and a public prosecutor at Pabna judge's court, was taken to the sadar hospital. Belayet told reporters that some 10-12 assailants intercepted him in Rai Bahadur gate area while he was going to the judge's court on a motorbike and attacked him with knives at around 9:30am. Unidentified attackers the day before had attacked Pabna district AL office secretary and an assistant public prosecutor Ahad Babu. Belayet and Ahad were loyal to rival factions, local AL leaders said. Pabna Sadar police chief Motiar Rahman told reporters that they suspected that Belayet was attacked in a reprisal for Wednesday's incident. Police were looking for the assailants, he said. Pabana district AL and Jubo League jointly brought out a procession protesting against the attack on Belayet. The lawyers of the judge's court are observing a work abstention demanding arrest of the attackers. bdn
