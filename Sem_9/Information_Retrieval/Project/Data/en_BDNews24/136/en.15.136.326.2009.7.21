<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)All important "clear skies" have been forecast for viewing Wednesday's total solar eclipse, a met official said. "There can be cloud cover in the mornings at this time of year, but the skies will be mostly clear over the country on Wednesday for the eclipse," senior meteorologist Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. The full event will take two hours, from around 7-9am but the total eclipse, visible only in the north of Bangladesh, will take place between 7:55am and 8am. Depending on where you are in the country, the range of the fullest eclipse will be between 83 percent and 100 percent eclipse. Dinajpur, Lalmonirhat, Panchagarh and Thakurgaon will see the total eclipse, its longest duration will be 2-3 minutes in those places. Other places will view a partial eclipse at the height of the event. Dhaka will see a 93 percent eclipse. "The upper layers of the atmosphere will hold some moisture in the early morning, but this should have cleared by 7am," Abdul Mannan said. The meteorologist said temperatures countrywide would fall several degrees during the celestial event. "The morning temperatures at this time of year range between 16-18 degrees Centigrade across the country. They will fall by between 3-5 degrees Centigrade as the sun's rays are blocked by the moon." He said the eclipse would also affect the tide in coastal districts, as the moon, sun and earth came into alignment. "It will cause the tide to be about 1-2 cm higher than normal," he said, adding that one fifth of the normal tidal pull was caused by the sun and four fifths by the proximity of the moon. bdnews24.com is sponsoring 24 observation camps hosted by Bangladesh Astronomical Association across the country for safe viewing of this once-in-a-lifetime celestial event. Bangladesh will have to wait for another 105 years to see another full solar eclipse, on June 2, 2114. Wednesday's will be the longest lasting total solar eclipse in our lifetimes, unsurpassed until June 13, 2132.
