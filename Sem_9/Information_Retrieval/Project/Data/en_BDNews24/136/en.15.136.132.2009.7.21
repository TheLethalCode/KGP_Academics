<TITLE> Myanmar, N.Korea arms links would be a worry - Clinton </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Jul 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that any military cooperation between North Korea and Myanmar could pose a threat to Myanmar's neighbours in Southeast Asia. "We know that there are also growing concerns about military cooperation between North Korea and Burma, which we take very seriously. It would be destabilising for the region. It would pose a direct threat to Burma's neighbours," she told a news conference in Bangkok. Army-ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, and communist North Korea are both expected to have representatives at a regional security forum on the Thai island of Phuket on Thursday, which Clinton will also attend. North Korea tested a nuclear device in May and test-launched seven ballistic missiles earlier this month in defiance of a U.N. resolution. A North Korean ship tracked by the U.S. Navy on suspicion of carrying a banned arms cargo, possibly missile parts, in June and early July was rumoured to be heading for Myanmar, but in the end never docked there. "It is something, as a treaty ally of Thailand, that we are taking very seriously," Clinton said, referring to the reported links between North Korea and Myanmar, which shares a border with Thailand. "Our position is that we are willing to have a more productive partnership with Burma if they take steps that are self-evident," she added. "End the political prisoners in detention who have been rounded up by the government and other steps that Burma knows it could take; end the violence against their own people, including the minorities ...; end the mistreatment of Aung San Suu Kyi." Pro-democracy leader Suu Kyi has spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention in Myanmar, mostly under house arrest at her lakeside home in the former capital, Yangon. She is currently on trial, charged with breaching security laws when an uninvited American swam across the lake and spent two days in her home. The trial is widely seen as a trumped-up affair that the military regime will use to keep Suu Kyi out of the way until after elections due next year. Adding to the international outrage over her treatment, it is being held behind closed doors.
