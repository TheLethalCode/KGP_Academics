 Chittagong, July 23 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Railway has formed two separate committees to investigate the latest in a series of countrywide rail disasters, as a passenger train collided with an articulated lorry on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Feni on Thursdayexactly one week after a similar accident killed five people on their way to a wedding in Jessore. At least ten people were injured as three compartments of the Chittagong-bound Turna-Nishitha Express derailed after it hit the loaded lorry stuck at Fatehpur level crossing in the early morning. The injured, including the train driver, assistant train driver and two security guards, were admitted to local clinics, said officials. The rail link between Dhaka and Chittagong was down for 12 hours. Road transport on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway was also halted due to the accident. Traffic was diverted to Feni town for taking the highway. "Rail communication was restored just before 5pm," Feni assistant railway station master Mohammed Harun told bdnews24.com. He said the lorry carrying iron coils stalled while negotiating the level crossing at around 5am. As the express train smashed into the stalled vehicle, three of its compartments were thrown off the track. A rescue train arrived at the scene of the accident from Chittagong at around 7am. The train was removed from the level crossing at around 9am. A police team led by assistant superintendent of police Shakila Sultana oversaw the rescue operations. Railway deputy director (mass communication) Shafiuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com two four-member committees were formed to investigate the accident. One is headed by the East Zone's chief engineer Noor Muhammad. The other is being led by acting Chittagong divisional railway transportation officer AM Shahnewaz. "Both teams have been instructed to submit their investigation reports as soon as possible," said Shafiuddin. He said a number of scheduled trains were suspended throughout the day. The Dhaka-Chittagong bound Subarna Express, Karnaphuli Express and the Chandpur-bound Sagorika Express mail train were cancelled on the day due to the accident. The Chittagong-Dhaka-bound Mohanagar Prabhati and the Sylhet-bound Paharika Express were delayed by hours. Trains resumed as normal after 5pm. "There was no further delay in the evening schedule," he said. Series of rail disasters Thursday's disaster is the third rail crossing collision in under two months. Just a week before, on July 17, five members of a bridal party were killed and ten others injured when a train crashed into a microbus at Mandatala rail crossing in Jessore's Sadar Upazila. Exactly a month before that, in Dhaka on June 17, the Jamuna Express from Kamlapur Station crashed into a minibus as it was stuck on the Moghbazar rail crossing, one of the capital's busiest intersections at the tail end of a rush-hour traffic jam. The train, without having time to slow down, rammed into the vehicle, which was tossed off the rail line and in turn smashed into four nearby cars, almost flattening them. The passengers of the minibus had all managed to disembarked when the crash occurred. TV footage, caught by a passing news cameraman, depicted the shocking collision in detail. At least two other major rail accidents have occurred in the past month alone. In Dhaka again, one person died and two rail employees were suspended after suspected signal errors led to a head-on collision between two trains at Kamalapur Station on June 22. The Mahanagar Probhati Intercity, coming from Chittagong, ran into the Mymensingh-bound Isha Kha Express at around 2.30pm, as the latter was waiting to pull out of the capital's busy central terminus. On July 2, four passenger coaches of the Kanchan Express mail train derailed in Thakurgaon. No casualties were reported as the train was travelling at low speed. Rail officials said the monsoon was hampering the newly laid Dinajpur-Thakurgaon-Panchagarh track. They said six trains had suffered derailment along the route since January as the new track had "yet to settle". In the worst such disaster of recent years, at least 30 people were killed and 40 injured on July 11, 2006 when a speeding train crashed into a jam-packed passenger bus at an unmanned rail crossing in Joypurhat. bdn
