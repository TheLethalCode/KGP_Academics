 BUENOS AIRES, July 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Diego Maradona, linked this week with Portsmouth's new, rich Middle Eastern owner, said he would never hide anything from his Argentina team. "In the national team I want people who are loyal to me...(and) The Mascheranos, Messis, Agueros will always have what's best for them," Maradona said on Friday.

FIFA have approved the Rosario Central ground provided the AFA make some refurbishments to the changing rooms and press and VIP stands. Argentina have only lost one qualifier at home and that was at River Plate where they were humbled 5-0 by Colombia on September 5, 1993.
