 Sylhet, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  India's Border Security Force retreated Monday from illegally erecting barbed wire fencing along the Jakiganj border in the face of protests by Bangladesh Rifles, a BDR officer said. The Indian border force had started erecting barbed wire fencing at 9am within 150 yards of no-man's land on the bank of the Kushiara river facing Jakiganj market, said Jakiganj BDR camp commander Nayek Subedar Mozammel Haque. The Bangladesh border force at Jakiganj, on receiving information, protested the move at 11am. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Haque said he had held a parley with BSF company commander Birendra Pal at Karimganj river station at 11am. "BSF claimed that they had initiated the fence building to prevent smuggling and intrusion," he said. "Bangladesh Rifles requested them not to violate international laws by erecting any illegal installation in no-man's land," said Haque. bdn
