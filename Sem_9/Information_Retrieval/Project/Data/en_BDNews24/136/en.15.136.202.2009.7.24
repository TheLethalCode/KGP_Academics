 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)--Grassroots women's participation was lower than expected at Friday's national council in spite of Awami League high command's insistence. Very few women councillors and representatives were seen in the council and the ratio was 1: 10 in favour of men. Awami League president Sheikh Hasina encouraged women's participation in politics at the national council. "Awami League is working for women's development. Many women represent the Awami League's cabinet," she told the council in Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. "We are thinking of appointing women as speaker and deputy speaker in the future." "We have initiated free healthcare and public transport facility for women aged over 60. The policy on women's development that was formulated in our last term will be implemented soon." Most of the women at the council were from the capital, working as volunteers. A woman leader, Tahmina Siddika, has been in politics for more than 30 years and the president of Kalkini Upazila Awami League unit in Madaripur for the last 13 years. She is leading an 11-member representative team from Kalkini upazila in the council. She is the only female member in the team. Awareness building can raise women's participation in politics and that will help them become aware of their rights, Siddika said. "Bangladeshi women have little social awareness. They will be active in politics if they are made politically conscious. Once they are politically active, they will know their rights." "Many problems stalking women such as family persecution and dowry will then be then solved." Councillor Kamrunnahar came from Lohagara of Chittagong. She is the law secretary of Chittagong south unit. "There are only 30 women among 300 councilors and representatives from Chittagong," she added. She had joined the council in 2002. Councillor Ismat Ara Sadek, working committee member of Keshabpur thana unit of Jessore, was the only woman from Keshabpur. She took to politics inspired by his late husband, former Awami League education minister AHSK Sadek. bdn
