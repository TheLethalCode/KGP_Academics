<TITLE> Tigers focus on ODI series </TITLE>

 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  A buoyant Bangladesh will be hoping to continue their good form as well as to christen international cricket's newest venue with victory when they take on West Indies in the first of three one-day internationals at Windsor Park in Dominica on Sunday. The visitors swept the Test series winning both matches against the makeshift West Indies, who are still considered a weakened side following a boycott by their leading players over payment and contract issues. "We are looking forward to the ODI series too and we want to continue winning," stand-in-captain Shakib Al Hasan had earlier said after the first-ever away Test series win. "The boys have been playing really well, and God willing, we can also win the ODI series," said Shakib who was given the responsibility to guide the side after regular captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza was ruled out following a knee injury. Shakib, however, rested in the lone one-day warm-up match where Bangladesh led by Mushfiqur Rahim recorded a 16-run win over University of West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI. The team management will be expecting Shakib leading the side smartly as he did during the Tests, and will hope to build on his performances which led to him to win the man-of-the-series award. The inclusion of left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak and swing Syed Rasel would boost the Tigers attack as Razzak, the most experienced Bangladesh spinner with 111 wickets at an average of 27.90, will be looking to exploit the frailty of the West Indies batsmen. On the other hand, West Indies coach John Dyson has only one thing on his mind. "I'm looking forward to the ODIs, but what I'd like to see is a hard, pacy, bouncy pitch," Dyson was quoted. "The two Test matches were closely fought. It wasn't a case where we were thrashed in either of the matches. We could have won both, so I don't think there's much in it." The West Indies recalled left-hander Devon Smith and fellow Grenadian Andre Fletcher, and included uncapped left-hander Kieran Powell to shore up their batting while leg-spinner Rawl Lewis and uncapped fast-medium bowler Gavin Tonge were retained for the squad. Squad: Bangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Abdur Razzak, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Mahbubul Alam, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mohammad Ashraful, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Raqibul Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Syed Rasel, Tamim Iqbal. West Indies: Floyd Reifer (captain), Darren Sammy, Dave Bernard Jr, Travis Dowlin, Andre Fletcher, Rawl Lewis, Nikita Miller, Nelon Pascal, Kieran Powell, Dale Richards, Kemar Roach, Devon Smith, Devon Thomas, Gavin Tong
