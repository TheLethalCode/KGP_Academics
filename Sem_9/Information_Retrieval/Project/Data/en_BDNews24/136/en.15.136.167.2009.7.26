 Dhaka, Jul 26 (bdnews24.com)A bid for a contract to supply fish to Dhaka Medical College Hospital was stolen from a company employee as he attempted to lodge it with officials at the hospital on Sunday. "A gang of youths attacked my employee and stole our tender schedule from him. He was then forced out of the hospital," Arman Hossain, the owner of Liza Enterprise, told bdnews24.com. He said a Tk 50,000 bank draft was also snatched from his employee during the altercation. Hossain alleged that police stationed close to the scene failed to intervene. DMCH official Amir Hossain said the owner of Liza Enterprise has requested permission to re-submit the tender, although the hospital had already reviewed the applications as it was the final day for tender submission. bdnews2
