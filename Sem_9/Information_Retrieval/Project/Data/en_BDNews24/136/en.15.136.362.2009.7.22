 Dhaka, Jul 21 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun, returning home Tuesday after a three-week absence, has said she is not aware of the resignation of her junior minister Tanjim Ahmed as was widely reported by Bangladesh media earlier in the week. Sahara arrived back in Dhaka at around 11.45pm, on a Singapore Airlines flight, following medical treatment abroad. "I feel well, I am recovering," she told reporters in a press conference at the airport. Speaking from a wheelchair, she said she was hoping to attend her office from Wednesday. Sahara left for Singapore on July 1 to be admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, after she injured her right sight in a fall at her home on June 29. With her departure, and the absence of junior minister Tanjim Ahmed, the home ministry had no minister in office for 21 days. Sahara, however, said she was in constant communication with her ministry and with senior officials of law enforcing agencies during her time away. "I gave them all necessary directives," she said. Asked to comment on the reports of Tanjim's resignation, she said, "I know nothing of his resignation. I cannot comment on it ... I am hearing it from you." Tanjim, popularly known as Sohel Taj, departed for the USA at the start of June following earlier rumours of his resignation. The home ministry said at the time Tanjim had taken leave. He was expected to return by July 3. Media reports on Sunday quoted Tanjim, speaking from Maryland in the US, saying he had not returned to Bangladesh as he had filed his resignation on May 31, prior to his departure. Sahara said, "I spoke to Tanjim Ahmed by phone from Singapore. As far as I know he took leave before going to the US." The home minister expressed her gratitude to prime minister Sheikh Hasina and all her well-wishers for their support during her treatment. "If the prime minister had not sent me abroad, I would have been disabled for life," said Sahara, referring to the seriousness of the injury she had sustained. bd
