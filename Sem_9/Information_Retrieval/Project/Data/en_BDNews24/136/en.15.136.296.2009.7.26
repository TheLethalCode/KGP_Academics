<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka City Corporation and city developers Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha are not assisting the police to ease traffic gridlock in the city, the Dhaka city police chief has complained. In a views-exchange meeting at the Rajarbagh telecom auditorium on Sunday, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said the DCC had leased many parts of the city streets. "So, the police face protests when they move to prevent parking on the streets." "In addition, the DCC's dustbins for garbage collection occupy a major part of the roads. They narrow down the roads," he added. But the DCC did not act despite being pressed on the issues, the commissioner complained. On RAJUK's non-cooperation, he said, "Keeping parking space is mandatory to construct buildings in Dhaka. But it is absent in reality in many cases, although outlined in the design. RAJUK did not care about our requests to take steps." Haque said a total of 365 people have been killed in road accidents in the city from July 2008 to June this year. The police commissioner claimed that the security was alright in the capital. "Some say that crime has increased after the caretaker government, which is not right." bdnews
