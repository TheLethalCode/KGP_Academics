 Brahmanbarhia, July 23 (bdnews24.com)Excessive ammonia gas leakages at Zia Fertiliser Factory at Ashuganj caused at least 25 people to fall unconscious in adjacent Charchartala village Wednesday night. The seriously ailing were Ruksana Begum, 24, Ayesha Begum, 50, Jobeda Begum, 45, Amena Begum, 55, Sufia Begum, 35, Sayeda Begum, 31 and Jahanara Begum, 32. Osman Ghani, managing director, Zia Fertiliser Factory, admitted that gas leakages had occurred at the factory. The sick were admitted to Zia Fertiliser Factory Colony Hospital and local facilities Noor Medical Centre and Sohrab Medical Hall. Protesting such gas leakages, the locals staged demonstrations at 10am on Thursday at the factory gate. As the ammonia gas plant of the factory developed faults over the years, gas leakages from the plant have been experienced by the inhabitants of the surrounding villages through the past four years. It is alleged that ammonia gas leakages have caused widespread pollution in the surrounds, inflicted damages to public health and cropped lands.
