 BISHKEK, Fri Jul 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's president won a second term by a Soviet-style margin on Friday, but the opposition complained of vote-rigging in a Central Asian country that is the focus of keen US-Russian rivalry. The United States and Russia have military air bases in the country which lies in the vast, conflict-prone region north of Iran and Afghanistan. Both have also expressed concern about what they see as a rise in Islamic militancy in the region. The central election commission said on Friday President Kurmanbek Bakiyev had 86.2 percent of the vote after two thirds of ballots had been counted. Opposition challenger Almazbek Atambayev, who has denounced the election in the ex-Soviet republic as rigged, had 7.4 percent. "Bakiyev lost this election. Kyrgyzstan has no legitimate president. He could have easily been given 190 percent," Atambayev told Reuters after the count was announced. Observers from the election monitoring arm of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe were due to give their assessment of the vote at 0900 GMT on Friday. An impoverished nation of alpine villages, clan rivalries and strong nomadic traditions, Kyrgyzstan appeared calm after a day of tension but the opposition said it planned more protests. Kyrgyzstan's stability is essential to regional powers seeking to block the spread of violence from Afghanistan and insulate Central Asia from the rise of radical Islam. Police fired in the air and used batons to break up a crowd of protesters during the Thursday vote. Bakiyev, accused by opponents of exaggerating the Islamic threat to shore up his own power, has vowed to use all means to preserve stability. Atambayev said his observers had documented widespread cases people submitting multiple ballots, adding that a number of his monitors had been harassed at polling stations. The central election commission played down these concerns, saying it was satisfied with the conduct of the election. "The election was conducted in a calm and friendly atmosphere," said commision chairman Damir Lisovsky. On Friday, state television showed lengthy live reports of Lisovsky's team debating in detail a 84-page report on election fraud submitted by the opposition. The general prosecutors office is also due to look into them for a legal review. HIGH RISK Kyrgyzstan's southern Ferghana valley, viewed by the government as a hotbed of extremism, has seen a string of gunbattles over past months involving state troops and attackers identified by the government as Islamist rebels. Some analysts say Taliban rebels of Central Asia origin, stirred by heavy fighting and more U.S. troops in the south, are now streaming back into their historic homeland -- a safe haven for many due to its remote alpine passes and lax security. Instability in Kyrgyzstan is also of concern to the United States, which uses its Manas air base there as a transit point for its troops fighting in Afghanistan. "Overall, a Bakiyev victory would signal policy continuity," Eurasia Group said in a research note. "But in the longer term, the level of macro-level political risk is relatively high in Kyrgyzstan. The country's political institutions are weak, corruption is endemic, and organized crime permeates the top levels of government." Bakiyev came to power in 2005 after mass protests ousted his predecessor, Askar Akayev. He charmed the West with promises of democracy and was elected in 2005 in a vote declared largely free and fair by the OSCE. Since then he has gradually tightened his grip on power and is now accused by the opposition of tolerating no dissent. Bakiyev has rejected opposition allegations, saying he would work hard to further democracy and re
