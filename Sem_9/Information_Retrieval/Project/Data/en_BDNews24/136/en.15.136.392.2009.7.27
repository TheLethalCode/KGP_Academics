 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)Senior Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedee has sought court orders to travel abroad for treatment after he was stopped flying to Saudi Arabia on July 24. In a writ petition filed with the High Court bench of justices Tariq ul Hakim and Borhan Uddin on Monday, Sayeedee, an MP, also challenged the government's authority to stop him flying to Saudi Arabia. The petition said the immigration officers stopped him at the Zia International Airport while he was scheduled to go to Jeddah at 5pm on a Saudi Airlines flight for treatment. Imran Siddiqi, the lawyer for Sayeedee, told reporters the petition was filed to challenge the legality of barring him from flying abroad. The hearing might take place the same day, Siddiqi added. Abdur Razzak, a barrister and Jamaat leader, will argue for Sayeedee in the hearing, while Siddiqi will assist him. Deputy attorney general Khurshid Alam will present the government's case. Earlier on July 24, Rafique Bin Sayeedee, Sayeedee's son, told bdnews24.com that he was to fly to Jeddah to join a seminar there at the invitation of the Saudi religious ministry. But, the immigration police refused to let him go without showing any reason and he returned home, Rafique said. The seminar Sayeedee was going to attend takes place every year. He was also scheduled to perform Umrah. bd
