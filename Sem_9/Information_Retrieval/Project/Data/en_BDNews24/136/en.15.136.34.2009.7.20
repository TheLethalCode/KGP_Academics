 Dhaka, Jul 20 (bdnews24.com)--A large number of Bangladeshis who enter India every year with visa do not come back, the Indian high commissioner has alleged. "We know that around 25,000 Bangladeshis do not return after entering India every year; those who enter unrecorded are many more in number," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty said on Monday. "Our concern about illegal migration cannot be brushed aside," he said and added that security was a major concern for his government in the recent times following the rise of terrorism in the region. Speaking at a conference on 'Bangladesh-India Economic Relation' at the city's Sonargaon Hotel, the Indian envoy also said that most of the crowd outside the Indian high commission in Dhaka were touts. "Eighty percent of the people...are tout and brokers," he told the the conference co- organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBBCI) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
