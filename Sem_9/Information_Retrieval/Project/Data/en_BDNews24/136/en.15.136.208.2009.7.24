<TITLE> Russia needs democracy to overcome crisis: envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Fri Jul 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia risks being a Third World-style raw material exporter mired in economic crisis unless it boosts democracy and the rule of law, the European Union's top official in Moscow said in an interview. Ambassador Marc Franco, the outgoing head of the European Commission delegation to Russia, said during his five years the relationship with Moscow had suffered "standstill, if not a regression" and many reforms of the 1990s had been reversed. "My stay here coincided with the second term of President Putin," Franco, 62, told Reuters. "Rightly or wrongly, I have the impression that in that period many reforms of the Yeltsin era seem to have been turned back." But he expressed optimism that in the long-term, a new generation of Russians would prevent a return to Soviet-style authoritarianism and reassert citizens' rights -- essential for the country to grow a modern, knowledge-based economy. Asked whether it was impossible for Russia to get out of economic crisis without political reform, Franco replied: "The simple reply to that would be yes...Russia still has many characteristics of a Third World economy exporting raw materials and importing finished products". "...I am not sure you need fully-fledged democracy to export oil, gas and nickel but you do need it to build up a 21st century knowledge-based economy. That is impossible without a full realisation of the rule of law." RULE OF LAW The European Union is Russia's biggest trade and investment partner but flourishing business ties have not been matched in the political realm, where rows over Russia's alleged use of gas as a diplomatic weapon, its treatment of neighbouring states and its record on human rights and democracy have soured the mood. Hopes that President Dmitry Medvedev's inauguration last year would usher in a new era of EU-Russia cooperation quickly evaporated, after Russia went to war with neighbour Georgia and cut off gas supplies to parts of Europe in winter during a payments row with key transit country Ukraine. Asked what needed to change in Russia, Franco said it would be presumptuous to give recipes but added: "...where the problem in Russia starts is in a not sufficiently developed and aware civil society and a lack of freedom of expression in media". "I do believe -- no matter which country we are talking about -- that you cannot have rule of law...without the basic elements of democracy, implying free elections and a vibrant civil society supported by a free press." Franco, a Belgian economist who has worked for the European Commission since 1978, said he felt comfortable making his observations -- unusually direct for a head of mission here -- because they did not contradict "what President Medvedev says". Medvedev has made the rule of law, the fight against corruption and the pursuit of a more open political system priorities for his presidency, although many diplomats and analysts complain that the results so far have been meagre. CRISIS Aside from the reform agenda, a more urgent priority for the Kremlin's is to combat a deep recession gripping Russia. This was prompted by tumbling world prices for the country's main exports -- energy and metals -- and the drying-up of foreign loans which bankrolled a nine-year boom. Franco said deep economic crisis threatened governments anywhere but added that in Russia "the existing regime is to a large extent based on a social contract" under which the administration guarantees prosperity in exchange for a leading role in the economy and a dominant role in society. "The Russian government can only maintain its credibility and stability provided it can ensure that 'Russia Incorporated' functions or can be expected to function soon," he said. "I was quite optimistic that Russia would get very quickly out of the crisis but looking at the latest statistics I tend to become a bit doubtful about whether it will happen so soon." Russia's Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach - the first official here to admit a recession had arrived - predicted this week the country could see a second wave of crisis in 2010, triggered by company insolvencies and their fallout on banks. Despite the difficult outlook in the short-term, Franco said he was optimistic that Russia was going through a cycle which would see a return to a more liberal government in another five to 10 years, when a new generation took power. "I don't really think a return to a fully authoritarian regime and Soviet-style management in Russia is possible," he said. "This is because I am convinced that the elements of freedom that emerged in the Yeltsin years have not disappeared." "History moves in cycles and the landmark reforms of the Yeltsin period have left their mark on the Russian society and economy and will re-eme
