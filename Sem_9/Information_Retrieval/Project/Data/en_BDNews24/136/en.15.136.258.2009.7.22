 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board president Lt General Sina Ibn Jamali on Wednesday ended the debate over the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) by declaring that the government intended to stage 2011 ICC World Cup matches at Mirpur and Narayanganj respectively. "After lots of deliberations, the government has finalised Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) and Narayanganj Osmani Stadium (NOS) as the venues for 2011 ICC World Cup in Bangladesh," said Lt Gen Jamali taking consent of state minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker. At a press meet, Sarker was asked about the selection of 2011 World Cup venues, but the state minister pushed the ball to the BCB president. The BCB boss also informed that the government had chosen the alternative venues in Chittagong and Khulna. "As per ICC directive, match venue and alternative venues would have to be upgraded upto World Cup standard. We have informed the government and we were assured of getting the maximum support from them," Jamali added. After it was decided that the BNS would schedule stage the inaugural ceremony of the ICC World Cup some quarters demanded it also hold a few matches. Currently the grand old stadium is used for football matches only. After taking unanimous decision at the board of directors meeting, the BCB in May also proposed to the government for holding one or two matches of the 2011 World Cup matches at the BNS. Replying to a query, the sports minister said that the government would have been pleased had they taken few matches to Chittagong, but they could not do it due to lack of logistic support. Meanwhile, co-hosts Bangladesh will host eight matches, of them two are quarter-final
