<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has been named in Sri Lanka's one-day international squad for their five-match series against Pakistan starting next week after recovering from a knee injury. Muralitharan, 37, the highest wicket-taker in ODI history, missed the three-match Test series with a tendon injury and will team up with Ajantha Mendis and recalled leg spinner Malinga Bandara in a 15-man squad that includes three spinners. Veteran seamer Chaminda Vaas, who retired from Test cricket on Friday, was overlooked but the selectors recalled Lasith Malinga to the ODI squad for the first time since February 2008. Uncapped left-armer Isuru Udana, a member of the World Twenty20 team that lost in last month's final against Pakistan in England, was included in the ODI squad for the first time. Middle order batsman Thilan Samaraweera, previously considered a Test match specialist, has been drafted in to bolster a middle-order that has struggled in the last 12 months. Opener Upul Tharanga has also been recalled as a replacement for Tillakaratne Dilshan, who fractured his right index finger in the third test against Pakistan. Squad: Kumar Sangakkara (Capt), Muttiah Muralitharan, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene, Upul Tharanga, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Kapugedera, Thilina Kandamby, Angelo Mathews, Isuru Udana, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Thilan Thushara, Nuwan Kulasekera, Malinga Ban
