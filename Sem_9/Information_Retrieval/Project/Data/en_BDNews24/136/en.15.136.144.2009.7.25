 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League's newly ratified constitution, submitted to the Election Commission on Saturday, officially turns loose its long-time student and labour wings in line with electoral laws amended last year. The ruling party's permanent constitution was approved at its 20th national council on Friday with changes to six clauses in line with electoral laws, including those relating to the make-up of the central working committee and associate organisations. Outgoing AL office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan handed the constitution to EC additional secretary Rafiqul Islam at around 4pm. Speaking to reporters after submitting the document, Khan said six sections in the constitution had been amended. "By 2020, thirty-three percent of positions will be filled by women at all levels in the party, including in the central working committee," said Khan. He also said the Awami League now recognised just eight associate organisations. "The Sramik League and Chhatra League will not be considered AL associates, they will be entirely separate and subject to their own constitutions," said Khan. Regarding candidate nominations ahead of elections, Khan said the party's parliamentary board would have the final say on candidate lists submitted by local committees. The board would select one candidate for the party ticket from a local panel of five hopefuls. He also said expatriate Bangladeshis would be permitted to participate in political activities in line with the laws of their resident countries. The constitution also mandates that the party's election expenditure, approved by the general secretary, will be submitted within 90 days of a general election, in line with electoral law. In a letter to the commission, signed by the new general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, AL said: "Specific changes and additions to the party's permanent constitution were made according to the Representation of the People Order, and approved through a national council. Legal obligations were fulfilled through submission of the constitution by 25th July." According to the RPO, amended ahead of the 2008 parliamentary polls, July 25 (Saturday) was the deadline for submission of permanent constitutions, after ratification, of the 39 political parties registered ahead of the elections with draft constitutions. Officials at the Election Commission have said they are willing to extend the deadline, however, as the main opposition BNP and at least 10 other parties have requested more time. Khan told reporters, at the EC secretariat, the ruling party did not object to the EC's decision to extend the deadline for submission of constitutions, although he added that "all parties should respect the law". The Jatiya Party, a key ally of the AL, also handed in its constitution at the EC secretariat earlier Saturday, after its council held Friday. Election officials said some 20 parties had submitted constitution by hand or post by the deadline. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina retained her party presidency for a sixth time, while Syed Ashraful Islam was elected general secretary at the AL's long overdue 20th national council on Friday. bdnews
