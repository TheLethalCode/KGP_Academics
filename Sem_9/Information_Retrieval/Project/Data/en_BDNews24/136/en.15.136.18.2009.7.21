 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister has said a commission to probe violence after the 2001 general elections against the minority Hindus and opposition workers will be formed 'soon' in line with the High Court orders. "Those who can probe violent incidents well will be appointed as members of the commission," Shafique Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat on Tuesday. The High Court on May 6 asked the government to form a commission to probe the violent incidents including killing, rape, attack and plundering after the eighth parliamentary elections. A bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammad Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave the orders upon a writ petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The court had ordered the government to explain why forming judicial committee will not be ordered to investigate the violence on Feb 1, 2001, after writ petition by the rights body,. On the lateness of the government action to form the commission, he said "So far as I know the court ordered the constitution of the commission within two months after receiving the orders. The copy has not been received until now." "I have asked the attorney general to take necessary steps on the issue. Steps will be taken quickly to form the commissiononce the copy of the orders is received." b
