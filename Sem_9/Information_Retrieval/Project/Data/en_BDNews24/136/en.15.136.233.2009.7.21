 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday acquitted former post and telecommunications minister Mohammad Nasim in a corruption case. The case alleged that Nasim, during his term as minister of the past Awami League government, abused his power to benefit from a deal involving installation of 300,000 digital telephone connections. The court also acquitted businessman AHS Rahman in the case, filed in 2002 by the now defunct Bureau of Anti Corruption under the past BNP government. Judge Mozammel Hossain of Special Court-3 cleared Nasim and Rahman on Tuesday, saying the charges were not proved. Nasim told bdnews24.com after the verdict that there is no other case against him. He said the former BNP-led government had filed six cases against him "as an act of conspiracy". "I applied for withdrawal of two political harassment cases against me," he said. "Other cases were quashed in the higher court," he said. bdne
