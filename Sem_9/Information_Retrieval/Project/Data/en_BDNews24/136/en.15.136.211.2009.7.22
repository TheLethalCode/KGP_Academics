<TITLE> Drought-hit farmers getting help: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government will provide farmers in the north with free electricity for irrigation, despite a countrywide power crisis, to protect Aman production from the dearth of monsoon rains so far this year, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury said Wednesday. "A latent drought is occurring despite the rainy season. The northern region is experiencing very little rain though the coastal areas are getting some," Motia told reporters at the Secretariat. "Farmers cannot prepare their land for planting due to the dry soil. So we have decided to connect 9,470 deep tube wells with free power throughout the region", she said. Farmers in the northern region, following flash floods at the end of June, are now facing a drought during the crucial Aman rice planting season. There has been barely any rainfall in Nilphamari, Dinajpur and Rangpur districts since the start of the current month, leaving the soil parched, cracked and unsuitable for tilling, while seedlings already planted or prepared for planting are withering. To deal with the situation the agriculture department has directed farmers to irrigate. Although well-off farmers have good recourse to irrigation, poor farmers have been struggling to water their lands. The northern region covers 26 lakhs hectares of rice cropland in 16 districts. Mass media have been running news for days that Aman production is facing setbacks in the region due to lack of rains. "I talked with the prime minister on the issue today (Wednesday). She has asked me to take all essential steps. I then spoke with the finance minister," said Motia. She said free power connections to the deep tube-wells were being switched on from Wednesday. "We will continue to supply them with irrigation means until it rains adequately." The government will need an extra Tk 8.06 crore to provide free power for the tubewells, Motia said. The agriculture ministry will repay the Rural Electrification Board the cost, she added. Asked whether the government would take such measures elsewhere in the country, she said, "The main problem exists in the north. We have been receiving news that it has been raining elsewhere." Regarding existing power shortages, the minister said the farmers' needs must be met. "There may be some effect on urban areas in the region, but not too much and not too long," she said. b
