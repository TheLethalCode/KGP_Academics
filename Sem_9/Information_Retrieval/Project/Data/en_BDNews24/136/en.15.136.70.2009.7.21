 Feni, July 21 (bdnews24.com)Former Awami league MP Joynal Hazari has applied for parole from a Feni jail in order to join the party's national council, Hazari's lawyer said on Tuesday. Hazari, facing a raft of corruption cases, was sent to jail on May 15 this year after he finally surrendered to authorities. Hazari was at one time facing 23 separate cases, of which he has secured bail in 11 cases and his name was dropped in another 11. He is awaiting bail in the single remaining case. Aziz Ahammad Chowdhury, AL's Feni district acting president, said Tuesday a party leader had called him from Dhaka to say that Hazari was nominated as a district councillor from Feni to attend AL's national council scheduled for July 24. "Under the circumstances, Hazari has submitted a parole application in court to be able to join the event," lawyer Ghyasuddin Nannu Tuesday told bdnews24.com. Hazari most recently secured bail from the High Court in an illegal wealth case. In Nov 2008, a special court sentenced Hazari, in his absence, to 10 years imprisonment for amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income and failing to provide a full account of his assets in a wealth statement to the ACC. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Feni police in Oct 2007. "Hazari will be freed from jail after he secures bail in one more case," his lawyer Enayetullah Chowdhury said after the bail hearing last Sunday. bdne
