 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)--The government has dismissed the Indian high commissioner's recent claims that his country gets an influx of 25,000 Bangladeshis who fail to return home every year. A foreign ministry spokesperson in a statement said Dhaka had not received any information on overstays of Bangladeshis in India. "The government's attention has been drawn to the remarks of the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka regarding overstay of Bangladesh nationals in India. "Ministry would like to inform all concerned that the information available with the government does not correspond with the observation of the high commissioner," the spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. "Moreover, Bangladesh has not received any official communication from the government of India in this regard." The foreign ministry's statement came two days after high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty at a conference at hotel Sonargaon said "around 25,000 Bangladeshis do not return after entering India every year". "Those who enter unrecorded are many more in number," said Chakravarty, who has, of late, hit the headlines for making controversial comments. "Our concern about illegal migration cannot be brushed aside," he said and added that security was a major concern for his government in the recent times following the rise of terrorism in the region. The foreign ministry spokesperson said Bangladesh-India relations were "multi-faceted and deep-rooted". "Both the countries believe in resolving all issues through dialogue," the spokesperson further said. The Indian high commission in a clarification on Wednesday has said Chakravarty's remarks on visa seekers were "misreported" in the news media, "leading to misunderstanding and unwarranted controversy". A spokesperson of the high commission said that the high commissioner tried to mean that "touts and brokers forcibly occupy the visa queues by displacing and harassing genuine visa applicants". "His remarks have been taken out of context and misreported, leading to misunderstanding and unwarranted controversy," said the spokesperson.
