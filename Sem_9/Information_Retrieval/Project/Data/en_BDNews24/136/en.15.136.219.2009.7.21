 Dhaka, Jul 21 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission has decided to extend the deadline for parties to hold councils, and approve permanent constitutions, by another six months to Jan 25 next year, pending amendment of electoral laws. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters Tuesday the EC had requested the law ministry for amendment of the Representation of the People Order, to allow parties a full year from the first sitting of the current parliament on Jan 25 this year. "The decision was made in today's meeting for the sake of those who could not complete their councils until now." Initiatives have been taken to enroll the expatriates as voters, he added. "The proposal to amend the voter list law was also made. We have recommended enlisting those with dual citizenship and who are abroad temporarily." EC will prepare the necessary provisions if the law is amended, Huda said. The 39 political parties, who were registered ahead of the December 2008 elections with draft constitutions, had originally been given six months, until July 25, to approve their permanent constitutions. The main opposition BNP, along with 10 other parties, has requested extension of the deadline. Ruling Awami League, among others, has been preparing to hold council this week to approve their permanent constitutions for submission by the original July 25 deadline. AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam, who is also the minister for local government, said on July 14, they had no problem if any party, including the BNP, asked the EC for an extension of the deadline. Huda said, "We have recommended the extension of the deadline by 12 months, while it was earlier extended for six months. "A few parties have already submitted their permanent constitution and a few more along with the Jamaat-e-Islami are to submit theirs by the next two or three days." According to the RPO, registration of the parties will be withheld if the constitution is not submitted in time. Then the parties will be able to run its activities but will lose the scope to run the elections. bdnews24.com/mhc/pks/rah/bd/1810h.
