<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)--A writ petition at the High Court on Monday has challenged the legality of the government inaction to stop the erection of Tipaimukh Dam by India across the common river Barak. Bangladesh Jatiya Party secretary general Abu Naser Mohammad Rahmatullah petitioned the bench of justices Tariq ul Hakim and Mohammad Borhan Uddin to order the government to take effective steps to stop the dam. The petitioner also appealed to the court to stop the parliamentary delegation visiting the dam site in the northeastern Manipur state. The lawyer for the petitioner, Tajul Islam, told bdnews24.com: "It is the government's duty to protect the interests of the country in line with the constitution." "India cannot erect Tipaimukh dam, according to international rivers laws. [But] the government does not take any initiative to stop the construction of the dam." Islam also said he would appeal to the court to hear the petition on Tuesday, a day before an 11-member parliamentary delegation is scheduled to visit the dam site. b
