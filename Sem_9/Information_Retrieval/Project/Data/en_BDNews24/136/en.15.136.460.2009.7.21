 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Jalil resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on Tuesday. He announced his resignation in a press briefing at his Gulshan home, just days before the ruling party's national council is due to take place. "I am resigning as I have not been allowed to discharge my duty for the upcoming council," Jalil told the briefing. "I hoped that I would work in the council. As I was not given the scope I had no other option but to resign from the post," he said. Jalil said: "According to the party constitution the general secretary convenes the council session. The invitation should be in his or her name. "The general secretary submits his report in the council session. But I haven't been given the opportunity," he said. Jalil did not reply to any questions from reporters. "I will not answer any questions today. I have resigned from the post of party general secretary. But I will try to work for the strength and progress of the party till death," he said. AL presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told reporters on July 17 that Jalil was not included in the council preparatory committee due to illness. The national council is scheduled for July 24, to approve the party's permanent constitution for final submission to the Election Commission by its July 25 deadline. Jalil said he would send his resignation letter to party chief Sheikh Hasina later Tuesday. The veteran AL leader said he would pursue his political career and continued to be inspired by the ideology of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Local party leaders and supporters from his Naogaon constituency were present at the press conference. Outspoken Jalil previously served as commerce minister during the 1996-2001 AL government, and was elected general secretary in the party's 19th council in December 2002. He was arrested and jailed on corruption charges on May 28, 2007, during the state of emergency, along with many other politicians. He was later paroled by the caretaker government on March 2 last year to seek medical treatment in Singapore after falling ill in jail. He returned home six months later. During his detention and while being treated abroad, the outspoken Jalil was reported on a number of occasions criticising Sheikh Hasina's rule of the party, and saying there was no democracy within Awami League. He denied the statements after his release on bail ahead of the December 2008 general elections. He said he was tortured and forced to make such statements during his detention. Jalil announced he was resuming his duties as AL general secretary after his release, but he was sidelined initially as joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam continued in his role as AL's acting general secretary for some time. Though Jalil was eventually reinstated, Ashraful has been official party spokesperson since. In a television interview, on Apr 20 this year, Jalil said he wanted to carry on with his duties as secretary general, but there were misunderstandings between him and Hasina. Most recently, Jalil during a speech in parliament on Jun 25 demanded the removal of the prime minister's advisers as they had not sworn any oath of secrecy. He also accused unspecified advisers of attempting to steer the cabinet and hampering the work of the government. b
