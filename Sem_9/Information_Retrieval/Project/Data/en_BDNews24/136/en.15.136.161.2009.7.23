<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP is preparing to hold its council in Dec after forming grassroots-level committees, a policymaker of the opposition party said on Thursday. "We'll hold the council in December. Now we're working in phases to hold fresh elections to the union, municipal, thana and district committees," Moudud Ahmed told reporters at the National Press Club in the city. "BNP has registration. We have applied to the Election Commission for extending time to hold party council fairly and transparently. It is now up to them what they will do." The former law minister said it will do no harm to the BNP if the party's registration was cancelled should the Election Commission decided not to extend the deadline. "Because no-one can separate people from the BNP." The policymaking National Standing Committee member wished a successful council of the ruling Awami League on Friday. Earlier, he spoke at a discussion titled 'From Tipaimukh to Corridor: Endangered Homeland-Duty of the Patriots', organised by Jatiya Ganatantrik Party. He proposed holding a national convention in Dhaka with the participation of all sections of people to mobilise public opinion on Tipaimukh dam. "Conspiracy has been going on for a long time to weaken and make Bangladesh ineffective with Tipaimukh dam and corridor." b
