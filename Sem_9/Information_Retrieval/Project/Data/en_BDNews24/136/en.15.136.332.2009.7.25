<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Jul 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's top authority called on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday to dismiss a senior official who had said Iran was friendly with everyone, even the people of its sworn foe Israel, state television reported. A senior aide to Ahmadinejad said the official, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie, accepted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's ruling and was giving up the post of first vice president. In a letter read on state television, Ayatollah Khamenei said: "The appointment of ... Mashaie as vice president is against your interest and the interests of the government and will cause division among your supporters." "It is necessary to announce the cancellation of this appointment," Khamenei added. Despite increased pressure, Ahmadinejad had shown no sign of backing down over his appointment of Mashaie as first vice president, whom he has praised as loyal to the 1979 Islamic revolution. But his senior adviser Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi told the state news agency IRNA: "Following the leader's ruling, Mr. Mashaie does not regard himself as the vice president." Ahmadinejad came under fire from several leading hardliners after appointing Mashaie his first vice-president on July 16. Analysts have said that the decision by Ahmadinejad to appoint Mashaie, to whom he is related by marriage, suggested the president had only a small entourage of people he trusted. Ahmadinejad was re-elected in a June 12 presidential vote, which stirred the largest display of internal unrest in Iran, the world's fifth biggest oil exporter, since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deep rifts in its ruling elite. Mashaie's remarks on Israel in 2008 created a storm at home, but Ahmadinejad had remained defiant, saying Mashaie's remarks had been "misrepresented." Mashaie also came under fire for hosting a ceremony in November where women in traditional dress carried Islam's holy book, the Koran, to music, an action deemed insulting to the Koran.
