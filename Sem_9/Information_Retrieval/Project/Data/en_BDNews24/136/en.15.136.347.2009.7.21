 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh police have netted another alleged member of Kashmir-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, sought by the Indian authorities, officials said Tuesday. The Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested Maulana Mohammad Monsur Ali, alias Maulana Habibullah, in the capital's Dakkhinkhan area on Monday night. The arrest was made on information from Mufti Obaidullah who was arrested the week before after reportedly spending 14 years in hiding. Both are Indian nationals. Police say Habibullah is known to be an arms and explosives expert of Lashkar-e-Taiba, while Obaidullah is an organiser. But police say they have yet to uncover any evidence of acts of sabotage by them in Bangladesh. Police produced Habibullah at a press conference at the DMP headquarters on Tuesday. DB deputy commissioner Manirul Islam said Habibullah was Obaidullah's superior in the miltant organisation. Islam said Habibullah entered Bangladesh by bribing Indian border guards. He said Habibullah also obtained a National ID Card in Bangladesh and had cast his vote in the December 2008 parliamentary elections . "He has links to madrasas in Bangladesh. He also had connections with the top HuJI leaders Maulana Abdur Rouf and Maulana Ali Ahmed," said Islam. Islam said, like Obaidullah, Habibullah had trained and fought in the Afghanistan war against Russia. "He has links with the 'Asif Reza Commando Force' as well as Lashkar-e-Taiba," said islam.
