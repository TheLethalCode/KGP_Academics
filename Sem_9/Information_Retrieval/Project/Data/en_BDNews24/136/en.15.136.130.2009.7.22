<TITLE> Skywatchers awed by longest eclipse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)Millions of Bangladeshis watched in awe as the longest solar eclipse of the century darkened the skies on Wednesday morning. This rare celestial event, the sun being totally shrouded by the moon, was best observed from the northern districts where 30 million people fell in shadow of the full eclipse. The Moon's shadow swept halfway across the world on the day, from India, over China and out into the Pacific Ocean. The eclipse was first sighted at dawn in eastern India near the town of Guahati before moving north and east to Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Bhutan and China. The longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century, it will be unsurpassed in duration until June 13, 2132, while Bangladesh will have to wait another 105 years to see another full solar eclipse, on June 2, 2114. bdnews24.com sponsored 24 observation camps hosted by Bangladesh Astronomical Association across the country for safe viewing of the astronomical event. People wept, cheered, clapped and prayed as they watched the once-in-a-lifetime wonder pass overhead. The height of the eclipse took place between 7:55am and 8am ranging between 83 percent in the south and totality in northern districts. Total darkness descended north of Dinajpur and Lalmonirhat and at Panchagarh and Thakurgaon for 3-4 minutes. Dhaka saw a partial eclipse of 93 percent. Panchagarh Stadium was packed as crowds of excited people began arriving from 5am, to watch the event, said Bangladesh Science and Technology Museum curator Sukallyan Bachhar. "The stadium was packed full for the eclipse. We handed out about 1,000 filters for people to watch safely." "There were clouds, so we couldn't see the whole event uninterrupted. We had intermittent views as the moon first began passing in front of the sun," said Bachhar. "But we were lucky enough to get a clear view of the entire three or more minutes of total eclipse." "We saw stars in the day!" "People became very emotional," he said. At Moinaguri Tea Garden in Panchagarh, where Bangladesh Astronomical Association was hosting an observation camp, sponsored by bdnews24.com, cloud cover frustrated watchers. But the experience was still awe-inspiring, said one viewer. "The clouds parted and we saw the famous diamond ring effect." "It was dark for about three or four minutes, and crickets started chirping as if it was night." Another said, "It went completely dark. But it was an absolutely indescribable dark." An eerie calm descends as the blinding solar disc is blotted out. Just before totality, as the sky darkens, many flowers fold up and birds and animals get confused. The temperature drops. And then a final diamond-like flash just before total darkness set in. At this stage, only a few wisps of ephemeral light from the solar corona is visible and the 'wrong stars' appear in the sky. It's an experience that lasts just a few minutes, but reverberates for a lifetime, say eclipse watchers. The path of totality, or the Moon's umbral shadow, began in India and crossed through Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and China. After leaving mainland Asia, the path crossed Japan's Ryukyu Islands and curved southeast through the Pacific Ocean where the maximum duration of totality reached 6 min 39 seconds. A partial eclipse was seen within the much broader path of the Moon's penumbral shadow, which includes most of eastern Asia, Indonesia, and the Pacific Ocean. Safe viewing Bangladesh Astronomical Association and bdnews24.com co-organised 24 observation camps throughout the country to help watch the celestial event safely. Local organisations helped set up the camps. BAA set up its main observation centre in a Tentulia Tea Garden. A number of related activities including workshops on the solar eclipse, a children's science festival, solar painting competition, kite flying and exhibition, a film show on astronomical phenomena, night sky observation by telescope, paper balloon flying and a music festival were held countrywide. In the capital, observation camps were set up at Dhanmondi playground, Notre Dame College and Mirpur Town Protection Embankment, jointly organised by Bijnan Andolan Mancho, Notre Dame College geography department and Amader Pathshala. Bangladesh Science and Technology Museum organised facilities to observe the total solar eclipse from Panchagarh Stadium. It also made arrangements for witnessing the eclipse in front of Porishankhyan Bhaban in the capital.
