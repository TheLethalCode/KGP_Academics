 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)Three RAB members, including an assistant director of the elite force, were arrested early on Friday on charges of mugging a man by threatening him with killing in 'crossfire' and were detained in prison.. Syed Sajjad Selim, Motijheel police chief, said that the police retrieved Tk 7.5 lakh from an assistant director, assistant superintendent of police Shoeb Ahmed, and two army soldiers Shahidul Islam and Shagar Chandra. The case details say Tajul Islam Hiran, 30, marketing manager of Fair Advertising of 2/2 RK Mission Road, was travelling to Rampura by a Rahbar Paribahan bus at 8pm on Wednesday, when the bus was stopped at Kamalapur by people who identified themselves to the passengers as RAB members. The RAB personnel took Hiran in their jeep to Doyel Chattar, threatened to kill him using 'crossfire' killing without trial ploy, snatched Tk 10.86 lakh from his possession, dropped him on the roadside and drove away. Hiran filed a mugging case with Motijheel Police on Thursday and lodged a complaint with the RAB headquarters, too. He said that one of the muggers had RAB uniform on and they had travelled in an ash-coloured Jeep. The complaints prompted police and RAB investigations and Hiran was called to the RAB-3 office where he identified the three muggers. RAB-3 deputy director Major Khairul Amin told bdnews24.com that three men were handed to the police after their involvement in the reported crime was primarily established. The three were suspended from service and departmental enquiries were on, Major Amin added. A metropolitan magistrate's court sent them to jail pending trial on Friday. bd
