<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has asked the energy ministry to realise compensation from the US oil company. Occidental, responsible for a devastating explosion at Magurchhara gas field 12 years ago. MK Alamgir, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on public undertaking, after a meeting Thursday told bdnews24.com that the government could still get compensation from the company. A massive blowout took place at Magurchhara gas field, drilled by Occidental, on June 14, 1997, causing an inferno to rage across a vast tract centring on the accident site. According to reports, a parliamentary probe committee at the time estimated that the Magurchhara blast caused financial losses of more than Tk 10,000 crore to the country. Environmentalists say it will take another 50 years for the ecological balance in the area to recover. "We have asked Petrobangla and the ministry to take measures for realising compensation for the blast," Alamgir told bdnews24.com Thursday. He said the state-run Petrobangla's mineral wing informed the standing committee at the meeting that it was working to do so. Alamgir said the accident happened due to poor safety measures adopted by the oil company. He said, according to the deal struck at the time, Occidental, later taken over by Chevron, must pay compensation to the Bangladesh government for its failure. The then-Awami League government formed an investigation committee at the time, which submitted its findings on June 30, 1997. But the report is yet to be made public. The parliamentary standing committee on the energy and mineral resources ministry later formed another investigation committee comprising three lawmakers. The forest department also conducted a survey on June 16 and 17, 1997. The subsequent BNP government, after assuming office in October 2001 for a five-year term, shelved the reports on the Magurchhara blast. On December 12, 2004, the parliamentary standing committee on energy formed another fivemember probe body to look into the damages caused by the blowout. But the committee, headed by BNP MP Shahidul Islam, did not complete its task.
