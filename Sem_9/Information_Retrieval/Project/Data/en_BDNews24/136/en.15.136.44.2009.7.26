 JERUSALEM, Jul 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States launched a fresh drive on Sunday to restart Middle East peace talks, sending senior officials to the region to deal with issues ranging from Jewish settlements to Iran's nuclear ambitions. The visits by Middle East envoy George Mitchell, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and National Security Adviser Jim Jones were a strong signal from US President Barack Obama of his intention to keep Israeli-Arab peacemaking high on his agenda. Obama's demand, in accordance with a 2003 US-backed peace "road map," to freeze Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem has met stiff resistance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Playing down the most serious rift in US-Israeli ties in a decade, Netanyahu told his cabinet: "It is only natural, that within a fabric of friendly relations between allies, there isn't full agreement on all points." He described Israel's relationship with Washington as "important and steadfast," a departure from tough comments he made only a week ago when he said he would not accept orders from the United States on Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said talks with Israel, suspended for more than six months, cannot resume until all Israeli settlement activity ceases. Flying into Israel from talks in Damascus with President Bashar al-Assad on the possibility of restarting Israeli-Syrian negotiations, Mitchell discussed a settlement deal with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv. The envoy was to meet Abbas on Monday and Netanyahu on Tuesday. Gates also plans talks in Israel. He was due to meet Netanyahu and Barak on Monday to discuss missile defense, Iran's nuclear ambitions and bilateral security issues, a senior U.S. defense official said. Netanyahu said he would meet on Wednesday with Jones, who will be heading a "senior team from the National Security Council, the State Department and the White House." COMPROMISE Mitchell and Barak have attempted in a series of meetings over the past several weeks in New York and London to forge a compromise on settlement expansion. Barak has raised the possibility of halting construction in settlements while allowing building projects already under way to continue, as part of a deal under which Arab countries would take initial steps to normalize relations with Israel. In a nod to Washington but stopping short of meeting its demands, Netanyahu has pledged not to build new settlements or expropriate additional territory in the West Bank, where Palestinians hope to build a state with East Jerusalem as its capital. But he has said construction in settlements to accommodate the "natural growth" of their populations must continue. Palestinians say they fear settlements, deemed illegal by the World Court, could deny them a viable and contiguous state. In Damascus, Mitchell said restarting talks between Israel and Syria was a "near-term goal" for Washington. He also called for Assad's support for a broad peace effort in the region. "If we are to succeed, we will need Arabs and Israelis alike to work with us to bring about comprehensive peace. We will welcome the full cooperation of the government of the Syrian Arab Republic in this historic endeavor," Mitchell said. Indirect talks between Syria and Israel, which were being mediated by Turkey, were suspended during the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip in December. Turkey said this month it was ready to resume mediation of those talks. Syria has been seeking the return of the Golan Heights, territory that Israel captured in a 1967 war. Syria's support for Hamas has contributed to deteriorating ties between Damascus and Washington in the last several years, which improved after Obama came to office in January and said Middle East peace was a US priority. Syria remains under US sanctions but Obama has decided to return a ambassador to Syria. Washington withdrew its envoy in 2005 to protest against the assassination in Beirut of Rafik al-Hariri, a Lebanese parliamentarian and former prime minister. "I told President Assad that President Obama is determined to facilitate a truly comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace," Mitchell told repor
