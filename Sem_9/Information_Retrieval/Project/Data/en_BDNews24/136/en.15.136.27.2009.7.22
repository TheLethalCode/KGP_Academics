<TITLE> Australia backing Johnson to come good </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson has the ability to bounce back quickly after his disappointing performance in the second Test loss to England, coach Tim Nielsen said on Tuesday. The 27-year-old Johnson, touted as Australia's premier seamer going into the series, struggled to achieve consistent line and length at Lord's and Nielsen said he needed support due to his lack of experience. "We are not running from the fact that he didn't have a great Test here, but he got better," Nielsen told reporters on Tuesday. "The great thing about Mitch is that he is such a quick bloke and such a quick learner. If we can get one or two little things right I'm sure he will be back on track pretty quickly," Nielsen said. Johnson has played 23 Tests and made a big contribution to Australia's series victory in South Africa this year. He could be dropped in favour of Brett Lee, who missed the first two Tests with a rib injury, but Nielsen said Australia would be cautious about bringing him back too soon. "The injury that he has is really a bowling specific injury. History shows if you have these injuries and then bring him on again it tends to be six, eight, 10 weeks before you come right. We have to be really careful," Nielsen said. Nielsen said he would try to ensure that his players enjoyed the rest of the tour. "I think we have got another five or six weeks in England. We have got to make sure that the results don't drive how we are feeling or how we act or how we are preparing," Nielsen said. The third Test starts in Birmingham next
