 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)--The Indian high commission has said Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty's remarks on visa seekers were "misreported" in the news media, "leading to misunderstanding and unwarranted controversy". A spokesperson of the high commission in a statement Wednesday said that the high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty tried to mean in his remarks that "touts and brokers forcibly occupy the visa queues by displacing and harassing genuine visa applicants". The spokesperson trashed the allegation that the "touts and brokers" operate in collusion with high commission officials. The official said the problem faced by "genuine visa applicants will be resolved speedily" as the high commission was going to shift the visa centre to a more spacious place. The high commissioner made the remarks as FBCCI president Annisul Huq drew his attention saying "the queue for Indian visa would find a place in the Guinness Book of World Records", the statement said. "The High Commissioner, while responding to these remarks mentioned inter alia that visa is a problem area because of two reasons: (a) the large number (around 25,000) of Bangladeshi nationals who obtain visa but do not return and (b) the difficulties caused to genuine visa applicants by touts and brokers," the statement said. "The High Commission wishes to clarify that the High Commissioner was highlighting a well-known problem: 'touts and brokers' forcibly occupying the visa queue, thereby displacing and harassing genuine visa applicants. "His remarks have been taken out of context and misreported, leading to misunderstanding and unwarranted controversy," said the spokesperson. The statement said the "exchange of visitors between the two friendly countries is an important aspect of our bilateral relations and we value people-to-people contact". The high commission and its affiliated offices issued 4,72,644, 4,81,064 and 5,23,322 visas in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The spokesperson said, "The High Commission desires that the problem faced by genuine visa applicants be resolved speedily. "We have discussed this issue with authorities concerned in the Bangladesh government and various solutions have been explored, including shifting of the Indian Visa Application Centre to a more spacious location to accommodate the rising demand. "We continue to work on this proposal to ease the congestion and related difficulties for genuine visa applicants." A significant component of this solution would include tackling the overwhelming presence of 'touts and brokers' in the visa queue so that they do not harass genuine visa applicants, it said. "The high commission rejects allegations of complicity between touts and brokers and officials of the High Commission. "We continue to work on this proposal to ease the congestion and related difficulties for genuine visa applicants." A significant component of this solution would include tackling the overwhelming presence of 'touts and brokers' in the visa queue so that they do not harass genuine visa applicants, it said. "The high commission rejects allegations of complicity between touts and brokers and officials of the High Commission. "Such allegations have been made before and have been found to be baseless and malicious," it said. "The High Commission continues to work in cooperation with the authorities concerned in Bangladesh government on this issue".
