 KHOST, Afghanistan ,Jul 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban guerrillas staged a series of attacks on government buildings in a town in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, residents said, with gunbattles and at least one large explosion heard. There were no immediate reports of any casualties from the attacks in the town of Gardez in Paktia province, or explanations of why the fighting had broken out. The complex attack resembled other recent assaults by the Taliban in eastern Nuristan, Paktika province and other assaults in Kabul and elsewhere. Gunbattles were being fought between the insurgents and government forces and at least one loud blast was heard, several residents said on the condition of anonymity. Officials in the town would not comment on the fighting and the Interior Ministry in Kabul said it was checking the reports. Violence has flared across Afghanistan since thousands of US Marines and British troops launched major offensives in the southern Taliban stronghold of Helmand. The offensives are the first operations under US President Barack Obama's new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and its Islamist allies and stabilize Afghani
