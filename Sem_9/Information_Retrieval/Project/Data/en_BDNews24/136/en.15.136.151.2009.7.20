 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)--The Prothom Alo and Daily Star have refuted the charges hours after Beximco's Salman F Rahman on Monday accused them of helping the military-installed caretaker government in its attempt to implement the "Minus-Two formula" and running a vicious propaganda for many years against the group. In a joint statement, the top-selling dailies rejected the accusation and said, "We categorically deny it and consider it as his (Salman) desperate attempt to divert public attention from the doings of his own companies." The Beximco Group boss also told a questioner at a news conference that these two newspapers were now trying to now execute 'Minus-One formula' in clear a hint at prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The statement signed by the Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam and Prothom Alo joint editor Abdul Quayum also denied the allegations that the two papers have been involved in a persistent malicious campaign against his company or indulged in unethical journalism. They claimed that they strongly adhered to the highest standards of ethical journalism and its norms. The statement said, "Regarding Salman F Rahman's terming our reports as not correct on the point of declaration of dividend and asset re-evaluation, our reports were based on what the Dhaka Stock Exchange mentioned in its website... Neither The Daily Star nor Prothom Alo had made its own judgement." The two dailies said they had never accused Salman or Beximco of insider trading. "Our report pointed out the unusual trading on that stock by two banks in close proximity of dividend declaration. Our report only brought out these facts to alert the public which we thought to be our journalistic duty to protect the interest of the investors."
