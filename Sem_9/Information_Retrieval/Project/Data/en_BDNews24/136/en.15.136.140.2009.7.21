 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  A young doctor was stabbed to death by a man in a private clinic in the capital's Badda area on Tuesday, police said. Sabujbagh police chief Asaduzzaman said they had arrested the man named Mostafizur Rahman Ujjal with a knife, after Dr Salma Perveen Moni, 30, was stabbed at the Rawshan Ara Clinic, located beside South Mugda mosque. Ujjal claimed to be Salma's lover. The clinic's X-ray technician Suman Chandra Das told bdnews24.com that the attacker had entered the clinic at around 10:30am and "roamed around for a while". "He entered Dr Salma's room on the first floor around noon," said Das. "At around 12:30pm she came out of her room and fell down on the floor. And then we saw she was bleeding," said Das. Another hospital worker Shahjahan Kabir said though the staff tried to save her, there was no doctor in the hospital to give her emergency treatment. "She was bleeding heavily. We rushed her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital," he said. Doctors there pronounced her dead. Das said the attacker had remained in the room. "The hospital staff detained him." He said Salma joined the hospital as a medical officer just four months ago, after completing her MBBS. Her body was being kept at DMCH morgue, said officials. Ujjal, 25, later confessed to police at Sabujbagh Police Station. Produced in front of reporters, he said he had known Salma for three years, since April 2006, after he called her by mistake while trying to phone a friend. The introduction later turned into a love affair, he claimed. He said he often came to Dhaka from Natore to meet Salma, and before that had visited her every three months at Sylhet Medical College, where she was studying. Ujjal said he killed Salma on Tuesday as she tried to break off the relationship. bdnews24
