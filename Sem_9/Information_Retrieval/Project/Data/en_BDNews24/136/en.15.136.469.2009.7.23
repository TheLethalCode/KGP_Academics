<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Jul 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The judge in the trial of the lone surviving gunman of last year's Mumbai attacks Thursday "recorded" the guilty plea by the accused, but said the trial would go ahead as some charges were still unanswered. Mohammad Ajmal Kasab who pleaded not guilty in May, on Monday admitted his role and gave details of the three-day rampage last November that killed at least 166 people and raised tensions between India and Pakistan. "The plea of guilt and statement will remain on record and the trial will proceed," Judge M.L. Tahilyani said. "A plea remains a plea even though it was made in a late stage of the trial. It can't be erased from the record." Kasab, a Pakistani national, had been charged with 86 offences including murder and waging war against India. If found guilty, he could face the death penalty. Earlier, prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said he was in favor of proceeding with the trial that has gripped the country for nearly three months, because of several discrepancies between the plea and Kasab's earlier confession shortly after his capture. Nikam, who has so far presented 134 witnesses, also maintained the recent plea did not cover all charges. The only one of the 10 gunmen captured during the coordinated attacks, Kasab is among 38 charged in the attack, most of whom are in Pakistan, India has said.
