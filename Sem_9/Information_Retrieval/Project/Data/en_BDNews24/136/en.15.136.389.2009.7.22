 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested a 30 year-old man from a slum in the city on Wednesday, on suspicion of past associations with executed militant Siddiqul Islam, who was notoriously known as Bangla Bhai. The suspect, identified as 'Mithu', was arrested from Korail slum on a "tip-off" said Gulshan Zone additional deputy police commissioner Mohammad Monir Hossain . "He originally hails from Talaimari village in Boalia, Rajshahi, home to Bangla Bhai too," Hossain told bdnews24.com. "He was living in Korail under an assumed name. Earlier, he was living in Khilgaon slum also with a false identity." "Suspicion has grown against him as he also tried to give a false name even after his arrest," said Hossain. Police recovered a mobile set from Mithu containing names and numbers which were being examined, he said. The suspect was being handed over to Detective Branch police for interrogation, he added. Bangla Bhai, commander of militant outfit Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB), along with five other militants, was executed by hanging on 30 March, 2007, for bomb attacks and killings. He gained worldwide notoriety for masterminding the Aug 17 2005 serial blasts, in which 500 bombs were exploded across Bangladesh. bd
