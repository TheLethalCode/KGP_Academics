 KANSAS CITY, Missouri, Jul 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US jobless rate is likely to stay high even once the nation exits recession some time in the next few months, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Sunday. Taping a "Bernanke on the Record" special that will air on PBS this week, the top US monetary policy-maker defended the aggressive, even unorthodox actions taken by the Fed during the long recession and deep financial crisis. "I was not going to be the Federal Reserve Chairman who presided over the second Great Depression," Bernanke said.

The forum, moderated by veteran anchorman Jim Lehrer, was attended by about 190 local citizens pulled together by a nonpartisan civic group. Bernanke bristled with emotion when asked about assaults on the Fed's independence -- notably, a proposal in Congress for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to be able to "audit" the Fed's interest rate decisions. I don't think that's consistent with independence. I don't think the American people want Congress running monetary policy. That's exactly what (the bill) would do," he said.
