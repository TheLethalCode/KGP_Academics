 SINGAPORE, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Liverpool supporters in Singapore had no hesitation in making a few financial sacrifices to see their team in action when the 18-time English champions arranged to play a friendly in the city-state on Sunday.

However, the absence of captain Steven Gerrard, on trial in Liverpool after being accused of affray, has upset a few supporters. "What is Liverpool without Steven Gerrard, it's a good thing I didn't buy a ticket," 34-year-old risk analyst Emril Jamil complained.
