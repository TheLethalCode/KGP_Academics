 PHUKET, Thailand, Jul 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States urged Myanmar to implement a UN resolution imposing an arms embargo on North Korea in a face-to-face meeting, a senior US State Department official said on Thursday. The official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said Washington's willingness to improve relations with the military-ruled former Burma will depend partly on the outcome of a trial against pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874, passed after North Korea's May 25 nuclear test, bans all North Korean arms exports, authorises member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo and requires them to seize and destroy any goods transported in violation of the sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that the United States was worried about possible nuclear technology transfers from North Korea to Myanmar. Talk of Myanmar-North Korea military ties was fuelled after a North Korean ship, tracked by the United States in June and July on suspicion of carrying banned arms, appeared headed toward Myanmar before turning around. In prepared remarks to be delivered at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) security gathering that she is attending on the Thai resort island of Phuket, Clinton criticised Myanmar's treatment of Suu Kyi. "Burma's persecution of political opponents and its continued imprisonment of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi casts doubt on its claims that next year's elections will bring democracy and respect for human rights," she said in the prepared remarks. "We are gratified by Burma's willingness to enforce the Security Council resolution to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions. This is an important step in playing a more constructive role in regional affairs," she added. "But we've been clear about the other essential steps: respect the rights of their people, release Aung San Suu Kyi, and hold open and credible elections next year," she added. "With Burma as with North Korea, we hold a sincere interest in engagement, provided these nations meet us in good faith," she added. "The path forward for any kind of engagement will turn on their actions." On Wednesday, Clinton said if Suu Kyi were released "that would open up opportunities at least for my country to expand our relationship with Burma, including investments in Burma". U.S. officials made a similar case in their meeting with Myanmar officials on Wednesday, the U.S. official said, telling them that "the outcome of the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi would affect our willingness and ability to take positive steps in our bilateral relationship." On May 15, U.S. President Barack Obama extended for one year a ban on U.S. investment in Myanmar first imposed in 1997 because of the authorities' repression of the opposition.
