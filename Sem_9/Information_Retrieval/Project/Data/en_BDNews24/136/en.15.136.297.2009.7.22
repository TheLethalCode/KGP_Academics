 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) - Mauritius's deputy prime minister Ahmed Rashid is willing to visit Dhaka in September to discuss labour issues, a senior foreign ministry official said Tuesday, just days after the African island nation asked 6,000 Bangladeshi workers to leave. M Wahidur Rahman, a director general, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the Bangladesh mission in Kenya was initially approached by the Mauritius government regarding Rashid's visit. "Mauritius deputy prime minister wants to visit Bangladesh sometimes in September. We are working on it," Rahman said. He said Mauritius, according to the Kenya mission, would continue recruiting female workers from Bangladesh. According to expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry sources, Bangladeshis constitute 50 percent of the 20,000 foreigners in the palm-fringed island on the Indian Ocean. Of the total 10,000 Bangladeshis, 6,000 are male and 4,000 are female workers and most work in the garments industry. On July 15, the Mauritius government asked 6,000 male workers to leave the tiny country, heavily dependent on tourism, due to global economic crises. Expatriates' welfare and overseas employment secretary Elias Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that Bangladeshi workers were still going to the African country to work mainly in garment industry. "They will continue recruiting female workers," said Ahmed. "The Mauritius government has refused to renew the contracts of the male workers fearing economic slide," he said. Rahman, the foreign ministry director general, said another 1,000 Bangladeshi women had gone to Mauritius in recent months despite the ongoing downturn. "At present, the number of Bangladeshis has reached 11,000," said Rahman.
