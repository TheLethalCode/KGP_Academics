 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League's national council on Friday unanimously reelected prime minister Sheikh Hasina president for a sixth term and endorsed the selection of Syed Ashraful Islam as general secretary for three years, councillors say. A fully fledged Awami League central working committee will be announced in a couple of days, the new general secretary said. Prime minister Hasina will roll out the committee, Ashraf told reporters after the party's council in Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The council was working on a new central working committee, Nilphamari councillor Rafiqul Islam Babu and his Laxmipur colleague Golam Mustafa told bdnews24.com. It also tasked them them to pick leaders for 45 posts in the central working committee, the highest executive forum. The constitution vests powers solely on the president to choose 26 of the 73 members of that committee. The councillors in closed-door deliberations endorsed a proposal to empower Hasina and Ashraf to pick 13 other leaders for the party's policymaking presidium, and 31 departmental secretaries. Three joint general secretaries and seven organising secretaries, and a treasurer are among the secretaries. It approved the amended constitution, manifesto and budget. In addition, the council empowered Hasina to make further changes to the amended constitution and declaration it had endorsed. Hasina's presidency was proposed by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and backed by Syed Ashraf, said deputy publicity secretary of the now-dissolved CWC Ashim Kumar Ukil said. He added that another presidium member, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, proposed the name of Ashraf and it was seconded by colleague Motia Chowdhury. Ashraf, local government minister and party spokesperson, was unanimously selected acting general secretary at the party's central working committee meeting on July 22, a day after Abdul Jalil resigned his general secretary post for his 'grievances' for being ignored. Hasina, who became the prime minister for a second time after the AL-led Grand Alliance swept the elections last year, opened the 20th council at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre amid hullabaloo. The party hurriedly held the council to approve and submit a final constitution to the Election Commission by Saturday's deadline. New electoral laws stipulate a permanent constitution for mandatory registration. Prime minister Hasina and her younger sister, Rehana, remained in self-imposed exile in then the West Germany and other countries until 1981 after their father, inderpendence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and other family members were killed in a bloody military putsch in Aug 15, 1975. When she returned home, Hasina took the party reins and reshaped it into a major political force. Ashraf is the son of the acting president of the wartime Mujibnagar government, Syed Nazrul Islam. Nazrul Islam was killed with three other national leaders, former prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, former home minister AHM Quamruzzaman and former finance minister Captain M Mansur Ali, by army officers inside Dhaka Central Jail on Nov 3, 1975. 'No revenge, work for people' Hasina in her address to the council had asked supporters to be tolerant of others and not to wreak vengeance on the rivals for years of persecution. "We are in power, so we have to be patient. We should not go for revenge," the prime minister said, kicking off the national council at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. She urged the supporters to not do anything that may erode public confidence in the party. Hasina thanked supporters who were on the streets during the 2007-08 emergency rule. "You were always on the streets. In these difficult times, many lost their way, gave in to enticement. Not all have steely resolve, courage. Not everyone walk with their head high." "But there are grassroots level leaders who did not compromise. I am grateful to you. Democracy was regained because of you." "There were temptations. But we should be able to overlook them. We should keep the hope of our people and should not lose credibility." "BDR mutiny took place on the 51st day of our tenure. Capitalising on that there was a conspiracy to push the country into civil war. Fifty-eight army personnel died in the BDR mutiny. But we solved that with your support." On the delayed council, Hasina said, "Awami League was prepared but we could not convene the council because of the situation in the country. We had to fight in past days. Then we had to deal with conspiracy during caretaker government rule." "We passed the Representation of People's Order after coming to power. And we are holding council showing respects to law and to continue with our progress in democracy." "Our country lags behind because of successive military rule. Democracy stumbled again and again. The military rule cannot deliver anything better to the masses." She highlighted her government's achievements. "We had pledged in the election manifesto to cut prices of essentials and reduce inflation, which we have already fulfilled. Currently, the foreign currency reserve has gone up to seven billion dollar." "We have also cut prices of diesel and fertiliser. Initiatives are taken for irrigation to keep agricultural production smooth. Rationing system has been launched for the people with limited income and we will not let anyone starve." "We have taken programme to create employment for an active youth from each family. A pilot project for the youth is also initiated to boost their skills. Besides, the street children are also given preference to be prepared for work." She also pledged to work for the people and earn their love. Her party's only goal will be to ensure the welfare of the people, she said. "There was an attempt to destroy the Awami League during the rules of the BNP-Jamaat coalition government and the caretaker government but that attempt was foiled by the active role played by innumerable leaders and workers." "When I was detained in prison attempts were made to get me out of politics. There were conspiracies. When I was abroad warrant was issued in cases against me. "I was barred from coming back to the country. I was told that I would be shot at the airport but I said if I was to die then I would rather on the soil of my country," said Hasina. She thanked AL workers, non-resident Bangladeshis and foreign friends for their support for her comeback. "I never bowed my head before injustice. I will go on struggling for the people of the Bengal. The only thing I will desire will be the love of the people of Bangladesh," she said. Council kicks off The council started with the slogan '60 years of struggle and success' at 10:30am with the reiteration of the campaign pledge to build a digital Bangladesh. At the beginning of the ceremony, Hasina paid respects to independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, four national leaders and the martyrs of the freedom and democratic movements. She also commemorated AL founder Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and general secretary Shamsul Haque. The AL was founded to achieve the independence of Bangladesh and it has contributed to all achievements of the country, she said. The party hurriedly held the 20th council to approve and submit a final constitution to the Election Commission by Saturday's deadline. New electoral laws stipulate a permanent constitution for mandatory registration. The business end of the council session began at 3pm, which was followed by a cultural programme.
