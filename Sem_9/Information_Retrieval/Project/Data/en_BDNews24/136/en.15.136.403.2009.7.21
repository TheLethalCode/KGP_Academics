 LONDON, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt predicted Tuesday he could reduce his own world 100 metres record to 9.54 seconds when the right opportunity comes.

"The best thing is that a lot of people go out of their way to help me," he replied. "There's not much downside but sometimes I want to be left alone to chill out.
