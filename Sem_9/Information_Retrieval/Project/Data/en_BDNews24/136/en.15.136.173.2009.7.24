 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)H M Ershad and Ruhul Amin Howladar have been unanimously reelected Jatiya Party chairman and secretary general at the national council of the key ally of the ruling Grand Alliance, presidium member Golam Masih said. Ershad had let known his desire to be at the helm of the party until his death earlier on Friday. The former military strongman has been the chairman since the inception of the party during his heyday. Howladar was elected secretary general in the 2005 council. After the inaugural session of the seventh council, their names were proposed and those were immediately passed in the working session as there were no other candidates. Ershad had declared the council open at 10:45am on Friday at the Institution of Engineers in the capital. He will also chair the day's council session. "To foil the execution of 'minus two' and subsequently 'minus three' formulas in the post-1/11 era, I had stood aside from JP chairman's position and as a strategic move, appointed an acting party chief," offered Ershad. "Now we don't need an acting chairman. There won't be any more acting chairmen in Jatiya Party from today," the former president declared. Anisul Islam Mahmud had shepherded the party through the two-year emergency rule to the general election. "Please wish me well so that I can shoulder the party chairmanship until my last moments," Ershad said to the councillors. "This special council is very important to the party leaders and workers," JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Howladar told bdnews24.com on Thursday night. As the Election Commission made it mandatory for all political parties to submit their finalised constitutions within July 25, JP is holding this special council, the secretary general said. He said 11,672 councillors and 23,000 delegates from across the country were scheduled to join the council and all preparations have been completed. The secretary general said the amended party constitution will be approved and new leaders will be elected through the council. The councillors will elect office bearers such as the party chairman, secretary general and all other offices, Howladar said. The Jatiya party believes in democratic practices, he reiterated. Since inception of the party in 1986, JP has held six councils, the last in 2005. bdne
