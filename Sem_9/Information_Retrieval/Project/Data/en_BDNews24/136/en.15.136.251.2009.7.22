 LONDON, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  England batsman Kevin Pietersen has been ruled out of the remainder of the Ashes series against Australia after having surgery on an Achilles tendon injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Wednesday. The 29-year-old right-hander, England's leading batsman with a Test average of 49.96, was hampered by the injury during the second match of the series which finished on Monday.

The South African-born Pietersen has scored 4,647 runs in 54 Tests, including 16 centuries, since making his debut against Australia in 2005.
