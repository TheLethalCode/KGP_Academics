<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)A sub-inspector of Motijheel Police Station was suspended on mugging charges on Thursday. Mirazul Islam allegedly mugged Tk 60,000 from an old man at Fakirerpool by threatening to implicate him in a case and arrest him on Thursday night. Mirazul Islam was suspended as the complaint was proved in the primary investigation, said Motijheel police chief Syed Sajjad Selim. Further investigation was underway, he added. Another official of the same police station said, preferring anonymity, that Mirazul mugged an old man, Aklus Mia, of Tk 60,000 on Thursday night at his Fakirerpool house. The SI had threatened to trump up charges against Mia and arrest him, the official added. Mirazul and two other policemen knocked at the door of the room where Mia, his son, Nazmul, and others were sleeping and told them that the room would be searched. They found Tk 1 lakh with Mia and Mirazul demanded Tk 50,000. He also asked for a further Tk 10,000 for the police informant and took the money from the bundle. Two days into the incident, Mia filed a written complaint to the deputy commissioner of Motijheel zone Khandaker Muhituddin. Muhituddin confirmed the suspension. Mia came to Dhaka to get visa, passport and other documents to send son Nazmul to Libya. bdne
