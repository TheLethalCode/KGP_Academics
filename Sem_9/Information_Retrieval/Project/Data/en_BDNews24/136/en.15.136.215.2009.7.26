 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com) - A parliamentary sub-committee investigating corruption charges against MA Matin will not allow the former shipping adviser to defend himself against charges of an illegal container handling deal at Chittagong port, the probe body's chief said on Sunday. On June 29, After a meeting of the sub-committee, Mohammed Shah Alam had told bdnews24.com that they would hear Matin, who was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. But Alam told bdnews24.com after a meeting at parliament on Sunday, "We have enough documents to prove his corruption. So, we will not summon adviser MA Matin to hear his version." He said the shipping secretary and an assistant secretary involved in the deal had confessed at the meeting that Matin had forced them to award the contract to Ishaq Brothers in violation of government rules. "Today, the officials of the Chittagong Port Authority submitted papers which prove Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work," said Alam. The probe body chief said that his sub-committee would meet on July 30 to finalise the report and refer the same to the main committee--the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry--which formed the four-member all-party enquiry committee. "We will refer the report to the main committee as soon as possible and the standing committee will make the final recommendations," said Alam. Awami League's Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and Nazrul Islam and the BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha are the other members of the probe body. According to Alam, the secretary and assistant secretary hab been were "under pressure" from Matin to award the contract of container handling work at Chittagong port to Ishaq Brothers, which had no prior experience, on Jan 6, Matin's the last day in office as adviser. Matin earlier at a press conference had denied wrongdoing after the parliamentary watchdog on May 27 formed the sub-committee. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the Chittagong Port Authority in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to Chittagong Port Authority for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it, it said. The standing committee said the contract was awarded when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of January 6 and the CPA awarded the works to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm. The standing committee also alleged that Matin had raised the service age of "pilots" at the Chittagong port to 60 years from 57. "He is not the authority to increase age of any public servants. This should be a political decision. "He must be made accountable for this," said Alam. Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges. Housing and public works adviser Moinul Hosein was the other adviser to come under parliamentary scrutiny for allegedly awarding public land to his wife and son in violation of government rules. Both advisers were very critical of the politicians for 'corruption' after the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007.
