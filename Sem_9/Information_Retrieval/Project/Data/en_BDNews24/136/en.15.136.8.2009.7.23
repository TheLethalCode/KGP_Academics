 PHUKET, Thailand, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reining in North Korea's nuclear program, counter-terrorism cooperation and maritime security will take center stage at Asia's biggest annual security gathering on Thursday. Myanmar could also be in the spotlight after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said Washington was concerned about the possible transfer of nuclear technology from North Korea to the military junta. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting on the Thai resort island of Phuket has brought together foreign ministers and senior officials from across Asia, Europe and the United States. North Korea, condemned for recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests, has sent low-ranking officials after sending its foreign minister to previous meetings of the 15-year-old group. Clinton planned to deliver a statement giving North Korea a choice between more sanctions if it refuses to give up its nuclear program and an array of benefits if it abandons them. "Full normalization of relations, a permanent peace regime, and significant energy and economic assistance are all possible in the context of full and verifiable denuclearization," Clinton will say, according to prepared excerpts of her speech. All of these incentives have been offered to North Korea in the past and it was not clear why Clinton thought they would change North Korea's mind about its nuclear program. "In the meantime, we will undertake the necessary defensive measures to protect our interests and our allies," she added. "North Korea's ongoing threatening behavior does not inspire trust, nor does it permit us to sit idly by." The head of the North's delegation, ambassador-at-large Pak Kun-gwang, told his Thai hosts this week he did not want Pyongyang to be a punchbag at the meeting. A draft communique to be issued at the end of the meeting said participants wanted ARF to come up with concrete and effective responses to terrorism, transnational crime, nuclear proliferation and maritime security. The statement, obtained by Reuters, also said the group wanted to "overcome security threats and challenges and prevent escalation of potential conflicts." It made no direct mention of North Korea or Myanmar. Many experts on North Korea have concluded from the reclusive state's belligerence that Pyongyang wants to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and will not end its atomic activities. The poor health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, believed to have suffered a stroke a year ago, and uncertainty about who might succeed him has further complicated efforts to persuade Pyongyang to curb its nuclear ambitions. Clinton said the international community was still open to talks with North Korea. "But we are not interested in half measures. We do not intend to reward the North just for returning to the table," she said. "We will not give them anything new for actions they have already agreed to take, and we have no appetite for pursuing protracted negotiations that will only lead us right back to where we have already been." North Korea has said "six-party" talks on ending its nuclear programs in exchange for a range of benefits were dead. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said during his campaign for office last year that Seoul would set up a $40 billion international investment fund, double the North's yearly economic output, if Pyongyang scrapped its nuclear weapons
