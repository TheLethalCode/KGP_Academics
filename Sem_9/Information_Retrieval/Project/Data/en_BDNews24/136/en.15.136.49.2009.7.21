<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh went one better than last week's first-ever Test win on foreign soil by securing an historic away series when they won the second and final Test at St George's, Grenada against makeshift West Indies by four wickets on Tuesday. Shakib Al Hasan's men survived a nervy period on the fourth day at the National Cricket Ground before chasing down the modest 215-run target. Though the acting skipper narrowly missed a well deserved century, he ended years of anguish in the most emphatic manner -- hitting Kemar Roach for a six. He remained undefeated on 96 as the Tigers reached 217-6 in 54.4 overs. Man-of-the-match and series Shakib, leading in place of injured Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, smashed 13 fours and a six. He got two Blackberries for the sterling efforts with both bat and ball throughout the series. The foundation of the victory was, however, laid by the 106-run stand for the fifth wicket with Raqibul Hasan whose plucky 66 off 99 balls steadied the innings that appeared wobbling at 67 for 4. Their stand ended any hopes of the second-string West Indies outfit, missing the bulk of their first-choice players because of a contract dispute with their board, from denying Bangladesh its finest hour after gaining Test status in the year 2000. While most of Bangladesh will wake up to the news certain quarters will refocus their argument on whether the victory and Test series was convincing enough. But it is not their doing who they face. Raqibul counter-attacked to keep the hosts on their toes. He had struggled in the first Test but held his own in the first innings here. The 21-year-old was the first to reach his maiden Test half-century when the young right-hander steered the ball down to the vacant spaces at third man off Dave Bernard with score on 141-1. He eventually fell with this side 30 runs away from an historic victory after spooning a return catch to Darren Sammy who juggled and took the catch at the second attempt. His knock featured eight fours and a six. Shakib reached his third Test fifty 20 runs after his former partner Raqibul. The left-hander spanked the ball through mid-off and cover off Kemar Roach. The bowler conceded two more consecutive boundaries in that over. Earlier, the prospect of any play on the penultimate morning looked remote as there was a two-hour rain delay. But it did little to dampen the Tigers' mood as spin duo Enamul Haque Jr and Shakib Al Hasan picked up the remaining two wickets in 4.1 overs after West Indies resumed on 192-8 and added just 17 runs to their overnight total. It was the first time Bangladesh had bowled out the opposition for less than 250 in both innings. Dave Bernard was stumped by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off Enamul for 69 that included six fours and two sixes while Shakib had Tino Best caught by Mushfiqur Rahim for a 23-ball 12 to end the West Indies innings. Bangladesh made 232 in reply to the hosts' first inning total of 2
