<TEXT>
 Chittagong, July 26 (bdnews24.com) The government is seeking Chinese support for a proposed tunnel under Chittagong's Karnafuli river to improve road links of the commercially crucial port city, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain said Sunday "A seven-member team of the Economic Relations Department will go to Beijing on July 28 to discuss financial and technical assistance from the Chinese government regarding the tunnel," said Hossain at a ceremony to mark the start of the final construction phase of a third bridge over the Karnafuli. He said a tunnel under the river would greatly improve transport links between the north and south parts of the country's second city. Inaugurating the final phase of work on the third Karnafuli bridge, Hossain said the new structure was destined to play an important role in the economic life of the country. He said regular dredging would be carried out in the vicinity of the new bridge to control siltation and maintain navigability of the river. Construction of the bridge started on July 19, 2006 after prolonged political wrangling. Located adjacent to the older Shah Amanat Bridge, the new span will have four lanes and span 950 metres long with a width of almost 25 metres. Total expenditure for the bridge is estimated to be Tk 590 crore, of which Tk 372 crore was provided by the Kuwait Fund. The remainder has been supplied by the revenue sector. Project director Md Mohiuddin said eighty percent of work on the new bridge had been completed, and construction of the approach road and toll plaza was also well developed. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to open the bridge in October 2009. Turning to another topic, the communications minister said plans were well developed for construction of the Padma bridge at Mawa, 50 kilometres south of Dhaka. "There is no shortage of funds to construct this bridge," said Hossain. bdnew
