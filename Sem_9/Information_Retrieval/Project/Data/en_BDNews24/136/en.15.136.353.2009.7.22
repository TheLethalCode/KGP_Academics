 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Syed Ashraful Islam was unanimously selected Awami League acting general secretary at the party's central working committee meeting on Wednesday, a day after Abdul Jalil resigned and ahead of the party's national council scheduled for July 24 (Friday). "Abdul Jalil's resignation letter was unanimously approved at the meeting," Ashraful told reporters in a late evening briefing. The ALCWC meeting kicked off a little after 6pm at the party chief's political office in Dhanmondi. Ashraf said the meeting also gave the nod to the ruling party's permanent constitution to be approved by council, declaration paper, the speech that the party president Sheikh is expected to deliver at the party's national council and the day's programmes. New Awami League leaders will also be elected through the council, he said. Ashraf also said opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, BNP's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, business leaders, heads of private organisations and diplomats are among those who have been invited to the council to be held at the newly renamed Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. "However, those parties and leaders who are affiliated with war criminals will not be invited," he said. The Awami League spokesman said the Bangladesh cricket team's recent victory against the West Indies to clinch their first ever overseas test was felicitated by the ALCWC. The meeting has been postponed until Thursday at 6pm. Jalil quits, frustrated Abdul Jalil resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on Tuesday. He announced his resignation in a press briefing at his Gulshan home, just days before the ruling party's national council is due to take place. "I am resigning as I have not been allowed to discharge my duty for the upcoming council," Jalil told the briefing. "I hoped that I would work in the council. As I was not given the scope I had no other option but to resign from the post," he said. Jalil said: "According to the party constitution the general secretary convenes the council session. The invitation should be in his or her name. "The general secretary submits his report in the council session. But I haven't been given the opportunity," he said. AL presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told reporters on July 17 that Jalil was not included in the council preparatory committee due to illness. Jalil previously served as commerce minister during the 1996-2001 AL government, and was elected general secretary in the party's 19th council in December 2002. He was arrested and jailed on corruption charges on May 28, 2007, during the state of emergency, along with many other politicians. Ashraful, who was joint general secretary, took over as acting secretary general during Jalil's detention. Jalil was later paroled by the caretaker government on March 2 last year to seek medical treatment in Singapore after falling ill in jail. He returned home six months later. During his detention and while being treated abroad, outspoken Jalil was reported on a number of occasions criticising Hasina's rule in the party, and saying there was no democracy within the party. He denied the statements after his release on bail ahead of the December 2008 general elections. He said he was tortured and forced to make such statements during his detention. Jalil announced he was resuming his duties as AL general secretary after his release, but he was sidelined initially as Ashraful continued in his role as AL's acting general secretary for some time. Though Jalil was eventually reinstated, Ashraful was made official party spokesperson which role he had played until Wednesday. Council on schedule As per the Representation of the People Order, political parties are meant to submit their ratified constitutions to the Election Commission by July 25, or six months from the first sitting on parliament that took place on Jan25. The ruling party has said it is holding its council within the deadline, even though a number of parties, including the main opposition BNP, have asked the EC to extend the deadline up to January next byear. The chief election commissioner has said the EC will extend the time by another six months until Jan 25 2010, and has requested the government to amend the law accordingly. bdne
