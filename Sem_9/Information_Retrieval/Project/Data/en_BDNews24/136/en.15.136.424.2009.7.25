 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  Twenty-four of the 28 swine flu cases so far detected in Bangladesh have fully recovered, an official said Saturday. The latest case is a 42-year male recently returned from Indonesia, IEDCR director Dr Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com. Rahman said earlier cases had been detected among Bangladeshis recently arrived from Britain, South East Asia and Australia, but most cases were from the United States. A handful of the cases have been contracted in Bangladesh. Of the total 28 cases to date, four are under treatment, while the rest have fully recovered, he said. The World Health Organization's latest figures, released Friday, showed the pandemic flu had spread to some 160 countries and killed about 800 people across the globe. WHO declared a global H1N1 influenza pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. The UN agency has said it is up to national health authorities to decide what measures they impose to slow the spread of the new strain, but it also told countries to stop reporting individual cases and concentrate on mitigation measures and detecting any unusual patterns of disease or spike in rates of absenteeism. The WHO said this is the fastest-moving pandemic ever known and it is now pointless to count every case. The world health body has also called for careful monitoring in case the strain mutates and becomes more severe over the coming winter. The Bangladesh government is screening incoming international passengers for flu symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports. Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports are also screening travellers, according to officials. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to wash hands regularly to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bd
