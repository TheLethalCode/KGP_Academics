 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh national cricket team will get ready to switch to the shorter-version game when they take on the University of West Indies Vice Chancellor XI in the lone one-day practice match in Portsmouth, Dominica on Friday.

However, Bangladesh will miss the services of injured pace spearhead Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who along with Shahadat Hossain, Enamul Haque Jr and wicketkeeper Sahagir Hossain are scheduled to return home on Friday. Pacer Nazmul Hossain replaced Mashrafe while left-arm medium pacer Syed Rasel, left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak and spinning-all-rounder Naeem Islam already joined the Tigers for the three one-day internationals. No doubt, the focus will be on Mohammad Ashraful in the practice match as the former captain is still going through a bad patch having scored only 24 runs in four innings (6,3,12 and 3). Bangladesh led by Shakib al Hasan will take on hosts West Indies in the first of three ODIs on July 26 at Dominica before facing the same opponents on July 28 in the same ground. The visitors will play the third and final one-dayer on July 31 at St. Kitts before the lone T20 match on August 2 at the same venue. The West Indies Cricket Board has already announced their one-day squad for the first two matches with retaining most of the players from the Test squad and added Kieran Powell, Devon Smith, Andre Fletcher, Rawl Lewis and Gavin Tong
