 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)The first hajj flight carrying hajj pilgrims will fly to Saudi Arabia on Oct 20, the civil aviation minister said on Thursday. Considering Nov. 27 or 28 as the probable hajj date, the work on sending hajj pilgrims will have been completed by Nov 20, GM Quader told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting on hajj pilgrims transportation and management. A total of 53,442 pilgrims, including around 8000 under government management, will have the opportunity to perform the yearly rituals. Quader said Saudia Airlines will carry 20,000 and Biman Bangladesh Airlines the rest of the hajj pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Renting of two Boeing 747s are at the final stages and another agreement will be sealed with a aircraft rental company to keep an aircraft stand by just in case, he said. Biman's DC-10 and two other rented aircrafts will ferry the pilgrims. Three DC-10 aircraft are now operating and during the hajj, four will be at work, he further said. Besides, three aircrafts rented by Biman to maintain the flight schedule will be used to transport hajj passengers, he added. He said that Hajj pilgrims this time will not have to face the problems they faced in the past. He said the government had seen to it that they did not face harassment. Special teams will work to serve the passengers at the airport and to receive them in Saudi Arabia. Sufficient medical facilities will also be there, he said. State minister Shahjahan Miah said houses for pilgrims going under government management had been rented and for those under private management the renting was going on. bd
