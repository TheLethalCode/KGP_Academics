 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)A self-confessed wife murderer turned himself in to Jatrabari police station on the outskirts of the capital on Wednesday, police said. Jatrabari police chief Md Maniruzzaman told bdnews24.com, "The man, Moin Uddin, arrived at the police station at dawn, confessed to killing his wife Ankhi and asked to be arrested." The 30 year-old Moin gave an address. "Police retrieved Ankhi's body at 7am from the address in North Jatrabari. The house is owned by Moin's sister," said Maniruzzaman. "It looked like the householders had no knowledge of the crime. They said they learnt about the murder from the police who retrieved the body," he said. Moin and Ankhi, residents of Shanir Akhrha, had come to visit their relative on Tuesday, the householders told police. Ankhi was orginally from Bhelanagar village in Banchharampur Upazila, Brahmanbarhia, said police. Her father Jainal Miah works in Kuwait. She was the third child in a family of six sisters and a brother. Forkan Miah, Ankhi's cousin, told bdnews24.com, "Ankhi's family married her off to Moin just eight months ago, giving Tk 1 lakh and two bharis of gold as dowry." "During the marriage preparations, Moin had said he was a small businessman. In reality, he was unemployed," said Forkhan. "He murdered Ankhi because he had pressed for more dowry but failed to get it," claimed the cousin. Police are investigating the motive for the murder, said Maniruzzaman. bdne
