 STANFORD, California, July 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Maria Sharapova, struggling for form after shoulder surgery and languishing 61st in the world rankings, is refusing to be written off as a title contender at the Stanford WTA tournament starting on Monday. "I'm a competitor and played many tournaments and won quite a few," the three-time Grand Slam winner, who faces Japan's Ai Sugiyama in the first round, told reporters. "You want to be the winner and if someone tells you otherwise they wouldn't be telling the truth." However, winning at Stanford will be a tall order for the 22-year-old Russian in a field which includes Serena and Venus Williams and former world number one Jelena Jankovic.

Her biggest worry is lack of match practice. "There's no better way to get into shape as a tennis player than playing tennis," she said. "I can do all the running or Pilates I want, work myself until I'm blue in the face, but when you go on court for the first time after months on end, your body isn't used to the whole thing." "Now it's a matter of forgetting what I went through and to get on court and try to do the right thing over and over. These tournaments are going to be crucial. As far as results, I'd like to be champion because that feels pretty darn good and I want that feeling back, but I'm not saying that in the next month and half I will or won't
