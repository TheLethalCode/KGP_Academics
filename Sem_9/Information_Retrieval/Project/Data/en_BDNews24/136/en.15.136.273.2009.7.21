 COLOMBO, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahela Jayawardene scored an unbeaten 72 to rally Sri Lanka to 164 for five at tea on the second day of the third and final Test against Pakistan on Tuesday. The experienced batsman hit 10 fours in his 139-ball innings, holding the innings together after Sri Lanka made a shaky start having bowled out Pakistan for 299 in the morning. Chaminda Vaas, playing in his farewell test match, was not out on one, Sri Lanka still trailing by 135 runs. Jayawardene raised 71 runs with all rounder Angelo Mathews (31) for the fifth wicket to revive the innings from the lunch score of 63 for three. The hosts, already 2-0 up in the series, needed just 3.4 overs in the morning to end the Pakistan innings after the visitors had resumed on 289 for seven. Sri Lankan left-arm paceman Thilan Thushara grabbed two of the last three wickets to fall, claiming career-best figures of five for 83 from 20.4 overs. The home pacemen wrapped up the innings as Pakistan batting collapsed for the fourth time in the series, the last six wickets tumbling for 14 runs after the second new ball was taken. Nuwan Kulasekara, who returned three for 47, struck first in the morning, trapping Danish Kaneria leg before for one. The touring side's hopes of posting a total in excess of 300 faded when Kamran Akmal, their last recognized batsman, was bowled by Thushara for one. He also bowled Saeed Ajmal for eight to pick up his first five-wicket haul in a Test innings. Pakistan had raised hopes of a big total when opener Khurram Manzoor, who top-scored with 93, and Mohammad Yousuf (90) shared 167 runs for the third wicket on the first day. GUL STRIKES Pakistan bowlers led the fightback after Umar Gul bowled Malinda Warnapura first ball of the innings after an ugly waft across his stumps. Skipper Younus Khan also chipped in, bowling opener Tharanga Paranavitana for five to reduce Sri Lanka to 23 for two. Sri Lanka would have been in deeper trouble had Manzoor not dropped Sangakkara on 16, spilling an easy catch at gully after the skipper played Mohammad Aamer away from his body. Sangakkara batted fluently for his 45 from 56 balls, stroking seven boundaries until he was adjudged leg before against spinner Saeed Ajmal to the last ball before lunch, although TV replays showed the ball pitched outside leg stump. Ajmal struck another big blow after the interval, with a sharp off break to bowl Thilan Samarweera for six. Jayawardene rallied the innings with Mathews, playing skilfully against quality spin bowling from Ajmal and leg spinner Kaneria. Kaneria, who troubled Mathews throughout his innings, gave the break just before tea when he induced the batsman to edge a catch to slip. Sri Lankan makeshift wicket-keeper Tillakaratne Dilshan did not take the field Tuesday after suffering an injury to his right-hand on the first day. The hosts are awaiting the results of scans to assess the extent of the injury.
