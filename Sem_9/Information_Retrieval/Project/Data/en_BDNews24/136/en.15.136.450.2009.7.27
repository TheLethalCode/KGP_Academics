 Patuakhali, July 27 (bdnews24.com)A depression in the Bay has whipped up troubles in the seas, estuarine waterways and rivers in Patuakhali, forcing passenger ferries to suspend operations. Incessant rains have severely restricted public mobility. Md Shahidullad Miah, Patuakhali river port official, said all motor launches below the length of 65 feet have been barred from cruising in the inclement weather. If the situation worsens, inland navigation with Dhaka and all other routes may have to be shut down in the afternoon, he added. Patuakhali Met Office senior observer Md Raqibul Islam said 60 mm rainfall was recorded from 1am to 12 noon on Monday. The seas are choppy due to the low, waves up to three to four feet lapped the shores. Ahsan Azim, a teacher from Char Kajal, said under the influence of the low, public life in the char area has been paralysed, as the seas and the estuaries have been experiencing gusty to squally winds. Hundreds of fishing trawlers returned from the seas in apprehension. bdn
