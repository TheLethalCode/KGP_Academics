 HANGZHOU, China, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  New signing Michael Owen scored twice and Ryan Giggs grabbed a hat-trick as Manchester United rounded off their pre-season Asian tour with a 8-2 thrashing of China's Hangzhou Greentown on Sunday.

It was another contribution from the outstanding Berbatov which set up the pick of the goals after 39 minutes, Owen controlling the Bulgarian's flicked pass on his chest before leaping to volley home from the edge of the area. Nani's strike and two in a row from substitute Giggs underlined United's superiority early in the second half but Ferguson will not have been impressed with the way Wang Hongyou was allowed room to head the ball past Ben Foster from a corner 13 minutes from the end.
