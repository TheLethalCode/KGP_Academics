 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Eight national footballers, who walked out of the training of the national team on Thursday, have been fined a month's salary as well as warned not to breach discipline in future. Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido has also been warned not to cross his authority. The decisions were taken on Sunday at the meeting of the National Team Management Committee (NTMC) with BFF vice-president Badal Roy in the chair. "The meeting decided to fine the offending players a month's salary worth 15,000 and gave them a final warning of not breaching the discipline in future," Roy told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "The meeting also decided to warn coach Dido as the committee thinks the coach has no authority to order the players to leave the camp," said the former national footballer. Following the walk out of Thursday's practice session, the NTMC had several meetings with the coach as well as eight players on Saturday and failed to deliver a decision and kept the camp closed for two days. The players later repented their mistakes to the coach, who, however, stuck to his decision to dismiss all eight players from the camp. Dido took two days to let the committee know his stance and it seems the matter reached crisis-point as the Brazilian had earlier told the NTMC to choose one option from two  keep him or withdraw eight players from the camp. Before the start of Sunday's meeting, Badal said, "Those who accept the decision will stay with us, otherwise those or he will leave us." He also said that the incident should have been solved when it arose. Replying to a query, Roy said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin was informed about the matter and he would only interfere when the NTMC would fail to solve it. Salahuddin is scheduled to return home from Singapore on Monday. Meanwhile, the 31 footballers went to the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan on July 13 for eight week's training after a three-week conditioning camp at Cox's Baza
