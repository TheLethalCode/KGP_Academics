 LONDON, Jul 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - ITV is promising exclusive unseen footage of Michael Jackson from the private collection of the singer's friend Uri Geller in a forthcoming documentary, "My Friend Michael Jackson: Uri's Story," its production and distribution division said Friday. The documentary will show Jackson on a midnight shopping spree at London department store Harrods and visiting the grounds of Exeter soccer club, as well as footage from Geller's private archive showing the singer acting as best man at Geller's wedding. It will also feature interviews with Geller offering his frank recollections of the star and some of the controversies that surrounded him. "This is the real Michael Jackson, the way that just a handful of friends were privileged to see him -- relaxed, witty, loving, smart, sincere and genuine," said Geller. "This film gives audiences around the world the opportunity to experience the reality of life with Michael." The documentary will be distributed by ITV Global Entertainment.
