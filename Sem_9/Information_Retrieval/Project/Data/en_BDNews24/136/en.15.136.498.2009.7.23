 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)Awami League was completing preparations on the eve of its national council, the first for seven years, to be held under tight security at the newly renamed Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Friday. The ruling party's 20th national council will ratify its permanent constitution, in line with electoral laws amended last year ahead of the ninth parliamentary elections. Awami League, founded on June 23, 1949, will hold its council with the slogan '60 years of struggle and success' and with the mission to build a 'Digital Bangladesh' as pledged in its election manifesto. The 19th council was held in 2002. Last sitting of the AL CWC The ruling party's Central Working Committee sat in a last meeting Thursday to finalise its permanent constitution, declaration paper, the speech of party president Sheikh Hasina and the day's programmes. The meeting, chaired by party president Sheikh Hasina at her political office, also approved the party budget for three years and a report from the general secretary to be placed in the council. "A final list of councillors is ready," the party's newly selected acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting. Organising secretary Abdul Mannan said 5,253 councillors from around the country will join the conference and elect the party's future leaders. "Thousands of councillors and delegates have already arrived in Dhaka," said Ashraf. "Initiatives were taken to tighten the security system of the conference centre and law enforcement agencies are requested to take extra security measures," he said. The programme The day will start with hoisting the national and party flags at 9:30am. Party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the day's programme at a session in the morning. The main council session will start at 3pm where major decisions will be approved. Council centre and security measures Two-tier security will be in place on Friday, for the council and for the prime minister. Seven hundred Dhaka Metropolitan Police personnel will be deployed for the council, along with Special Branch, Rapid Action Battalion and National Security Intelligence personnel. RAB, police and other law enforcing agencies were already deployed at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, renamed from the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre just days ago. Uniformed and plain clothes security personnel were seen patrolling on Thursday. RAB officer Major Ziaul Ahsan told bdnews24.com RAB-2 was in charge of the overall security supervision. "But members from other units are also deployed." A dog squad is also be on patrol, he said. Ahsan said law enforcers will be in uniform and plain clothes. "Everyone entering the conference place will be checked." Lt Col Mirza Rokaiya Nur, also of RAB, told bdnews24.com they had been deployed since Wednesday. Around 24 close circuit cameras, each with a 90m range, will be placed at the main conference building, its grounds and surrounding areas. 'In a hurry' Awami League spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said just days ago, the decision was taken in a hurry to hold council and submit a permanent constitution to Election Commission in line with the Representation of the People Order, and within the July 25 deadline. The party had originally considered asking the EC for a six-month extension. The RPO gave political parties, registered with draft constitutions ahead of the December 2009 elections, six months from the convening of the new parliament to ratify their permanent constitutions. BNP and 10 other parties, however, have requested extensions to prepare and hold effective councils, and on July 21 the Election Commission requested the government to amend the law to give up to Jan 25 next year. bdnew
