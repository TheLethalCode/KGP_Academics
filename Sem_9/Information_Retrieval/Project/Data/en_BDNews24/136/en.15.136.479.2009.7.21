<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)One of the most wanted militants sought by Indian authorities was arrested in the capital on Thursday after he spent 14 years in hiding. Police believe at the orders of Kashmir-based militant group 'Lashkar-e-Taiba' leader Amir Reza, Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah had been preparing for attacks by organising militants in Bangladesh, city police chief AKM Shahidul Haq said. He had advanced weapons training for one and a half months during the war in Afghanistan in 1990-91. He had gone to Afghanistan many times and fought against the Soviet army. The Detective Branch presented Obaidullah before the media on Friday after they arrested him near the Babubazaar bridge. Shahidul said Obaidullah mainly encourages people to wage 'Jihad'. He used to encourage people in activities against rightwing Hindu groups and the army in Kashmir. There are no specific allegations of acts of sabotage against the top arms expert, the police chief said. During his 14 years in Bangladesh, he would train up people to be militants. He is most wanted in India as he has links with militant groups, Shahidul said. He said information derived from Indian mafia operative Daud Merchant and his associate Zahid Sheikh, who were arrested from Brahmanbaria in May, led to Obaidullah's arrest. Hailed from Hawrah district in West Bengal, Obaidullah has been living in Bangladesh with his wife, three sons and two daughters since 1995. He has a doctorate degree on 'fatwa' from 'Deoband' madrasa in India's Uttar Pradesh. In last six years in Bangladesh, he taught in a madrasa in Madaripur district by the name Moulana Abu Zafar. He had also taught at three madrasas in Jessore, Satkhira and Srimangal. Shahidul said Obaidullah had links with four other most wanted Indian militants who are also hiding in Bangladesh. Obaidullah also confessed to having connection with the four men. Obaidullah confesses Obaidullah told reporters that he had living in Bangladesh with his family only to lie low. He wanted to be left 'undisturbed' and so, he did not got involved in any act of sabotage or with any group, he added. He, however, had planned to eliminate the Hindus and 'the foes of the Muslims' by forming a group. He has no followers in Bangladesh, Obaidullah said. He voted in the last December parliamentary election as well. His Bangladeshi classmates in Deoband helped him staying in the country. Although he supports Lashkar-e-Taiba, Obaidullah denied having any connection with the group, ever. Its leader Amir Reza had told him to join the group, but he refused. Before hiding in Bangladesh in 1995, he was involved with Pakistan-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI). Now, he has no links with the group, he claimed. Obaidullah also denied any ties with Daud Merchant. "I have seen Merchant, but have no relation with him. They are smugglers and have no idealism. But they have also acted to eliminate Hindus." bdnews2
