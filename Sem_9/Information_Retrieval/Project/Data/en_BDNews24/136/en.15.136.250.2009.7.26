 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)The government would like to see all political parties completing the registration process with the Election Commission by submitting their ratified constitutions, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Sunday. Ashraf, also the newly elected general secretary of Awami League, told reporters at his secretariat office, "No proposal for extension of the deadline for submitting permanent constitutions has yet reached the government. "It will be duly considered after it reaches us." The ruling AL submitted its permanent constitution by the July 25 (Saturday) deadline of the EC, after getting it approved at a "hurriedly" convened national council the day before. The main opposition BNP has said it would like more time to hold council in December, when the party constitution will be finally approved before submission to the EC. The EC has recommended that the Representation of the People Order be amended to accommodate requests for the deadline extension by the main opposition and other parties. All political parties have been required to bring about changes in their constitutions and manifestos to fulfill the registration terms. The new electoral law says no political party can run the polls without registration with the EC. The EC provisionally registered 39 political parties during the caretaker government regime, accepting their draft constitutions on condition that they would all hold councils within six months, to ratify permanent constitutions before submitting them. bdne
