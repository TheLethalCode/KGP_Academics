<TITLE> Moudud, gainer of Mujib killing, blocking trial: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said BNP leader Moudud Ahmed is a beneficiary of assassination of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "He is trying to obstruct the trial of the Bangabandhu murder case by making misleading remarks so that it is not completed," he told reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday. "They [BNP] rode to power on this murder. Considering this aspect, Moudud Ahmed can be called a beneficiary to Bangabandhu killing." Shafique said the hearing on the appeals against the High Court verdict on the case will take place soon. "Hearing on the case will be held shortly after the chief justice forms a bench." "Why didn't you move for the trial when you were in power?" he snapped at Moudud, a former law minister who went on to become a deputy prime minister in the military strongman HM Ershad's government. "Former chief justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury had lamented in his farewell speech that the murder could have been tried by appointing judges to the Appellate Division on an ad hoc basis. But the Moudud Ahmeds did not do that." "You were in power after 1975, but then did not try [Bangabandhu murder case]. Instead, those who were self-declared murderers were rewarded with jobs in various countries," the law minister said. Moudud on Wednesday had questioned why the government's move for a 'speedy resolution' of appeals in the Bangabandhu murder case is taking so long. "It is not clear why it is taking so long. It could have been settled by now if appeals began in March by forming a bench with three judges," he had said. It has been a year since the Supreme Court accepted petitions by the five death convicts for a review of the High Court verdict. The trial court handed down ruling in the case in 1998 and the High Court gave its verdict in 2001. The trial hit snags as three of the five judges who sit on the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court are unable to hear the appeals for varied reasons, which means another judge is needed to start the hearing. The appeals hearing can start only with the appointment of a new judge, either on a permanent or an ad-hoc basis. Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975 and the case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. On the latest appointment of four judges to the Appellate Division, he said, "The president appointed four judges to the Appellate Division under his constitutional jurisdictions after consulting with the chief justice." "We need more judges to speedily settle the cases in a country of 15 crore people. There is no ulterior motive in their appointments." On the dispute over the number of on-trial cases in the Appellate Division, the minister said right data was not available as the case management in the Supreme Court was not very efficenient. The Supreme Court needs its own secretariat to better monitor judges' work in the lower courts . On the planned war crimes trial, he said the process will start after the home ministry appointed the investigation agencies. b
