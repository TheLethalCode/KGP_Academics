 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League submitted its permanent constitution, ratified at its national council, to the Election Commission on Saturday, officials said. Outgoing office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan MP handed the document to EC additional secretary Rafiqul Islam at around 4pm. Jatiya Party also handed in its constitution at the EC secretariat earlier in the day. Election officials said some 18 other parties, out of a total 39, had submitted their constitutions by hand or by post up to Saturday, in line with new electoral laws. Awami League and its key ally Jatiya Party held long-due national councils Friday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina retained her party presidency for a sixth time, while Syed Ashraful Islam was elected general secretary, at the AL's 20th national council. A fully fledged Awami League central working committee will be announced in a couple of days, said the new general secretary. HM Ershad and Ruhul Amin Howladar were unanimously re-elected JP chairman and secretary general at their national council Friday. Former president Ershad expressed his desire to be at the helm of the party for life. The former military strongman has been the chairman since the inception of the party in 1986. According to the Representation of the People Order, Saturday (July 25) was the deadline for submission of permanent constitutions, after ratification by national councils, for the 39 political parties registered ahead of the December elections with draft constitutions. Officials at the Election Commission have said they are willing to extend the deadline, however, as the main opposition BNP and at least 10 other parties have requested more time.
