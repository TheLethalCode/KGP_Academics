<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 23 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has made it clear to foreign minister Dipu Moni that Kuala Lumpur is maintaining its embargo on Bangladeshi workers, the foreign ministry said on Thursday. Dipu Moni met Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Anifah Aman on the sidelines of the 16th ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Phukhet, Thailand. Earlier this year, overseas employment minister Khandker Mosharraf Hossain stated that Kuala Lumpur had taken a "political decision" to lift the ban that had forced some 55,000 Bangladeshi workers out of Malaysia earlier this year. "Lifting the ban was just a matter of time", Hossain had told bdnews24.com on May 7. Dipu Moni, in Phuket on Thursday, enquired about Malaysia's latest stance, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Aman told Dipu Moni his government would lift the ban on Bangladeshi workers after Malaysia had fully recovered from the effects of the global recession,. "The Malaysian foreign minister said it was a reiteration of the existing decision so that unscrupulous manpower agents did not send prospective workers when there are still no jobs available," quoted the statement. "He (Aman) reassured that the decision to take Bangladeshi workers still holds," it said. "They will be taken once Malaysia starts recovering from the current economic recession". The Malaysian government on March 10 cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers because of a "politically sensitive" statement made by a Bangladeshi diplomat. Bangladesh labour counsellor Talat Mahmud had told a Malaysian TV channel that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs despite the economic slowdown in Malaysia. The counsellor told the same to Malaysia's state-run news agency, angering people and politicians in Malaysia, hard hit by the global economic meltdown. The far-eastern country subsequently sent thousands of Bangladeshi workers back empty-handed. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and Hossain in April visited Malaysia and had talks with the leaders of the new government there for lifting the ban. The diplomat was later withdrawn. Around 500,000 Bangladeshis live in Malaysia. Dipu Moni meets Hillary Clinton Dipu Moni also met US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Russian foreign minister Sergey V Lavrov, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana and other leaders. On her meeting with Hilary Clinton, the statement said, "Secretary Clinton said that her government had a lot of interest in South Asia and especially in Bangladesh." "In their exchange, they agreed that a number of areas where the two countries can work together include issues related to climate change, women, children, human rights and counter-terrorism," according to the statement. Dipu Moni also met her Australian counterpart Stephen Smith, the statement said.
