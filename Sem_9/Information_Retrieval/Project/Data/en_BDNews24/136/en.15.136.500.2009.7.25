 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation on Saturday failed to deliver a decision after eight national footballers refused to practice in the afternoon on Thursday under Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido. Following the players' refusal, the National Team Management Committee headed by BFF vice-president Badal Roy had several meetings with the coach and the revolting players for almost six hours at BFF House on Saturday. "The national camp will remain suspended for the next two days and Dido will let us know his stance in a couple of days," Roy told bdnews24.com after having a third meeting with the Brazilian, who had earlier recommended for those players who refused to practice to be dismissed. Dido met the NTMC members soon after captain Aminul Haq repented for their mistakes and wanted a couple of days to let the committee know his decision. "After a second meeting with the players, they repented for their mistakes and they promised us that they clear up everything after talking to the coach as they were not angry with him," the BFF vice-president told reporters. The revolt began during Thursday's second session when defender Rajani Kanta Barman repeatedly refused to continue running round the ground citing his tiredness and so the Brazilian coach asked him to leave the camp forever. Dido, who took charge on January 31 this year, then asked who else wanted to leave the camp and midfielders Arman Aziz, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury and Jahid Hasan, defenders Wali Faisal, Arif Hossain and Mozzamel Hossain Saikat and striker Jahid Hasan Emily followed Rajani by walking out. Eight players also skipped the swimming session on Friday before all players were released for weekly vacation after lunch. Rajani informed Badal Roy of the situation and the NTMC chairman asked him not to leave the camp and reported him on Saturday along with other players. Roy admitted that the players broke the disciplines after not completing the scheduled time on Thursday and they would not compromise with the training schedule as they were advancing to a target and the players had earlier given an idea about the training. The former national footballer, however, said that after having talked with both parties they felt the players were really tired and it was normal to feel that way during high performance training. "I can't understand why the players took such a decision as the slightly modified training schedule is similar to what the players did during the time of coach Andres Cruciani," Argentine fitness trainer Ariel Colman told bdnews24.com. Asked whether he would allow those players to return to training, Dido's reply was "no". Meanwhile, the 31 footballers went to Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan on July 13 for eight week's training after a three-week conditioning camp at Cox'z Baza
