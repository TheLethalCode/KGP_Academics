 Dhaka, Jul 20 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun will return home Tuesday after undergoing medical treatment abroad, a government spokesperson said. "The home minister is now recovered," the ministry's public relations officer Shahenur Miah said Monday. He said she would arrive back late Tuesday night. Sahara left for Singapore on July 1 to be admitted to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, after she injured her right sight in a fall at her home on June 29. The home minister expressed her gratitude to the prime minister for all her support, said a ministry statement. With Sahara's departure, and the absence of junior minister Tanjim Ahmed, the home ministry has been without a minister at its head for almost three weeks. Tanjim, popularly known as Sohel Taj, departed for the USA at the start of June following rumours of his resignation. The home ministry said at the time Tanjim had taken leave. He was expected to return by July 3. Media reports on Sunday quoted Tanjim, speaking from the US, saying he had not returned to Bangladesh as he had filed his resignation on May 31, prior to his departure. bdnews
