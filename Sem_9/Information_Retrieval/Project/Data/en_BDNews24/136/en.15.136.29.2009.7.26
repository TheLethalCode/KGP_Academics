 ISLAMABAD, Sun Jul 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani police have arrested a former member of parliament for his alleged involvement in the beheading of a Polish engineer by Taliban militants in February, his brother and an aide said on Sunday. Shah Abdul Aziz, a cleric and former lawmaker from an Islamist party, was apprehended after the main person accused in the case, a militant named Attaullah Khan, told police he had killed geologist Piotr Stanczak on Aziz's orders, his brother said.

"There's no doubt he has links and several times, the government asked him to negotiate with militants in kidnapping cases," said the aide, Khalid Khuwaja, a former intelligence officer and spokesman for a human rights group. Assaults on foreign aid workers, company employees and diplomats have increased in Pakistan over the past year, especially in areas near the border with Afghanistan, where government forces are battling the Taliban and al Qaeda.
