<TITLE> Clinton to outline 'stark choice' for North Korea </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Jul 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will consult regional players on Wednesday about giving North Korea a choice between tighter sanctions if it pursues its nuclear programme and wider incentives if it abandons them, US officials said. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans separate meetings with the foreign ministers of China, Japan, Russia and South Korea on the resort island of Phuket to plot strategy on how to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. Clinton's talks will come ahead of Asia's biggest annual security gathering, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which takes place on Thursday and where concerns over North Korea's recent military moves will be high on the agenda. In the last two months North Korea has conducted its second nuclear test, test-fired seven ballistic missiles and boycotted "six-party" talks on ending its nuclear programmes in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits. On Tuesday, Clinton also voiced US concerns about possible military links between North Korea and military-ruled Myanmar. US officials said their main focus was to carry out UN Security Council resolution 1874, which bans all North Korean arms exports, authorises UN member states to inspect North Korean sea, air and land cargo and requires them to seize and destroy any goods transported in violation of the sanctions. However, they said they had discussed a wider package of incentives for the North from the other five parties if Pyongyang were to take credible steps on ending its nuclear programme. "We would like to paint a picture for North Korea of a very stark choice," said one senior official who spoke to reporters on condition that he not be identified. "If they continue on the current path, it's a path that leads to greater tensions in northeast Asia, more isolation, more steps aimed at ... the regime," he added. "If they decide they are prepared to work constructively and take the necessary steps on the nuclear side, then there would be a different set of commitments not just from the United States but from the other players as well," he said. The official said the United States hoped to secure greater cooperation from its partners on sanctions if it showed that it was willing to be flexible about providing more incentives. SEOUL WANTED 5-WAY MEETING Clinton was scheduled to hold separate talks with China's Yang Jiechi, Japan's Hirofumi Nakasone, Russia's Sergei Lavrov and South Korean's Yu Myung-hwan on Wednesday. Seoul had wanted foreign ministers from the other five parties to meet jointly on the sidelines to discuss North Korea. But Beijing, the closest North Korea has to a major ally and host of the now moribund six-party talks, was against the idea, said a South Korean official with knowledge of the issue. North Korea has sent a low-level delegation to the talks in Phuket, after sending its foreign minister to previous meetings. There were no announced plans for any of the foreign ministers from the other five parties to meet the North Korean delegation. The U.S. official declined to detail the new incentives under consideration, saying only that "some of them are familiar, but there are new dimensions associated with this as well". However, he said "we are at the other end of the spectrum right now" and concentrating on sanctions. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said during his campaign for office last year that Seoul would set up a $40 billion international investment fund, double the North's yearly economic output, if Pyongyang scrapped its nuclear weapons. The head of the North's delegation, ambassador-at-large Pak Kun-gwang, told his Thai hosts late on Tuesday he did not want Pyongyong to be a punching bag at the regional security meeting on Thursday. "The ambassador wanted to express his concern to the (Thai foreign) minister that he does not want ARF to become a place where his country is attacked," said Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, a Thai Foreign Ministry offi
