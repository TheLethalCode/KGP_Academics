 BUDAPEST, July 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Ferrari's Felipe Massa will be kept under sedation for 48 hours after fracturing his skull in a freak accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix, a hospital doctor attending the Formula One driver said on Sunday.

Ferrari said in their own update on Sunday morning that Massa's "condition remains stable and there were no further complications through the night." Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone went to see the Brazilian on Saturday night and said he hoped to visit again later. "I think he's okay. Everybody seemed quite happy with him this morning. The hospital's happy, which is more important," he told Reuters at the Hungaroring. "I'm waiting to see because he might be asleep all day. If he is awake then I'll go and see
