<TITLE> Govt sees little role in saving Mauritius jobs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The government has no information on the job cuts of some 6,000 Bangladeshi workers in the Island nation Mauritius. And even if it did, expatriates' welfare secretary Elias Ahmed says, there is very little that can be done to save the jobs of the retrenched workers. The secretary, however, said the government would do everything possible to secure them. Reuters, quoting trade unions backing the migrant workers, has reported the African nation is to send home thousands of Bangladeshi workers by the end of 2009 in a move to protect local jobs in the downturn-hit textile sector. Some 6,000 male Bangladeshi workers, 4,000 of whom work in clothing factories, have been ordered to leave within six months, according to union leaders on the palm-fringed island of 1.3 million people. Reaz Chuttoo, president of the Confederation for Private Sector Workers of Mauritius, told Reuters on Tuesday that 6,000 Bangladeshis including 4,000 working in the textile sector had been ordered to go due to global economic recession. "We have not received any message about that," Ahmed, the secretary, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. He said the government would get in touch with the Mauritius authorities to verify the information. "We have no mission in Mauritius. The workers go there through contracts with companies. "Therefore, we have little to do to protect their jobs," he said. Ahmed believed the contracts of the workers may have expired. Some 12,000 Bangladeshis have gone to Mauritius since 1992, mostly in the apparel sector. Bangladesh, still to some extent insulated from the heat of the current global economic downturn, is heavily dependent on the foreign remittances from its wage earners. Last year, 6.5 million Bangladeshis living abroad sent over US $9 billion in remittances. The government fears that the global economic crises may hamper its steady flow of foreign currencies from the expatriates as the workers have been facing job losses in the destination countries. Malaysia this year cancelled over 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers owing to economic slow down there. bd
