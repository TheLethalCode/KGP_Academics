 HARARE, Fri Jul 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe on Friday called for an end to political violence and committed his party to campaigning peacefully as the country marked the start of a national reconciliation process. The southern African country was plunged into violence last year as Mugabe fought to reclaim power in a run-off vote after being defeated by Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai, now prime minister in a new unity government. The formation of the new administration in February has eased political tensions although the MDC says some of its members continue to be targeted by Mugabe's ZANU-PF members in the countryside. "There are still reported cases of political violence and these must stop," Mugabe said during a ceremony marking three days to observe national healing and reconciliation. "We will commit members of our party in observation of the principles of non-violence. You should not succeed through violence but the efficacy of your political theory and your campaign," the veteran leader said. Zimbabwe has had a history of political violence starting from the colonial days and after independence in 1980 when a special military unit led a crackdown against what it branded an insurgency in the Western parts of the country leaving thousands dead. Civic groups say up to 20,000 people, mostly civilians were killed, but Mugabe, who has previously described the period as "a moment of madness," says the figures are exaggerated. The southern African country was again plunged into political violence from 2000 when veterans of the liberation struggle started seizing white-owned commercial farms, killing dozens of farmers and opposition supporters in the process. Last year the MDC said more than 200 of its members were killed in a violent run-off campaign which Mugabe won after Tsvangirai, who defeated Mugabe in a first round presidential vote pulled out, citing gross violence. Speaking at the same ceremony, Tsvangirai said the reconciliation process should also include the pre-independence period during which the former white colonial government was accused of atrocities against nationalist politicians challenging its rule. "These three days of dedication must herald the beginning of a genuine open and frank process that includes and incorporates the concept of transitional justice," said Tsvangirai. "Zimbabwe has suffered so many phases of trauma, upheaval and conflict that there must be agreement on defining the scope of the healing process," he said, adding that retribution would only perpetuate violence. Analysts say Tsvangirai's push for justice is likely to meet resistance from Mugabe's supporters in his ZANU-PF party and the security establishment, accused of violently clamping down on dissent. The former trade union leader, who in March 2007 was severely beaten up by police, said the new government should discuss the issue of reparations for victims of violence. The MDC says its members continue to be harassed by law enforcement agents and that five of its legislators have been convicted on charges of political violence while none from ZANU-PF have been brought to c
