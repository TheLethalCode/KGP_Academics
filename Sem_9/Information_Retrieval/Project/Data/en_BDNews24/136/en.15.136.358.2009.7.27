<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)A woman was killed, and two other people injured, as a train ran into a Mishuk at Malibagh rail crossing in the capital on Sunday. Railway police sub-inspector Bimol Kumar Chaki told bdnews24.com the accident occurred at around 9.20pm as the Parabat Express from Sylhet hit the three-wheeled passenger scooter on the track. Known locally as a Mishuk, the small vehicle was trying to illegally squeeze its way around the level crossing gate after it had been lowered, said Chaki. The Mishuk was carrying two female passengers, one of whom was killed on the spot, he said. The second female passenger and the Mishuk driver were injured, said the sub-inspector. But Chaki could not immediately confirm the identities of the dead woman or the two injured people. Sunday's rail accident in the heart of the capital is the latest in a series of level crossing disasters. At least four rail crossing collisions have occurred in the past six weeks. A passenger train collided with an articulated lorry on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Feni last Thursday. The Chittagong-bound Turna-Nishitha Express rammed into the lorry stuck at Fatehpur level crossing, causing three of the train's compartments to be thrown off the track. At least ten people were injured, though no deaths were reported. Just one week before, on Thursday July 17, five members of a bridal party were killed and ten others injured when a train crashed into their microbus at Mandatala rail crossing in Jessore's Sadar Upazila. Exactly a month before that, on June 17, the Jamuna Express leaving Kamlapur Station in Dhaka crashed into a minibus as it was stuck on the Moghbazar rail crossing, one of the capital's busiest intersections. At least three other vehicles were also smashed in the pile up, but luckily all drivers and passengers had managed to leave their vehicles in time.
