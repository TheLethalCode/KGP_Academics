 Full text of APJ Abdul Kalam's speech at Dhaka University July 20, 2009 Today, I am delighted to be in the midst of the members of University of Dhaka with a renowned history of eighty eight years growing from 877 students to over 34000 students and currently with 1600 faculty members covering various dimensions of knowledge acquisition. My greetings to the faculty members, researchers and distinguished guests assembled here. I greet the pioneers both present and past who have built a robust education system over the years in this university. I am inspired to visit the University of Dhaka which has generated great political leaders, inspiring poets, creative scientists, reputed economists, sharp legal minds, eminent educationists, and above all, generating ignited young minds. When I am with you, I would like to talk on the topic "Capacity building for national development". Dear friends, let me take you to the type of society we are entering and challenges. The knowledge society in 21st century The world in the 21st century will be a knowledge based society with multiple opportunities. I was reading a book, "Empires of the Mind" by Denis Waitley. This book gives, what type of the new world which we are facing now? What was yesterday and what is today. I have modified certain points of the author to suit our conditions. I have also added a third line which relates to action of university. It specially says that "what worked yesterday, won't work today". 1. Yesterday  natural resources defined power Today - knowledge is power University will be a powerhouse for knowledge 2. Yesterday - Hierarchy was the model Today- synergy is the mandate University will be enabler of intersection of mutiple faculties towards mission goals 3. Yesterday  leaders commanded and controlled Today  leaders empower and coach Potential Leaders will be empowered through exposure to the needs of sustainable development 4. Yesterday - shareholders came first Today  customers come first Education should inculcate sensitivity to "customer" needs 5. Yesterday - employees took order Today  teams make decision University can inject team spirit 6. Yesterday - seniority signified status Today  creativity drive status University is the breeding environment for creativity 7. Yesterday  production determined availability Today  Competitiveness is the key Competitiveness is powered by research and university has to have the motto of "teaching-research-teaching" 8.Yesterday - value was extra Today  value is everything Objective Value judgment to be introduced in education 9.Yesterday  everyone was a competitor Today  everyone is a customer Educated customer is also from university 10. Yesterday - profits were earned through expediency Today  Work with integrity and succeed with integrity. Education with value system is the need of the hour Now friends, let us look at the new dimensions of knowledge society. Dimensions of Knowledge society and Economic Development In the knowledge economy the objective of a society changes from fulfilling the basic needs of all-round development to empowerment. The education system will be promoted by creative, interactive self learning  formal and informal education with focus on values, merit and quality. The workers instead of being skilled or semi-skilled will be knowledgeable, self-empowered and flexibly skilled. The type of work instead of being structured and hardware driven will be less structured and software driven. Management style will emphasize more on delegation rather than giving command. Impact on environment and ecology will be strikingly less compared to industrial economy. Finally, the economy will mostly be driven by knowledge and knowledge driven institutions and industries. The emphasis in knowledge society will be on sustainable development. Now let us take the example of University of Dhaka . The vision of Bangladesh to become developed with prosperity of all citizens in equitable manner and to contribute its core competence in partnership for the benefit of the world requires the partnership of the faculty and researchers of the university in the development process. This has a few components. 1. To ensure that a synergy of faculties takes place for given issues of development. 2. Identification of accelerators for development and potential challenges to overcome. 3. To take up research on areas which could be of long term nature relevant to national development. To illustrate the point of synergy, I would like to give a personal experience in deriving the vision of a nation with the example of India. In mid 1990's, I was given the task of chairing Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC). I recollect, that in the first meeting of the Council itself, we took a decision that TIFAC must evolve a plan how India can be transformed into an economically developed nation by the year 2020. When the suggestion was mooted everybody was wondering how we can evolve such a long term mission under the then prevailing economic and social conditions of the country. In spite of this, the council with many young members jumped into the idea and we discussed for one full day on how we can translate the thought into action. At a time when the economy was growing at around 5 to 6% per annum in GDP we had to envisage a growth rate of at least 10% per annum consistently for over 10 years for realizing the development vision of billion democratic people of multi lingual, multi religious and multi cultural characteristics. This really ignited the minds of all of us in the Council. We debated and arrived at 17 task teams with over 500 members who had consultations with over 5000 people in various sectors of the economy. Committees worked for over two years resulting in 25 reports which we presented to the then Prime Minister of India on 2nd August 1996. Transforming India into a developed nation implies that every citizen of the country lives well above the poverty line, their education and health is of a high standard, national security assured and core-competence in certain major areas enabled production of quality goods competitively including for exports, bringing all-round prosperity for the countrymen. This event led to the birth of the book "India 2020: a Vision for the New Millennium". Based on various inputs, the government announced the vision statement that India will become a developed nation by 2020. As far as accelerators of development, there are several areas like increasing food output, improved food processing, infrastructure, communications, affordable access to health care, cost effective habitat, education for all and opportunity for employment or entrepreneurship. For example, how can University of Dhaka contribute to balanced and sustainable growth of Bangladesh ? As far as challenges to development, we have to arrest deterioration of environment, fight pollution, work on prediction of natural disasters like earthquake and cyclone and work on alternative energy sources and energy conservation, prevention against diseases. I have given some examples. I am sure, faculty members of University of Dhaka will be able to assess the national development needs and suggest directed and exploratory research areas to be conducted by the students. Now I would like to discuss, how great minds succeeded in inventions and discoveries. Inventors  inventions and discoverers - discoveries Let us study important inventors and their inventions.  The Wright brothers and the plane.  George Eastman and film  Thomas Edison and the light bulb  Alexandra Graham bell and the telephone.  Sono Arsenic Filter who have developed to deal with the problem of arsenic contamination of groundwater. Let us study a few Discoverers and their discoveries.  Albert Einstein and the energy equation E=MC2  Chandrasekhar Subramaniyam and Chandrasekhar Limit  Sir CV Raman and Raman Effect  Satyendra Nath Bose and theory of the Bose-Einstein condensate The students from University of Dhaka may enter in such a list by working in areas like energy, bio-technology, space, manufacturing or social sciences. You may find new remedies for diseases or code the human life. Dear friends, how did the inventors and discoverers achieve? Inventions and discoveries have emanated from creative minds that have been constantly working and imaging the outcome in the mind. With imaging and constant effort, all the forces of the universe work for that inspired mind, thereby leading to inventions or discoveries. Higher the number of creative minds in the country, the best results of innovation in all the three sectors of the economy will emerge. The faculty members of the universities have to inject these characteristics among the youth which will make them as future discoverers or inventors. Friends, I would like to present my visualization of a nation by or before 2020. Every dimension of visualization has an opportunity for the universities to build certain capacities and expertise among the students. Visualization of the nation in 2020 1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. 2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water. 3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. 4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious candidates because of societal or economic discrimination. 5. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and all citizens are able to feel a sense of security 6. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors. 7. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. 8. A Nation where the governance is responsive and transparent. 9. A nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, devoid of terrorism, peaceful and happy and continues with a sustainable growth path. 10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership. Integrated Action for developed India To achieve the distinctive profile of a nation, we have to have a mission for transforming the nation into a developed nation. For India , we have identified five areas where we have core competence for integrated action. This will be true for many developing nations: (1) Agriculture and food processing (2) Education and Healthcare (3) Information and Communication Technology (4) Infrastructure: Reliable and Quality Electric power, Surface transport and Infrastructure for all parts of the country and (5) Self reliance in critical technologies. These five areas are closely inter-related and if progressed in a coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and national security. The development in science and technology is vital for time-bound realization of the ten pillars that I have mentioned earlier. I have been interacting with many universities, specifically how they can strategize actions for each element of development profile pillars. This has triggered many refreshing thoughts. With multiple disciplines, you may be in a position to offer many path breaking ideas and actions for realizing Bangladesh vision. Now let me talk to you in some detail on the need for world knowledge platform for the challenges faced by humanity in general. Fusion of core competence of two nations Let me share with you a unique experience of developing, a complex system through a joint venture using the core competence of two nations. The technological and managerial cooperation of the two nations and an investment of around two hundred million dollars by each nation have enabled the realization of the first Supersonic Cruise missile called BrahMos, within 5 years. The foundation of the Joint Venture is based on joint design, development, production and marketing. One of the significant technological breakthroughs of this decade is the design, development and productionization of Supersonic Cruise Missile BRAHMOS by an Indo-Russian joint venture. BrahMos is the first supersonic operational cruise missile in the world, which can be launched from multiple platforms such as ships, submarines, road mobile and silo, and with modifications from aircraft. This technological innovation is the trendsetter in the cruise missile field. The robust design of the missile, elaborate ground tests and simulation has ensured 100 percent success rate in all the flight tests conducted for the Armed Forces by the joint venture company. In successful design, development, production and marketing of BRAHMOS missile, an innovative way of technology co-operation has emerged between India and other countries for multi-billion dollar business. Pan African e-Network During the year 2003-04, I visited African countries such as Sudan , Tanzania , Zanzibar and South Africa . I addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 Sept 2004, at Johannesburg , South Africa which was attended by Heads of 53 member countries of the African Union. Based on my study of the communication, healthcare and education needs of the African countries, I proposed the system of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries. The Pan-African e-Network project is estimated to cost around US$100 million. As part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers and 53 tele-education centers in Africa are being connected. In the first phase tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. One of our Indian Universities has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities . As regards, tele-medicine, the specialists from CARE Hospital , Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital , Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. The Pan African e-Network will primarily provide Tele-Education, Tele-Medicine, Internet, videoconferencing and VOIP services. It also supports e-Governance, e-Commerce, infotainment, resource mapping and meteorological services. Each remote location will be able to access the Internet through the network by linking the HUB to Internet backbone. Using this network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries will be connected for instant communication. The network is designed to have 169 terminals and a central hub to deliver tele-education and tele-medicine services. The proposed network will utilize state-of-the-art technology and can be integrated with the latest broadband technologies like Wi-Fi and Wi-Max. The network is scalable to support different applications catering to increased number of users. I am happy to inform you that many countries have already been connected through this network. The rest will be connected subsequently. With these two examples, I am confident that multiple countries can pool their knowledge for developing and leading to products which are needed by many countries. World Knowledge Platform Keeping this in mind, I have proposed to establish the "World Knowledge Platform", which will integrate the core competencies of the partner countries to develop knowledge products. This platform will enable joint design, development, cost effective production and marketing of the knowledge products in various domains based on the core competence of partner nations to international market. Knowledge GRID: Initially, the mission of World Knowledge Platform is to connect and network the R&D Institutions, Universities and Industries using fiber broadband from the partner nations on selected R&D Missions. The underground fiber cable infrastructure already exists between the many partners. This knowledge GRID will support multitude of seamless connections supporting both synchronous and asynchronous communication, carrying either text or audio or video. We can then use this network in the academic environments to teach courses online and share expensive equipments remotely. In the Industrial environment, it can be used to design complex systems  even ones that are as complex as an aircraft in a collaborative way using virtual prototyping concepts in the cyber space. Missions of World Knowledge Platform: The convergence of Bio, Nano and IT is expected to touch every area of concern to the humanity. The "World Knowledge Platform" will take up the missions, in some of the areas discussed further, which are of utmost urgency to all of us to make our world a safe, sustainable, peaceful and prosperous place to live: 1.Energy Independence : the transformation of global energy dependence on fossil fuel like oil, gas, coal has to shift towards renewable energy sources like hydro-power, solar power, wind power and nuclear power. This has to happen to protect the planet earth from environmental pollution and to meet the situation of non availability of fossil fuel in few decades and above all to realize economic freedom from high and fluctuating cost of crude per barrel. 2. Water: Desalination of sea water using solar energy, channelization, networking of rivers, cost effective safe drinking water. 3. Healthcare: Diagnosis, drug delivery system, development and production of vaccines for HIV/TB, malaria and cardiac diseases. The permanent solution has to be found by world wide research through life style change for preventing occurrence and curing diabetic diseases. 4. Knowledge products: Hardware, Software and Networking and Storage Products including handheld micro and nano electronic devices. 5. Transportation systems: Fossil fuel free biofuel based transportation systems using biofuel like ethanol and bio-diesel. Also it is essential to develop transportation system to suit 100% biofuel. 6. Disaster Prediction and Management: Earthquake forecasting, assessing in advance the quantum of rain for particular cloud condition. 7. Capacity Building: Quality human resource development for all the above areas including the development of personnel with world class skills. 8. Sustainable development: Strategies, policies, education system and modeling. A number of academic, research and production institutions from many countries can form a consortium for the vertical missions of the World Knowledge Platform in these areas with the public, private partnership. In short, the Knowledge Platform would be a launch pad for many innovations that are waiting to be unearthed only by the combined power of multiple institutions from multiple countries. I would suggest, University of Dhaka with a strength of over 1600 faculty members and 34,000 students can definitely think of a knowledge platform for pooling the resources available within the university which can be later linked to other universities in Bangladesh and other countries depending upon the products and solutions envisaged. Conclusion The faculty members of University of Dhaka have to build the capacities of research and inquiry, creativity and innovation, use of high technology, entrepreneurial and moral leadership among the youth through the education process. If we develop in all our students these five capacities, we will produce "Autonomous Learner" a self-directed, self controlled, lifelong learner who will have the capacity to both, respect authority and at the same time is capable of questioning authority, in an appropriate manner. These are the leaders who would work together as a "Self-organizing Network" and transform Bangladesh into a prosperous nation. The most important part of the education is to imbibe the confidence among the students is the spirit of "we can do it". Good teaching emanates from research. The teachers' love for research and their experience in research are vital for the growth of the institution. Any University is judged by the level and extent of the research work it accomplishes. This sets in a regenerative cycle of excellence. Experience of research leads to quality teaching and quality teaching imparted to the young in turn enriches the research. I am sure, the faculty members of University of Dhaka will be injecting these capacities among the students through continuous research who in turn will be contributing in multiple areas of national development. My best wishes to all the members of University of Dhaka success in the mission of developing the vital human resource needed by the
