 BANGKOK, Jul 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sketched out on Wednesday how the United States might cope with a nuclear Iran -- by arming its allies in the Gulf and extending a "defence umbrella" over the region. She said crossing the nuclear threshold would not make Iran, which Washington believes is pursuing nuclear weapons, safer or more secure. Iran says its nuclear program is to generate electricity so it can export more oil and gas. "We will still hold the door open (for talks with Iran) but we also have made it clear that we'll take actions, as I've said time and time again, crippling action, working to upgrade the defence of our partners in the region," she said in a programme taped for Thai television during a visit to Bangkok. "We want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment ... that if the US extends a defence umbrella over the region, if we do even more to support the military capacity of those in the Gulf, it's unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer because they won't be able to intimidate and dominate as they apparently believe they can once they have a nuclear weapon." A senior US official said Clinton's comments should be seen as a public arguments that the United States is making to dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear arms rather than a sign that the United States is becoming resigned to the prospect. UNCLEAR INTENTIONS "She is making an argument to Iran about why they should not do this," the official, who spoke on condition that he not be named, told reporters traveling with Clinton. He said the United States still regards a nuclear Iran as unacceptable. Last week Clinton said Iran's intentions were unclear following June's election there and that US President Barack Obama's offer of talks with Tehran over its nuclear programme was not open-ended. Former US President George W. Bush was reluctant to engage Iran directly until it had met certain preconditions, including suspending uranium enrichment, a process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants or atomic weapons. But Obama, who took over in January, says that approach failed and Clinton has also said it was a mistake. Despite the US policy shift, Iran has not responded to Obama's overtures and those from other countries seeking to persuade Tehran to give up sensitive nuclear work the West believes is aimed at building a bomb and Iran says is to generate power. Diplomats suspect Iran is buying time by stalling over getting into any substantive talks. Clinton is heading to the Thai resort of Phuket to attend Asia's biggest annual security meeting. A key topic will be how to rein in North Korea's nuclear progr
