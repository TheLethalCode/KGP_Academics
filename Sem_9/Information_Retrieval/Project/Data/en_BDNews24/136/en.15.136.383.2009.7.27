<TITLE> 'Deadly compounds' </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Jul 26 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka University professor has said the toxic chemical compounds, suspected of causing the deaths of at least 25 children in the past month and a half, have a history of use by unscrupulous drug manufacturers in the country. "In 1992, many children died when diethylene glycol was mixed with a paracetamol product," Prof Abu Sara Shamsur Rouf, of Dhaka University's pharmaceutical technology department, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. He said pharmaceutical factories are known to use ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as a solvent in certain paracetamol preparations, instead of the approved propylene glycol. "These chemicals are cheaper, and smaller amounts of them are required to perform the same task," said Rouf. He said at least three times more propylene glycol is required to dissolve paracetamol in water than ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol. Rouf also said unscrupulous chemical vendors could adulterate propylene glycol with the more toxic compounds to increase their profit margins. "But it is possible for drug manufacturers to determine whether propylene glycol has been adulterated prior to the manufacturing process." Rouf said an overdose of the approved propylene glycol can also damage the kidneys, liver and brain. The US Food and Drug Administration approves the use of no more than 0.1 percent of propylene glycol in the preparation of medicines, he said. Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, speaking at a press briefing earlier in the day, said diagnostic tests were being carried out by a laboratory on samples taken from a number of children who suffered the suspected poisoning. Tests were also being done on samples of a children's paracetamol suspension manufactured by the Rid Pharamaceutical Company, which is suspected of adulteration, he said. Haque said he would not confirm the nature of the children's illnesses or comment on the cause until the results had come in. He also said a top-level ministerial committee had now been formed to investigate the children's deaths, in addition to a four-member parliamentary team formed on July 23. Prof Golam Mainuddin, a paediatric nephrology lecturer at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and a member of the probe committee, said haemodialysis is required in cases of kidney failure due to glycol intoxication. bdne
