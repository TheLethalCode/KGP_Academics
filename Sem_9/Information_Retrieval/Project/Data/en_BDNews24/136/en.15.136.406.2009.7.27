<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith on Monday called on the LDCs to ask together for aid from the fund the developed nations have raised to combat recession. He sought an overhaul of the global financial system that had failed to issue early warning about the downturn. "Today's widespread economic crunch experienced globally has solely been occasioned by the developed nations," Muhith said at a four-day regional workshop co-organised by UN-ESCAP and Bangladesh Bank at Sonargaon Hotel. "The developed nations were being warned too of the dire consequences since 2000. But they didn't heed, now the least developed countries are felling the pinch of the recession," he said. The workshop has been titled 'Strengthening the Response to the Global Financial Crisis in Asia-Pacific: The Role of Monetary, Fiscal and External Debt Policies'. "So, it is they who should bear the most responsibilities also. We should start demanding the funds they have raised to enable the low-income nations wade through these messy times. "Holding seminars and workshops won't do. We should start trying to wrench the slice due to us out of their clutch." "The world economic recession has impacted not so much on our economy until now. There's a surplus balance of payment." "Foreign currency reserve has been quite good for several days. There will be no problem meeting expenses for importing fuel, fertiliser and food." "Loans do not need to be taken from any agency." Muhith said that the Asian Development Bank president, Haruhiko Kuroda, in his recent trip to Bangladesh had said that Bangladesh had seen off the first phase of global recession very well. "But (Kuroda said) our economy will be affected very much if the recession lasts longer." "We no need to get financial aid for the business sector. Now are the bigger challenges lying ahead of uspoverty alleviation and infrastructure development. "Especially development of energy sector and to implement the programmes taken for the poorest people under social safety net in the budget. "Also to help various projects by offsetting losses from climate change." At the inaugural, Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, deputy governor Nazrul Huda and ESCAP director Nagesh Kumar spoke among others. Rahman presented a keynote paper at the session. The finance minister expressed disappointment over the palty allocation of $50 billion for the developing countries from $ 1.1 trillion bailout fund pledged by the rich countries at the G-20 meeting in London in April. Muhith asked for equitable distribution of the fund to help the developing countries to pull through, exhilerate world trade and better regulate financial firms. The workshop in Dhaka is being participated by delegates from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, China, Cambodia, Malaysia, Fiji, the Philippines, Korea, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Representatives from UNDP, World Bank, IMF, ADB and a number of other local and international organisations have also joined the workshop. ERD additional secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, finance ministry joint secretary Jahidul Haque, BB financial adviser Habibullah Bahar and non-governmental research organisation Centre for Policy Dialogue executive director Mostafizur Rahman were also present. "World economic recession more or less impacted on the countries of the Asia-Pacific Region. But, Bangladesh has been affected less than other countries," Rahman, the central bank chief, said. "It has been possible because of Bangladesh's limited and controlled links with other countries in the world." "The state of liquidity of our country also remains normal. It has been possible to sustain a two-digit export growth. Remittance flow stands strong. "A 5.9 percent GDP growth was achieved in the outgoing 2008-09 fiscal year. Inflation is also limited to a one-digit figure." Mindful that the recession may last longer, the government and the central bank have taken initiatives on revenue and monetary policies, including easier loan policies, the central bank chief said. bdnew
