 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)-Operations at Chittagong port were strained Tuesday as crane operators on docks began a strike for better pay and work conditions among other demands. "Around 350 winch men, employed under the berth operators, have been abstaining from work since 8am," Abdul Matin, president of Chittagong Winch Men Welfare Association told bdnews24.com. The docks came to a standstill in the morning, he said. "They will return to work after being ensured better pay, permanent port identity cards and gate passes, welfare allowance, life and health insurance and better work conditions." The country's major sea port was not totally inoperative through the day as the port authorities and berth operators took alternative steps. "Loading and offloading of goods were suspended for sometime in the morning, but the berth operators and other of the port workers began operating the cranes," Ahsanul Kabir, port director (traffic), told bdnews24.com. The crane operators have been in talks with berth operators on several occasions and have also launched strikes twice before. The berth operators and port authorities assured them of meeting their demands, but did not deliver, say the strikers. A member of the berth operators association told bdnews24.com that were surprised and upset as the winch men had stopped work before the latest negotiations had ended. "Their pay demand is not logical, and the issue of permanent identity cards and port entry passes are pending with the port authority," he said. The berth operators are trying to resume talks with the winch men, he said. bdnew
