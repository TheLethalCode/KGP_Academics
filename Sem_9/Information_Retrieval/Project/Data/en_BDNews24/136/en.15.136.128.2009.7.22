<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  A senior minister on Wednesday pressed Myanmar's envoy in Dhaka for resolution of the Rohingya refugee issue and maritime boundary disputes, through regular meetings at diplomatic level. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak, in a meeting with Myanmar ambassador Phae Thann Oo at the former's office, said Bangladesh gave Rohingya refugees from Myanmar shelter for purely humane reasons but there were many problems. Razzak said many Rohingyas refugees assimilated with locals in Bangladesh by obtaining fake IDs, they voted illegally in local and national elections, some engaged in crime and other irregularities. He said some even went overseas with false Bangladeshi passports. Agreeing that the Rohingya issue needed addressing, the Myanmar ambassador assured that his government would send a representative team to the refugee camp in Cox's Bazar. Razzak said bilateral talks were necessary to solve this problem, and maintain close ties between the two countries. Firoz Salahuddin, who represents the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at the Rohingya camp at Cox's Bazar, was also present at Wednesday's meeting. Sea borders Razzak also pressed for resolution of maritime boundary disputes. Bangladesh has long-standing disputes with both Myanmar and India over their shared sea boundaries, preventing crucial oil-gas exploration in the Bay for all three countries. July 27, 2011, is the deadline for Bangladesh to submit its sea border map to the United Nations Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf. Myanmar and India have already submitted maps of their sea boundary to the UN without resolving disputes with Bangladesh The two neighbouring countries are making sea border claims in such ways that entry of vessels to Bangladesh's Chittagong and Mongla ports would be blocked, say foreign ministry officials. Bangladesh has lodged a protest with the UN while still pressing on with its effort to resolve sea border issues through bilateral talks with Myanmar and India. Thann said he would pass on the concerns to his government. Sharing disaster management experience Ambassador Thann said Myanmar was also interested to share disaster management experience with Bangladesh. He also mentioned that Myanmar had little experience in disaster management before cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar last year. Bangladesh is a close neighbour to Myanmar. There are similarities in their culture and both are agro based, he said. Strengthening trade and agricultural relations they can be mutually benefited, said the ambassador. bd
