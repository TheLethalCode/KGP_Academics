"If the owners of these high fire-risk building do not take preventative measures on their own, legal action will be taken against them," said Abu Naeem Md Shahidullah, director-general of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, at a practice drill and volunteer training session in Mirpur. Razzaq said the condition of urban roads remained "a big problem" for the fire service, but the government's hands were currently tied in the matter. "A coordinated initiative will have to be taken involving Rajuk, the city corporations and related ministries," he said. Razzaq also cited a recent study had shown that Dhaka and Tehran were the two most earthquake-prone cities in the world.

He said his ministry was preparing to buy modern equipment to deal more effectively with future disasters. "Greater attention has also been given to construction practices in line with the national building code," he said. Saturday's training was held under, an initiative undertaken by the food and disaster management ministry, as part of the Coordinated Disaster Management Programme.
