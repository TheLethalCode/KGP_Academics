 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  While the nation was gripped by the euphoria of an historic away Test series win, four former national captains put the success in a different spin. Former captain Faruque Ahmed was impressed by the fighting spirit and mental strength of the team in the match. "Normally, we saw Bangladesh in the past lose a game from a winning situation.

I would call that improvement," he said. The country's first Test captain Naimur Rahman pointed out that the unity and commitment among the players played a key factor in both Tests. "Maybe certain players underperformed during the Test series but they were retained because their sheer presence inspired the others to perform on a higher level. They acted as motivators and that is why achieved success against West Indies."

"Now we have to work on the batting side, especially on how to stay at the crease for longer periods.
