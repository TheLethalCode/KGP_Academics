<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  A senior opposition leader on Wednesday questioned why the government's move for a 'speedy resolution' of appeals in the Bangabandhu murder case is taking so long. "It is not clear why it is taking so long. It could have been settled by now if appeals began in March by forming a bench with three justices," BNP MP and former law minister Moudud Ahmed said. "The appeals could not be settled when I was the law minister as I did not get three Appellate Division judges who could hear the appeals (against earlier convictions in the case)," he said. "But, this government could have begun in March when there were four Appellate Division judges to choose from to form a three-judge bench." "Why this didn't happen is not clear," he repeated. Moudud also wondered at law minister Shafique Ahmed's explanation for the recent appointment of four new Appellate Division judges. ""The law minister said four new justices have been appointed for two reasonsto finally conclude the Banabandhu murder trial, and to reduce case jam in the Appellate Division." "But, the law minister's explanation is baseless." Moudud said Shafique had written in a letter to the chief justice that a total of 102,095 cases were pending with the Appellate Division up to Dec 21, 2008. "But, this figure is not right," said Moudud. He said the chief justice wrote back in a letter to the minister that only 6,247 cases were pending with the Appellate Division up to Dec. 21, 2008. The number fell to just 4,516 by Apr 30, this year, he said. "This has created much confusion about the legal premise for appointment of the four new Appellate Division judges," the BNP lawmaker said. He said the four judges would have eventually been appointed to the Appellate Division on the basis of seniority, without being promoted by showing unjustified reasons. "The government can appoint justices to the Supreme Court. But, the explanation the law minister gave, especially after the judicial branch has been separated from the executive branch, is baseless." "It has smeared the image of the Supreme Court," said Moudud, a barrister by profesion. b
