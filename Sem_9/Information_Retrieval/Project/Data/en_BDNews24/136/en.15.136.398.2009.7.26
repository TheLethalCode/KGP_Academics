 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing German ambassador Frank Meyke has commended the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government, in power for an unprecedented two years from 2007-09, for its role in restoring democracy to Bangladesh. "The democratic structural reforms of the last caretaker government and the elections of December 29, 2008, has opened up the perspective of a stable democracy ... for Bangladesh," said Meyke in a Meet the Press gathering at Dhaka Reporters Unity on Sunday. He said the general election, with over 87 percent turnout, was a "great positive element" for the international image of Bangladesh. Meyke rejected allegations of any diplomatic role in the declaration of a state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. "But once it happened, we supported it," he said. "At the time, there was no better solution as there was no conducive environment for holding a free and fair election." Meyke, who represented the EU presidency at the time, said the 27 countries of the European Union believed "bloody developments" would have taken place if the election that was scheduled for Jan 21, 2007, had gone ahead. The outgoing ambassador's statement comes at a time when some in the ruling and opposition parties have been talking of bringing the leaders of the 1//11 changeover "to justice" for imposing the state of emergency and installing a two-year interim regime without constitutional basis . British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans earlier this month also refuted the allegation that the diplomatic community in Bangladesh had a hand in "calling the army out of barracks" on Jan 11, 2007. He spoke in defence of his predecessor Anwar Choudhury who is considered by some as one of the brains behind the changeover. Evans also said the state of emergency was imposed at the time as an "internal dynamic" in Bangladesh. More to follow
