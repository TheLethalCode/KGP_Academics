 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has set August 3 to rule on the appeal for further investigation into the explosion and murder cases related to the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack. Judge Md Masder Hossain of the Dhaka's First Speedy Trial Tribunal heard the appeal on Monday at a special court set up at Nazimuddn Road in the capital. The CID submitted two charge-sheets against 22 persons, eight of whom are fugitives, on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the two cases are running concurrently. The grenade attack was carried out on an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue, leaving at least 23 people killed and scores, including AL chief Sheikh Hasina, injured, during the 2001-2006 term of the BNP-led coalition government. Awami League central leader Ivy Rahman, wife of president Zillur Rahman, was also killed in the deadly attack. On the last day of the hearing, Khandaker Mahbub Hossian, lawyer for former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, a defendant, told the court, "The government has appealed for more investigation to politically harass and include a good number of politicians from the opposition." Sanaullah Mia, the other lawyer for Pintu, alleged that the government was trying different ploys to interfere with the judiciary." Chief public prosecutor Syed Rezaur Rahman appealed for more investigation on June 25 and the court heard it four times. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil. CID assistant police superintendent Fazlul Kabir pressed charges in the cases on June 11, 2008. The BNP-led government made an attempt to divert the case into a different stream by making fake accused. The CID in its charge sheet made 22 people accused in the case including former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier Maolana Tajuddin alias Taj, and banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan. Of them 13 accused including Pintu and Mufti Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. bdnew
