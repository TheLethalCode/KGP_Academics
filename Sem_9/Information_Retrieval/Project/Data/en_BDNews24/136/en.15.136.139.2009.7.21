<TEXT>
 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion is intending to step up its drive against literature that promotes or idealises Jihad, said a top RAB official. "So far no measures have been taken to stop these publications which encourage militancy," RAB additional director-general, Col Rezanur Rahman Khan, told bdnews24.com Monday. RAB regularly seizes pamphlets, books and manuals promoting Jihad in raids throughout the country, but has not actively taken steps to tackle their production by going after the publishers. "The problem is being taken up," said Khan. Khan said preliminary investigations had shown most publishers' addresses contained within the Jihadi literature proved to be false. He said RAB should monitor which publishing houses deal in Jihadi subjects, with the assistance of the police, Islamic Foundation and others official agencies. "These Jihadi books play a key role in spreading militancy," said another RAB official, not wanting to be named. "But sale of these books and magazines can be see going on unabated in Banglabazar, Baitul Mokarram and markets near Kataban Mosque," he said. The RAB official said they had found a clue linking a staff member at a publishing house, named 'Mumtaj Library' in Banglabazar, to publication of a Jihadi book. "A phone number was contained in a book titled 'Ajadi and Lorai', which was produced before reporters on July 15, following the arrest of four militants," he said. The employee, who gave his name as Abdul Momin, admitted the 'Ajadi and Lorai' title was published by the Mumtaj Library and was sold in their Banglabazar bookshop. Speaking to bdnews24.com on Monday, Momin said: "We don't keep track of who buys these books from us." "It is not our responsibility if the RAB or police seize these books on the pretext that they are 'banned'. What can we do if someone uses these books with ill intent?" said Momin. Maulana Masud Azhar, founder of militant organisation Joyesh-e-Mohammed, is credited with authoring the title. RAB officials suggested all publications in Bangladesh could be required to seek clearance from a governmental agency, although they conceded that such a drastic measure could impact on freedom of speech. b
