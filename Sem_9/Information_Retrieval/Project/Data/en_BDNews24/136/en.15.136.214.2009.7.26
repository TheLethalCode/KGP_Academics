 Dhaka, Jul 26 (bdnews24.com)Liabilities of foreign loans to poor nations like Bangladesh should be cancelled, said a citizens action group on Sunday. Loan liability per capita in Bangladesh stood at $147.32 in 2007, jumping from $6.56 in 1974, said Abdul Awal, chairman of Shushanor Jonno Procharabhijan (SUPRO), or Campaign for Good Governance. "Almost 65 percent of the foreign aid received is spent on interest payments," Awal told a press conference in the city. "Bangladesh has to repay $1.5 for each dollar of foreign aid received." "In the wake of the global economic crisis, loans of the poor nations should be cancelled in a bid to achieve MDGs (millennium development goals)," he said. South and Southeast Asia has been hit hard by the recent global downturn, said Awal. "The recession, caused by rampant free-market policies and weaknesses in financial management of richer nations, has resulted in thousands of job losses and bankruptcy of financial institutions in this region." He called for total annulment of liabilities for all foreign loans, especially from G-8 countries. "We also ask not to count the cancelled liabilities as development aid." SUPRO, in a written statement, also demanded a separate commission under the UN for loan and aid affairs "free from any influences of the IMF and the World Bank". The press conference was organised ahead of a three-day meeting of UN ESCAP, scheduled to be held from Monday in Dhaka. The UN's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), formed in 1947 with its headquarters in Bangkok, is the regional development arm of the United Nations for the Asia-Pacific region.
