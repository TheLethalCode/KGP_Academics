 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the finance ministry to submit a detailed report of defaulters on loans from the country's four state-owned commercial banks over the last seven years, the planning secretary said on Tuesday. She asked for the report to include those who had loan interest payments waived during that time, secretary Habib Ullah Majumder told a press conference after an ECNEC meeting chaired by Hasina at the NEC conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. He said the prime minister also asked the Roads and Highways Department to submit a report on whether any sort of corruption was committed in road construction works during the years of the BNP-led government and subsequent two-year caretaker government regime. Hasina did not give deadline for the reports, said Majumder. He said she also spoke of ongoing plans to save Dhaka's rivers by removing illegal structures and evicting illegal encroachers. "The prime minister said walkways will be erected along two sides of the rivers surrounding Dhaka, in an attempt to keep illegal structures and encroachers at bay." Majumder said she had directed the concerned ministry to take necessary steps. The ECNEC meeting approved five development projects costing around Tk 857 crore, he said. They include a Coast Guard Station Construction Project in Patuakhali under the home ministry, Water Supply (Second Phase) Project in Rajshahi city under the local government division, Rural Water Supply Project in the Southwestern Zone, Rural Infrastructure Development Project in greater Faridpur and Construction of New and River-eroded Upazila Parisad Complexes (Revised) Project. bd
