 KABUL, Jul 27(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's foreign aid minister said on Sunday commanders had told him British troops in Afghanistan had "never been better equipped" to fight the Taliban despite a record death toll so far this month. Britain is locked in a major military offensive in parts of volatile Helmand province in south Afghanistan as part of "Operation Panther's Claw" alongside a major US offensive launched this month. At least 20 British soldiers have been killed in July, taking the total death toll in the war to 189, 10 more than during the Iraq war and the worst battlefield casualties suffered by the British military since the 1980s Falklands War. US troops have also suffered casualty rates not seen since the worst days of the Iraq war as they push through Helmand, the first operation under President Barack Obama's new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and stabilise Afghanistan. The surge in the death toll has raised questions in Britain over whether there are enough troops for the job, whether they are properly equipped and even if they should be in Afghanistan at all. Douglas Alexander, who was visiting Afghanistan but has not been to Helmand where the majority of British combat troops are deployed, said he had met a British commander who assured him "his troops have never been better equipped". "He explained to me there were a number of new 'Ridgeback' armoured vehicles that had arrived in recent days, but that was on top of the vehicles which I myself examined in the course of my visit," Alexander told a news conference in Kabul. "I can assure you we are unstinting in our efforts to provide our troops with the equipment and resources they need to do the truly outstanding job that they have been doing." Alexander made no mention of whether he thought British troops have enough helicopters. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been dogged by accusations that a shortage of helicopters is endangering British soldiers by forcing them to travel by roads on which insurgents plant roadside bombs. The minister said Afghan President Hamid Karzai had assured him that more Afghan troops would be sent to Helmand soon to help hold areas cleared of insurgents by foreign troops. He said British troops would be able to hold onto and build upon the areas they had won so far, helping to boost security for presidential elections on Aug. 20. "We are confident and determined that the land has been secured and will allow polling to take place in areas that otherwise would not have been able to participate in the democratic elections," Alexander said. He also announced an additional 225 million pounds ($372 million) of aid for the Afghan government over the next four years, 60 million pounds of which will be an immediate contribution to help pay the salaries of teachers and doctors. "Now is the time to make a clear-headed investment in the future of Afghanistan," he
