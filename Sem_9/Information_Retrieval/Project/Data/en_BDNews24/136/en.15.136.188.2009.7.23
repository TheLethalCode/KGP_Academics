 PHUKET, Thailand, Jul 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Asia's biggest security community on Thursday to keep the pressure on North Korea to end its nuclear program and enforce UN sanctions against the reclusive state. Reining in North Korea's nuclear program, counter-terrorism cooperation and maritime security took center stage at Asia's premier annual security gathering, the ASEAN Regional Forum. Myanmar was also in the spotlight after Clinton on Wednesday said Washington was concerned about the possible transfer of nuclear technology from North Korea to the military junta. "The United States will continue to work through every avenue to persuade North Korea to eliminate its nuclear program and normalize relations with the world," Clinton said in a speech planned for delivery at the meeting. "The ASEAN Regional Forum can play an important role in achieving this outcome and for continuing to work vigorously to implement Resolution 1874. That means denying North Korean vessels access to any trans-shipment points and cooperating with the enforcement of financial sanctions against those designated entities that support North Korea's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons." The ARF meeting on the Thai resort island of Phuket has brought together foreign ministers and senior officials from across Asia, Europe and the United States. North Korea, condemned for recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests, sent low-ranking officials to Phuket. The head of the North's delegation, ambassador-at-large Pak Kun-gwang, has made little comment but told his Thai hosts this week he did not want Pyongyang to be a punchbag at the security talks. Clinton also planned to deliver a separate statement giving Pyongyang a choice between more sanctions if it refuses to end its nuclear activities and an array of benefits if it does. "Full normalization of relations, a permanent peace regime, and significant energy and economic assistance are all possible in the context of full and verifiable denuclearization," Clinton will say, according to prepared excerpts of her statement. In one indication of how sanctions have begun to bite North Korea, The Financial Times reported on Thursday that Italy has blocked the sale of two luxury yachts to North Korea believed to be destined for leader Kim Jong-il. The sale of luxury goods to North Korea is banned under Resolution 1874. China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said while U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea should be implemented, all sides should work to avoid an escalation of tensions. RESPONSE TO TERRORISM Some 10,000 Thai troops have enforced tight security around the complex but there was a minor scare when a loud blast was heard not from the meeting venue. Thai officials said it was caused by a suspicious motorbike being destroyed by water cannon. A draft communique to be issued at the end of the meeting said participants wanted ARF to come up with concrete and effective responses to terrorism, transnational crime, nuclear proliferation and maritime security. The statement, obtained by Reuters, also said the group wanted to "overcome security threats and challenges and prevent escalation of potential conflicts." It made no direct mention of North Korea or Myanmar. Many experts on North Korea have concluded from the reclusive state's belligerence that Pyongyang wants to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and will not end its atomic activities. The poor health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, believed to have suffered a stroke a year ago, and uncertainty about who might succeed him has further complicated efforts to persuade Pyongyang to curb its nuclear ambitions. The United States urged Myanmar to implement the U.N. resolution imposing an arms embargo on North Korea in a rare face-to-face meeting, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Thursday. The official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said Washington's willingness to improve relations with the military-ruled former Burma will depend partly on the outcome of a trial against pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Clinton said on Wednesday the United States was worried about possible nuclear technology transfers from North Korea to Myanmar. Talk of Myanmar-North Korea military ties was fueled after a North Korean ship, tracked by the United States in June and July on suspicion of carrying banned arms, appeared headed toward Myanmar before turning around.
