 Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)The government should establish a separate ministry or department for protecting national resources in the Bay of Bengal, which remain under threat from India and Myanmar, a citizens' group said on Saturday, blasting successive administrations for "standing by and doing nothing" to secure the integrity of Bangladesh's maritime borders. "Greater public awareness should be created over the aggression of India and Myanmar regarding maritime boundaries," social activist, author and Dhaka University professor emeritus Serajul Islam Chowdhury told a press conference given by the group, naming itself the 'National Committee for Protecting Maritime Boundaries and its Assets'. "Historically the Bay of Bengal belongs to Bangladesh, however, boundaries have been created by India and Myanmar while our governments have come and gone and done nothing," Chowdhury told the briefing at the National Press Club. "The major political parties are indifferent to the issue, while other political parties and civil societies are also failing to act," he said Noor Mohammad, convener of the committee, said the actions of India and Myanmar meant Bangladesh would not benefit from the 28 blocks in the Bay previously earmarked by the government for oil and gas exploration by international oil companies. "At most, two or three blocks will be available for Bangladesh," said Noor. "India is claiming a big part of the continental shelf. We have protested this, but it is not easy. We will have to do a lot more work," he said. "We are not organised. We need a ministry, or at least a department, to deal with issues relating to the Bay," said Noor. Anu Mohammad, professor of economics at Jahangirnagar University, also said successive governments had failed to establish Bangladeshi sovereignty in the Bay of Bengal. Anu said there had been no new initiatives to determine maritime boundaries in the Bay since 2001. "Though a technical committee was formed, no meetings have been held to date," he said. "Indian experts are assisting Myanmar in determining their maritime boundaries in addition to their own. If no measures are taken, an area three times the size of Bangladesh will be lost to India and Myanmar," he said. "Maritime boundaries have great strategic importance. This problem can be solved, but we will have to show determination and intelligence," said Anu. Unresolved disputes Bangladesh has long-standing disputes with Myanmar and India over shared sea boundaries, preventing crucial oil-gas exploration in the Bay for all three countries. Bangladesh must submit its sea border map to the United Nations Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf by July 27, 2011. Myanmar and India have already submitted their maritime boundary maps to the UN without resolving disputes with Bangladesh The two neighbouring countries are making sea border claims in such ways that entry of vessels to Bangladesh's Chittagong and Mongla ports would be blocked and exploration in the Bay hampered, say foreign ministry officials. Bangladesh has lodged a protest with the UN while still pressing on with its effort to resolve the disputes through bilateral talks with Myanmar and India. bdnew
