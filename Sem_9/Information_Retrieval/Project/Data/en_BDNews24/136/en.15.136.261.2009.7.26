 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)GMG Airlines has filed a case against two foreign pilots, who recently joined the United Airways, on charges of not seeing out their contract with GMG. The pilots, captain Cheron Will Fried Orlod from New Zealand, and first officer Rudi Kurnides from Indonesia, joined GMG in December. Orlod had a five-year contract and Kurnids for one year, the lawyer for GMG, Mohammed Asaduzzaman Monir, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. He added that they had filed an arbitration case with the Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court on Thursday. The court ordered them not to work for any other airlines until they explained their action in writing. Monir said that the pilots had joined GMG in December but walked out of their contracts in July, forcing GMG to count losses. They had been trained abroad on company expenses, Monir added. They went home and returned only to join United Airways. Sadat Rahman, vice president, marketing and public relations of GMG, said that they had flown a plane on Thursday, violating the court orders. "They flew a plane of the United Airways without securing a release order from us," Rahman added. Company secretary of United Airways, ATM Nazrul Islam, told bdnews24.com, "The pilots joined them with the work visa recommended by the Board of Investment." "How did they get the recommendations if they had not left GMG?" he questioned. "The court ruling had said that they would not be able to fly planes until submission of the written explanation. They have submitted it on Sunday and so, they should not face any barrier to flying now." Monir, the GMG lawyer, said they had asked the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh and United Airways to take steps after Thursday's court orders. CAAB chairman Sakib Iqbal Khan told bdnews24.com, "We haven't got any direct instruction on the matter about the two pilots." bd
