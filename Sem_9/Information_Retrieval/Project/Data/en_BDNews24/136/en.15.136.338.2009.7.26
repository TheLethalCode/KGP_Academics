 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, July 25 (bdnews24.com)  As Washington reporters gathered at the White House press room for a routine briefing by press secretary Robert Gibbs on Friday, to their utter surprise, the man who walked in instead, unannounced and unscheduled, was the president of the United States: Barack Obama. The political hacks were taken aback, especially after the fact that Obama had held a prime time news conference just two days before and it is very rare for the president to hold another press briefing so quickly. So what was the occasion? The president himself gave the reason for his sudden appearance. He wanted to clarify the comment he made at the fag end of his prime time news conference on Wednesday about the arrest of a highly respected black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr, at his own home in Cambridge, near Boston. A comment that had had fueled an already sparked a racial debate. Obama said he should have been more careful in choosing his words and didn't expect his comments would further inflame the controversy that had flared up since the arrest was first reported a week ago. In his prime time news conference, Obama, responding to a reporter's question, said the police had "acted stupidly" in arresting Prof Gates even after it became clear it was his own home. His remarks triggered a firestorm, especially from the conservative media and bloggers. The president insisted he had not meant to malign the arresting officer, who was white. The arrest episode stemmed from a misunderstanding when Prof Gates returned to his Cambridge home on July 16 from a trip to China and found his door stuck. As he and his driver, also black, tried to force the back door open, a woman reported seeing someone trying to break into the house and the police responded. Although the arresting officer became aware that Prof Gates was in his own home, the police said he was belligerent and arrested him for "disorderly conduct". The charge was later dropped. To defuse the volatile national debate that has erupted over the episode, Obama has invited both Gates and the man who arrested him, Sgt James Crowley, to have a beer with him at the White House. Obama, however, told reporters that he still considered the arrest "an overreaction," but added that "Professor Gates probably overreacted as well." The president's somewhat toned-down remarks appeared to have calmed the growing controversy, at least for now, but the episode has revived the most sensitive social issue that has plagued America for centuries: race relations. Many analysts now say that while America has made substantial gains in improving racial tensions, especially between white and black, the issue is far from resolved even after an African American has been elevated to the highest office in the country. Obama himself acknowledged the fact recently when he said "my election to the presidency does not mean that we've gotten over the race issue". The Gates case has become the first significant racial controversy Obama has confronted since being sworn in as the nation's first black president. The improvisational handling of it underscored the delicate challenges for a leader who has tried to govern by crossing old lines and emphasizing commonalities over differences. Obama defended his decision to weigh in. "The fact that this has become such a big issue I think is indicative of the fact that, you know, race is still a troubling aspect of our society," he said. Indeed, as several recent polls indicate, race remains a big issue in America and no one seems to know how the problem can be resolved. Whether one thinks race was a factor in this arrest may depend largely on the prism through which the conflicting accounts are viewed. For many black men, it's a prism stained by the fact that a negative, sometimes racially charged, encounter with a policeman is a far-too-common rite of passage. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last July asked: "Have you ever felt you were stopped by the police just because of your race or ethnic background?" Sixty-six percent of black men said yes. Only 9 percent of white men said the same. These views are not without merit. A series of racial-profiling studies across the country have found that blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be stopped and searched than whites. In fact, last year the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York law firm specializing in human rights, released a study of the racial-profiling practices of the New York Police Department. It found that more than 80 percent of those stopped and frisked were black or Hispanic. The report also said that when stopped, 45 percent of blacks and Hispanics were frisked, compared with 29 percent of whites, even though white suspects were 70 percent more likely than black suspects to have a weapon. But the point is Prof Gates is not an ordinary African American. He is one the most recognizable and widely respected black men in the country for his scholarly work on race relations and his appearances on television as an expert on race issues. So the question is what prompted the police to arrest such a prominent person in his own house? Many are asking whether the police would have acted differently had the occupant been a white man. The July 16 incident is not the first time Prof Gates has encountered such "misunderstandings", ostensibly over his blackness. Stanley Fish, a former English professor at the prestigious Duke University in North Carolina and a friend of Gates, wrote in Friday's New York Times that the African American scholar had encountered similar problems when he was teaching at Duke more than 20 years ago. According to Fish, one of the first things Gates did when he first arrived there was buy the grandest house in town (owned previously by a movie director) and renovate it. During the renovation workers would often take Gates for a servant and ask to be pointed to the house's owner. The drivers of delivery trucks made the same mistake. The message was unmistakable: What was a black man doing living in a place like this? At Duke itself (which in a past not distant at all did not admit African-Americans ), Gates's reception was in some ways no different, Fish wrote. Doubts were expressed in letters written by senior professors about his scholarly credentials, which were vastly superior to those of his detractors. He was already a recipient of a MacArthur fellowship, the so called "genius award." There were also wild speculations (again in print) about his salary, which in fact was quite respectable but not inordinate; when a list of the highest-paid members of the Duke faculty was published, he was nowhere on it. In 2009, Gates is once again regarded with suspicion because, as the cultural critic Michael Eric Dyson put it, he has committed the crime of being HWB, Housed While Black. Two decades on, it appears to be a different version of the same old st
