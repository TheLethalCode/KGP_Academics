 KARACHI, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Shoaib Akhtar has been left out of the Pakistan squad for a five-match one-day series in Sri Lanka after the board opted to omit the fiery paceman from the 16-member group named on Wednesday because of fitness concerns. Although Shoaib will miss the series starting later this month, the interim selection committee did recall opener Imran Nazir and paceman Rana Naved after the pair had bans lifted last month for severing ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League. Nazir and Naved last played for Pakistan in 2007. "The selectors have made six changes for the one-day series and all selections have been made after confirming the fitness of available players," a board spokesman told Reuters. The Pakistan Test team are currently involved in a three-match tour of Sri Lanka, which the home side leads 2-0 after victories in Galle and Colombo. Squad: Younus Khan (captain), Misbah-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Nasir Jamshed, Imran Nazir, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Abdul Razzaq, Rao Iftikhar, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad Aamer, Umar Akmal, Rana N
