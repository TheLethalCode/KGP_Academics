"The government with the help of all concerned will arrange a special reception for the national cricket team," said state minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker at a press meet held at the National Sports Council Tower conference room on Wednesday. Congratulating the terrific Tigers, Sarker said, "The Bangladesh national cricket team created a new piece of history with the first-ever away Test series win over West Indies and they brought a rare laurel to the nation." Bangladesh clinched the two Tests series handing a four-wicket defeat to hosts in Grenada on Monday after recording a comprehensive 95-run win in the first match in St Vincent.

The sports minister said that Bangladesh would be spending a busy time in the SAFF Championship, SA Games and ICC World Cup. "Country's respect and pride lies in these meets and I am hoping cooperation from all quarters to make it success," said Sarker.
