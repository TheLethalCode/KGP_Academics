 Dhaka, July 26 bdnews24.com) -- A four-wicket haul by Abdur Razzak helped Bangladesh to win the first one-day international against a makeshift West Indies side by 52 runs on Sunday. It was also their first ODI victory over the Caribbeans in 14 matches, with two rained out. The Tigers dismissed the home side for 194 in 43.4 overs after making 246-9 at Windsor Park in Dominica after the left-arm spinner grabbed 4-39. It marked a triumphant return for the bowler who remained suspended for his suspect action. He was named man-of-the-match. Razzak, who last played against South Africa in November last year, weaved his magic around the batsmen. Apart from Devon Smith who made 65 off 84 balls and Dave Bernard 38, there was very little resistance offered by the home side against the Bangladesh spinners. All the bowlers chipped in with a wicket. The two sides meet again in the second ODI at the same venue, which made its ODI debut on Sunday, on July 28 and third and final match is in St Kitts on July 31. Earlier, half-centuries by Mohammad Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan propelled Bangladesh to their highest one-day total against the hosts. They scored 246-9 after being put into bat, which easily surpassed the previous best of 219-5. The Bangladesh innings, however, got off to a horrible start after Tamim Iqbal was caught behind for a first-ball duck off Kemar Roach who finished with 5-44. The former Bangladesh captain Ashraful, who struggled during the Test series, began watchfully before getting to his 17th ODI fifty. He made 57 off 95 balls with five fours before being run out attempting a single. He added 74 runs for the second wicket with Junaed Siddique (47-ball 36). Shakib, who was instrumental in the two-match Test series, continued his purple patch hammering 54 off 60 deliveries. His knock, however, contained just three boundaries. The left-handed Shakib featured in a 79-run stand for the sixth with Mahmudullah Riyad, who made a 39-ball 42 with the help of two sixes and as many fours. Shakib who scored his 11th one-day half-century eventually fell with the score on 230 to Roach. Dave Bernard, Nikita Miller and Rawl Lewis grabbed one wicket each.
