 TBILISI/MOSCOW, Jul 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia vowed on Thursday to prevent its pro-Western neighbor Georgia from rearming and threatened nations who helped it, in a harsh warning timed to coincide with US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Tbilisi. Moscow issued its broadside as Biden sat down to closed-door talks with Russia's arch-foe President Mikheil Saakashvili in Tbilisi. Tensions between Russia and its former Soviet vassal are rising ahead of the first anniversary next month of their war. Georgia is pushing for U.S. monitors and weapons to help defend it against what it says is a threat from Russian troops stationed in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the two rebel regions at the center of last year's war. "We are a country under attack, under partial occupation," Saakashvili said at the start of his meeting with Biden. "We decided to join the free world, Europe, the North Atlantic alliance (NATO)." Moscow is angry because it believes Georgian aggression started the war and says the West fails to understand that Saakashvili is a dangerous leader bent on fresh conflict. "We will continue to prevent the re-arming of Saakashvili's regime and will take concrete measures against this," Russia's ITAR-TASS agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin as saying in an interview. Karasin also accused certain unnamed states of hiding military cooperation with Georgia "under the guise of humanitarian aid" -- an apparent reference to the United States, which has been sending Tbilisi humanitarian supplies. "We have a deep worry regarding the activity of the Georgian leadership over remilitarizing its country, which several states are responding to in a surprisingly calm and positive way" Karasin said. Russia would consider "limiting or stopping military- technical or military-economic development" with states supplying Georgia with arms, he added. Moscow has in the past accused Ukraine of arming Georgia. SOLIDARITY Opening Thursday's talks in Tbilisi with Biden, Saakashvili thanked President Barack Obama for telling Russia during a recent visit that Washington would not allow any big power to claim particular regions as its special areas of influence. "His (Obama's) talk about not allowing in today's world, in the 21st century, any spheres of influence, was music to our ears," Saakashvili said. Biden was given a raucous welcome on Wednesday, and insisted the United States would continue to stand by Georgia, addressing unease in Tbilisi over Washington's recent bid to "reset" relations with Moscow. "The reason I'm here ... is to show you that we stand with you," Biden said at the start of talks with Saakashvili on Thursday at the newly-built Georgian presidential palace on the banks of the Mtkvari river. "We'll have a lot of talk today about security, economy, democracy," he said. Analysts say it is unclear how far Obama is prepared to go in supporting Georgia without undermining cooperation with Moscow on a host of issues from arms control to the worsening war in Afghanistan. Georgia's NATO accession has been shelved for the foreseeable future in the wake of the war and amid unease among some European states about Saakashvili's unpredictability and chequered record on democracy. Biden's message of support was balanced by a call for Georgia to strengthen its democracy almost six years since the "Rose Revolution" swept aside the ex-Soviet old guard and brought the pro-Western Saakashvili to power. The 41-year-old president has faced down months of street protests by opponents who accuse him of monopolizing power, stifling the media and leading Georgia into a war it could not possibly win. Biden is due to meet opposition leaders. Russia crushed a Georgian assault on the rebel pro-Russian region of South Ossetia in August last year, sending tanks into Georgia proper and then recognizing South Ossetia and the Black Sea territory of Abkhazia as independent states. Russia has thousands of troops in both regions, and holds the heights of South Ossetia, with a border located only 50 km (30 miles) from Tbilisi at its closest point. Central Tbilisi was sealed off on Thursday for Biden's visit. On Wednesday, hundreds of people waved Georgian and U.S. flags as Biden's motorcade sped past. They held banners saying "No to occupation!" and "We count on you!." Biden arrived from Kiev, where he told Ukraine it was free to choose which alliances it should join, but urged leaders of the 2004 "Orange Revolution" to end their infighting and "posturing" to seal independence and economic development.
