 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, July 25 (bdnews24.com)The pass rate for Higher Secondary Certificate exams may have witnessed a drop this year due to tough questions in English and physics papers, the chairmen of two general education boards said Saturday. Prof Mohammad Sanaullah, chairman of the newly formed Dinajpur Board, which was the poorest performing board this year, pointed the finger at difficult questions in the two compulsory English papers. Some 59,393 students sat the HSC exams for the first time under the Dinajpur Board, with a pass rate of just 55.90 percent. Comilla Board chairman, Prof Atiqur Rahman, also told bdnews24.com the major reason behind poor results under his board was harder questions in both English and physics. The Comilla Board saw more than a huge 10 point drop in its pass rate this year. A total of 41,199 students sat the HSC exams under the board, with a 66.77 percent pass rate, falling from 77.33 percent last year. The results of the HSC and equivalent exams were published Saturday, showing an overall drop in the combined pass rate under all 10 education boardseight general boards, a madrasah and a technical board. The total number of GPA-5 achievers under all 10 boards also fell this year for the first time. Some 607,872 students, representing 7,237 educational institutions, sat HSC and equivalent exams under the 10 education boards in April this year. They spent an anxious morning Saturday waiting for individual results officially released at 1pm. The HSC exams were held under eight general education boardsDhaka, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Dinajpur, Sylhet, Barisal, Jessore and Comilla. Equivalent level Alim exams were held under the Madrasa Education Board and business management/vocational exams under the Technical Education Board. The combined pass rate for HSC and equivalents, including Alim and vocational exams, stood at 72.78 percent this year, down from 76.19 percent last year. The result marked a fall of 3.41 points or 4.47 percent. The HSC pass rate alone, under the eight general boards, also fell to 70.43 percent, down 4.42 points from 74.85 percent last year. The pass rate for the Alim exams rose, however, to 84.14 percent from 82.43 percent last year. It marked the highest pass rate among all 10 boards and defied the overall downward trend. The Jessore Board also bucked the trend, with its highest pass rate in 10 years. The 78.77 percent pass rate was also the highest among the eight general education boards. This year also saw the total number of GPA-5s under all 10 boards register a fall for the first time since introduction of the US-style grading system in 2003. The total number of students achieving perfect Grade Point Averages fell by 1,909 from 22,045 last year. The figure had doubled in one leap last from around 11,000 GPA-5s in 2007. Professor Atiqur was convinced the downturns this year lay in tougher questions for certain subjects. His Comilla board saw 1,987 students fail in physics along among the total 2,498 who sat the paper. "Other than physics, poor performance in the compulsory English papers is another reason for the drop in the overall HSC pass rate this year." Prof Sanaullah said around 21,000 students failed English out of 59,393 who sat HSC exams under the newly-formed Dinajpur Board's first run. "The students failed as the questions of both English papers were very hard, which affected the total pass rate," he said. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid officially released the results at a press conference Saturday afternoon after handing them to the chairmen of the education boards and the prime minister earlier in the day. Nahid did not agree that results were bad, though the pass rate was down this year. "These students sat for their SSC and equivalent exams in 2007, where the pass rate was just 58.36 percent. Among them 72.78 percent passed the HSC and equivalents this year, which is a positive outcome," he said. bd
