<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)H M Ershad has let known his desire to be at the helm of the Jatiya Party until his death and sought the approval of the national council of the ruling Grand Alliance partner. Chairman Ershad declared the three-day council open at 10:45am on Friday at the Institution of Engineers in the capital. He will also chair the day's council session. "To foil the execution of 'minus two' and subsequently 'minus three' formulas in the post-1/11 era, I had stood aside from JP chairman's position and as a strategic move, appointed an acting party chief," offered Ershad. "Now we don't need an acting chairman. There won't be any more acting chairmen in Jatiya Party from today," the former president declared. Anisul Islam Mahmud had shepherded the party through the two-year emergency rule to the general election. "Please wish me well so that I can shoulder the party chairmanship until my last moments," Ershad said to the councillors. "This special council is very important to the party leaders and workers," JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Howladar told bdnews24.com on Thursday night. As the Election Commission made it mandatory for all political parties to submit their finalised constitutions within July 25, JP is holding this special council, the secretary general said. He said 11,672 councillors and 23,000 delegates from across the country were scheduled to join the council and all preparations have been completed. The secretary general said the amended party constitution will be approved and new leaders will be elected through the council. The councillors will elect office bearers such as the party chairman, secretary general and all other offices, Howladar said. The Jatiya party believes in democratic practices, he reiterated. Since inception of the party in 1986, JP has held six councils, the last in 2005. bdne
