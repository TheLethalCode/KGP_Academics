 LUCKNOW, Sun Jul 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than a quarter of the districts in Uttar Pradesh, India's top sugarcane-producing state, are in the grip of a drought, threatening to cut output in the world's top consumer and leading importer of sugar. With the cane crop set to decline for a second successive year, the prospect of large imports by India hoisted New York raw sugar futures to a three-year high on Friday. In Uttar Pradesh, which normally accounts for about 55 percent of India's sugarcane production, 20 of the 71 districts were hit by drought, Chief Secretary Atul Kumar Gupta, the state's top bureaucrat, told reporters on Saturday. The weather office expects rains in the state after 24 hours. "Rain at a few places over Uttar Pradesh during the next 24 hours and at many places thereafter," the India Meteorological Office said in its forecast late on Saturday. India's vital June-September monsoon rains were far short of normal last month and revived in most parts of the country in July except in key grain-producing states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. These districts have received barely 40 percent of the normal rainfall so far during the monsoon, he said. Gupta said the state had drawn up a contingency plan and had asked the federal government to provide additional seeds to help farmers plant alternative crops such as lentils. On Thursday, another official said Uttar Pradesh's cane output was likely to drop about 11 percent in the new season that begins in October. Local officials say the crop was barely surviving in the state and was likely to give a lower yield of cane, which in turn would have a lower sugar content. India has contracted imports of about 2.5 million tonnes of raw sugar this year and traders expect the country to buy another 3 million tonnes in 2009/10. Narendra Murkumbi, the chief executive of Shree Renuka Sugars, India's top refiner and importer, told Reuters on Friday that he expected the country to import 2.8-3.0 million tonnes next
