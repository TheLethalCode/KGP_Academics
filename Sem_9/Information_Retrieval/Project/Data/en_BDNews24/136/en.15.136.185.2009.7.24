 COLOMBO, July 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Kumar Sangakkara scored a defiant unbeaten century to give Sri Lanka an outside chance of completing a world record run chase in the third Test against Pakistan on Friday as the hosts reached tea on 338 for four.

Captain Sangakkara led from the front with a determined 111 from 241 balls, including seven boundaries, and the superb century was his first as skipper and the 19th of his career. The 31-year-old left-hander, who was dropped by Pakistan on 40 the previous evening, shared a 122-run fourth-wicket stand with Samaraweera, Sri Lanka's highest partnership in the series. At the tea interval, all-rounder Angelo Mathews was unbeaten on 33, having helped Sangakkara add 61 for the fifth wicket.
