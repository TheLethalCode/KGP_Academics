 LONDON, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Chelsea captain John Terry should not be vilified for considering a switch to Premier League rivals Manchester City, his team mate Frank Lampard said. Speculation about Terry's future at the club he has spent his whole career at has mounted after big-spending City's offer for the 28-year-old England skipper was turned down this month.
