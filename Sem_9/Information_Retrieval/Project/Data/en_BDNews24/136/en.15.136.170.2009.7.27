 Dhaka, Jul 27 (bdnews24.com)Election Commission lawyer Kamal Hossain met with the commissioners on Monday, sparking speculations that the fate of BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's parliamentary seat was on the agenda. In June, the EC wrote to speaker Abdul Hamid recommending cancellation of Chowdhury's Chittagong-2 parliamentary seat for providing false information in his nomination papers prior to the December national polls. Later that month, however, Hamid told reporters that any decision regarding Chowdhury's House membership fell within the EC's purview. Finally, on July 19, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said the they would have to consider the legal implications of the matter before making a final decision. The lawyer held an hour-long meeting with Huda, commissioners Muhammad Suhul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and EC secretary Humiyun Kabir at the commission secretariat in the morning. "We discussed issues relating to various electoral laws, among other things," Suhul told reporters after the meeting. Hossain declined to talk to reporters as he left the secretariat. bdn
