<TEXT>
 AMSTERDAM, July 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A shed in which Anne Frank was forced to work before she was sent to a German concentration camp has been destroyed in a fire, Dutch police said on Wednesday. Police are treating Sunday's fire as arson, but said it was too early to speculate on whether anti-Semitism was the motive. Anne Frank became famous posthumously for the diaries she kept while hiding from the Nazis with her Jewish family in Amsterdam during World War Two before they were betrayed and arrested in 1944. Anne and her family were forced to work in a Dutch camp, Westerbork, dismantling batteries in the shed for recycling. Anne died in a German camp in 1945. At the time of the fire, the shed was located in the village of Veendam and was due to be moved back, later this year, to its original position in the work camp, now a memorial. Police are investigating an online message calling for the shed to be set on fire, which someone posted in reaction to a news story that it was to be moved back to the camp. First published in 1947 and now translated into more than 70 languages, Anne Frank's diary remains one of the world's best-selling books
