The law says Sheikh Mujib's two daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana and their children will be entitled to special lifelong security, which will entail affording them protected houses with SSF guards. The law defines "the family of the Father of the Nation" as his two daughters and their children, the press secretary said. It will remain effective through an executive order until passage in parliament. The cabinet has sent the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 back to the law ministry for further review. In addition, the meeting in principle approved Administrative Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2009. bdne
