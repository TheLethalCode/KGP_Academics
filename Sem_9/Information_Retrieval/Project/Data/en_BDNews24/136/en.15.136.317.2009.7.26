 Dhaka, July 26 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Sunday rejected bail for the three RAB members accused of mugging a man by threatening him with killing in 'crossfire'. Metropolitan magistrate Dilara Alo Chandana turned down the appeal submitted by their lawyer Mokhlesur Rahman. Rahman told the court that the case had been filed to harass Shoeb Ahmed, an assistant director and assistant superintendent of police, who is known to be an honest officer. An appeal to remand him would have been filed if he (Shoeb) was really involved with the mugging. "The investigation officer did not mention why the charges were filed late. Moreover, no seizure list was submitted to the court along with the complaint," Rahman added. Shoeb, an assistant director of RAB-3, and army soldiers Shahidul Islam and Shagar Chandra, have been suspended and they are facing departmental enquiries. Awlad Hossain Mollah, the lawyer for complainant, protested the bail appeal. Tajul Islam Hiran was present in the court but the defendants were not in the dock. Hiran, marketing manager of Fair Advertising at RK Mission Road, filed the case with Motijheel Police on Thursday and lodged a complaint with the RAB headquarters, too. The case details say Tajul was traveling to Rampura by a Rahbar Paribahan bus on Wednesday night when the bus was stopped at Kamlapur by people who identified themselves as RAB members. The RAB personnel took Hiran in their jeep to Doyel Chattar, threatened to kill him without trial, snatched Tk 10.86 lakh from his possession, dropped him on the roadside and drove away. RAB-3 deputy director Major Khairul Amin had told bdnews24.com that three men were handed to the police after their involvement in the reported crime was primarily established. A metropolitan magistrate's court sent them to jail pending trial on Friday. bdnew
