 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Former Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam, in speeches at two educational institutions Monday during a visit to Dhaka, said knowledge based societies would form the world of tomorrow and education must be "without borders". "In the knowledge economy, the objective of a society changes from fulfilling the basic needs of all-round development to empowerment," Kalam told an audience of students and faculty members at Dhaka University. "The workers, instead of being skilled or semi-skilled, will be knowledgeable, self-empowered and flexibly skilled," said Kalam, who served as India's eleventh president from 2002 to 2007. The former president, who was a driving force behind India's plans to become a developed and knowledge-based super power by 2020, highlighted the importance of moulding an education system capable of producing a work force with "merit and quality". "Universities are a power house of knowledge, and competitiveness is powered by research. Universities should have as their motto 'teaching-research-teaching'," he said. He said in future 'knowledge based societies' the impact on environment and ecology would be strikingly less compared to present industrial economies. "...the economy will mostly be driven by knowledge and knowledge driven institutions and industries. The emphasis in knowledge society will be on sustainable development," said Kalam. He called on faculty members at all universities in Bangladesh to mould students into creative-minded citizens, who would become the inventors of tomorrow. Energy security Responding to a question from the audience following the lecture, Kalam, known for his views on energy security, said, "We have to develop renewable energy sources to create energy security." "Present reserves of oil and gas will run out in the next 60 to 80 years." Earlier in the day, the former Indian president addressed a convocation ceremony of the privately-run University of Information Technology and Science, where he recited a poem by Bengali rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam in his native Tamil language. He also said, "Education in the 21st century should be without borders." Kalam, who played a pivotal role in the development of India's nuclear programme, also told the convocation a major challenge for developing countries was to move towards solar and renewable energy sources by reducing their dependency on fossil fuel
