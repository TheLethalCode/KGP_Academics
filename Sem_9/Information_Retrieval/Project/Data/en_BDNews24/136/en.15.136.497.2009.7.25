 Dhaka, July 24 (bdnews24.com)--The suspense over the post of general secretary of Awami League kept all on the edge of their seats as there was little doubt about Sheikh Hasina retaining the presidency. Finally, only one name was proposed, seconded and endorsed. The man in whose blood politics runs deep--Syed Ashraful Islam, the son of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's close colleague Syed Nazrul Islam. Syed Nazrul Islam was acting president of Bangladesh in the absence of Sheikh Mujib in the wartime Mujibnagar government. He was one of the four national leaders to have been killed inside jail on Nov. 3, 1975 by renegade army officers. Ashraf was unanimously selected acting general secretary at the party's central working committee meeting on July 22, a day after Abdul Jalil resigned his general secretary post for 'being ignored'. Ashraf teamed up with Zillur Rahman, a former general secretary and now the president of the country, and the two shepherded Awami League at a time when Hasina and general secretary Abdul Jalil were detained in prison and when some senior party leaders were trying to usurp party power exiling Hasina from politics. Born in Mymensingh in 1971, he has been into politics since his student days and lasted the distance. He was the general secretary of Bangladesh Chhatra League in greater Mymensingh and worked in many capacity for the AL's student wing. He went to London after the assassination of his father and reorganised the party in Britain. Ashraf returned home in 1996 and was elected MP in his home Kishoreganj Sadar constituency. He went on to become the civil aviation and tourism minister in the 1996-2001 Hasina administration. He was also elected MP in 2001 when the party had suffered debacle. He is now the local government, rural development and cooperative minister after his party took office through Ninth parliamentary elections with a hiatus of seven years. He has served Bangladesh's biggest and oldest political party as joint general secretary, acting general secretary and spokesman. Ashraf is married with one daughter. b
