 MONTE CARLO, Apr 16 (bdews24.com/Reuters) - Juan Carlos Ferrero had high hopes of advancing into the semi-finals of the Monte Carlo Masters but instead smacked into an impenetrable brick wall named Rafael Nadal on Friday. Nadal's shock fourth round defeat at last year's French Open was long forgotten as the claycourt master, four-times a winner at Roland Garros, powered past his fellow Spaniard 6-4, 6-2. In the other part of the draw, top seed Novak Djokovic scored an impressive 6-2, 6-3 win over Argentine David Nalbandian. Ferrero, who had won 17 of his 18 matches on the slow surface this season, tried to attack Nadal's backhand. Nadal in turn reacted by stifling Ferrero. "This result against probably one of the tougher opponents right now on clay is a very good one," said Nadal. "And I served much better today. My serve was much better than the rest of the three days. That's very important, too." Ferrero said: "I think on clay, he is at the same high level. Of course, he has some bad matches on clay. "But still he puts a thousand balls in court and it's difficult to get a winner. So his bad days are good." The second seed, looking for a record sixth win in Monte Carlo but a first ATP title in 11 months, will next face compatriot David Ferrer, a 7-5, 7-6 winner over German Philipp Kohlschreiber. Nadal's match had to be halted midway through the first set after gusting winds and rain caused havoc on court. The world number three wiped off dust in his eyes in the third game while VIPs on the terrace had the sunshades pulled back into place after sudden gusts of winds sent white napkins flying. But Ferrero refused to get distracted by the airborne debris and grabbed a 3-2 lead in the tense encounter when the players were ordered back into the locker room. GRUMPY LOOK While some fans took cover from the elements by draping Spanish flags around their shoulders, Nadal wore a grumpy look as he trudged out of centre court for around 30 minutes. On resumption, Nadal stepped up a gear to break for 5-4 with a stunning forehand, following up on serve to clinch the opening set with a service winner. The former world number one kept up pressure, breaking in the first game of the second set as Ferrero gradually ran out of steam -- and hope. A crosscourt forehand winner gave Nadal another break for 4-1, which delighted his father Sebastian who kept a close eye on the match from under his panama hat. Ferrero found unlikely angles to save a couple match points but bowed to the inevitable on the third, returning a serve into the net. Nadal took some time to deal with all autograph requests from young fans, high-fiving them with a broad smile on his face as the left the court. In the later game, Nalbandian, who showed glimpses of his claycourt abilities in the previous round, conceded the first 11 points of the match as Djokovic raced to a 3-0 lead. The ex-Australian Open champion had too much confidence and although Nalbandian threatened a comeback in the second set, Djokovic ended the contest with an exquisite drop shot. Next in line for Djokovic is either Albert Montanes or fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco and then a possible re-run of last year's final against N
