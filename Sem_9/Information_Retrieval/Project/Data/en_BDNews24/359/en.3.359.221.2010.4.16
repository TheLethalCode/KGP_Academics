 MANCHSTER, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For the first time in Alex Ferguson's long reign at Manchester United, Saturday's derby clash means more than just pride and local bragging rights for Manchester City. City lead the race for the fourth and final Champions League place and that adds fuel to the fire. "It puts a definite emphasis on the derby game," Ferguson told a media conference on Friday. "In my years at Manchester United this is the first time we have played City when they have had a chance to achieve something.

United trail leaders Chelsea by four points with four games left and are desperate for a win. Fourth-placed City are just one clear of Tottenham with five matches to play and can afford no slip-ups, least of all at home.

With Wayne Rooney facing a late fitness test for United, the central on-field figure at Eastlands appears likely to be Carlos Tevez, the Argentine who has scored 28 goals for City since moving from Old Trafford last summer. Mancini has described Tevez as the best player in the world at present, alongside Rooney and Barcelona's Lionel Messi yet, despite the striker's form, Ferguson has no regrets about allowing him to leave his club. "No regrets whatsoever," he said. "We tried to buy him, we didn't match the money they wanted, the boy moved on. There is no bitterness from me, players leave here from time to time, some do well, some don't. We just have to move
