 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)The education minister on Friday left a discussion hurriedly when he found out the identity of the organisers. Nurul Islam Nahid, the education minister, was scheduled to join an event at the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh (IEB) auditorium on Friday afternoon. But when he found out that it was organised by the Daily Inquilab, perceived to be in favour of Islamist politics, in collaboration with FM Method, an English teaching centre, Nahid made a quick exit. Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique also came to the programme but left after five minutes. The minister left the place just after the DU VC. While leaving, Nahid told the organisers, who requested him not to leave, that he had thought the event was organised by a newspaper. "But now I find that I have been used for publicity of a coaching centre." The chief executive of the coaching centre, Firoz Mukul, was delivering his speech on the different aspects of their organisation. Deputy general manager of FM Method Abul Bashar declined to make any statements in this matter to bdnews24.com. Parliament members Biren Sikder, Ranjit Roy and Md Shah Alam, and vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University Sharif Enamul Kabir also attended the event. bdn
