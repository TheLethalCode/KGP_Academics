 MANILA, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nine policemen and two members of a militia linked to the massacre of 57 people in the southern Philippines pleaded not guilty to murder on Wednesday in a case that has raised fears of more bloodshed in elections next month. Four other police officers were not arraigned pending motions to drop the charges, but a judge at the Manila court ordered them to enter pleas next week over the November massacre, which is considered the Philippines' worst case of electoral violence.

The killings raised fears next month's elections would be bloody, particularly the contest for local positions. The hearing was held at a detention facility inside a police base in the capital's southern district, where six members of the Ampatuan clan, including the principal suspect, are being held. Lawyer Roque said his clients also petitioned the court to replace all the public prosecutors handling the case.
