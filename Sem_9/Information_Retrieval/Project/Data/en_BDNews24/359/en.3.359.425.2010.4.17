 Shamim Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com) Polythene bags, banned eight years ago, are again being sold in large numbers in the markets across Dhaka. Most businessmen in the capital's New Market are selling their products in plastic bags, though the production of polythene with a thickness of less than 100 microns was banned on 1 Jan, 2002, except in relation to 14 sectors including those involving certain, foods, medicine, cement and fertiliser. Polythene bags were also being openly sold in Begum Bazar, Chawk Bazar, and Chawk Mogaltuli Bazar markets. The businessmen justified using them by saying that the alternatives - jute or net bags -were costly and there was limited supply. Abdur Rahim, a fish-seller in the capital's Palashi Bazar who uses polythene bags, said each jute bag costs Tk 8 and begins to decompose after some days, while the net bags found in the markets are not suitable for carrying products like fish or meat. Polythene traders in Begumganj area said the wholesale prices of polythene bags, are Tk 45-Tk 90 per thousand, depending on their sizes. Consumers said they were using polythene bags as there are some products that could not be carried without it. Sukumar Bishwas, director-in-charge of the Dhaka Division of the Department of Environment, told bdnews24.com that there are many factories illegally producing polythene in the Mirpur, Lalbagh, and Debidasghat areas in Dhaka. He said that mobile courts, almost every week, go to the areas where the illegal factories are located, and that in the previous year, 31 cases have so far been filed against such factories. Several businessmen have been fined. However, one owner, on condition of anonymity, said that every week he has to bribe higher authorities with a lot money to keep his production operational. "Polythene bags are smuggled from India. What is the problem then if we produce them in our country?" he asked. The raw materials to make plastic bags are also easily on hand in old Dhaka, the factory owner said. Businessmen said, it was very easy to 'manage' the customs officers and others to bring in these raw materials. This is why polythene bags are so easily available in Dhaka, they said. Haji Asmat Ali, a trader of Islambag area, told bdnews24.com that raw materials are also produced by melting old polythene bags. The maximum punishment for manufacturing or being otherwise involved in the distribution of plastic bags is a fine of Tk 5,000. A sentence of six months' imprisonment can be imposed if the fine is not paid, Bishwas said. Abu Naser Khan, chairman of Paribesh Bachao Andolan (Save the Environment Movement) told bdnews24.com that polythene bags are seriously polluting our environment. Biodiversity is facing grave danger. Polythene bags are also responsible for disrupting the water drainage system in Dhaka, Naser said. He said police and the department of environment should take stern actions as they are well aware of the illegal polythene factories. bdn
