 NEW DELHI, Apr 21(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is fighting to reassure foreign participants that it will provide foolproof security for the Commonwealth Games and the Cricket World Cup, despite a recent bombing and the Mumbai attacks of 2008. Threats to sporting events were underscored last week when bombs went off outside a packed cricket stadium in south India, stirring fears India may not be able to secure elaborate, multi-city events involving tens of thousands of players and spectators. But Indian police have sought to calm the jitters, citing their security apparatus which includes turning stadia into virtual fortresses, food tasters for athletes and aerial vigils. Delhi hosted a successful hockey World Cup this year. "I cannot pre-empt threats, threats are there, but we are wide awake," Y.S. Dadwal, chief of Delhi Police, told Reuters. "We will not allow anything to happen, security is top priority ... It will be a foolproof system in place." The October Commonwealth Games in New Delhi involving 54 nations will be by far the largest global sporting event ever in the country. India is keen to put together a world-class show to go with its image of a fast-modernising, emerging economic giant. But the run-up to the Games has been mired in controversies and missed construction deadlines, sparking a sense of unprofessionalism that is probably now also colouring views about the organisers' ability to provide foolproof security. For instance, a full-fledged setup dedicated to the security of the Games should have been in place by now. "One does not get the impression that this is so," said B. Raman, former chief of India's spy agency. ILL-PREPARED Indian media have reported on what they said were an ill-prepared police, unsecured games sites and delay in buying crucial security equipment. "Pressed for manpower, the Delhi police have been unable to maintain a watch on workers and trucks carrying material into construction venues," the Hindu newspaper said in a report. "Integrated-circuit timers, which have been deployed with increasing frequency by jihadist groups, can be programmed to detonate up to a year after they are planted -- demonstrating the need for better security at construction sites." There are other problems as well. With police, private guards and organisers all involved in providing protection, there is no single-point authority for security at sports venues. In comparison, China's spectacular hosting of the Olympics last year involved designing and building each stadium in consultation with security and emergency experts. It put in place a central security control room four years before the Games. Indian police and experts say the Games face a threat because hitting high-profile events generate publicity for militants. "They make attractive soft targets because of the large crowds, participation of foreign sports personalities and foreign media coverage of the events," Raman said. The Commonwealth Games will act as a pointer for next year's cricket World Cup. While the Games may be a little easier to control because they are in one city, the World Cup spread over eight cities in India will pose a greater challenge in smaller cities where security can be crippled by an under-trained police force. One players' body has slammed India for poor security at the Bangalore stadium where last week's blast wounded 14 people. The chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations said this week the Bangalore blasts reflected poorly on India's capacity to co-host the World Cup, and that they were disappointed with arrangements. A top interior ministry official said in February militants may target other parts of the country while the Commonwealth Games were on and that the real danger could be from a lone attacker rather than a coordinated attack like the one in Mumbai that killed 166 peo
