 Jahangirnagar University, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  At least 25 students were injured in a clash between activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League at Jahangirnagar University on Tuesday night. One student, Sumon, received bullet wounds, and was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He was later shifted to the Orthopaedic Hospital. Witnesses said the clash was between students belonging to AFM Kamal Uddin Hall and Shahid Salam-Barkat Hall. It started with an argument at around 11pm over a trivial matter between some students of the halls, which turned more serious. On hearing about a brawl between the students, a group of Kamaluddin Hall BCL activists went to Salam-Barkat Hall with clubs and attacked some of the students, vandalising the hall's reception room. Then BCL students from Salam-Barkat Hall came to protect their own hall, resulting in a serious clash between the two BCL factions taking place Two rounds of firing were heard. University proctor Arzu Miah said on Wednesday that they would soon start investigating the incident. Additional policemen have been deployed on the campus to avoid any further untoward events, he said. The central Chhatra League committee dissolved the university's BCL committee in January last year following several factional clashes on the campus. bd
