 Khulna, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia alleged that the ruling Awami League sues people whenever they talk about corruption. Referring to a few instances, she alleged during her address at Shibbari intersection in Khulna, that the ruling government was persecuting critical voices. Khulna is the second in line of six rallies that BNP has planned in divisions to infuse dynamism into the party's ranks. The series of six kicked off with a large rally at Laldighi Maidan of Chittagong on Mar 29. The former prime minister claimed that AL was appointing partisan people in the courts. "The government is running the courts in a similar fashion as that of Moeen Uddin and Fakhruddin. The administration doesn't let the higher court give proper verdicts." She said the attorney general threatens the judges, "So they can't give appropriate decision." But, the opposition leader did not give any example regarding such threats. She claimed there had been three attempts on former energy advisor Mahmudur Rahman's life. Khaleda said that he used to speak against AL at the roundtables, newspapers and television discussions. Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud was another subject of government ire, she claimed. A false case had been field against New Age editor Nurul Kabir as he spoke against the government in a television talk show, she said. Khaleda said that her party's chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque has had a number of cases filed against him because he spoke of the government's corruption. bdnew
