 NEW DELHI, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Saturday it was further tightening security before the October Commonwealth Games after the United States issued a warning to its citizens about possible militant attacks on hotels and markets in India. New Delhi remains jittery about the threat of militant attacks. A blast in Pune killed 17 people in February, the first major militant strike since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
