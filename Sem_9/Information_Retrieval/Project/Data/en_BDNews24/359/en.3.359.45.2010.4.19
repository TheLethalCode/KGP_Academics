<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday granted former BNP state minister Ehsanul Haque Milon a three-month "interim" bail in a case relating to the non-submission of electoral expenses. The bench of justices Siddiqur Rahman Miah and Krishna Devnath also asked the government to explain why Milon should not be given permanent bail. This is the second case for which Milon has obtained bail, though on Mar 14, a Chandpur court sent the BNP leader to jail in connection with another case in which it was alleged that he vandalised a car. Mesbah Uddin, returning officer of Chandpur district, filed the case against Milon on July 28, 2009 with Chandpur Model Police Station. It is alleged that Milon, a former BNP state minister for education, submitted the statement of his electoral costs on Feb 2 instead of the submission deadline on Jan 31. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan, who argued for Milon, said in the hearing that his client had submitted the statement on Feb 2, since Jan 31 and Feb 1 were holidays, he said. bd
