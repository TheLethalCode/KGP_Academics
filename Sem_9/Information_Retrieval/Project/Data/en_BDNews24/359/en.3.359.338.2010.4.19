 MANILA, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine state prosecutors asked the government on Monday to reconsider a decision to drop murder charges against two members of a powerful clan linked to the massacre of 57 people last November. Acting Justice Secretary Alberto Agra's move last week to clear Zaldy Ampatuan and his uncle Akmad Ampatuan of any role in the massacre came three weeks before presidential elections and raised concerns of interference, as the family is allied to the government.

The murdered people were on their way to witness filing of nomination papers of a candidate preparing to stand against Ampatuan Jr in the May 10 elections. Richard Fadullon, one of the state prosecutors handling the case, learnt of Agra's decision from newspapers and said the lawyers were shocked as they were not consulted or informed.
