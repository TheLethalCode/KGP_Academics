 LONDON, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain said on Monday European funds should be made available to compensate airlines and other travel firms who have lost millions of dollars in revenue from the closure of airspace because of a volcanic ash cloud. Prime Minister Gordon Brown also said Britain would deploy three Royal Naval ships including an aircraft carrier to bring home citizens stranded abroad by the closure of much of European airspace because of the plume of ash from an Icelandic volcano. "I believe that this is one of the most serious transport disruptions that we have faced," Brown told reporters. "It's got financial consequences as well as human consequences and we will do everything in our power to make sure all the arrangements are in place to help people where possible to get back home." Brown, facing an election on May 6, said he had held talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso about helping out airlines and travel companies who have suffered from the airspace paralysis. Analysts say the 5-day disruption had cost Britain's airlines well over 100 million pounds so far. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the economic impact to be greater than the 2001 September 11 attacks with revenue losses reaching $250 million (164 million pounds) a day. "I am very clear that this is a shared European problem and he (Barroso) is very clear that there should be a shared European approach and I hope that we can see the European solidarity fund or other funds used to help not just airlines but people who have been stranded," Brown said. "It's the biggest challenge to our aviation transport system for many, many years. We're conscious that we will have to look at the financial position not just of airlines but of associated companies." Brown also said the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal and two other vessels would be deployed to help, including one which would be sent to Spain to bring home soldiers returning from Afghanistan. The British travel agents' association ABTA has estimated that about 150,000 Britons in total have stranded abroad. Extra ferries and train services through the Channel Tunnel were also running to help bring back holidaymakers and those on business trips. Britain is also in discussion with Spain about creating a "hub" in Madrid to bring Britons home from Europe and beyond. "We have large numbers of travellers who are caught in Asia and America and the main route home that is available at the moment is through the airports that are open in Europe and that is in Spain. Brown said he had held talks with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero "He has offered in principle the use of Spanish airports as a hub for bringing people back to Britain." "We are very conscious that speed is of the essence here. We hope to have reached agreement with the Spanish in the next few hours about what can be do
