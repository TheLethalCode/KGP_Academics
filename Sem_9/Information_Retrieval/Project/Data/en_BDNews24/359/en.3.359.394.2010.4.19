<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP has given a lukewarm response to the Election Commission's proposal to provide security for the candidates running in the Bhola by-election. Election standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said on Monday that the commission needs to ensure security of the voters as well. "They are panicked not knowing whether they will be able to go to polling centres," he said. He made the comment one day after the EC decided to employ a special security force comprising five police personnel led by a magistrate to assist with each of the candidate's personal security. "We have heard of the decision. But we won't make any comment until it has actually been implemented," Mosharraf told a briefing. Awami League candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon and BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed will have the security until the voting day on Apr 24. He again called for army deployment. The BNP leader alleged that the local administration was working for the government. He mentioned that five of the BNP candidate's 10-vehicle convoy carrying the central leaders was obstructed on Sunday - but the 14-vehicle convoy of the ruling candidate faced no obstruction. "From these incidents it is very clear that the local administration is working for a particular party." Mosharraf also claimed that AL candidate Shaon was a criminal. "He was a marked criminal for firing shots in a BNP procession in Dhaka in 1998. But the Awami League has now made him a candidate," he claimed. He also alleged that "criminals" had been taken to the constituency from Dhaka to try and occupy the polling centres.
