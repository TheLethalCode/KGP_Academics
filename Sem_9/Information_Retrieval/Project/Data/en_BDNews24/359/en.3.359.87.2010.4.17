<TEXT>
 BISHKEK, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's interim rulers moved to consolidate power in the strategic Central Asian nation on Saturday, issuing arrest warrants against supporters of the country's deposed president. The ousted leader, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, has resigned and fled to neighbouring Kazakhstan, easing tensions that threatened to boil over into civil war in the volatile Central Asian state. Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous Muslim country of 5.3 million, hosts a crucial U.S. air base and the turmoil disrupted U.S. military flights to operations in nearby Afghanistan for days. The new government, which has warm relations with Russia while consisting of many pro-Western liberals, says it would maintain balance its ties with regional powers and vowed to bring Bakiyev and his allies to justice. Azimbek Beknazarov, an interim vice premier in charge of security, said arrest warrants had been issued for a dozen Bakiyev allies and family members including brother Zhanybek, the former head of the presidential guards. "He (Zhanybek) has not surrendered... there will not be any use of force," said Beknazarov, who indicated the new leaders knew where Zhanybek was. "We will use only diplomacy." A Reuters reporter at Bakiyev's home village of Teyyit, where Zhanybek Bakiyev is believed to be, saw military helicopters hovering above the area. Additional checkpoints and security had sprung up around the village. Beknazarov said 200 criminal cases had been opened to investigate crimes committed under Bakiyev. The new government accuses Bakiyev of corruption and nepotism, as well as killings of journalists and politicians. Bakiyev, speaking on Kazakh television from the Kazakh city of Taraz, was defiant. "As far as who is guilty and why, history will be the judge and it will not take long," he said. Bakiyev has not said where he could fly on from Kazakhstan. Interim officials said they were not tracking his movements and Kazakh officials said they could not comment on Bakiyev's plans. Bakiyev's brother stayed behind when the deposed leader took a military jet to Kazakhstan on Thursday. Both brothers have been accused of ordering troops to fire against protesters on April 7. At least 84 people died when Bakiyev's forces shot on civilians protesting outside the presidential offices. After Bakiyev fled the capital to the south, the ethnically divided and most flammable part of Central Asia, where he tried to rally supporters against the new leaders. Led by ex-foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva, the new government has pledged to restore law and order in all parts of the volatile former Soviet republic, reform the constitution and hold presidential elections in about six months. The turmoil has underlined rivalries between the United States and Russia for influence over Kyrgyzstan which is home to a Russian and a U.S. military air base. Washington and Moscow have both endorsed the new government, pledging financial support. Otunbayeva, whose government has yet to be recognised internationally, says she will maintain balance in her relations with regional pow
