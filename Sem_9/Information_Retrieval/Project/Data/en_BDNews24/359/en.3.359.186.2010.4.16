<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP will participate in the upcoming Bhola by-election despite its allegations that the ruling Awami League is trying to fix it. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters on Friday that the Awami League was trying to marginalise the BNP in the elections scheduled on Apr 24. "But we will not pull out of it." Delwar told the reporters that the BNP always wanted to participate in elections and it would. "We will take this one as a test case." He said the government was carrying out illegal activities to turn the election into a farce. He criticised the Election Commission for not taking necessary measures for a free and fair election. "We are still urging the commission to take actions against bids to foil the election," he said. Criticising the EC for deferring the date of DCC polls, the BNP leader said that some days ago the chief election commissioner had said that he would declare the election schedule on Apr 18. "Now he is saying the election will be deferred." Delwar alleged that ATM Shamsul Huda, the election chief, had no neutrality. "He always toes the government line." He said that the BNP did not want to pull out of the election. Tofail Ahmed, Awami League's coordinator of the Bhola-3 by-election, on Thursday alleged BNP of trying to thwart the election sensing 'certain' defeat. BNP leaders, however, on Thursday threatened to pull out of the election if armed forces were not deployed. BNP chief Khaleda Zia, in a written statement on Thursday, said her party would launch a tough movement if armed forces were not deployed. BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed, also hinting a pull-out said, "We'll have to seriously reconsider our participation." The warnings came following a reported Awami League attack on BNP leader Nazim Uddin Alam early Thursday when he was campaigning for the BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed. Former BNP MP Alam said Thursday that he was assaulted by ruling AL activists during an election campaign in Bhola, while Awami League claimed that it was the BNP that had first attacked an Awami League rally. bd
