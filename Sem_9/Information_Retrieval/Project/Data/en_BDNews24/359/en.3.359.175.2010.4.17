<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  A sepoy named Moeen was claimed by prosecutors to have been the person who triggered the mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters last year. Prosecutor Lt Col Akhtar Hamid Khan stated this on Saturday in the special BDR court which is prosecuting 623 people for alleged mutiny. The court, headed by the current BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, set Oct 18 as the date to frame charges in the case and asked that the accused be produced on that date looking the same way - with or without a beard - as they did when they are alleged to have committed mutiny. The court, set up at the Darbar Hall in the Peelkhana, began at around 11:30am and ended at around 12:30pm. Of the accused 315 were from 13th Rifles Battalion, with the other coming from different battalions. For the first time in court, Prosecutor Lt Col Akhtar Hamid Khan stated that a sepoy named Moeen had triggered the mutiny by pointing a gun in the direction of the director general, obtaining the support of other members. Some 172 members of 13th battalion were present in the Darbar Hall. Their involvement was proved either by photographs or video footage, he said. Mainul Islam, the head of the court, asked the prosecutor to make sure that the witnesses give their statements only with regard to the mutiny, not in relation to killing, looting or other crimes. This court is only trying the mutineers, he said. Addressing the accused, Islam said that anybody can be made a witness. If the witness is a military person or BDR member the authorities will take all required steps to produce him before the court. If the witness is a civilian, the accused person has the responsibility to bring him to court. "This is a historic incident. This is the same place where the mutiny took place and now the mutineers are being tried. "I hope such incidents will not recur in future so that the Darbar Hall is never again used as a court," the outgoing DG said. The trial began on Apr 15. 293 of the accused were arrested soon after the incident, and the remaining were only arrested on the day that the trial started from Peelkhana headquarters. b
