 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's exports are in grave danger due to the prevailing gas and power crises in the country, business leaders said on Sunday. Speaking at a meeting on developing a new export strategy for Bangladesh. leaders of several organisations representing exporters told the commerce minister Faruk khan that if the crises continue for much longer Bangladesh will gradually lose its foreign markets. The business leaders demanded a rapid solution to the problem  including the provision of government subsidies to buy diesel and furnace oil for their industries. They also pressed for immediate implementation of a second stimulus package. Abdus Salam Murshedy, president of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said the businessmen of the country, at present, could not reach even close to their export target. The traders had to supply their products by plane as they could not get their shipments ready on time, said Murshedy. Fazlul Haque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers & Exporters Association, demanded that the government look closely at the increased price of yarn. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Association vice-president Maksudur Rahman demanded special assistance in relation to accessing power. The commerce minister, speaking as the chief guest at the meeting, said the government is putting its heart and soul into trying to solve the power and gas crises for the last 15 months. A taskforce also have been formed to assess the second stimulus package which is due to submit its report within a month, he said. The Dhaka Chambers of Commerce Industry president Abul Kashem, Bangladesh Tanners' Association president Abdul Hye, Finished Leather Association president Rezaul Karim Ansari and Fruits and Vegetable Exporters' Association president SM Jahangir Hossain were also present at the meeting.
