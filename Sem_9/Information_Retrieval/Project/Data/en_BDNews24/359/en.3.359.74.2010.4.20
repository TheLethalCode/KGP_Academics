<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  Fishermen beat to death a Ganges dolphin near Bagerhat on Tuesday. At least six teams of fishermen have been fishing over a three kilometre stretch, from the Muniganj bridge over the Daratana River to Daratana Bridge. One Zakir Hossain caught the Ganges dolphin, an endangered species, during the high tide on Monday near Dakbanglo Ghat. Zakir and his associates became frightened while gathering the nets and beat the dolphin to death. But Zakir denied killing the dolphin. He claimed that it had died getting entangled in his fishing net. The district administration and fisheries department officials recovered the dead dolphin at around 10am. Azam Khan, the additional deputy commissioner, went to the spot with district fisheries officer, Bazlur Rashid, hearing the news and covered the dolphin with ice. Then he buried the Ganges dolphin through the Bagerhat municipality as it was not possible to preserve it at his department. He said that the dolphin's length was 7 feet 1 inch, from head to tail and weighed about 80kgs. bd
