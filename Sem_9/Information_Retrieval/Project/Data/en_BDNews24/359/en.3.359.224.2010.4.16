<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  Senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed has alleged that the main opposition BNP was not serious about the Bhola by-election. He said that Khaleda Zia and Khandaker Delwar Hossain were not taking the Bhola-3 polls 'seriously'. "BNP does not want to see Maj Hafizuddin Ahmed win." Tofail reasoned that this was why the BNP leaders were not at the constituency campaigning for their candidate. "They are only making false allegation at press conferences here in Dhaka." Tofail made the allegations at a press conference in Dhaka on Friday, a day after his return from the Bhola constituency where by-elections are scheduled on Apr 24. Tofail, member of the party's advisory council, is also the chief coordinator of the party's election publicity committee and has been elected MP from the same another constituency of the same district. Welcoming election monitors and journalists from home and abroad, he said, "You just watch by how many thousand votes we win." Tofail clearly indicated that winning was not a question but it was the margin of victory that could be debated. Referring the dubious role that Maj Hafiz played as a so-called reformist during the tenure of the military-controlled interim regime, he said, "Maj Hafiz divided BNP into two parts during the previous caretaker government period." "They (BNP) can't forget this and that's why they are not taking the election seriously," he claimed. "If they did, they would have given the responsibility of a coordinator to a senior leader rather than to Nazim Uddin Alam," Tofail added. The former minister alleged that BNP was working towards abandoning the election. Regarding army deployment he said, "There is no record of deploying the army in a by election." TWO MORE RAB BATTALIONS Meanwhile, election commissioner Mohammad Sohul Hossain, currently in Bhola, reiterated on Friday that the army will not be deployed. However, following demands for army deployment by the BNP, the commission on Thursday decided to add two more battalions of RAB. In a meeting with the district administration and law enforcing agencies on Friday, the commissioner said, "The election will be conducted fairly at any cost." He also said the committee, formed after the alleged assault on BNP's Nazim Uddin Alam on Thursday, will submit its report on Friday. Bhola police super SN Nazrul Khan admitted that there had been a few stray incidents of violence as candidates were not holding rallies according to election laws. bdnews24
