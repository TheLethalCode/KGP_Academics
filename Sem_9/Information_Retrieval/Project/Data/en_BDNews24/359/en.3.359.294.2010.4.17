<TITLE> FBCCI demands tax cuts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The country's apex business association demanded that people earning less than Tk 2 lakh per year should be exempted from paying tax. At present, those earning more than Tk 1.65 lakh per year are required to pay tax. Annisul Huq, president of the FBCCI made this recommendation whilst setting out his organisation's proposals in a pre-budget discussion held on Saturday. Whilst this proposal was supported by other businessmen during the open discussion, former caretaker government advisor AB Mirza Azizul Islam disagreed. Azizul Islam said that the limit, at which tax should first be paid, should be fixed in line with the national per capita income. Comparing Bangladesh to India, the limit in Bangladesh should be Tk 1.25 lakh he said. "And even if it is raised, it must not be over Tk 1.75 lakh." FBCCI also suggested a cut in corporate tax as it was "the highest in the world" and said that lowering it would raise revenue collection. In his presentation, Annisul Huq proposed 25 percent tax for listed companies, 30 percent for non-listed ones and 40 percent for banks, financial institutions and mobile phone operators. On this issue Azizul Islam agreed that there should be a cut in corporate tax as it was "high". "However, it should be reduced gradually." He proposed a reduction between 2 and 2.5 percent for the next year. The former finance advisor, however, was sceptical about the proposed rates for banks and financial institutions. "The spread is still too high. Whenever, the lending rate is lowered the banks also slash their deposit rates." he said. He said that banks should still have their taxes lowered. Finance minister AMA Muhith, agreed with his predecessor on banks and financial institutions, but noted that "their gains from the stock market are not taxed either." Muhith called for views on imposing tax on capital gains from the stock market, a provision which the government is considering for inclusion in the next budget. On overall corporate taxes, Muhith felt that they were "not that high". The trade body also asked for a restructuring of import duties to favour local industries. Many of the FBCCI recommendations involved measures that would protect local industries from foreign competition and foster further industrialisation. Huq said that a reduction in import duties and raw materials along with higher duties on imports of finished goods would foster domestic industrial growth. On this issue, Azizul Islam also felt the import tax structure should be revised. "The current structure is aligned with the one formulated during the early '90s when we were in the spirit of trade liberalisation," he added. Finance minister AMA Muhith, however, did not make any comments on income tax and import tariffs saying it was "tough to comment at this moment". "Our aim, however, is liberalisation and everything would be considered accordingly." Measures to widen the tax net, simplification of income tax procedures, VAT reforms and setting up a National Tax Tribunal also came up in FBCCI's recommendations. Responding to the issues, Muhith promised that a tax tribunal would be formed within this fiscal year. He also said that reforms in VAT and duty would be completed by the next fiscal year. "There will be no Income Tax Ordinance in the next fiscal year," added Muhith indicating that a full-fledged law would be formulated. On simplification of income tax return, Muhith said the current four-page income tax return form might be reduced to two pages to make it easier for people to file. The FBCCI discussion also stressed power and energy issue along with the necessity of increased focus on railway and waterways development, and population control measures. It also insisted on urgent measures to ease the traffic congestion of Dhaka. Annisul Huq said in his presentation that traffic congestion caused a loss of $1.84 million every day. "Annually it stands at about $670 million per year." b
