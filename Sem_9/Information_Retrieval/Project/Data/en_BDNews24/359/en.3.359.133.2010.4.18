 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com) Pakistan has raised reservations about signing an agreement on natural disaster rapid response mechanisms at the upcoming SAARC summit to be held in Thimphu, Bhutan Three days ago the Bhutanese ambassador in Bangladesh Dasho Bap Kesang told journalists that this agreement would be signed at the summit. "Pakistan has said the proposal needs more examination by the experts," a foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com Sunday. He said Islamabad had informed the SAARC secretariat about its concerns and the secretariat passed the message to the member states. According to the charter of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) all decisions have to be adopted unanimously by member states. However, the officials say that two other agreements  one on the environment, and another on trade in services - will be signed during the Thimphu summit scheduled for April 28-29.
