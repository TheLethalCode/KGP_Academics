 Meherpur, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said Saturday that the Awami League had come to power with the pledge to trying war criminals. Ashraf, also the AL general secretary, said that war criminals' trial was a pledge of the present government. "It was because of this pledge that the people brought this government to power with huge support." Ashraf made the statements speaking at a programme to mark the Mujibnagar Day at Mujibnagar of Meherpur district. The cabinet members and advisors of the government, led by Ashraf, laid wreaths at the Mujibnagar Monument at around 10:30am. Afterwards, the leaders received a guard of honour from a four member squad of Ansar. These four were also the ones who had given the guard of honour to the first government of Bangladesh 39 years ago. The LGRD minister said, "The present government has finished all preparations for the trial to meet its election pledge." He also asked the freedom fighters to be vigilant once again to free the nation of 'war criminals'. The Bangladesh government was formed in Meherpur on this day in 1971 with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the president, Syed Nazrul Islam as the vice president and acting president and Tajuddin Ahmed as the prime minister. bdnews24.c
