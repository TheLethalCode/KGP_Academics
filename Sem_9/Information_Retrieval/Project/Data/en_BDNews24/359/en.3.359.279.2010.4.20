<TITLE> Power crisis threatens boro in Madaripur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Madaripur, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Boro crops of about 4,000 hectares are under threat due to lack of irrigation. Farmers cannot water their lands at the eleventh hour as power supply is not sufficient. As a result the paddy will not bear any cereal and might affect the harvest severely, farmers say. The boro season target acreage was about 4000 hectres, but boro covers more than double that target. Deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension of the district Kafil Uddin said the yield target could not be achieved although acreage was so high. The West Zone Power Distribution Company admitted its inability to ensure supply according to demand. Executive engineer Abdul Wahab told bdnews24.com: "Currently the district demands 72 megawatts (MW), whereas we can only provide 20-25MW." "Of this, we provide Palli Bidyut Samity with 12-15MW against a demand of 26MW. Of the remaining 8-10MW, 4MW is supplied to Shariatpur." "Only 4-5MW is left for us," he added. Citing that WZPDC was forced to impose loadshedding, the official said, "We do not really have any other option." Local agriculture experts said this year's production could not be in line with the expectation if power supply is not addressed immediately. District DAE specialist Md Nurul Islam Mollah told bdnews24.com most of the boro paddy have not borne any fruit due to lack of water. "This is the time when the paddy is supposed to flower and necessarily require 3-4 inches of water in the fields." Rahim Bepari, a farmer from Panchkhola village of Sadar upazila said that his paddy would not bear any cereal. He has cultivated boro on 4 bighas (33 decimals = 1 bigha) with loans. Rahim said that all he would be ruined this year. Block supervisor of Sadr upazila Abdur Rahman said irrigation was interrupted in his blocks due to frequent loadshedding. "We get power for a pretty short period, which is insufficient for irrigating the lands." The farmers said they had complained to power officials several times, without any results. The agitated farmers attacked the Samity office last week and injured the an official there demanding power supply for irrigation. bdnews
