 BUENOS AIRES, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diego Maradona said on Friday that Argentina's line-up in their World Cup opener against Nigeria could be identical to the one which started the 1-0 win over Germany in a warm-up in Munich last month. Maradona, speaking to local radio station FM Metro, said Argentina will play with four centre backs and Jonas Gutierrez and Angel Di Maria on the wings at the tournament in South Africa.

Asked for more details and whether he had already settled on 20, Maradona ran through some of Argentina's biggest names, saying: "'Masche', Veron, Tevez, Messi, 'el Kun' (Sergio Aguero)...Yes, we're there." Captain Javier Mascherano, Juan Sebastian Veron and Lionel Messi were in the team in Munich along with striker Gonzalo Higuain, who scored the goal.
