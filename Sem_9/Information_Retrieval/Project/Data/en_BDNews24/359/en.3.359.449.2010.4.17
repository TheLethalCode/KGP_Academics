 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  15 of the 17 newly appointed additional judges to the High Court are set to take oath on Sunday. Chief justice Fazlul Karim will conduct the oath scheduled at the Supreme Court lounge at 10am, government news agency BSS said Saturday quoting a press release from the registrar's office of the Supreme Court. President Zillur Rahman, with the consent of the chief justice, appointed 17 new additional judges on Apr 11. Of them, oaths of former senior leader of JSD Chhatra League Md Ruhul Kuddus Babu and deputy attorney general Muhammad Khasruzzaman will be held later. Several government sources, asking not to be named, said the Chief Justice refused to administer their oath. Newspaper stories say the appointments were made violating the prescribed guidelines. Several newspapers reported that until recently Babu had a murder case against him which was recommended for withdrawal and his name was struck from the list of the accused. Khasruzzaman had reportedly taken part in vandalism in the Supreme Court area and is said to have kicked at the door of the Chief Justice's office. The 15 judges to be sworn in are Supreme Court lawyer M Faruk, Supreme Court registrar Shawkat Hossain, deputy attorney general FRM Nazmul Ahsan, Dhaka District and Sessions judge Krishna Debnath, Dhaka Sessions judge ANM Bashirullah, Supreme Court lawyer Abdur Rab, Dr Kazi Reza-ul-Haque, Md Abu Zafar Siddique, additional attorney general AKM Jahurul Haque, Supreme Court lawyer Jahangir Hossain Selim, Sheikh Md Zakir Hossain, Habibul Gani, Gobinda Chandra Thakur, Sheikh Hasan Arif and former deputy attorney general JBM Hasan. bdnews
