 NIZHNYAYA ALARCHA, Kyrgyzstan, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's interim rulers moved on Tuesday to quell ethnic violence threatening their fragile grip on the Central Asian state after the overthrow of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Defiant Bakiyev loyalists in the south and lawlessness on the fringes of the capital Bishkek are challenging efforts to restore order after an April 7 uprising that ousted the president but left at least 85 people dead. On Tuesday, some 300 riot police and troops confronted a crowd of several hundred people on the outskirts of Bishkek in an area where five people died on Monday when looters attacked homes belonging to mainly ethnic Russians and Meskhetian Turks. A tense standoff was under way. Led by ex-foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva, the interim government that took power on Bakiyev's ouster has played down the unrest, blaming it on thugs trying to exploit a security vacuum to grab property illegally. But continued instability in the impoverished country of 5.3 million people is a worry both for Russia and for the United States, which earlier in the crisis curtailed operations at its Kyrgyz airbase supplying operations in Afghanistan. The Interior Ministry said its forces had arrested a number of rioters in a swoop operation in the suburbs after nightfall. The night appeared to pass without major unrest. The new authorities on Monday pledged fast reform to strengthen the role of parliament at the expense of the president, and to hold free parliamentary and presidential elections in September or October. But they face resistance in the south. In Jalalabad, a southern city in Bakiyev's tribal heartland, loyalists of the ousted leader have installed a pro-Bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government office at the weekend, intensifying a stand-off with the self-proclaimed government in Bishk
