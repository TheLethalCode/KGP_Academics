 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has urged the Election Commission to cancel its decision banning political leaders and MPs to enter polling centres on the election day in Bhola. "We want the commission to reconsider its decision," party's joint secretary general Rizvi Ahmed told a press briefing on Wednesday. The EC had said on Tuesday that only voters taking part in the election should be allowed to enter the area. He said the EC had allowed political leaders and MPs to enter the polling centres during the by-elections held between 1991 and 2001. "If they are not allowed this time we will simply think that there must be something odd going on," Rizvi said. He said that the BNP fears that this decision would allow criminals to occupy the centres and rig the voting. He further alleged that eight local BNP activists were assaulted in Bhola on Tuesday after chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had left for Dhaka. About 250 party men had so far been injured by "Awami League criminals" during the election campaign, the BNP leader said. "The voters don't know whether they will be able to get to vote. The criminals of the ruling party are ordering them not to go to the polling centres." People do not have faith in law enforcers, Rizvi said. He again expressed concern whether the polls would be held fairly and that the commission was working under the government.
