 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com) A United Airways plane made an emergency landing at Dhaka airport on Tuesday after developing technical fault in its engine. But all the 35 passengers were safe, public relations officer of the private airline operator Quamrul Islam told bdnews24.com. He said the twin-engined Canadian Dash-8-100 left Dhaka for Chittagong at 5pm but the pilot landed the plane at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 5:52pm. This is the second time this year that an United Airways plane made an unplanned landing. On Jan 24, a Cox's Bazar-bound aircraft of the same model was forced to make an emergency landing. "The pilot of the plane faced mechanical problems just minutes before reaching the destination. He then flew the plane back to Dhaka since there are no facilities in Chittagong to fix the problem," Islam told bdnews24.com. bdne
