 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's internet connectivity was restored to its full capacity at 2 pm on Sunday. A fault in a submarine cable on the 14 April resulted in Bangladesh losing all its internet communication with countries to the west of the cable including Europe. The fault was repaired by Mango Teleservices Limited, an International Internet Gateway (IIG) operator in Bangladesh.
