<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20(bdnews24.com) -- BNP has launched a signature collection campaign demanding unconditional release of party's senior vice-chairperson Tarique Rahman, who is in London for treatment with 14 cases filed against him. Former vice-chancellor of Dhaka University professor Emajuddin Ahamed inaugurated the programme at the Institution of Engineers on Tuesday. Tarique, who fell sick in custody during the previous army-backed caretaker government following alleged torture on him, flew to London on Sep 11 in 2007 for treatment after obtaining bail in all the cases. Organisers said the campaign aims to collect one crore signatures. Speaking on the occasion, Emajuddin said: "Amidst immense uncertainties prevailing around us, I am optimistic that our young generation will herald a new era after erasing past failures." "Tarique Rahman is one of the shining stars of that generation," he said cautioning everyone against blind praise and sycophancy. Terming Tarique the symbol of the country's independence, he said Tarique would be able to make the impossible possible with the present generation. Emajuddin recalled Tarique's contribution to strengthening BNP at the grassroots level. Urging the organisers to take the campaign to the rural areas, he said it would help beat the propaganda against him. Tarique was arrested by the joint forces on Mar 7, 2007 following promulgation of the state of emergency. A new organisation, with BNP vice-chairperson Abdullah Al Noman as the convenor, came into being for conducting the signature collection campaign. The organisation will have 501 organising members at the national level, 101 at district levels and 71 at upazila levels. The programme, chaired by professor of development studies at Dhaka University, Mahbub Ullah, was attended by pro-BNP intellectuals. bdn
