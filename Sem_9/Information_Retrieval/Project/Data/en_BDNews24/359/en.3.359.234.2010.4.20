 Dhaka, Apr 20(bdnews24.com) The state minister for power requested for constructive suggestions instead of just criticism regarding the power crisis. Power state minister Enamul Haque said at a seminar on Tuesday that it would not be easy to reduce power shortage to below 10 percent within 2015 as the government had proposed. Replying to comments the minister said the suggestions were simply not feasible. "We need more time and planning." He said the government had come up with a plan. But if other had alternative suggestions they could come forward with the plan. "Nothing can be achieved from just criticism." The country has a shortfall of 30 percent compared to the power demand. "But we will resolve the power crisis completely by 2021," said Haque. Ijaz Hossain, a professor of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology, said that the so-called system loss was actually not system loss at all. "This is plain pilferage." He said that mere plans would not do. "Pilferage must also be stopped." He said that the government made numerous plans with numerous deadlines for completion. "But there are no results." "We do not want any more dates. We want to see the actual work done," said the BUET professor. Former power state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmood said that when he was in charge of the ministry, projects failed to materialise despite plans due to system loss, gas shortage, inefficiency and lack of funds. He told the seminar that he had burnt his fingers trying to handle the power ministry. "I don't want you to burn your fingers too." Mahmood said that feasibility tests would also have to be conducted. The current power state minister retorted to this saying that just because the BNP-led government had failed, does not mean that so would the current government. He blamed that the opposition was trying to oust the government by blowing the power and gas shortage out of proportion. The keynote paper was presented by Md Mizanur Rahman, director in charge of system planning, Bangladesh Power Development Board. The keynote said that current peak electricity demand was 5800MW against a production of 4000MW on average. But power generation was stunted further due to a number of reasons. Rahman said that the country lost about 500MW due to old power plants, and between 500MW and 700MW due to gas shortage. The seminar was organised by Energy and Power, a fortnightly magazine on power shortage. Energy and Power editor Mollah Amzad Hossain moderate the seminar. b
