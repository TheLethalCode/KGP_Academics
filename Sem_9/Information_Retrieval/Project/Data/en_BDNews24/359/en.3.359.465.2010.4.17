 Savar, Apr 17 (bdnewa24.com)  An India-owned garments factory based at Ashulia has sacked 148 of its total 1350 workers. Pearl Garments Company Limited of Epic Group made the announcement on Saturday after announcing two days earlier that it had shut the factory for an indefinite period due to labour unrest. The manager of the factory Arif Hossain said, "The workers were sacked under Section 26 of 'Labour Law 2006' alleging that they created unrest inside the factory." He said that the sacked workers were paid all the money that was owing to them along with an additional 120 days of wages. In defiance of the police, some workers organised a protest rally in the field beside the factory, demanding immediate opening of the factory and re-appointment of those who had been sacked. Some of the sacked labourers said that when receiving their money, they were forced to sign agreements not to take part in protests for their re-appointment. On Tuesday, some of the workforce had downed tools alleging that a worker named Saddam Hossain was assaulted by a company manager. As the police arrived, the workers closed the main gate from inside the factory. The gates were only opened at 5pm, when the factory closed. Following this incident, the company issued a notice, signed by the factory manager which stated that the factory would from then on be closed for an indefinite period due to labour unrest. Sewing operator Shima, Motaleb and many others claimed to bdnews24.com that on Tuesday when the labour unrest took place, they were on leave, but they have still lost their jobs They claimed that some of the people who were present during the incident continue to retain their jobs. A sewing operator, Lipi Akter, who was one of the sacked workers, told bdnews24.com that she did not know why she was sacked and also claimed that she was not paid the money owed to her Claiming that the workers were fired in a proper way, a senior manager of the factory, Sazzadul Islam, said that unrest was created in the factory under the influence of the 'so-called' labour leaders. Discussions were going on with the workers to resolve the situation, he added.
