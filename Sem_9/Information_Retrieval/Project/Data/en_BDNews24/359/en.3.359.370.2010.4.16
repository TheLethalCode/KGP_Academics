 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber killed at least three foreigners and their Afghan guards in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Thursday, while four German soldiers were killed in a separate attack in the north. The blast in Kandahar came hours after another large car bomb in the centre of the city, which has been the scene of numerous attacks in recent weeks, ahead of a major planned offensive by US troops expected there in coming months. "The attack was on a security company. There are some casualties. Some foreigners were injured and killed; some security guards were killed," Ahmad Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council, told Reuters. He said preliminary reports indicated at least three foreigners had been killed and nine wounded. A police official, Mohammad Nabi, said seven foreign workers, believed to be British, had been killed in the blast, however other tolls were lower. Two other security sources said there were six dead, including three foreigners. A doctor at a central Kandahar hospital, Farhad, who uses only one name, said one dead foreigner had been brought to its morgue. Sixteen wounded Afghans and one wounded foreigner had been treated there, he said. The attack came hours after another car bomb exploded near a hotel, destroying shops and cars. Nabi said six people were wounded in that first attack. The birthplace of the Taliban, Kandahar is to be the focus of an upcoming US-led military offensive to turn the tide against a stubborn insurgency, and the militant group in the past has played up some attacks as a warning to NATO forces. In the biggest attack in Kandahar this year, Taliban suicide bombers killed more than 30 people in a series of coordinated strikes across the city last month. The bulk of the 30,000 additional combat troops ordered to Afghanistan by US President Barack Obama last year are expected to be deployed to Kandahar as part of the summer campaign to root out the Taliban from their spiritual homeland. FOUR GERMAN TROOPS KILLED Separately, in Afghanistan's northern Baghlan province, four German soldiers were killed and five wounded when they came under insurgent fire on Thursday in the deadliest single attack for foreign troops this year. Insurgents apparently carried out a rocket attack on a group of soldiers, some of whom were in an armoured car, close to Pol-i-Khomri camp, the German Defence Ministry said in a letter to members of the lower house of parliament. While military commanders have largely focused on the south and east of the country where most of the violence is concentrated, insurgents have been seizing parts of the north over the past couple years. The commander of US and NATO forces, General Stanley McChrystal is expected to send 2,500 US troops to the north in coming months to try and beat back the Taliban's advance. Germany has the third biggest NATO contingent in Afghanistan with more than 4,000 troops in the north, but critics say insurgents have been allowed to advance because of German troops' post-World War Two restrictions on their combat role. Polls show a large majority of Germans oppose their country's involvement in the Afghan conflict, which Chancellor Angela Merkel recently described as a "war" for the first time. The latest deaths are only likely to fuel public discontent. Fourty-three German troops have died in Afghanistan since 2002, seven of those in the last month. But despite waning public support for the war, Merkel said Germany would continue its mission in Afghanistan. On a visit to the United States, Merkel said she was saddened by the deaths but stressed that the security of "all western democracies" hinged on success in Afghanistan. "We must continue the mission," she said in San Francisc
