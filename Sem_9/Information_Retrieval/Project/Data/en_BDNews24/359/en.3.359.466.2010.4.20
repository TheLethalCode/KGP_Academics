 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Police will question for three days Hizb ut-Tahrir's chief coordinator for Bangladesh operations Mahiuddin Ahmed after his arrest early on Tuesday. Deputy DMP commissioner, Uttara Zone, Nesarul Arif told bdnews24.com that they had asked a Dhaka metropolitan magistrate's court for a seven-day remand for interrogation. Arif earlier said they had picked him up early on Tuesday from his Green Road house in connection with a bomb case. Two activists of Hizb ut-Tahrir were arrested with two petrol bombs and leaflets at Uttara and a case over the incident was filed. Mahiuddin was shown arrested in the case. Mahiuddin, also spokesman for the group in Bangladesh, and an associate professor of the Institute of Business Administration of Dhaka University, is facing charges of trying to reorganise the group. The university authorities sent him into forced retirement after the government banned the Islamist outfit on Oct 23. Hizb ut-Tahrir has become active in recent times, with its activists taking out a procession in Chittagong last week.
