 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has once again rejected BNP's demand for army deployment in the Bhola by-election. The Election Commission rejected the main opposition's demand during an hour-long meeting held with BNP standing committee member MK Anwar and senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters after the meeting that the commission would not deploy armed forces in the upcoming Bhola by-election scheduled to be held on Apr 24. Sakhawat, however, said the home ministry had been asked to assign five armed police under a magistrate to ensure security for each of the two candidates from both the ruling AL and opposition BNP. He also said that the EC had informed the home ministry to transfer the Bhola police superintendent before the polls. BNP's Anwar however told reporters: "The political situation in Bhola has deteriorated recently. It is not possible to hold elections there without army deployment. Free and fair election can not be held there by installing RAB and police forces." When asked whether the BNP would boycott the by-election if armed forces were not deployed, Anwar said, "I cannot answer that instantly. We think the EC will take positive decisions." BNP's Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed and Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury of the Awami League are set to run in the elections. A BNP delegation has met the commissioners on three previous occasions, on Mar 22, Apr 6 and Apr 13. bdn
