 BISHKEK, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Deposed President Kurmanbek Bakiyev formally resigned in a letter faxed to Kyrgyzstan's new leaders, officials said on Friday, allaying fears of civil war in the strategic Central Asian country. Bakiyev fled to neighbouring Kazakhstan on Thursday, ending days of turmoil that disrupted US military flights through a Kyrgyz air base to operations in Afghanistan. The crisis had underlined the rivalries between the United States and Russia for influence in Central Asia, a vast region of steppes and mountains wedged between China, Afghanistan and the Caspian Sea. Officials in the interim government, led by Roza Otunbayeva, said Bakiyev had faxed his resignation letter overnight. "I tender my resignation in these tragic days as I understand the full scale of my responsibility for the future of the Kyrgyz people," Bakiyev said in the letter. The text of the letter, signed by Bakiyev, was posted on the Twitter account of the interim chief of staff, often used by the new government to make important announcements. A photograph showed Otunbayeva scrutinising the letter. Bakiyev's departure has sharply reduced tension in the impoverished former Soviet republic after a violent uprising against his five-year rule raised the spectre of civil war. At least 84 people were killed in the uprising last week. The interim government, which has pledged to hold free elections and introduce democratic reform, will be hoping the end of Bakiyev will lead to formal recognition by major powers. Russia, which also has an air base in Kyrgyzstan, sought to pressure Bakiyev to evict the United States from its Manas air base, through which 50,000 U.S. troops passed last month. The interim government says it plans to allow Washington to keep the base but has hinted it may review some elements of the operations. ACCUSATIONS FLY It has accused Bakiyev of nepotism and corruption and says the United States overlooked human rights abuses in the country in its resolve to maintain the base. Washington has denied this. Kazakhstan, which is chairing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) this year, said Bakiyev's departure was the result of joint efforts by the presidents of Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who had warned that Kyrgyzstan could become a "second Afghanistan," said on Thursday he believed the "negative scenario" in the country had been avoided through the efforts of "all the stakeholders." Bakiyev has not appeared in public since fleeing. Interim government officials say Bakiyev is in the Kazakh city of Taraz on the Kyrgyz border with his wife and two children. Kazakh officials declined to comment. He had demanded that two of his brothers, accused by the opposition of playing a role in the deaths of his opponents and last week's violence, should be allowed to leave with him. Their whereabouts are now unclear. Interim government officials said forces were conducting an operation in southern Kyrgyzstan to round up any Bakiyev allies thought to be hiding in the region. Bakiyev's defence minister had been arrested, local media s
