 Rajshahi, Apr 20 (bdnews24. A three-day strike by the Truck, Oil Tanker and Van Workers Unity Council began on Tuesday in 16 districts in the north of the country. Sramik Oikya Parishad called the strike over a set of demands including appointment letters for transport workers, and the provision of wages, allowances and bonuses in accordance with the government rules. The strike will continue until 6 p.m. of Thursday. The President of the strikers' organisation Nurul Islam told bdnews24.com that Rajshahi divisional commissioner Hafizur Rahman Bhuiyan and the DIG of the Rajshahi police range Mokhleshur Rahman called a meeting on Tuesday between the owners' association and union leaders. However, he said that the union did not join the meeting, as instead of the commissioner and the DIG attending, the organisers sent the district commissioner and the police super. Bhuiyan however told bdnews24.com that the only reason he could not attend the meeting was because he was on leave - and that he was certainly willing to sit at the meeting if the union leaders wanted. On the first day of the strike, hundreds of vehicles loaded with goods remained stranded at different places. Shamiul Huq Liton, president of the C and F agent association of the Sona Masjid land port, said that he feared that the perishable goods in the stationery vehicles would be destroyed unless the strike was withdrawn. Even oil tankers full of fuel could not reach their filling station destinations due to the strike. Rabiul Islam, assistant manager of the Gul-Gafur petrol pump of Rajshahi city, told bdnews24.com that their lorries were unable to reach the filing stations. He claimed that the three-day strike was called without prior announcement. Atiqul Islam, owner of a filling station in the Rangpur town, said that on Tuesday no tank-lorry had come into his filling station. The workers's demands also included providing insurance to workers, issuing licenses to drivers on easy terms and requiring the government providing Tk 2 lakh as compensation to the families of workers killed in accidents. The workers have also demanded the accountability of the those police officials who failed to stop robberies The districts effected are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra, Natore, Naogaon, Chapainawabganj, Dinajpur, Panchagarh, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Pabna, Sirajganj, Gaibandha, Joypurhat and Kurigram. bdnews24.
