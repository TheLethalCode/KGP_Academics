 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com) -- The semi-finals of the 2010 Indian Premier League have been moved out of Bangalore and will be played at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai, reports Cricinfo. The decision, announced by IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, was made following the two low-intensity blasts at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore shortly before the match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians was due to begin on Saturday evening, and the recovery of two unexploded devices over the subsequent 24 hours. "We don't want to take any chances. We want to ensure the safety of our players and spectators alike," Modi said from Dubai, where he is attending an ICC meeting, when he made the announcement. "While reluctant to relocate the semi-finals at such short notice, yesterday's incidents have made it clear that the current environment in Bangalore prevents us from continuing with our original plans," Modi said in a statement issued by the IPL. "The incidents were assessed by local police and the IPL's security agency as being of a minor nature but they have forced our hand." The developments in Bangalore, which point to a lapse in security, have raised concerns over both general pre-match security procedures and the specific handling of the match after the blasts. There have been unconfirmed reports of some overseas players being unwilling to go ahead with Saturday's game and question marks over security arrangements during the tournament. For the moment, though, the international cricket boards are not prepared to wait and watch the situation. The ECB said they were in "constant contact with their players at various franchises over a number of issues, of which safety and security is one, but there are no plans for the players to leave early." Cricket Australia (CA) spokesman Peter Young said the security situation in India would be closely monitored. "We're keen to talk to IPL organisers, and that will possibly happen sometime in the next 12 hours or so, just to get an understanding of what's going on," he said. Young said Australians playing in the IPL were participating in India independent of CA. "In a formal sense we are not connected," Young said. "But we are always concerned about our players and personnel. There were around 40,000 spectators inside the Chinnaswamy Stadium at the time of the blasts in Bangalore and security measures were tightened. Apart from the two blasts that delayed the start of Saturday's first match by more than an hour, and in which at least eight people sustained injuries, another bomb was found and defused at a separate location outside the arena. On Sunday morning, another unexploded device was found several meters from the stadium, and a second one a short distance
