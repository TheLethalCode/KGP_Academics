<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government is observing the historic Mujibnagar Day on Saturday. But prime minister Sheikh Hasina could not join any event of the day due to a sudden bout of sickness. Her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com that she was on rest the whole day as the doctor had prescribed. Hasina had felt sick due to 'overwork', he added. The prime minister was supposed to pay tribute at the portrait of Bangabandhu at Dhanmondi Road 32. The Bangladesh government was formed in Kushtia's Meherpur area on this day in 1971 with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman named as the president, Syed Nazrul Islam as the vice president and acting president and Tajuddin Ahmed as the prime minister. The government is for the first time holding programmes in Meherpur, as well as in Dhaka, to make the day. Parliament deputy leader and Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, finance minister AMA Muhith and other central leaders laid floral tributes at the graves of three national leaders Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed and M Mansur Ali in Dhaka's Banani in the morning. In Meherpur, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, son of Syed Nazrul Islam, the state minister for liberation war affairs ABM Tajul Islam and other central and local leaders laid wreath at the Mujibnagar mausoleum at around 10am. A meeting was held beside the mausoleum with Syed Ashraf as chief guest. The Awami League also organised a discussion in Dhaka's Bangabandhu International Conference Centre to observe the day. Hasina was also expected to attend the event as chief guest. bdnews2
