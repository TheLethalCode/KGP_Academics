 Dhaka, Apr 16(bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami on Friday termed International War Crimes (Tribunal) Act a 'black law'. Nizami was speaking at the launch of district ameer conference at Al-Falah Auditorium at Maghbazar in the capital on Friday. Nizami said, "Not a single Jamaat leader was associated with any crime against humanity during the Independence War of 1971." He claimed that nobody would be able to prove the allegations against Jamaat leaders. He said the International War Crimes (Tribunal) Act of 1973 was the worst black law in history. Clarifying Jamaat's role during the Liberation War, Nizami said that his party sincerely wanted to retain the sovereignty of Pakistan. "But it was not pragmatic." Nizami said that the party never really concealed its role. "We wanted to resolve the problems staying within an integrated Pakistan." Nizami said, there might be debate over Jamaat's role in 1971, but since independence, Jamaat has been trying to establish a welfare state in Bangladesh. The Jamaat chief said, "It seems that the government and its intellectuals are up against Jamaat and bent on getting it out of the political field." "The issues of banning Islamist politics and war crimes have been put on the forefront in a bid to implement Indian agenda," he said adding that the government considered Jamaat to be an obstacle to their mission. Dismissing the allegations of war crimes, Nizami said, "No one from the Hindu community has ever accused Jamaat leaders. Not even Awami League leaders complained against Jamaat." "If Jamaat leaders had indeed committed any misdeeds, Awami League leaders would not have spared us." Nizami slammed the government for its failure to resolve the crises of electricity, gas and water.
