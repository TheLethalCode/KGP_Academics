<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP claimed on Tuesday that government pressure is behind the Election Commission's decision against army deployment in the Bhola by-election. The EC has repeatedly rejected the BNP's demand for army deployment in the election scheduled for Apr 24. "The Election Commission has obeyed the government in its rejection of our demand. The government does not want army deployment there," BNP's joint secretary general Rizvi Ahmed told a press conference. Senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed said on Monday that the government wanted to show that, as with the by-election in Bogra, it was not necessary to deploy the army. In April 2009, in Bogra. the BNP candidates won the two seats which had been vacated by party chairperson Khaleda Zia. Rizvi however said that, "The situation in Bhola is not normal. Criminals are threatening people not to vote BNP." He claimed there was real concerns about whether a free and fair election could be held there. He was also critical of the election commission bracketing together both the AL and the BNP candidates when it warned them both to abide by the electoral code of conduct. There is a lot of evidence that the AL candidate, Nurunabi Chowdhury Shaon, has breached the electoral code of conduct, he said. The BNP leader said its candidate, Hafizuddin Ahmed, however was well aware of the need to comply with the law.
