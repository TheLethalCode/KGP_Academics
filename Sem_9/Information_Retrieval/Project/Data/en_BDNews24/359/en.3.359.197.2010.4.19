 MONTE CARLO, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With the French Open looming, Rafael Nadal sprung back to life at the Monte Carlo Masters and left his opponents baffled about how to beat him on clay. The world number three dropped only 14 games on the way to his record sixth consecutive triumph in the principality, demolishing fellow Spaniard and Davis Cup team-mate Fernando Verdasco 6-0, 6-1 in Sunday's final.

After a one-year drought, he is back with an amazing level of play. "He's bluffed everyone." Verdasco was asked who could challenge Nadal on clay this season. "I think I can put myself in the top five right now. But also there are very good players," he said. "I think Ferrer and Ferrero, they're having an unbelievable year.
