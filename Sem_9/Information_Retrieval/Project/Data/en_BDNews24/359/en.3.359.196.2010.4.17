 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP has alleged that the Election Commission's decision against deploying the army on the voting day of the Bhola by-election is part of the government's "secret agenda." The party says that it doubts whether voters will be able to go to polling centres on 24 April to vote due to the influence of "outside criminals." "The Election Commission is not taking any action over these people even though we have informed them of the matter," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said on Saturday. The BNP leader alleged that "criminals" were continuing to threaten people in Lalmohan upazila not to vote the BNP. He also claimed that the BNP candidate Maj Hafizuddin Ahmed's convoy was attacked on Friday on his way from Tajmuddin to Lalmohan, but the local administration has not taken any action Although, following BNP demands for army deployment, the commission last week decided to add two more battalions of RAB in Bhola, the party still does not think that it is sufficient. "We think voters will only be able to vote fearlessly if the army is deployed there," Rizvi said. Rizvi rejected comments made on Friday by senior Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed that the BNP does not really want to see their own candidate Maj Hafizuddin win the by-election as he played a so-called "reformist" during the tenure of the interim regime. "We are working in unity for the candidate," he said Rizvi repeated his claims that the BNP candidate would win the election if held fairly. "The ruling party is spreading propaganda to occupy the constituency," he said.
