 MILAN, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian defender Maicon broke the deadlock with a spectacular goal to steer Inter Milan to a 2-0 home win over 10-man Juventus that took the champions back to the top of Serie A on Friday. Full back Maicon juggled the ball three times before cracking an unstoppable volley into the corner of the net in the 75th minute.

Eto'o and fellow forward Diego Milito wasted chances before Maicon finally broke through with his flash of brilliance. Substitute Mario Balotelli then hit the crossbar and Eto'o grabbed the second goal in the second minute of stoppage time. "It's a nasty blow. It's hard to swallow," Juve coach Alberto Zaccheroni said. "I have to raise morale again for the umpteenth time. We have to conjure up new energy and keep fighting till the end."
