<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka judge set May 25 as the date for submission of Ershad's written statement in a case filed against him by his former wife. Former military dictator HM Ershad could not appear in court in person on Tuesday because he was suffering from piles and low blood pressure. Also chairman of his faction of Jatiya Party Ershad, through his lawyer, Mahbubur Rahman appealed to the First Joint Judges Court for more time to submit a written statement for contesting a case file by Bidisha, Ershad's estranged wife. Bidisha claimed that she was tortured by him and her reputation had been tainted because of the "false cases" filed by him. Judge Imrul Quayes set May 25 for the submission. The former wife of the former president identified herself only as Bidisha, no surname, in the case statement filed with the Dhaka District and Sessions Court on Mar 18. Bidisha claimed in the case that Ershad tortured her both physically and mentally during 2005 to 2007, including harassing her with different false cases that harmed her social, political and business reputation. She also claimed damages for police torture that she alleges she suffered in custody after she was detained in connection with the cases filed against her by Ershad. Judge Imrul Quayes accepted the case and ordered Ershad to appear before the court on April 20. Bidisha demanded from Ershard Tk 10 crore for physical and mental harm, Tk 22 crore for loss in her profession and business and Tk 28 crore for defamation. The case papers say that in June 2005, five years after they married, Ershad filed a false fraud case against her. She claimed that, under Ershad's influence, on June 4 police then arrested her and took her for interrogation the following day. The case papers say that whilst in police custody she was given electric shocks, her nails were uprooted and she was beaten while being hung from the ceiling fan. Subsequently, she was released from all the cases. Bidisha also stated that she was well-known as a business woman, and through her design work in the garments sector, she had become "an institution". She said, however, that the propaganda spread by Ershad harmed her business and personal reputation and that Ershad also took over her boutique house 'Isabel' in Banani. bdnew
