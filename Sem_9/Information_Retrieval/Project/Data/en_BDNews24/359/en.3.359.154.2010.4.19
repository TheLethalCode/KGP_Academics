<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)RAB helped organise a local arbitration as a way of entrapping four men, accused of raping a teenager. When the men arrived at the local salish assuming that the allegations could be resolved in a mutual way, they were arrested by RAB officers. The accused allegedly kidnapped a 16 year old garment worker, when she was on her way back home on Friday. They then taped her mouth and raped her. The four men are also alleged to have threatened her with murder if she informed anyone about the incident. Since this incident the four men were absconding. Maj Mohammad Redwanul Islam, deputy director of RAB-3, at a press conference in its office on Monday said his officers decided to exploit the fact that the accused was putting constant pressure on the teenager's family to deal with the issue through mutual agreement. With the help of local guardians, RAB decided to set up a pretend salish. The four men then came to the Matir Masjid area of Chowdhurypara Sunday night where the salish was due to take place and were arrested. The miscreants had been harassing school students and garment workers at Rampura area for a long time, he added. The arrested men are 'Sagar', 22, 'Anis', 22, 'Shahjalal', 26, and 'Ujjal', 22. bdn
