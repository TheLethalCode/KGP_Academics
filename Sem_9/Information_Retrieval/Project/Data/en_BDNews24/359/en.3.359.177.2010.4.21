 Chittagong, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com )  Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has secured a six-month interim bail from a Chittagong court in a defamation case. District and sessions judge Abdul Quddus Miah gave the order on Wednesday after Chowdhury appeared before him and prayed for bail. The MP from Chittagong-2 constituency was accused of making provocative and defamatory comments about the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Last November, Chowdhury reportedly told a local BNP council meeting in Fatikchhari that, "Aug 15 is an important day in our national life as the nation was emancipated from one-party rule that day." In relation to the decision of the Supreme Court's Appellate Division to uphold the death sentences of those who were convicted of Mujib's murder, he is also reported to have said, "The nation has not accepted this verdict." The case was filed on Dec 3 by businessman Abu Taher Uddin of Shulkbahar in the port city. The court issued arrest warrant against him on the same day. The High Court initially granted him an interim bail for two months and later on Jan 25 allowed him a further six-month bail. It also asked him to appear before the trial court within this period.
