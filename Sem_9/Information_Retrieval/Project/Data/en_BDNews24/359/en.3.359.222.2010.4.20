 Rangpur, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque compared parliament to a 'zoo', a 'fish market' and the government's 'meeting place'. The opposition whip also claimed the government was 'turning the country into a jail'. Farroque was speaking to reporters after he secured bail from a Rangpur court in a defamation suit on Tuesday. On Mar 12, Farroque alleged in a press conference in Dhaka that the prime minister's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wajed "controlled the illegal VoIP trade in Bangladesh from Canada and the US" and called for an investigation. Since then, 21 defamation cases have been filed against Farroque across the country. The cases have been filed against him for 'using derogatory words' which has 'tarnished the image' of prime minister's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed. Rangpur additional chief judicial magistrate Rezaul Karim granted the bail upon Farroque's petition after he appeared before the court. "Cases have been filed against me just when I started revealing in parliament the corruption of this government. But we will keep disclosing information and proof of corruption," Farroque said. The opposition leader on Tuesday also secured bail from the senior judicial magistrate Maruf Hossain's court in Nilphamari. He appeared before the court 23 days ahead of the date, May 13. Several lawyers including Anisul Arefin Chowdhury, Kazi Mahbubar Rahman and Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury Shamim heard for Farroque. But none was present for the plaintiff. Member of Bangladesh Chhatra League central committee Nayeem Shahriar filed the case on Mar 16. bdnews24.com/corr/
