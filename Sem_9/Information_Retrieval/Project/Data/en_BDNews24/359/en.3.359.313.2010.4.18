 NICOSIA, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish Cypriots vote in a presidential election Sunday which could shape the future of Cyprus's fragile reunification process and Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Some 164,000 Turkish Cypriots are choosing between incumbent Mehmet Ali Talat and challenger Dervis Eroglu. Opinion polls put Eroglu, a staunch supporter of Turkish Cypriot independence, in the lead. Polling stations open at 6 a.m. British time and voting ends at 4 p.m. British time. The final result of the vote, which has to be ratified by an election council, is expected by 7 p.m. BST.

The outcome of the vote in northern Cyprus has major implications for Turkey whose own negotiations to join the European Union are virtually hostage to the resolution of the decades old island dispute. Cyprus was ethnically split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief coup inspired by the military then ruling Greece. The conflict not only burdens Turkey's bid to join the EU, but also makes decision making on defence issues between NATO, of which Turkey is a member, and the EU problemat
