 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) has said that the upcoming budget of 2011 fiscal should be one of delivery. In line with what has already been mentioned in a number of pre-budget discussions, the Dhaka-based research organisation indicated that the government would not have to start implementing projects. Terming the previous budget a preparatory one, CPD said the main challenge in the upcoming budget was to enhance implementation capacity. CPD's executive director Mustafizur Rahman said on Saturday at a press briefing that the government undertook new initiatives including the Public Private Partnership in the previous budget. "This year will show how much progress there has been in attracting investment and ensuring implementation." Since Bangladesh is now deemed as a potential destination, Rahman said that financing was no longer a challenge. "Rather, timely implementation was the challenge." Reportedly, the budget will have a net outlay of about Tk 132,000 crore against last year's outlay of Tk 113,819 crore. Due to failure of implementation of the Annual Development Programme (ADP) nearly Tk 2,000 crore has been curtailed in the amended budget. Senior Awami League leaders came down hard on finance minister AMA Muhith for slow progress of projects at a pre-budget discussion on April 15. Veteran AL leader Tofail Ahmed, also a former minister for commerce and industries, had said that a lot of announcements had come in the last budget but 'nothing had improved' and there had been no progress as regards IPP (Independent Power Plant) in the last 15 months. Suranjit Sengupta, the head of the parliamentary standing committee for law, justice and parliamentary affairs echoed Tofail on budget implementation. He said that there were a lot of new features in the last budget like, PPP, district budget, ADP and revenue budget integration, but none of them had taken off. CPD recommended that the government should not borrow heavily from the local banking sector. Under general fiscal measures CPD suggested that import related duty collection needed to be enhanced to achieve target and popularising online submission of tax returns. Subsidised 'insurance' programme for agricultural sector to cover natural disaster is included in their suggestions. Other recommendations include green tax, expedited implementation of power projects and the much hyped PPP. Rahman said that they had placed the pre-budget recommendations to the finance minister on April 12. He said that this year's budget would be very significant because the government is working on a five-year plan that includes short-term, mid-term and long-term projects. The CPD chief said they had only made recommendations in relation to the short term projects. Given the inflationary pressure on the economy and a lagged impact of the global recession, CPD recommended investment and stimulus packages to address the current crisis. bdnews24.co
