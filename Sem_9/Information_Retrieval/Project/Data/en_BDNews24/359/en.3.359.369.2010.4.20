<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission will deploy silent observers during the by-election in Bhola for instant information about irregularities, said an election commissioner. Commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters on Tuesday that the silent observer teams would instantly inform the EC or the returning officer concerned about any rigging or irregularities during the election in Bhola-3 on April 24. The commission will form these teams with about 36-40 of its officers. "The commission will take instant actions based on their information." If necessary they will request the presiding officers to take urgent measures, said the commissioner. Hossain said adequate number of executive and judicial magistrates and law-enforcers would be deployed to prevent any trouble and violence before and during the poll. He said 24-30 law-enforcers would be deployed at each of the 86 polling centres. "Every inch of the election area will be under close watch." The commissioner said that necessary directions had already been given. "We have also ensured video footage of any incidents." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and two other commissioners visited the poll area over the last three days. Sohul Hossain said the commission was satisfied with the overall situation in the constituency, which suggests that "the election will be free, fair and neutral." Asked about the deployment of army during the poll as demanded by the main opposition BNP, he said: "It's not required by law. There will be adequate number of law enforcers from RAB, police, armed police battalion, Ansar-VDP and coastguard." b
