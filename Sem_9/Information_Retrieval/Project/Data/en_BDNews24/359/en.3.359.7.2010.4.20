 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed for five days a High Court order that had allowed BNP leader Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin to leave the country. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Muzammel Hossain gave the order following a government petition. Additional attorney general MK Rahman represented the government while Mir Nasir acted for himself in court. The High Court on Sunday ordered the government not to bar Mir Nasir, adviser to the BNP chairperson, from going abroad. The court had also asked the government to explain why the bar should not be declared illegal. Mir Nasir was stopped at the Shahjalal Internatinal Airport on Apr 15. Officials prevented him from boarding a Saudi Airlines flight. bdne
