 Chittagong, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com  The Dock Workers' Unity Council has called a strike on Apr 27 in Chittagong port demanding the formation of Dock Workers' Management Board and re-appointment of the workers sacked during the caretaker government. On Tuesday, the council called the strike after staging a rally in front of the main gate of the port building at 10am on Tuesday. The council's demands were supported by the Dock Port Labour Workers Federation and the Chittagong city corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. Following previous demands by the federation, a committee has already started working on the issue of re-appointments - though the council, which is calling the strike, has not been included in these discussions. Chief advisor of the council and ward counselor Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that "If our demands are not met between now and April 27, workers will stop the port operations on that day." Later, on Tuesday, the council leaders met up with the shipping minister - though it has not yet called off the strike. bdne
