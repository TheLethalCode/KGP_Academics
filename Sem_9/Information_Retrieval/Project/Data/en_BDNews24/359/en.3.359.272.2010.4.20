 Dhaka, Apr 20 (dnews24.com)  Ship breakers have demanded safety certification of exporting countries for abandoned ships. This contradicts with the recent government policy that clears individual importers on the basis of self certification. Ship breaking workers, at a press conference organised by Chittagong Ship Breaking Workers' Trade Union at the National Press Club on Tuesday, said the yards at Sitakunda in Chittagong were gradually becoming riskier. They held three factors  import of vessels without license and neutralisation, traditional waste disposal, and absence of necessary equipment and lack of training -- responsible for the growing risk. They demanded implementation of labour laws in ship breaking industry and measures to prevent accidents and ensure security of the labourers. "Ship-breaking yards are turning into death traps for the workers," said forum convener Tapan Datta while addressing the conference. He said unskilled workers are being employed at the yards for the last three years "and most of the accidents occur due to ignorance of the workers and recklessness of the owners." Tapan said around one lakh labourers were working at 70 ship yards across the country. The forum placed a 12-point demand for making the industry environment- and labour-friendly. The demands include ensuring workers' representation in ship breaking guideline preparation process, ensuring opportunities of education, treatment, recreation for the workers and setting up a workers' welfare centre. They also include issuing appointment letter to the workers, Tk 5 lakh as compensation for workplace deaths, development of infrastructure for preventing accidents, creating awareness and specialised safety equipments for workers. bdne
