 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)The European Union has made a fresh grant of 1.2 million euros for the Chittagong Hill Tracts people facing food shortages due to destruction of crops by wild rat and pig. This allocation raises the EU assistance to 4.85 million euros since the rat attacks started three years ago. Earlier, the EU had granted 3.65 million euros for 1,35,000 poor people facing starvation. The funds will be utilised through the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department, which works with the international NGOs, specialised UN agencies and the Red Crescent, said an EU press statement issued on Tuesday. "This population, isolated and remote, has faced successive shocks over the last few years - the rodents, the loss of bamboo and the pigs - with grave humanitarian consequences" the statement quoted Milko Van Gool, the local EU mission's acting head as saying. After every 40 to 50 years, the history of the region shows, the wild rats eating bamboo shoots increase its population at faster rates. The wild rats eat out the crops leaving the indigenous people in severe food crises. The local communities usually depend on bamboo sales. The eaten bamboo takes five years to regenerate, according to the people working in the area. "Although the rats are declining in numbers, crops are now being destroyed by an increased number of wild pigs in the forests," said the statement
