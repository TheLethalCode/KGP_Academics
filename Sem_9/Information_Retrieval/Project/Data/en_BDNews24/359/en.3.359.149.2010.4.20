 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com)The government is going to sign a deal with a British company to add 250 megawatts electricity to the national grid by the next three months through two rental power plants. According to the deal, UK-based Aggreko will provide the electricity by August from two plants in Khulna and Ghorashal. An initial contract was signed on Tuesday between Agrekko Asia managing director Debajit Das and Power Development Board secretary Azizul Islam at the power ministry. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the signing that Aggreko will provide 100MW of electricity by late June this year and the rest by mid-August. The final contract, however, will be signed after the nod from the cabinet committee on purchase. Finance minister AMA Muhith and prime minister's adviser on power Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury were also present at the signing ceremony along with state minister for power Enamul Haque. Agrekko was picked directly by a high-level committee headed by the power secretary for generating power, bypassing the regular public procurement rules. The committee was formed earlier this month by prime minister Sheikh Hasina and comprises representatives from the Power Development Board, National Board of Revenue, law ministry, power ministry and the Prime Minister's Office. A power ministry official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that public procurement rules will not be effective for any power sector project in the future. He added that the two power plants would go into production by the next two months. "Of them, the Khulna power plant would start within June 22 and the Ghorashal power plant would start on July 28." On Tuesday, the government has also approved three power projects. A meeting of the Executive Committee for the National Economic Council, chaired by the prime minister, gave the green light to the power plants which would altogether generate 450MW. Tk 879 crore has been approved for a 150 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant in Sylhet and Tk 1201 crore were approved for a 150 MW Combined Cycle Power Station in Chandpur. Another Tk 40 crore was given for construction of Liquid Fuel System for the 150 MW Sirajganj Peaking Power Plant.
