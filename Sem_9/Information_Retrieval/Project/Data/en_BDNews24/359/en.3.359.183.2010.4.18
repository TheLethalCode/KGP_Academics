<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)Chief Whip Abdus Shahid has said the ruling Awami League will hold debates in parliament on three of the five deals which the government earlier this year signed with India. The three agreements, all signed during the prime minister's Delhi trip in January, relate to with issues regarding joint cooperation on criminal justice issues. One concerns mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, another with transfer of sentenced persons between the two countries and a third one on combating international terrorism, organised crime and illicit drug trafficking. The main opposition BNP has for some time been demanding parliamentary discussion on the agreements but the speaker had not chosen any of the party's notices for discussion in the just-concluded 4th session of parliament. The BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami have claimed that the agreements only secured Indian interests in helping New Delhi deal with its own separatist movements. The government has rejected the claim. "We will discuss in parliament's next session the three deals signed with India, but we don't know whether the opposition BNP will take part in them," Shahid told a discussion meeting organised by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association of Bangladesh (DCAB) and five NGOs relating to the upcoming SAARC summit in Bhutan. "The Leader of the House and prime minister had already given her consent," said Shahid The chief whip said the Business Advisory Committee, the authorized body for setting duration of parliament sessions, had agreed that any issue could be discussed with the consent of the treasury and the opposition benches. The opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque responded by telling bdnews24.com that he did not believe that such a discussion would actually take place. "You cannot believe what the Awami League says. The treasury bench has several times broken its promises," Farroque told bdnews24.com on Sunday over the telephone from Khulna. "They rejected all of our notices on this issue. Should I now believe that they will hold a discussion on these agreements?" he questioned. He said that the government should first ensure water, gas and electricity before thinking about these matters. The other two agreements between the two countries involved a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the power sector and cultural exchange programmes
