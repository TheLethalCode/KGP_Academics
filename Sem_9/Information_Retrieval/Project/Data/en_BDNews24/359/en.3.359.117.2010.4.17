<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The country's apex business association demanded that the lowest income slab for tax be raised from Tk 1.65 lakh per year to Tk 2 lakh. FBCCI's pre-budget discussion on Saturday stressed on the different aspects of revenue collection quite in line with the keynote paper presented. The discussion saw a number of suggestions from the speakers regarding reform of income tax slab, corporate tax, widening the tax net and reforms in VAT collection. Annisul Huq, president of the apex business federation (FBCCI), opened the discussion with the trade body's recommendations. The FBCCI recommended restructuring the income tax slabs and suggested that people with a yearly income lower than Tk 2 lakh should be exempted. Huq said that the FBCCI was opposed to the current income tax slabs and proposed raising the upper limit of each slab. While he was naturally supported by the other businessmen during the open discussion, former caretaker government adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam disagreed. Azizul Islam said that the income tax exemption slab should be fixed in line with the national per capita income. Compared to that of India, the exemption limit should be Tk 1.25 lakh in Bangladesh, said Mirza Aziz. "And even if it is raised, it must not be over Tk 1.75 lakh." FBCCI also suggested a cut in corporate tax as it was "the highest among the world" and said that lowering it would raise revenue collection. In his presentation, Annisul Huq proposed 25 percent tax for listed companies while 30 percent for non-listed ones and 40 percent for banks, financial institutions and mobile phone operators. Mirza Aziz agreed with Huq on the issue saying that he was in favour of a cut in corporate tax as it was "high". "However, it should be reduced gradually." He proposed a reduction between 2 and 2.5 percent for the next year. The former finance adviser, however, was sceptical on the issue of banks and financial institutions. "The spread is still too high. Whenever, the lending rate is lowered the banks also slash their deposit rates," he said indicating that banks retained the considerable margin of profit. He said that banks should have their taxes lowered if they continued to retain that profit margin. Finance minister AMA Muhith, agreed with his predecessor on banks and financial institutions, but from a different perspective. "True it is high but then again their gains from the stock market are not taxed either." He called for views on imposing tax of capital gains from the stock market, a provision which the government is considering for inclusion in the next budget. On overall corporate taxes, Muhith felt that they were "not that high". The trade body also asked restructuring of import duties to favour local industries. FBCCI recommendations mainly include measures that would protect local industries from foreign competition and foster further industrialisation. Huq said that a reduction in import duties and raw materials would foster the growth of domestic industries along with higher duties on imports of finished goods. On this issue, Mirza Aziz said that he felt the import structure should be somewhat revised. "The current structure is aligned with the one formulated during the early '90s when we were in the spirit of trade liberalisation," he added. Finance minister AMA Muhith, however, did not make any comments on income tax and import tariffs saying it was "tough to comment at this moment". "Our aim, however, is liberalisation and everything would be considered accordingly." Measures to widen the tax net, simplification of income tax procedures, VAT reforms and setting up a National Tax Tribunal also came up in FBCCI's recommendations. Responding to the issues, Muhith promised that the tax tribunal would be formed within this fiscal. He also said that reforms in VAT and duty would be completed by the next fiscal. "There will be no Income Tax Ordinance in the next fiscal," added Muhith indicating that a full-fledged law would be formulated. On simplification of income tax return, Muhith said the current four-page income tax return form might be reduced to two pages to make it easier for people to file income taxes. The FBCCI discussion also stressed power and energy issue along with the necessity of increased focus on railway and waterway development, and population control measures. It also insisted urgent measures to ease the traffic congestion of Dhaka. Annisul Huq said in his presentation that traffic jam caused a loss of $1.84 million every day. "Annually it stands to about $670 million per year
