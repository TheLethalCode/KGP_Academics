 Chittagong, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong University bus that carries teachers was set ablaze near the port city's Sholoshahar area on Tuesday, the fourth day of the indefinite strike called by pro-Awami League students. Mohammed Halim, sub-inspector of Panchlaish Police Station, told bdnews24.com some eight to ten youths set fire to the empty bus at around 7am and fled the scene. No-one was injured in the incident, he said. No shuttle trains ran to the university. University proctor Md Jashimuddin said classes were held only in a few departments as the number of students was very low. Bangladesh Chhatra League activists enforced the indefinite strike on the campus after the death of a co-activist in violence with local youths on Apr 15. Another private bus bound for the university was torched on Sunday. Three university students have been killed over the last three months.
