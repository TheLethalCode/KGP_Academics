 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner has warned that voting in Bhola will be suspended at any centre where there are any reports of election day irregularities. ATM Shamsul Huda, who is currently in the constituency, said that 36 centres had been suspended during the upazila polls last year. He said nobody except the local residents and authorised election-related personnel would be allowed in polling centres until the day after the election. He was speaking at a meeting with district and law enforcement officials. Journalists were also present. The CEC said, "Two observers have been recruited in every union in the constituency and will start working from tomorrow. In case of any disruption they will immediately inform the election commission who will take the necessary action." He said that the election commission has no agenda. In addition to 400 observers, reporters will be present there, "So nobody will have the opportunity to get away with any misconduct." He said that the Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidates have each been provided with five police officers for their protection. One nirbahi magistrate will accompany the candidate and everything will be video taped. Addressing the government officials he said that for seven day the government officials are working under the authority of the EC, not the government. He said that if anything goes wrong during the elections, they may be held responsible. bdnew
