<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com) -- The Pakistan Cricket Board has said the indefinite ban imposed on Mohammad Yousuf will not be reviewed, as the former captain, who announced his retirement from international cricket, has not appealed against the penalty, reports Cricinfo. "The last date to appeal against the penalties was April 16 and since Yousuf did not challenge the punishment, the ban has attained finality," PCB's legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi told AFP. Yousuf was among seven Pakistan players penalised, for various reasons, in the aftermath of a winless tour of Australia. Yousuf and Younis Khan were banned indefinitely, Shoaib Malik and Naved-ul-Hasan were banned for a year while Shahid Afridi and the Akmal brothers were fined and placed on probation for six months. Yousuf and Younis were accused of infighting and having a negative influence on the team. Yousuf is the only one among the punished players to not have appealed. Following the ban, Yousuf quit international cricket but said the decision was for the 'time now', leaving the door ajar for a possible return open. bdnews24.com/lg
