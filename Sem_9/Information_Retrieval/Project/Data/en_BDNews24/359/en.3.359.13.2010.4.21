 Mymensingh, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  Criminals beat to death a youth named Raju, 25, at RK Mission Road in Mymensingh on Tuesday. Allegedly the killing of Raju is in reprisal of the murder of Nasir, a criminal who died in a similar attack last month. Tension is prevailing at Ram Krishna Road between the two groups of criminals. Golam Sarwar, OC of Sadr Police Station said that some of the rival criminals took Nasir from his house and cut off his hands on March 11. The locals admitted Nasir in Mymensingh Mehocal College Hospital. He was then transferred to Dhaka as his situation was deteriorating. Nasir died that night. According to the case, Raju, son of neighbour Abul Kashem, called Nasir from his house over mobile phone. Raju was made one of the accused for killing Nasir. Sarwar said that some of the criminals called Raju from his house and took him to a room on Tuesday at around noon. He apparently had a quarrel with them in that room and the others beat Raju and went away in a moment of excitement. Upon Raju's cries for help, locals recovered him and admitted him to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital at around 1pm. He died at around 3.30pm. No one had been arrested till Tuesday evening. bd
