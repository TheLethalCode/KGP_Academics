 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank has doubled its assistance to Bangladesh for increased assistance to power, energy, transport and water supply. Visiting director general of ADB's South Asia Department, Sultan Hafeez Rahman, told reporters Monday that these were the sectors that needed urgent assistance. Bangladesh is facing a "triple crisis" in power, gas and water supply, he added. Rahman arrived in Dhaka on Saturday for a five-day official visit. The multilateral lending agency would be providing an assistance of US$ 3.3 billion over the next three years, according to the ADB official. "We have increased our assistance for Bangladesh by more than double." The ADB official expressed satisfaction over the government's initiatives in Padma Bridge construction. "Most of all, I am very pleased to see that the Padma Bridge is moving ahead." Dwelling on the crucial issue of power generation, Rahman stressed on the need to review the IPP (Independent Power Plant) and PPP (Public Private Partnership) approaches. "Investments in infrastructure are large by nature and these cannot be done by the government alone." The ADB is "keen to see" IPP and PPP supported by the government. "They must be streamlined quickly." Rahman said that the ADB was interested to support Bangladesh in implementing PPP. Asked whether the ADB would increase its assistance if PPP and IPP power projects take off, Rahman refrained from replying to the question directly. He said, "I think the committed amount is very significant." Meanwhile, the ADB has urged the government to expedite its proposal for railway reforms. "The proposal is awaiting a cabinet approval," AMA Muhith told reporters. He also said that the ADB emphasised reforming both direct and indirect tax regimes.
