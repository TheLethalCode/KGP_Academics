<TITLE> Controversial DRS likely to make debut in 2011 World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com) -- The controversial Decision Review System (DRS), being trialled in the five-day format by International Cricket Council in select Test series, could make its appearance in limited overs cricket from the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent, reports PTI. Broadcasters, Member Boards and technology providers involved in the recent Test series that used the DRS were all of the view that in spite of teething problems the system had been a success, the ICC's April newsletter said. According to the newsletter, it was recommended by many that the DRS be retained for all future Test series and also be considered for ODI cricket, particularly in the 2011 World Cup. The DRS, in which decisions by on-field umpires are referred to the third umpire who uses technological help to find out the correctness of these verdicts, has been declared as not fool-proof by some top current players. The ICC had conducted a two-day workshop in Dubai last month to "further explore ways to finesse the DRS," the newsletter said. It was found out that players who had asked for reviews were proved to be correct only 26 per cent of the time while in the vast majority of reviews the on-field umpire was proved correct, it said. Giving details, the newsletter stated that the application of DRS in 14 Tests from October 2009 to February 2010 saw 586 appeals and 135 requested reviews from players leading to 136 decisions being overturned -- making an upswing in the percentage of correct decisions from 91.7 to 97.5. "After 14 Test matches, we felt it was time to bring together a range of important stakeholders to discuss some of the practicalities of the DRS," said ICC general manager David Richardson. Saying that the broadcasters of these matches were crucial to the success of the system, Richardson said the all the technology suppliers "have strong views on how the processes can be refined". "We found it extremely beneficial bringing these groups together with our Member Boards, who also all have their own unique local factors to consider," he explained further. It was the general view of attendees that the application of ball tracking technology to assist with lbw decisions has been a success, the newsletter stated. But whether the batsman had edged the ball or not, in the case of thin edges, proved to be a more complex area, particularly in Test rubbers that had not used "the full suite of available technology". It was also felt at the workshop that for "all uncontested dismissals (e.g. clean bowled), the bowler's front foot should be shown immediately to the third umpire by the TV director through a separate monitor. If it's a no-ball the player should be called back". But this course of action would need careful drafting (of the Laws) to incorporate when the ball becomes 'dead', the newsletter clarified. The consensus was for the number of reviews to be retained at the current level of two per innings with suggestions to carry over reviews not used in the first innings and restrictions on when reviews can be used (can only use one after six wickets are down) to avoid time wasting and speculative reviews. A total of 17 recommendations were made at the workshop which would be passed on to the ICC Cricket Committee for consideration at its meeting in May, barring the purely practical ones that will be immediately implemented, the newsletter concl
