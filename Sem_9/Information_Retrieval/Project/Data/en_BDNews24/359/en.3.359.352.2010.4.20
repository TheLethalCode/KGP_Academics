<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina insinuated that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was involved with the BDR mutiny of 2009 in some way. Alleging that Khaleda having prior information about the bloody mutiny, Hasina questioned how the BNP chief came to know of what would happen on Feb 25. Soldiers of Bangladesh Rifles, border guards, on that day rose up in rebellion against their commanding officers, who were deputed from the army. The bloody rebellion that lasted into the next day, saw about 70 people dead, with 57 army officers executed. This included the paramilitary force's chief, a major general, and his wife. The PM called for investigations into Khaleda's activities and whereabouts for three days following the outbreak of the bloody mutiny in the BDR headquarters of Pilkhana. Referring to Khaleda, Hasina asked, "Why did she have to leave her house on a car with tinted glass?" The prime minister made those comments during a meeting with the Bangladesh Krishak League leaders at her official residence. The Krishak League delegation, led by its president Mirza Abdul Jalil and general secretary Motahar Hossain Molla, met Hasina at Ganabhaban on the founding anniversary of the organisation on Monday. The PM claimed that Khaleda was in a hideout for three days from Feb 25, 2009. The prime minister asked where Khaleda had been for those three days and how she knew what would happen. "What was on your mind?" Hasina said that the reason behind Khaleda going into hiding should be unearthed. Terming her government farmer-friendly, the prime minister claimed that the previous governments of Zia-Ershad-Khaleda did not undertake as many 'initiatives' as those of the current government. She said that the Awami League has always been supportive of the farmers. "But those same farmers are shot down when BNP is in power." bd
