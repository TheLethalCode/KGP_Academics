 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  Two persons died in different incidents in the capital on Saturday. Maania Sultana Prova, an eleventh grade student of Viqarunnisa Noon School and College, committed suicide by hanging from a fan at her room Friday afternoon. The police recovered her body at around 9pm and sent the body to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Proloy Kumar Saha, sub inspector of Sabujbag Police Station, told bdnews24.com that Maania married a boy while she was in class nine in 2007. But last year they were separated. "Maania might have committed suicide as she had been suffering from mental problems since then," the official suspected. He said she had committed suicide in the afternoon although her family only realised this at around 7pm since she locked her bedroom. In another incident, a 44 year-old man 'Sabuj' died when he tried to jump off a window of a hotel in the capital. The incident took place at Hotel Bangaraj on Secretariat Road on Saturday noon. Hotel boy Arif said that Sabuj tried to escape the scene as Detective Branch police raided the hotel at noon. He jumped on a tin-shed roof beside the hotel and was hurt. He was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where the doctor declared him dead. It is alleged that unsocial activities take place in the hotel. bdnew
