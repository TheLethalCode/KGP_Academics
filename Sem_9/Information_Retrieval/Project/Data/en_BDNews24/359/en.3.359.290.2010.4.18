 JALALABAD, Kyrgyzstan, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's interim rulers ran into fresh hostility in the restive south on Sunday after supporters of the country's deposed president laid siege to regional government headquarters. Kurmanbek Bakiyev, toppled in a violent revolt on April 7, went into exile last week after days of turmoil that threatened civil war and disrupted military flights from a crucial US air base that supports operations in nearby Afghanistan. The interim government, which has yet to be formally recognised globally, says its forces control the Central Asian nation, but the situation appeared fluid in the south, Bakiyev's tribal stronghold. Persistent uncertainly in Kyrgyzstan is a worry for the United States and Russia, both of which operate military air bases in the impoverished Muslim nation of 5.3 million. Bakiyev supporters broke into a regional government office in the southern city of Jalalabad late on Saturday and briefly seized a local television channel, witnesses said. Reuters reporters said the government building was now guarded by a group of men who identified themselves as Bakiyev loyalists. The overall situation was calm and no police or security forces appeared to be in sight. A few dozen protesters remained outside, some holding banners in support of Bakiyev's defence minister, who was arrested by the interim government last week. "We voted for Bakiyev. He is our president. I don't believe that he resigned. I want him back," said Sultan-Maksut Dubanayev, a 55-year-old resident of Jalalabad. On Saturday, a crowd hurled stones at Bolotbek Sherniyazov, the interim interior minister, after he arrived there to lead a security operation to arrest a number of Bakiyev loyalists. Any further turbulence in the south of Kyrgyzstan is particularly worrisome since the region lies at the heart of Central Asia's most flammable corner where hundreds died in the 1990s in ethnic clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz. Hawks in the new administration have called for the U.S. base to be shut, accusing the United States of ignoring corruption and abuses under Bakiyev in order to keep the base. For now, interim chief Roza Otunbayeva says the government would abide by its U.S. base agreements and allow the lease to be extended automatically for another year this summer. There were conflicting reports about Bakiyev's whereabouts. Kazakh officials said he was in the Kazakh city of Taraz but some media reported that he had moved on from there elsewhere. The new government says it allowed Bakiyev to escape in order to avoid civil war, saying that Bakiyev had sent a formal letter of resignation shortly after fleeing. His close family member told Reuters in the clan village of Teyyit that the letter, which was shown to reporters on Friday, was a fake and that Bakiyev had never intended to resign. The interim government says Bakiyev had wired $200 million (130 million pounds) out of the country through local banks as he fled the capital and says he must be brought to justice. Bakiyev and brother are accused of ordering troops to open fire on protesters after anti-Bakiyev demonstrations exploded into a night of gunfire on April 7. At least 84 people di
