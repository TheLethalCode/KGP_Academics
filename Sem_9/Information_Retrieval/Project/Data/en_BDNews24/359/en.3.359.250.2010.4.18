 Pabna, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  Another activist of the extremist outfit 'Janajuddho' was allegedly killed by a rival group in Pabna, police said on Sunday. This is the second such death within two days that the police have claimed to be a 'consequence of rivalry'. The victim was identified as Abdus Sabur Khan, 35. On Apr 17, Shahidul Islam, also a 'Janojuddho' member, was found dead in Pabna. Ataikula police chief Sirajul Islam Chowdhury said some cadres of another banned extremist group 'Lal Pataka' on Saturday strangled Sabur and left the body on the street in Falia Lakkhipur village under Ataikula. Both the groups are rivals of Purbo Banglar Communist Party. Police on Sunday morning recovered the body and sent it to Pabna General Hospital for autopsy. Pabna police super AKM Mosharraf Hossain said the dead was a terrorist and a local leader of Janajuddho. He has at least 18 cases, including nine for murder, against him. A case has been filed with the Ataikula police. However, no one was arrested, said the police official. bdnews24
