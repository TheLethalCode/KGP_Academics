 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  Delayed execution of two power projects has led to a tripling of expenditures. An ECNEC meeting (executive committee of the national economic council) on Tuesday approved the two combined cycle power projects generating 150MW each  one in Sylhet at Tk 879 crore and another in Chandpur for Tk 1201 crore. Planning secretary Habib Ullah Majumder told reporters that the two projects were first approved in 2001. Cost was respectively Tk 342 crore and Tk 282 crore at that time. Concerning the rise in expenses, the secretary said that the government did not have enough funds for the project initially. "But costs have increased now." The two projects, financed by the government, are expected to be completed by 2012. The cabinet purchase committee has already given green light to two Chinese companies. Shanghai Electric Group Company Ltd has been approved for the Sylhet power plant project while Chengba Engineering Company Ltd was approved for Chandpur. The ECNEC also approved a Tk 40-crore project for a dual fuel system in Sirajganj power plant which is still under construction.
