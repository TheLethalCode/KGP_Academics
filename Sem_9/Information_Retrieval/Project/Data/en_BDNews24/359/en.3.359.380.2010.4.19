 JALALABAD, Kyrgyzstan, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supporters of Kyrgyzstan's toppled president put up fresh resistance against the country's new rulers on Monday, gathering hundreds in the south to rally against the self-proclaimed government. Kurmanbek Bakiyev was toppled in a violent revolt on April 7 and went into exile after days of turmoil that disrupted flights from a US air base supporting operations in Afghanistan. The interim government, which came to power after Bakiyev's overthrow, says its forces now control the entire nation, but a surge of unrest in the south -- Bakiyev's tribal stronghold -- has threatened its authority. Trying to consolidate, the new government unveiled a reform plan on Monday including shifting powers from the president to parliament and holding free parliamentary and presidential elections in late September or early October. But in the southern city of Jalalabad, Bakiyev loyalists seized a regional government office over the weekend and about 1,500 supporters rallied in the city square on Monday morning. "Bakiyev is our legitimate president!" shouted the crowd, some holding banners reading "The opposition spilt blood to grab power." Others gave out leaflets calling for Bakiyev's comeback. A Reuters reporter in Jalalabad said there were no police and Bakiyev supporters walked in and out of the government building freely, but the overall mood was peaceful. In a suburb of the capital Bishkek, around 1,000 men armed with sticks faced off with police, who cordoned off the area. A police official said three police vehicles had been torched. The incident appeared to be motivated by a land dispute in the post-uprising turbulence, rather than political resistance. US, RUSSIAN BASES The new government, led by ex-foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva but yet to be formally recognised globally, says it allowed Bakiyev to escape in order to avoid civil war and would not use force to intervene in the south. Unrest in Kyrgyzstan is a worry for the United States and Russia, both of which operate military air bases in the impoverished former Soviet republic. Turbulence in the south, Central Asia's most flammable region straddling the densely populated Ferghana valley, is particularly alarming in a country with a south-north divide where hundreds died in ethnic clashes in the 1990s. At least 84 people died when protests against Bakiyev's five-year rule erupted into a night of violence on April 7. Bakiyev fled the capital and tried to muster support against the opposition in the south but eventually fled to Kazakhstan. His exact whereabouts are now unclear. The interim government has cracked down on his allies, issuing arrest warrants for officials it says were involved in murders and corrupt deals under Bakiyev. It also says Bakiyev transferred $200 million (131 million pounds) of state money out of the country on April 7, a big sum for the country's $4.7 billion economy. Bakiyev's brother Zhanybek, accused of ordering troops to fire on protesters, is still at large. The events have thrown the fate of the US air base into question. Hawks in the new administration have called for the US base to be shut, accusing the United States of ignoring corruption and abuses under Bakiyev in order to keep the base. For now, Otunbayeva says the government would abide by its US base agreements and allow the lease to be extended automatically for another year this sum
