 NEW DELHI, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Indians backed by opposition parties denounced steep price rises in one of the biggest marches in years in the capital, demanding the ruling Congress-led government quit over food inflation. The demonstration underscored how inflation was stoking public anger against the government and revitalising the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a year after it lost the general election against Congress. Vehicles crawled on roads in central parts of the capital as protesters bussed in from various states by the BJP walked with saffron flags past festoons, posters and banners. The BJP sees rising prices of grains, sugar and lentils as denting Congress's fortunes before eight state elections this year and next. "I have always voted for the Congress party, but I am very disappointed at the way they have handled price rises. They have left us nowhere, I do not know how I will support my family," said Mohan Singh, a farmer taking part in the protests. The Congress's core voters are largely in poor, rural and agrarian India and a shift in loyalties could hurt its fortunes. Most credit the Congress victory in federal elections in 2009 to welfare schemes aimed at those segments. But the government has so far focused on keeping fast economic growth on track rather than clamping down on inflation, despite political opposition. The opposition has demanded a special vote in parliament to force Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government to resign over an unpopular hike in fuel prices that has helped push wholesale inflation to 9.9 percent, the highest since October 2008. The demand has not yet been accepted by the parliament office, but any vote would be before April 29, when the government's budget is put up for approval. Earlier in the day, BJP lawmakers walked out of parliament in protest, shouting slogans against what they said was the government's inefficiency in controlling prices. The rally is a test of strength for Nitin Gadkari, a relative political unknown picked to head the BJP last year, and a chance to gain the support of voters who abandoned the party over its perceived bias towards development of cities. Policymakers and government advisers have said inflation has peaked and would begin declining as a bountiful summer harvest and a good monsoon improves the prospects of food sup
