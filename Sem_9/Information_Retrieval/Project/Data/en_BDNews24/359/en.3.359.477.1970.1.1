 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The wildlife conservation law will be amended with the provision of life term imprisonment and fines of up to Tk 3 lakh for poaching and killing of wild animal. The move to amend the three-decade old law is seen as an attempt by the government to convey a stern signal to poachers that it is determined to prevent the possible extinction of wild animals from illegal poaching and killing. The forest department has just sent the draft of the Wildlife Conservation (Amendment) Act 2010 to the ministry of forest and environment for approval by the cabinet. Forest and environment ministry joint secretary Joynal Abedin Talukder told bdnews24.com that the draft of the amendment is nearing completion. "We'll send it to the cabinet after a review." The proposed law prohibits poaching, catching, killing and trading of wild animals. However, there will be some exceptions, including the provision for killing of nine vermin species, like crow, raven, rodent and bat, which are harmful to crops. It has also provision for rearing some species. These exceptions will be made with recommendations from the Wildlife Advisory Board. The amendment provides for a fine of Tk 25,000 to Tk 3 lakh, and imprisonment from two years to a life term for those convicted. The existing law only allows fines of between Tk 5,000 to Tk 20,000 and terms of imprisonment between six months to two years. The proposed law lists 14 species of frog, 108 species of mammal, 578 species of birds and 96 species of reptile as wildlife. Until 1973, there was no law enacted for wildlife conservation, with the Forest Act 1927 being in force. The Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation) Ordinance took effect from July 17 the same year. In 1980, reserved forest initiatives, such as development of national forest, wildlife sanctuary and game reserve, was announced to facilitate safe breeding of wild animals' research. Since then, 245,813 hectares of forest land have been brought under reserved forest. Conservator Tapan Kumar Dey of the forest department told bdnews24.com that a section of people, ignorant of wildlife law and the impact of killing of wild animals, are indiscriminately killing them for money. "Many wildlife species have been extinct and many are threatened due to such poaching," he said. According to environmentalists, many species, including rhinos, wild buffalo, borosinga, neelgai and wild goat, have already been extinct. IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red Data Book 2008 identified eight species of amphibious animal, 58 species of reptile, 41 species of birds and 40 species of mammals as endangered. Environment activists called for proper implementation of the existing law and making it time-befitting. Prof Anwarul Islam, chief executive of Wildlife Trust, who is also a member the government's Wildlife Advisory Board, told bdnews24.com: "The existing law doesn't match the present socio-economic condition nor reflect international convention and protocols on wildlife conservation. It doesn't provide for enough punishment for offences relating to wildlife." He said the secretariat of CITES (Conservation on International Trade of Endangered Species), to which Bangladesh is a signatory, requested the government to update the existing law in conformity with the international instrument. Prof Islam hoped that the new law would play an important role in conserving the wildlife and biodiversity. "But the government's sincerity and mass awareness about the law will be needed for its proper enforcement," he said. bdnew
