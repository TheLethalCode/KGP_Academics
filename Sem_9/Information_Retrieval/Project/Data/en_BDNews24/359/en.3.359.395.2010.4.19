 Netrakona, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)Thousands of people from Kalmakanda upazila are repairing six embankments voluntarily to save their crop from the rising waters. They have taken it upon themselves to do to the work in order to prevent water flowing into the flood plains as river levels continue to rise. Reconstruction of the dykes was underway on an emergency basis with the help of the local Water Development Board, locals said Monday. They said several thousand hectares of paddy have been under threat due to the increasing water around Moushaura, Ranga Motiur, Hugla, Kormoshi, Morondigha, Meda and Jangia haors (flood plains that become dry in winter and are submerged in the monsoon). Men and women of ten villages were cutting mud to construct dykes in Noubonder Bandh, Baluaghat, Kaowarkhali Khal, Katakhali, Ghoramara Khal and Hoirakhali. Hazi Abdul Motalib, Shahid Mia and Fazlur Rahman of Korlapur village said the WDB was providing empty sacks, bamboo, dried rice and sugar for the volunteers. bdne
