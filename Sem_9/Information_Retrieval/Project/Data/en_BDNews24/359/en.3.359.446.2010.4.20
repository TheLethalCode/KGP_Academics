 MELBOURNE, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bomb blasts that wounded 14 people outside a cricket venue in Bangalore were not surprising and reflected poorly on India's capacity to co-host the 2011 World Cup, according to players' union head Tim May. "Obviously we were disappointed, but to a certain degree not surprised that there was an incident during the Indian Premier League," May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA), told Reuters on Tuesday.

May said despite assurances, players had reported a number of security lapses during the Twenty20 tournament, including being exposed to attacks while being bogged down in traffic. "It also disappointed us today that the players in their (Bangalore) team bus were put in a situation where they had to travel over one hour and 15 minutes without any security personnel as laid down by the security arrangements," he said.
