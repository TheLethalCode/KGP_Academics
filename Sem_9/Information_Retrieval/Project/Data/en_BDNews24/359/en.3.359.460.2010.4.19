<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is thinking of not deploying the army at all as a long term plan. The chief election commissioner (CEC) said Monday that the commission might choose not to deploy the army even in national elections. "Let alone by-elections." Citing the electoral law reforms, CEC Shamsul Huda said army deployment might not be needed in future if the political parties cooperate. Huda made this statement to reporters on Monday while leaving for Bhola-3 constituency where a by-election is scheduled on Apr 24. Regarding army deployment in Bhola, he said that there was no record of deploying the army in any by-polls. "We don't feel it's needed here either." He said it was not such a good practice to deploy the military for every little thing, said Huda. "It would be good if army deployment is reduced. They have their own jobs." The CEC said that elections could be conducted with the help of law enforcing agencies. The opposition BNP has been repeatedly demanding army deployment in Bhola where there is a by-election scheduled on Apr 24. The BNP's has suggested numerous times that the elections would not be fair without army deployment. He said that the current law and order scenario of the Bhola-3 constituency was satisfactory. But, Huda also admitted that some untoward occurrences had taken place. "Orders have been given to arrest the miscreants." Huda said that the agencies were working in the same way as they do in other places of the country. "There are 200 RAB members deployed in the two upazilas of Lalmohan and Tozumuddin. Check-posts have also been set up at many points," he added. Problems increase when candidates are given much time, said Huda. "So I am in favour of allowing seven days for publicity." He said initiatives would be taken based on discussions with other election commissioners. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday said her party would launch a strong movement against the Election Commission if the Bhola elections were unfair. Replying to the comment, Huda said, "She is a major political leader. Its her prerogative to make such announcements." bdn
