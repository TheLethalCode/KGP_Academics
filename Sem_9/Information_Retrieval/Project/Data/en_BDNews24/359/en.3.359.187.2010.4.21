<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka University professor proposed to draw up a list of people who harass women. At a joint meeting, attended by education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, academicians, citizens and government officials, on Tuesday agreed that this issue must be addressed. Professor Akhteruzzaman, a teacher of DU Islamic studies and culture, said that the lists could be drawn up by local level committees in each area. Nahid agreed that it was indeed possible. He said that harassment of students will not be tolerated. "These offenders will be resisted collectively." The minister urged everyone to help identify these people and bring them to justice. The meeting was organised to devise means to stop women's harassment. The media has recently been giving such incidents much publicity. Many women, including some school children, have committed suicide after failing to tolerate such harassment. "New laws will be formulated, if necessary," Nahid said. The education minister stressed on raising public awareness to create safe environment for free women's movement. Moreover, steps will be taken so that teachers can make their pupils more aware. Serajul Islam Chowdhury proposed to include women's security in political manifestos. Mehtab Khanam, a professor of psychology from DU, asked for measures so that troublemakers could be transformed into 'good people'. "These initiatives could possibly be started from the families and spread into the society," she observed. Mehtab indicated that 'co-education' should be popularised and 'sexual education' in the regular curriculum could bring about good results. DU vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique proposed to include 'inter-personal relationship' in the curricula at all levels. "It would help build easy relationship between men and women," he added. Abdullah Al Mamun, assistant inspector general of police said that in many cases the accused gets out because of a lack of appropriate legal regime. He said further, that whatever laws existed in this concern, are riddled with loopholes that can be exploited by the offenders to get away scot-free. Education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, former advisor Rasheda K Chowdhury, Dhaka Education Board chairman Fahima Akhter, Karmojibi Nari president Shirin Akhter, advocate Salma Ali, additional secretary of the women and children affairs ministry Golam Kibria also spoke at the meeting. bdnews
