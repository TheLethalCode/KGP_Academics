 Cox's Bazar, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  38 members of Pakua upazila Awami League in Cox's Bazar including the acting president resigned on Saturday. The mass resignation was triggered by 'no confidence' on the unit's president. Among those who resigned are three vice presidents, two joint secretaries, 11 secretaries and 22 members. They resigned to protest the reinstatement of Sadequr Rahman Waresi, the suspended president of Pakua upazila Awami League. District AL acting president Ahmed Hossain told journalists that he had got a few resignation letters. Decisions would be taken in the next meeting of the district AL. Baktier Uddin Chowdhury, the acting president, told journalists that Sadequr was expelled on Mar 5, 2009 on charges of anti organisational activities, insulting the leaders and activists and assisting the opposition party's candidate in the previous general election. But the district AL reinstated him as the president of the upazila committee, he added. Moreover, the disgruntled leaders claimed that Sadequr's father, AHM Sayedur Rahman Waresi, a Muslim League leader, had opposed the Liberation War in 1971. bdnews24.
