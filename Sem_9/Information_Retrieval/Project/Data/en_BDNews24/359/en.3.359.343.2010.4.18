 Khulna, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has said her party will launch a strong movement if the Bhola by-election is not held fairly. "Our candidate will win by a huge margin if it is held in a free and fair manner." During her address at Shibbari intersection in Khulna, Khaleda said that the BNP will launch a movement against the Election Commission if the voters are barred from polling centres. "The commission will not be given any leeway anymore. Khaleda also termed the Awami League's Bhola candidate, Nurunnabi Chowdhury, a 'miscreant'. The by elections at Bhola-3 constituency will be held on Apr 24. Maj (retd) Hafizuddin is the candidate for BNP. She demanded that the government contain prices of essentials, and put an end to power, gas and water crises. Khaleda also visited the Khulna Medical College to see the injured, who had met with an accident on their way to the BNP grand rally. She also announced a condolence programme for the 11 who died in the accident. The former premier said the Fakhruddin-Moeen Uddin government left the country in a distressed situation because of their plunder. "They took the country backwards. The current government has come to power with their help and is following the same trend." Alluding to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the BNP chief said, "Everyone from the 'number one' are busy with corruption." Charging the government of massive corruption, Khaleda said, "False cases are being filed against us." Referring to the ruling party she said, "You have told us to learn and so we have." She said that the BNP will file cases against Awami League's corruption when it goes to power. "Then it will be you, walking up and down the balconies of courts day and night." Khulna is the second in line of six rallies that BNP has planned in divisions to infuse dynamism into the party's ranks. The series of six kicked off with a large rally at Laldighi Maidan of Chittagong on Mar 29. Khaleda Zia alleged that the ruling Awami League sues people whenever they talk about corruption. Referring to a few instances, she alleged that the ruling government was persecuting critical voices. The former prime minister claimed that AL was appointing partisan people in the courts. "The government is running the courts in a similar fashion as that of Moeen Uddin and Fakhruddin. The administration doesn't let the higher court give proper verdicts." She said the attorney general threatens the judges, "So they can't give appropriate decision." But, the opposition leader did not give any example regarding such threats. She claimed there had been three attempts on former energy advisor Mahmudur Rahman's life. Khaleda said that he used to speak against AL at the roundtables, newspapers and television discussions. Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud was another subject of government ire, she claimed. A false case had been field against New Age editor Nurul Kabir as he spoke against the government in a television talk show, she said. Khaleda said that her party's chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque has had a number of cases filed against him because he spoke of the government's corruption. She said the government had not kept its pledges to the people and was busy with implementing conditions imposed by foreigners. Khaleda termed the recent treaties with India as 'against the spirit of independence and sovereignty' and declared that they would barred from being implemented. "Mongla port will not be given to anyone. The country must not be run by renting out parts of it," she added. Khaleda also claimed that some 1500MW had been added during the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government. She claimed that the BNP government had also sanctioned funds for nine power plants, and completed the tender procedures for eight more, which could add around 2500MW. "But the following caretaker regime stopped the process." Khaleda followed up her claim by alleging that the current government had not been able to add even one megawatt of power. The local BNP made elaborate preparations to greet the chief, with more than 50 gates in the city. The rally featured use of three hundred megaphones, drinking water facilities, medical camps and ambulances. Traffic movement was also halted for the rally. The party also installed 12 large screens around the main stage so that the teeming BNP supporters could watch their leaders. Video footage of Hasina's election pledges was also telecast at the beginning of the rally. Khaleda claimed that prices of all necessary items had increased during the current government's tenure. "The prices are nothing close what the people may afford." She taunted the Awami League, referring to its much hyped pledge of ensuring 'Tk 10 per kg of rice, free fertiliser and one job for every household. "They are still a far cry." Criticising the commerce minister, she alleged that one of his relatives was given the contract to import lentils at a higher price. Khaleda also criticised the role of prime minister during the BDR mutiny, assault on minorities and border killings. Harassment by Chhatra League activists in different educational institutions including Badrunnesa College, Eden College, Mymensingh Anandamohan College also came up in her hour-long address. bdnew
