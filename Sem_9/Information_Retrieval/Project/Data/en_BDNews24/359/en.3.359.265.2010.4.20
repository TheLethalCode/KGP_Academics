 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  Hindus of Mothbaria upazila in Pirojpur allege that some ruling party activists backed by the local MP are trying to grab their lands. Shankar Mitra, on behalf of 100 Hindu families living in Dakkhin Sonakhali village in the upazila, made the allegations at a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium on Monday. He alleged that Mujibur Rahman Sayed, an influential person in the local area - Ashrafur Rahman's father, a former central Chhatra League leader - along with his associates had been trying to grab the lands owned by the minorities. Shankar claimed that this group of people had set fire to their shops and harassed women. He specifically alleged that Sayed attacked his home on April 1 in order to grab his land and injured his brother Subhash. Shamol Chandra Haldar, another resident of the village, told the press conference that the reason behind the violence was to grab nearly 500 bighas of land owned by the families. "They're grabbing the land of anyone who is leaving for India," he added. He also alleged that two families had already left Bangladesh and many more were making preparations. "There has been no action from the local administration or the MP, Anwar Hossain," Shamol added. The speakers also alleged that the parliament member had said "it does not matter if I lose 1,000 votes"." When contacted, Anwar told the bdnews24.com: "Neither the BCL leader nor his father is involved in such matters." He alleged that the man making the allegations, Shankar was a BNP activist and that the allegations were made to create instability within the community. Anwar denied any complaint had been made to him by any of the families or Shankar. Mothbaria police chief Nurul Haque told bdnews24.com that the police were investigating one incident of violence in the village, but that no cases of arson or violence against women had been filed. bdnews24.com
