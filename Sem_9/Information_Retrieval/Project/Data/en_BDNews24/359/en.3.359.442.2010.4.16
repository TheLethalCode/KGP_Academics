 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested Islamist radical Golam Mostafa for the second time on Friday. DMP officials said that Mostafa, member of the banned Islamist political outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), was nabbed from Sylhet for trying to organise and strengthen the banned outfit secretly. Mostafa is an enlisted militant with the British government. He has a money laundering case and another under Terrorism Act filed against him in London, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said at a press briefing. Golam Mostafa has lived in England for a long time. Haque came to Bangladesh when the London police ran several drives to arrest him, said the DMP official. The alleged militant was first arrested on Dec 2, 2007 from a house in the capital's Bashundhara residential area, which is also Dhaka's diplomatic zone. A British passport, a pistol and five jihadist books were also recovered from his possession. Mostafa was sentenced to 17 years in prison in Bangladesh but managed to get bail from the High Court. The DMP commissioner said Mostafa started tidying up HuJI and became involved in different criminal acts after he got out of jail. He also tried to free other HuJI leaders including its top-ranking leader Abdus Salam who is at present behind bars. Mostafa directly participated in the war against Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Bangladesh police will request the Interpol to provide more information on the alleged militant, Haque said. The police, on Mostafa's information, have seized some jihad-related books from his father-in-law's house in the capital's Hazaribagh. bdn
