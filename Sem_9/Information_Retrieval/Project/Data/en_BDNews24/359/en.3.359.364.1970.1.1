<TITLE> "Nothing new" in June 10 budget, Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 20 (bdnews24.com) The next financial year's budget, to be given on June 10, will not contain anything new, the finance minister said on Tuesday. AMA Muhith, however, said that the 12 ministries currently outside of the Mid-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) will be brought inside the framework. The minister was speaking to reporters after a meeting with those ministries. "There will be nothing new in this budget. Instead it will review the existing components," He said that the secretaries of the non-MTBF ministries claimed that the allocation of money to their projects is poor, hampering implementation. "The main problem is, we have too many projects and that's why it's difficult for us to focus", the minister said. He said that there is no easy solution but changes should be undertaken in a "systematic way". Muhith once again admitted that the power situation has not improved much, though he was confident that the Awami League would fulfill its power generation target over the next three years. He said that he hoped that Public Private Partnership (PPP), an idea set out in last year's budget, would take off this coming year. "Not much has been done on PPP, we will review integrating PPP with the power and energy sector in the upcoming budget," he said The finance minister expressed his satisfaction over revenue collection saying that it has already fulfilled its target. "We are thinking to restructure the revenue collection process," he said
