<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)Awami League's coordinator of the Bhola by-election committee Tofail Ahmed has alleged BNP of trying to thwart the election sensing 'certain' defeat. Tofail, the AL advisory council member, also an MP from the same district of Bhola, said that BNP was out to create subversion. "We must be more alert." The senior AL leader urged party leaders and supporters not to retaliate to BNP's actions. He also said apart from a few sporadic incidents, the atmosphere at the Bhola-3 constituency was congenial ahead of the polls scheduled Apr 24. Tofail Ahmed was speaking at a press conference at the party president's political office at Dhanmondi after returning from Bhola. He also said former BNP MP Nazim Uddin Alam's motorcade attacked the AL election rally at Farashganj in Bhola in a pre-planned manner. One of the drivers of the BNP motorcade admitted the incident, he claimed. "A US embassy official phoned me to learn about the attack. This proved that the attack was pre-planned." "I wonder how the official came to know of it before me," he said. He slammed BNP leaders who questioned the neutrality and atmosphere of the constituency. "BNP has begun raising different issues sensing their defeat," he said. "Those, who have a chance of winning, do not make allegations." They are only out to create a ground for boycotting the election to save face, he added. Asked if the AL apprehended that the BNP might boycott the elections, he said that BNP itself was making such announcement. "But we do not want them to." bdnews
