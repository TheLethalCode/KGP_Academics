<TITLE> Woods to compete at Quail Hollow Championship </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tiger Woods will play his second PGA Tour event since returning to the game after a five-month break at the April 29-May 2 Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina. The disgraced American world number one made his highly anticipated comeback to the sport following a tawdry sex scandal at last week's US Masters where he tied for fourth. "I'm excited about competing," Woods said on his official website (web.tigerwoods.com) on Thursday. "It's a wonderful venue, and they always have a great field." While Woods was given a warm welcome by the fans in the tightly controlled environment at Augusta National for the Masters, he could well experience his first on-course heckling at Quail Hollow since his double life was exposed. The 14-time major winner took an indefinite break from the game at the end of last year to try to repair his marriage to his Swedish wife Elin following startling revelations about his serial philandering. Woods, the 2007 champion at Quail Hollow, will use the tournament as part of his build-up to the June 17-20 US Open, the second major of the year. Earlier this week, he confirmed his entry for the US Open which returns to Pebble Beach for the first time since 2000 when he obliterated his rivals to triumph by a record 15 strokes. "It's always been one of my favourite courses," Woods, a three-time US Open champion, said of Pebble Beach. "I can't wait to go back." If Woods follows his usual US Open build-up, he can also be expected to compete in the May 6-9 Players Championship at the PGA Tour's headquarters in Florida and the Jack Nicklaus-hosted Memorial tournament in Dublin, Ohio from June
