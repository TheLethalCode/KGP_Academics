<TITLE> EU ministers strike deal to reduce ash no-fly zone </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, April 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union reached a deal on Monday to cut the size of a no-fly zone caused by a cloud of ash from an Icelandic volcano, under pressure from frustrated airlines losing $250 million (163 million pounds) a day. Although some countries were opening airspace, officials said they expected less than a third of flights to operate in Europe on Monday, the fifth day of a flight clampdown that has stranded passengers worldwide and halted freight flights. "On a national and European level, we have decided to move step by step towards a normalisation, within the framework of strict security requirements," German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer told N24 television. An EU diplomat said earlier that there seemed to be a consensus around creating new zones with a smaller no-fly zone near to the volcano, and a wider zone where flights would be subject to safety restrictions and checks, but no ban. He said the new regime was expected to go into force at 7 am on Tuesday. The European Commission said it might approve compensation to cushion airline losses from the shutdown. "This volcano has crippled the aviation sector, firstly in Europe, and is now having worldwide implications. The scale of the economic impact (on aviation) is now greater than 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days," International Air Transport Association (IATA) head Giovanni Bisignani said. He said airlines were losing $250 million a day in revenue. "We must move away from this blanket closure and find ways to flexibly open air space, step by step," he said. Airline shares fell and European Union competition chief Joaquin Almunia said the EU Commission was considering easing stringent rules for state aid. British Airways, which says it has lost 15-20 million pounds a day in passenger and freight revenue, said it had asked the EU and national governments for compensation. Millions of passengers have been stranded or had their travel disrupted. "We can't fly because of the volcano, so they dropped us off at Rome, and now we're trying to get up north but it's chaotic," said Mark, a Briton stuck at Rome's central station, trying to make his way back to Duesseldorf in Germany. FLIGHTS DOWN 70 PERCENT The European aviation control agency Eurocontrol said on Monday it expected between 8,000 and 9,000 flights to operate in Europe. That would represent just 30 percent of normal flight traffic, compared to earlier predictions by European Union officials that half of flights could be operating on Monday. Over the weekend only a fifth of normal flights were flown. Figures released by Eurocontrol showed 80,000 fewer flights in Europe since Thursday compared to the same period a week ago. Austria and the Czech Republic opened their airports on Monday. Some countries opened their airspace but others kept no-fly decrees in place. Italy closed its northern airspace after briefly opening it on Monday. France said it would progressively reopen airports and create an air corridor to Paris to ease the transport crisis. Businesses dependent on fast air freight felt the early impact of the disruption. Kenya's flower exporters said they were already losing up to $2 million a day. Kenya accounts for about a third of flower imports into the European Union. In export-reliant Taiwan, the island's two major international carriers, China Airlines and Eva Air, said they had cancelled a total of 14 cargo flights to four European airports since Thursday. European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the EU's economy would face serious consequences if the disruption continued for a long time. "What makes me a little bit afraid is that there is no timer on this volcano," he told Reuters. In Britain, companies reported staff had been unable to get back from Easter holidays abroad and hospitals said they were cancelling some operations because surgeons were stuck abroad. Some food suppliers were also feeling the effects. "We are running short of tuna from Indian Ocean, Victoria perch from Africa, basil from Cyprus and other fresh herbs from Israel, lobster from Canada and green asparagus from California," said Thomas Kosmidis, at Frankfurt wholesaler Venos, which supplies mainly restaurants. Britain's official weather forecaster, the Met Office, released a graphic predicting little movement of the ash plume over Europe on Monday, but saw it spreading towards the eastern seaboard of North America. "The wind flow is staying very much the same through the day. Probably for the next three or four days the wind regime is not going to change terribly much," a Met Office spokesman said. Airlines conducted test flights at the weekend without any apparent problems from the ash cloud. Dutch airline KLM, which has flown several test flights, said most European airspace was safe despite the plume of ash, and dispatched two commercial freight flights to Asia on Sunday. But engine damage was found in a NATO F-16 fighter plane, a senior U.S. official said on Monday. Volcanic ash is abrasive and can strip off aerodynamic surfaces. In the high temperatures of an engine turbine, ash can turn to molten glass and paralyse the engine. A British Airways jet lost power in all four engines after flying through an ash cloud above the Indian Ocean in 1982. Iceland's Meteorological Office said the erupting volcano appeared to be spewing more steam and less ash into the sky. "There is at least some lava bursting up from the craters and landing on the ice," geologist Hjorleifur Sveinbjornsson said. "The colour of the steam is brown but also quite white so it is more like water vaporisin
