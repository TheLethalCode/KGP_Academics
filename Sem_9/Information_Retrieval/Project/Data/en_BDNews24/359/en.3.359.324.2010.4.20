 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Marketing manager of Milk Vita, a government-controlled cooperative association, has been sacked for irregularity and incompetence. State minister for local government and cooperatives Jahangir Kabir Nanak gave the order of Bidyut Kumar Mandal's dismissal on Tuesday at a meeting organised to discuss ways to invigorate the marketing of Milk Vita products. He also ordered the Milk Vita management to identify others engaged in irregularities and corruption and take tough actions against them. The state minister expressed his dissatisfaction at the performance of Milk Vita and censured its 'dishonest' officers. "The organisation was kept crippled." He said that the dairy cooperative was used to serve political interests. "But this government doesn't want the practice to continue." Nanak asked the management to prepare a work plan in this regard and submit it to the ministry within 15 days. The state minister asked for ensuring operation of Milk Vita mineral water plant, installed at a cost of Tk 210 million during the previous four-party alliance government. He said: "The plant was set up for personal gains. Some people got commissions out of the deal.."
