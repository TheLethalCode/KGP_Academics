<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia would also be tried for war crimes. She alleged that the opposition leader had helped the Pakistani army during the Liberation War in 1971. This is the first time ever that any AL top leader has brought such an allegation against Khaleda, who is the wife of assassinated president, General Ziaur Rahman. Ziaur Rahman, a noted freedom fighter, was an integral part of Bangladesh's armed resistance and led one of the three main forces as the Liberation War culminated. The AL presidium member was speaking at a discussion on Mujibnagar Day in Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka, Saturday. She said, "Khaleda Zia was with the Pakistani army during the war and helped them" "She will be put on trial too", Sajeda added. She also said that the trial of those who were involved in crimes against humanity during the Liberation War will by held in Bangladesh and those who supported the criminals will also be prosecuted. Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, AL presidium member said that hypocrisy and conspiracy to hamper trial of the war criminals by highlighting power, gas and water crisis would not work. "99 percent of the people want the trial of war crimes." Former home minister and AL leader Mohammad Nasim said, "We all want the trial of the war criminals. Only Khaleda Zia does not want this." Nasim demanded removal of the BNP-Jamaat leaning bureaucrats in the administration. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was expected to attend as chief guest but could not join due to a sudden bout of sickness. bd
