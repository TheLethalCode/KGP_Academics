 NEW DELHI, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian authorities have begun an investigation into the financing of the Indian Premier League, the finance minister said on Monday, following allegations of corruption in the world's richest cricket tournament.

Lalu Prasad, a former railways minister, said in parliament that IPL members 'get money from Swiss banks and make it white money here', while a Communist lawmaker said players were being bought 'like vegetables'. Broadcasting rights to the Twenty20 tournament were sold for $1 billion for 10 years in 2008.
