 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has warned the two candidates running in the Bhola by-election to follow the electoral code of conduct during the campaign. The warning letter was faxed to the Bhola returning officer on Monday who will forward it to the election coordinators of both candidates, EC officials said. The commission on Sunday decided to send letters to both the Awami League candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon and BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed following an inquiry report on clashes in Lalmohan upazila that took place last week. The report found that supporters of both BNP and AL candidates clashed during an unscheduled campaign meeting on Apr 15 conducted by Nazimuddin Alam, the election coordinator for the BNP's candidate. The EC said that the incident was a violation of the electoral code of conduct. According to the electoral law, a candidate can be removed from the election for breaching the code of conduct. b
