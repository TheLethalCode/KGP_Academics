 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  Pro-BNP and Pro-Jamaat-e-Islami lawyers have demanded a provision for a regular appeal in the war crimes trial. Otherwise, they suggested, the law would not ensure justice to those accused, at a seminar in Dhaka on Friday. However, according to Section 21 of the Amendment to the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act, a party has the right to appeal to the Appellate Division against a sentence, conviction or acquittal within 60 days of the ruling. The National Forum for Protection of Human Rights (NFPHR) headed by former speaker and BNP leader, Jamiruddin Sircar, hosted the seminar. Speaking as chief guest, justice TH Khan said, "There is nothing 'international' in the Act, though it has the word in the title." Urging the government to amend the law, he said, "Holding trial through formation of tribunal will not do. There should be a scope for appeal too." In his speech justice Abdur Rouf urged on the importance of fairness of the trial. Referring to the tribunal judges he said that the process and sentences should be such that the judges themselves not be guilty of being partial to a certain party. The speakers apprehended that many innocent people might be subject to harassment through the 1973 War Crimes Act. The seminar was also addressed among others by professor Emazuddin Ahmed, Sircar, Khandaker Mahbub Hossain. The government on March announced the war crimes panel of judges, investigators and prosecutors. The investigation agency has already begun its work. bdnews24.
