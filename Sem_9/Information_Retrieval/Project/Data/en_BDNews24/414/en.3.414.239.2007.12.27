<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the killing of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto as an atrocity on Thursday and said extremists must not be allowed to kill democracy in the country. "She risked everything in her attempt to win democracy in Pakistan and she has been assassinated by cowards afraid of democracy," Brown said in a televised statement. "Benazir Bhutto may have been killed by terrorists, but the terrorists must not be allowed to kill democracy in Pakistan," he said after Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack as she left a rally in Rawalpindi before an election due on Jan. 8. "This atrocity strengthens our resolve that terrorists will not win there, here or anywhere in the world and we will work with all in the Pakistani community in Britain and elsewhere in the world so we can have a peaceful and safe and democratic Pakistan," he said. Earlier, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband voiced shock at Bhutto's assassination and called for restraint.
