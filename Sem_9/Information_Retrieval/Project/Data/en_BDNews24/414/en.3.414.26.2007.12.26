 MELBOURNE, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The wicket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground would deteriorate and make batting harder as the first test against India progressed, Australian centurion Matthew Hayden said on Wednesday. Hayden, who initially struggled after his captain Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat on a green pitch with a moist outfield, grafted 124 in Australia's 337 for nine at the end of the first day's play. The burly left-hander, who has now scored six centuries in his last seven matches at the MCG, played some streaky shots before settling down to combine with Phil Jaques for a 135-run opening partnership. "I think it's definitely going to be a wicket that will be very hard to score on over the next few days," Hayden told reporters. "There will be slow conditions and it will be challenging to score runs. "You will see us really putting the pressure on in the field and really trying to restrict India, that's the way I see it going. "I also think the match will go into the fifth day and the wicket will deteriorate and it will be very difficult to bat on during that last day." The danger of the wicket breaking up and facing a run chase on the final day had been noticed by India captain Anil Kumble, whose figures of five for 84 had dragged his side back into the match. He said it was important his vaunted batting lineup stepped up when they get the chance to bat. "The wicket is slow, but if you apply yourself then there are runs to get," said Kumble. "He (Hayden) showed that and I'm sure if our batsmen apply themselves it will happen.
