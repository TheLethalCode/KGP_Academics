<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian security forces killed three drug smugglers and seized 132 kg of narcotics in a clash in the southeastern province of Kerman, Iranian news agency (INRA) reported on Wednesday. The southeast of Iran, near Afghanistan and Pakistan, is a major smuggling route for drugs and other contraband. More than 3,300 Iranian security personnel have died in the region fighting drug traffickers since Iran's 1979 revolution. "These people, in addition to smuggling drugs, used to create fear among people," IRNA quoted a local security officer as saying about Tuesday's operation. The news agency also described them as "rebels" without elaborating. Tourists visiting southeastern Iran have been advised not to travel at night in the area.
