 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  An advisory council meeting Wednesday may decide if the artefacts already sent to France for display should be brought back immediately, cultural affairs secretary ABM Abdul Haque Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Wednesday morning. "No decision has so far been made on bringing back the relics already sent to France for display at the Guimet Museum before the exhibition begins." "The advisory council meeting [today] may decide whether the relics will be exhibited abroad or brought back immediately," the secretary said. Forty-two artefacts in 10 crates were shipped to France on Dec 1 for exhibition at the Guimet Museum in Paris. Two 7th century relicsstatues of Lord Vishnuwere found missing, while the second consignment of 145 artefacts were to be shipped out in 13 crates on Dec 22. Failing to retrieve the lost relics, the government decided Tuesday not to ship the remaining artefacts abroad, retrieving them from Air France authorities and returning them to the National Museum. A top level committee headed by the cabinet secretary was formed Tuesday to investigate and report fully on the incident within three workdays. bdnews24.co
