<TEXT>
 Touba, Senegal, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Senegal's powerful Mouride Muslim brotherhood has died at the age of 92, throwing into mourning a movement that holds huge influence and whose trade networks span the globe. The brotherhood is the biggest centre of religious, economic and political influence in the mainly Muslim country in West Africa, and counts among its followers octogenarian President Abdoulaye Wade. Caliph Serigne Saliou Mbacke died on Friday in Senegal's holiest city Touba, known to some as "little Mecca". He was buried overnight before the news was announced, as is the custom to ensure an orderly ceremony before crowds arrive. "We've lost him, we've lost everything," said Mamadou Diouf, a 32-year old mechanic who rode the 200 km (125 miles) from the capital Dakar on his moped as soon as he heard the news. Popular music star Cheikh Lo brought a late-night concert in Dakar an abrupt halt when news of Saliou's death arrived and thousands of people set out to pay their respects in Touba. Wade went early on Saturday and declared three days of national mourning until Monday, national television reported. Followers waited in long queues to visit the grave, within the grounds of the city's palatial Grand Mosque. The grave was sheltered under a metal structure and covered with a carpet, flowers and portraits of other marabouts, or religious teachers. By late Saturday, some people slaughtered cows by roadsides outside the town to feed the many supporters who had come. "Serigne Saliou's calling back to God is a huge loss for me, for Senegal and for the entire Muslim community," said Senegal's Mines Minister Madicke Niang, himself a "talibe" or disciple. Saliou was the last surviving son of Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba, who founded the Sufi Islamic brotherhood in 1883. Supporters praise Saliou for promoting education in daaras, or Koranic schools, and building up the city of Touba. Mouride followers said Bamba's eldest grandson, Serigne Bara Falilou Mbacke, would become the movement's sixth caliph. GLOBAL NETWORK Bamba's doctrine of hard work as a route to paradise and unique brand of moderate Sufi Islam helped forge his followers into a global network of small traders whose donations funded the building of Touba's Grand Mosque with its lavish colonnades. Shops in the city boast the latest electronic gadgets while Mouride traders tout everything from household goods to bootleg designer gear on the streets of Paris and New York. Others run import/export businesses in Dubai and Hong Kong. From dusty villages at Bamba's birth, Touba and adjoining Mbacke have grown into Senegal's second biggest conurbation. Photographs and tributes to Saliou and other marabouts adorn many of Senegal's ubiquitous rickety, bright-painted minibuses. Touba's annual pilgrimage attracts 1 million people from around Senegal and further afield, marshalled by dreadlocked disciples called Baye Fall armed with wooden clubs and silver begging bowls to collect alms for their religious teachers. Bamba's teachings, such as "Pray as if you will die tomorrow and work as if you will live forever", induce thousands of Senegalese to work for free in the fields around Touba, sometimes for weeks on end, during the annual peanut harvest
