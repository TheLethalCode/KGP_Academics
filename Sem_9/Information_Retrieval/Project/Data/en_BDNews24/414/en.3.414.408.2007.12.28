 Savar, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The RAB retrieved Friday 12 pieces of the stolen Lord Vishnu statues from the dumping zone in Baliarpur near Dhaka-Aricha highway, a RAB officer said Friday. Swapan Kumar Biswas, acting keeper of the Bangladesh National Museum, visited the scene and confirmed to reporters that two of the pieces were parts of the Vishnu images stolen from Zia International Airport. Deputy commander Major Khairul Amin of RAB-1 said they retrieved the pieces of the rare archaeological artefacts in a long search since 10am Friday. Nine of the 12 pieces belong to one figure and together they will make a complete statue, Biswas told reporters. Three pieces belong to the other. The RAB officer said they retrieved parts of head, body, foot and fingers of the statues. Conservation chemist Shafiqul Alam rushed to the scene and examined the pieces. Shafiqul Alam said they examined the pieces and were sure that the pieces belonged of the stolen statues. RAB officer Khairul Amin said the search would be continued until the remaining pieces of the statues were retrieved. Thirteen workers of Dhaka City Corporation were helping RAB with the search. The Bangladesh and the French government had earlier signed a loan agreement to transfer rare Bangladeshi artefacts to Paris for an exhibition in Guimet Museum. The museum authorities has cancelled the exhibition of the Bangladeshi artefacts. Bangladesh sent 42 items, in a first shipment, to Paris for the exhibition scheduled for January. But the government decided not to send the second consignment following disappearance of two Vishnu statues from the airport. Their disappearance was discovered on Dec 22, as a second consignment of artefacts was handed over to Air France authorities for transport to Paris. Archaeologists, historians and cultural groups in Bangladesh however had protested the transport of the rare archaeological artefacts to France, saying the proper measures were not being taken by authorities to protect them. Bangladesh authorities and the French embassy in Dhaka were in some disagreement after two rare statues went missing. Shouldering the responsibility for the missing artefacts, cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri resigned Wednesday. bdnews24.com/cor
