District commissioner Sajjadul Hassan and army officer Lt Col Anisur Rahman launched the programme at Cox's Bazar Government Girls' High School in the morning. Hossain said data were collected about 21,000 voters until Dec 25. A total of 17 engineering construction battalions of the army will assist in the job at Cox's Bazar municipality and Sadar Upazila areas. The voter registration centres are Cox's Bazar Government High School, Cox's Bazar Government Girls' High School, Primary Training Institute, D Ward Government Primary School, Cox's Bazar Technical School and College, Tekpara Amena Khatun High School, Kosturaghat Government Primary School, Tekpara Government Primary School, Umidia Madrasa, Burmese Government Primaary School, Peshkarpara Government Primary School and Shaheed Titumir Institute. Authorities were asked to be on alert to prevent Rohingya refugees migrating from Myanmar from becoming voters. Earlier, a meeting of the coordination committee on problems about the Rohingyas was held at the conference room of the district commissioner. It formed committees in upazilas and unions to prevent the Rohingyas from enlisting as voters. The DC said the Rohingyas would not be allowed to be voters. "The Rohingyas will not be allowed to be voters at any cost.
