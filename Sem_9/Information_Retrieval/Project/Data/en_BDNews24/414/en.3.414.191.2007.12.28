 Hebron, West Bank, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least two Israeli hikers were shot dead on Friday near the West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli police and rescue services said. Micky Rosenfeld, Israeli police spokesman, described the incident as a "terrorist attack". Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service confirmed that two hikers had been killed. "The police and the army are searching the area for the attackers," Rosenfeld said. Palestinian security sources confirmed the shooting in the north Hebron hills but said it was not immediately clear what sparked the incident. Palestinian witnesses said Israeli police blocked off the main entrances into Hebron. Israel has called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to meet his obligations under a 2003 "road map" peace plan to rein in millitants in the West Bank and the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. The Palestinians say they are meeting their obligations by launching a security clampdown in the West Bank. Israel has yet to meet its own road map obligations to freeze settlement construction
