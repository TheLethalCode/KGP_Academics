 Louise Heavens SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Friday as news of the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and fears over regional political turmoil triggered a flight to less risky assets such as government bonds and gold. The news further dampened appetite for risk, which had already been hit by U.S. economic reports showing a weaker-than-forecast rise in U.S. durable goods orders and an unexpected rise in jobless claims. The combination of the weak data and the Bhutto news sent Japan's benchmark Nikkei average down 1.7 percent in a shortened final session for 2007. The index was down 11.1 percent for the year, the first annual decline in five years and on track to be the world's worst-performing major stock market in 2007. Investors fear that Bhutto's killing on Thursday at a political rally in Rawalpindi could spark instability in the region and civil unrest within Pakistan. "Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike North Korea or Iran, is known to really have nuclear weapons," Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments. "The implication for the stock market is worries about higher oil prices and a weaker dollar." U.S. light crude was up 35 cents at $96.97 a barrel by 0238 GMT, further boosted by a fall in U.S. crude supplies, while gold changed hands at around $828, having hit a one-month high of $830.05 overnight. The dollar steadied after losing ground in New York trading, where the Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.4 percent. BONDS RALLY Safe-haven government bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumping 23/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 4.19 percent. Japanese 10-year bond yields fell to 1.50 percent from 1.55 percent while the futures rose 0.51 basis points to 136.81, despite strong Japanese inflation data. Rising oil prices drove Japanese annual inflation in November to its highest level in nearly a decade, but that did little to alter market views that Japanese interest rates are stuck on hold for the next year. The dollar traded at 113.38 yen, having reached a seven-week high at 114.65 on Thursday, while the euro held most of its gains, trading at just over $1.46 to the dollar. MSCI's broadest index of shares excluding Japan was down 0.6 percent by 0330 GMT. Benchmark indexes in Australia , South Korea , Hong Kong and New Zealand fell by between 0.3-1.7 percent. EMERGING EQUITIES OUTPERFORM Global emerging equities dipped just 0.2 percent. "The assassination in Pakistan pushed up oil prices and there is a worry that mounting geopolitical risks would further boost oil prices," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. "But as Pakistan is not a country with developed financial markets and the country's connection with global credit markets is minimal, the case would have a limited and short-term impact on markets." Pakistan's five-year credit default swaps were still trading at around 480 basis points after widening by around 100 basis points (bps) overnight, with two dealers reporting almost no trades in Asian hours. The Pakistan rupee was last quoted at 61.30 against the dollar, just off a 3-year low. Indian-based American Depositary Receipts were dragged lower as Bhutto's death raised concerns about stability in South Asia.
