<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  A taskforce under the Regulatory Reforms Commission is being formed to look into how the land-related formalities could be simplified, an official said Friday. Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury would head the taskforce, which is expected to come into existence at a commission meeting on Jan 8. "We'll finalise its formation in that meeting. The taskforce will deal with land-related disputes that we have already in hand," he told bdnews24.com. "The taskforce will see how it can ease the ways for land registration, mutation, change of the ownership and the recordkeeping. "We are going to form this to ease the sufferings of the people. It will particularly focus on ways to stop changes of ownership through false document and cheating," he said. Asked if the taskforce will deal with the "vested property", Khan said his commission was not told about that yet. Immediately after assuming power the interim government took steps to reform the land administration and formed a committee under the Ministry of Land to ease the land registration system. The committee later prepared a draft of recommendations where it said a new owner would get the registration papers within a deadline. It also said under the new system many unnecessary formalities for land registration would go. Khan said the new taskforce would take all the recommendations into account to prepare the final recommendations. bdnews24.com/ahd
