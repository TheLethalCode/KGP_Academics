 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdews24.com)The verdict in a Tk 1 crore extortion case against BNP leaders Salahuddin Ahmed and Quazi Salimul Haque will be delivered on Jan 10. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Judge's Court-5 fixed the date for delivery of the verdict after hearing the closing statements by state and defence lawyers Thursday. Salahuddin, former state minister for communications, is charged with taking Tk 1 crore in bribes from contractor Mir Zahir Hossain and elder brother FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain on Febr 14, 2005. The bribe money was allegedly transacted through a bank account belonging to Salimul, who has been co-accused in the case for aiding Salahuddin in the extortion. Defence lawyer Azizur Rahman Chowdhury claimed Salahuddin Ahmed was innocent, and that the state had failed to prove the case against his client. State counsel Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told the court: "We have succeeded in proving to the court the crime of the accused persons through specific information and deposition of the witnesses." "I appeal for highest punishment for the accused." The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Salahuddin and Salimul on May 29. Charges were framed on Oct 28, and witnesses were deposed from Oct 31. In total, 26 witnesses testified for the state. Joint forces arrested Salahuddin in Gulshan on the morning of Feb 6. Salimul is on the run. Former communications minister Nazmul Huda was given a seven-year sentence on Aug 27 for taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribes from Mir Zahir Hossain. Nazmul's wife Sigma Huda got three years behind bars in the same case for aiding her husband in the crime. bdnews
