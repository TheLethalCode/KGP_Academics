<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The inspector general of police said Friday they ensured an improved law and order throughout 2007 compared with previous years. Noor Mohammad said the situation was "completely under control". "Crimes such as murder, robbery have substantially declined. After hanging six top militants of the outlawed JMB, the situation has improved to a great extent," the police chief told reporters in the city. He made the comment after attending the annual general meeting of the Bangladesh Police Cooperative Society Ltd as chief guest. In the meeting 40 percent dividend was announced for the members of the Society for fiscal year 2005-06. He, however, said their claim was not enough if people do not agree. He said they tightened security across the city after the news of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto came Thursday. Security has especially been beefed up around the diplomatic missions in Dhaka, he said. He termed the former Pakistani prime minister's killing barbaric and unjust and said plainclothes vigilance had also been upped. "Additional police have been deployed in front of every embassy and security check posts have been set up at city crossings," he said. About the welfare of the police, the IGP said they were considering setting up a Police Bank. "The matter is a top priority," he said, adding that they were planning to implement six housing projects for them at six divisional headquarters. bdnews24
