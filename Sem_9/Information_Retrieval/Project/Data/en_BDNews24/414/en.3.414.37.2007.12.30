<TITLE> EC mulls banning 'war criminals' from polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has planned to declare war criminals unfit for the polls by adding a new provision to election rules, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Sunday. "It's difficult to identify who is war criminal or who is not. But if anyone is convicted of war crimes, he won't be able to take part in the election. We may add a provision to our draft reformed law," the CEC said. The EC started dialogue with political parties on reforms to election rules on Sept 12. Most parties except for Islami Oikya Jote, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jatiya Party (Manju) asked the main election office to ban the 'war criminals and anti-liberation forces including Jamaat', from the election. The EC did not hold dialogue with the BNP because of an embargo set by the High Court. Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan told reporters Saturday that "political complications" would occur if Upazila and Zila Parishad elections take place prior to the parliamentary election. The elections to Upazila and Zila Parishad should be held simultaneously, Akbar said without explaining how. On the statements of Akbar Ali, the CEC said: "We have mentioned in our election roadmap when we will hold the elections." "We will hold elections to the four city corporations and some important municipalities in line with the roadmap. We will not change the roadmap," he said. bdnew
