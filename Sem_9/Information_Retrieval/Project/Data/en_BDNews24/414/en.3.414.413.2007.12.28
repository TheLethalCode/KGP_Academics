 Seoul, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect met the leaders of the country's top conglomerates on Friday, calling on them to increase spending next year and add more jobs to their payrolls. Lee Myung-bak, a former Hyundai construction CEO who stormed to a landslide win in a Dec. 19 election, has asked business leaders to increase capital spending by about 20 trillion won ($21.31 billion) to 30 trillion won in 2008. "I will make companies feel that it's worth investing," Lee was quoted as saying by the Federation of Korean Industries, the lobby group for the country's conglomerates. Lee has pledged to roll back regulations he feels stifle business and to make the country more attractive to foreign investors. Lee, who set up his transition team this week ahead of his inauguration in late February, met leaders including Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of the Samsung Group, Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor Group, as well as the chairmen of the LG and SK groups. The combined sales of those four conglomerates are about equal to half the country's yearly economic output. Prior to the meeting, Chung said the country's top auto maker and its affiliates would invest 11 trillion won in 2008, up by almost 60 percent from this year, Yonhap news reported. On the basis of nominal value, central bank data show capital investment rose only 1.6 percent annually on average in the first four years of President Roh Moo-hyun's single, five-year term, down from a 16.7 percent annual average rise in the preceding four years. Many divisions of the family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol have already set their investment plans. It may be difficult for them to increase spending when the key U.S. export market faces tough times due to subprime lending problems. The president-elect, who will soon end 10 years of liberal leaders in the presidential Blue House, later had his first meeting with Roh since winning the election. Details of their discussions were not immediately available. Lee has criticised Roh for bungling economic policy. Earlier this week, Roh's government approved a special counsel to look into securities fraud allegations brought by Lee's political opponents. Lee has denied any wrongdoing. ($1 = 938.4 won
