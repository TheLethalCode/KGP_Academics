 HONG KONG, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese police have forcefully detained a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester in Beijing on Thursday, as pressure mounts ahead of a key ruling by China's parliament this Sturday on Hong Kong's democratic future. Law Jou, a member of Hong Kong's radical pro-democracy group, the League of Social Democrats, was seen being wrestled to the ground by uniformed officers at Beijing's international airport, in footage carried on Hong Kong's Cable Television. Before being arrested, Law told reporters in the airport terminal that he was "surprised" to have been allowed to travel to Beijing in the first place, given a travel ban on most Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates to China. Law had planned to hand a petition to senior members of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), demanding that Hong Kong be allowed to hold fully democratic elections by 2012. The NPC Standing Committee has been meeting in Beijing this week and will make a closely watched ruling on Saturday clarifying Hong Kong's democratic future. The NPC members were deliberating a draft resolution on advancing Hong Kong's democracy "step by step and had fully considered the wishes of Hong Kong society on pushing forward constitutional development", Xinhua said in a statement. But Hong Kong media reports quoting unnamed sources have suggested that Beijing will rule out universal suffrage by 2012. The NPC ruling will be based on a constitutional development report submitted on Dec. 12 by Hong Kong's chief executive, Donald Tsang, urging Beijing to allow greater democracy. The report concluded that a majority of people in the former British colony wanted full democracy by 2012, but suggested a delay until 2017 was a more practical option, drawing fire from the pro-democracy camp. Earlier on Thursday, three other activists including maverick legislator Leung Kwok-hung were prevented by plainclothes police officers from travelling into China via the land border at Lowu.
