<TITLE> State schools embrace English summer game </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One cosily sentimental image of the English summer game has squire, vicar and blacksmith united under blue skies playing cricket on the village green. A grimmer picture emerges in a celebrated black-and-white photograph showing schoolboys in a sunless industrial city playing against stumps roughly outlined in chalk on a wall. The latter is the environment embraced by the Chance to Shine campaign, a bold campaign designed to reinvigorate cricket in English state schools. Judy Coles is head teacher at The Hague School in Bethnal Green in the heart of London's East End; once a haunt of Jack the Ripper, pounded relentlessly by German bombers during the blitz in World War Two and home to the notorious Kray twins who ruled the London underworld during the 1960s. Populated by French Huguenot silk weavers in the 18th century, its streets now reflect modern Britain's complex ethnic diversity. Coles told Reuters that 96 percent of pupils at The Hague, a short walk from Bethnal Green underground station, were of Bangladeshi origin, the result of the latest wave of immigration. "Within my school, cricket is my passion," she said "It is sort of a rite of passage isn't it? That your brother did it, your sister did it and it becomes part of the culture. "It's not to the exclusion of other sports, last year we offered 26 different sports from canoeing to climbing, the full range." PRESIDENT KING The president of Chance to Shine is Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England. Its director of operations is Wasim Khan, one of the first men born in Britain of Asian parents to play county cricket. Nick Landon, a former teacher, is the president of the Cricket Foundation, the charity behind Chance to Shine which he says is the largest grassroots initiative in a single sport in British history. "It's an educational campaign to regenerate competitive cricket in state schools. We believe massively in the power and benefits of competition, of competitive team sports and of cricket in particular," Landon said. "Our ambition is to develop life skills, development opportunities for youngsters, values and attitudes that will stand them in good stead in the workplace and in their personal lives. And our plan is over 10 years to engage a third of all of the nation's schools. It is a hugely ambitious campaign." Crucial to the Chance to Shine initiative are the links arranged between schools and local clubs with the help of the county boards. Coles said a challenge for her was to convince parents to transport their children from school three kms up the road to the local cricket club when they did not have easy access to cars. "Children get enthused and excited by cricket and going back home and trying to talk parents in taking them along to the clubs," Coles said. "Parents who had nothing to do with cricket and wouldn't have thought to send a child to a cricket club through having this contact and meeting the coach from the club and school can then be inspired to go along and join the club." INNER CITIES Wasim Khan knows from personal experience the difficulties in breaking out of a non-cricketing environment in Britain's inner cities, in his case Birmingham's Small Heath. "It's got a high unemployment rate, there's no local club," said Wasim, who played for Warwickshire, Sussex and Derbyshire before retiring at the age of 31. "A lot of youngsters start to lose their way now in the Asian community. When I was growing up, cricket was huge. It meant everything. "But as I start to look around now within the Asian community, it doesn't mean everything. Kids are off smoking, standing on corners and getting involved in crime, all of those kind of low aspirations." Coles said the programme emphasised continuity. "It's not Chance to Shine coming into your school for one year, for 12 weeks of cricket. It's the fact that they're committed for several years," she said. Wasim said 1,277 schools throughout England had been involved this year. "The one thing we wanted the schools to understand was that this was a really serious campaign. We are not only looking at pupil development but also staff development. Teacher training is a huge part of our programme. We are looking at sustainability so the programme can continue once we finally leave in a few years' time," he said. Neville Cardus, the great Manchester Guardian cricket writer and music critic, once praised W.G. Grace, the best cricketer of the 19th century, for bringing a country game to fashionable St John's Wood, the home of Lord's. To which an equally great cricket writer, the West Indian Marxist CLR James, retorted: "There they needed it least. It was to bleak Sheffield, to dusty Kennington and to grim Manchester that W.G. brought the life they had left behind." In these and other outwardly unpromising areas, Chance to Shine is successfully implementing a noble ambition
