 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)Four jail superintendents have decided to go into voluntary retirement and another four with the same rank are scheduled to retire soon, further straining the operations of prisons, a top official said Wednesday. Brig Gen Md Zakir Hasan, inspector general of prisons, said the retirements would create a further vacuum as jail authorities had long been facing a dearth of staffers. "Running the prisons has become a tough job for them since many posts, including those of prisons guards, have not been filled for long," he said. There are 69 prisons, including two special jails, in the country. Each prison should have one superintendent but there are only 22 for all, Zakir said. The superintendents who have appealed for voluntary retirement are Abdul Jabbar Biswas for Satkhira, Rafiqul Alam for Naogaon, Ruhul Amin for Narsinghdi and Zakir Hossain for Patuakhali. Another four superintendents, who will retire as scheduled, are Alauddin for Jessore, Nurul Islam for Rangpur, Abdul Qadir for Mymensingh and Akkas Ali for Chuadanga. Bimal Chandra, superintendent for Bagerhat jail, retired on Dec 20. The officials opted for voluntary retirement after the government asked them to submit wealth statements, another official said, asking not to be named. bdnew
