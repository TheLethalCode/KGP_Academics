<TITLE> Commonwealth says Benazir death `dark day for Pakistan' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Commonwealth, which suspended Pakistan over last month's emergency rule declaration, said the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Thursday was a "dark day" for Pakistan. "This is a heinous and cowardly act of violence and an utterly senseless tragedy," Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon said in a statement. "This is a dark day for Pakistan and the Commonwealth. I strongly condemn this outrageous act." The 53-nation Commonwealth suspended Pakistan's membership in November after President Pervez Musharraf failed to meet a deadline to lift emergency rule and resign as army chief. Musharraf later did hand over command of the army and lift the state of emergency. The Commonwealth promised last month to review progress in Pakistan after parliamentary elections scheduled for January. McKinnon said he hoped Benazir's assassination would show the importance of restraint and reconciliation as the only way of consolidating the democratic process in Pakistan. "The Commonwealth stands by Pakistan in that effort," he said. Benazir was killed in a gun and bomb attack as she left a pre-election rally in Rawalpindi.
