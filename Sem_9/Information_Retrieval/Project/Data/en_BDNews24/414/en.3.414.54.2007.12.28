 MELBOURNE, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Openers Wasim Jaffer and Rahul Dravid guided India to six for no wicket in their second innings as they set about chasing a mammoth 499 for victory over Australia on the third day of the first test on Friday. Jaffer was on two and Dravid three after Ricky Ponting had declared Australia's second innings closed on 351 for seven, with about 40 minutes of play remaining. Brad Hogg was 35 not out, his highest test score, while Brett Lee was 11 not out when Ponting declared. The highest total batting fourth on the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the 417 set by England in the Centenary test in 1977, chasing 463 for victory. Australia are seeking their 15th successive test victory and chasing the world record of 16 wins in a row set by Steve Waugh's Australia team from 1999-2001. Australia's bowlers picked up where they left off in the first innings with an exacting period of bowling as the shadows lenghthened across the ground. Ponting changed his bowling attack several times with Lee, Johnson, Stuart Clark and Hogg all attempting to get a wicket. CLEAN BOWLED Michael Clarke, who top-scored for Australia with 73 before he was stumped by Mahendra Dhoni off the bowling of India captain Anil Kumble, said it was difficult to score on the low and slow wicket. "It's really hard to start your innings," Clarke told reporters. "As the ball gets older it's difficult to score. "We noticed it was reverse swinging a bit as the ball got older and you have to be patient and .... work as hard as possible to score your runs." Opener Phil Jaques, who scored 66 in the first innings, made 51 before being caught and bowled by Kumble, while all-rounder Andrew Symonds contributed an aggressive 44 before he was trapped in front by Zaheer Khan just before tea. Symonds could have been dismissed earlier, having been clean bowled by Khan, off a no ball. To add insult to injury, Symonds and Clarke added an extra run while the Indians celebrated before noticing umpire Billy Bowden's outstretched arm. Symonds also nicked Khan between wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni and first slip for a boundary two balls before Khan got a delivery, that would have hit middle stump, to nip back. Mike Hussey was caught by Sachin Tendulkar off RP Singh for 36, while Matthew Hayden was caught by Saurav Ganguly at long off for 47 and Ponting was caught by Dravid at slip for three. Harbhajan Singh finished with three for 101, while Kumble had two wickets for 102. "The wicket was getting slower and slower," said Harbhajan, whose dismissal of Ponting was his 250th test wicket. "I bowled a little bit slower in the second innings. I was trying to use different sorts of angles because there wasn't much spin. Those variations needed to be used.
