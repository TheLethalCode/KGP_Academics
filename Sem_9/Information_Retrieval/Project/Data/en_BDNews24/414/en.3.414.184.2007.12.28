 SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Friday as news of the assassination of Pakistani oppositionleader Benazir Bhutto and fears over regional political turmoil triggered a flight to less risky assets such as government bonds and gold. European stock markets were expected to open lower, with Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC seen down around 0.5 percent. Concerns over instability in Pakistan, which prompted credit agency Standard & Poor's to caution on the negative outlook for its sovereign debt ratings, prompted investors to dump the dollar and buy the yen in an unwinding of the carry trade, in which traders borrow lower-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding ones. The dollar fell as low as 112.97 by 0648 GMT, while the Australian dollar fell to 98.74 yen and the euro dropped 0.6 percent to 165.20 yen "Growing uncertainty after the Bhutto assassination is making the dollar vulnerable," said Shuichi Kanehira, a senior trader for Mizuho Corporate Bank. The news of Bhutto's assassination dampened appetite for risk, which had already been hit by US economic reports showing a weaker-than-forecast rise in US durable goods orders and an unexpected rise in jobless claims. The combination of the weak data and the Bhutto news sent Japan's benchmark Nikkei average down 1.7 percent in a shortened final session for 2007. The index fell more than 11 percent, the first annual decline in five years and heading to be the world's worst-performing major stock market in 2007. Investors fear that Bhutto's killing on Thursday at a political rally in Rawalpindi could spark instability in the region and civil unrest within Pakistan. "Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike North Korea or Iran, is known to really have nuclear weapons," Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments. "The implication for the stock market is worries about higher oil prices and a weaker dollar." OIL, GOLD FIRM U.S. light crude was up 29 cents at $96.91 a barrel by 0238 GMT, further boosted by a fall in U.S. crude supplies, while gold changed hands at around $828, having hit a one-month high of $830.05 overnight. Japanese government bond futures rallied 0.51 basis points to 1236.81 while the 10-year bond yields fell to 1.50 percent from 1.55, despite strong Japanese inflation data. Rising oil prices drove Japanese annual inflation in November to its highest level in nearly a decade, but that did little to alter market views that Japanese interest rates are stuck on hold for the next year. MSCI's broadest index of shares excluding Japan was down 0.4 percent by 0654 GMT. Benchmark indexes in Australia, South Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand fell by between 0.2-1.6 percent. Mumbai's stock market dipped 0.1 percent. EMERGING EQUITIES OUTPERFORM Global emerging equities dipped just 0.2 percent. "The assassination in Pakistan pushed up oil prices and there is a worry that mounting geopolitical risks would further boost oil prices," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. "But as Pakistan is not a country with developed financial markets and the country's connection with global credit markets is minimal, the case would have a limited and short-term impact on markets." Pakistan's five-year credit default swaps were still trading at around 480 basis points after widening by around 100 basis points (bps) overnight, with two dealers reporting almost no trades in Asian hours. The Pakistan rupee was last quoted at 61.30 against the dollar, just off a 3-year low. Other Asian currencies, such as the Singapore dollar, the Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit rose against the dollar, taking their cue from the weaker US data, which cemented expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. "I think investors will selectively choose theemerging markets in which they are likely to go into, with thecurrent instability in Pakistan, and to a lesser extent Thailand, probably betting on the Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Philippine peso or the Indonesian rupiah," said Enrico Tanuwidjaja, currency strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapo
