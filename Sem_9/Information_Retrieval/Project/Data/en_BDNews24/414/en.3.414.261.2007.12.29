 Sydney, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The only Guantanamo Bay inmate convicted of terrorism offences, Australian David Hicks, was released from prison on Saturday morning after spending over six years behind bars, the majority in solitary confinement. Hicks, 32, returned to Australia from the US military prison on the island of Cuba in May after pleading guilty to terrorism charges. He left prison in his hometown of Adelaide in south Australia. Wearing a green polo T-shirt and blue jeans, Hicks walked out of Adelaide's maximum security Yatala prison and was immediately driven away to a secret location in a blue sedan, escorted by police. In a statement read by his lawyer, Hicks asked for privacy and said he would need time to readjust to society. "I had hoped to be able to speak to the media but I am just not strong enough at the moment, it's as simple as that," Hicks said through his lawyer David McLeod. Hicks also said he would need to get medical help for "the consequences of five and a half years at Guantanamo Bay". He added that he would not speak to the media before March 30, 2008, as stipulated under terms of his release from Guantanamo Bay. "Right now I am looking forward to some quiet time with my wonderful Dad, my family and friends," Hicks said. Hicks was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001 and spent over five years in Guantanamo before becoming the first person to be sentenced under the alternate war crimes tribunals created by President George W Bush's administration to try non-American captives. The former kangaroo skinner admitted training with al Qaeda and meeting its leader Osama bin Laden, whom he described as "lovely", according to police evidence given to the court. Media reports last week said Hicks was unprepared for freedom, suffered agoraphobia and had retreated to solitary confinement in his Australian prison cell. Hicks will still be subject to a strict control order that includes a midnight to dawn curfew. He will not be allowed to leave Australia. Under a plea bargain with US military authorities, Hicks agreed to a gag order barring him from talking about his experiences for a year, ending on March 26, while any money offered for interviews could be confiscated under Australian law
