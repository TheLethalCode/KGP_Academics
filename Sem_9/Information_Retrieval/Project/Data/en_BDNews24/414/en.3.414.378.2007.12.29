<TITLE> Azerbaijan pardons some reporters after criticism </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Baku, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Azeri President Ilham Aliyev has signed a decree pardoning six journalists whose imprisonment had drawn criticism from Western diplomats and human rights bodies. The journalists are among 119 convicts pardoned by Aliyev, "proceeding from the principle of a humane state and continued policy of justice, as well as appeals ... by human rights bodies," said the decree published on Saturday. Ex-Soviet Azerbaijan is fast becoming an important oil supply route to the West and foreign oil barons have pumped in billions of dollars to develop the Caucasus nation's oil output. At the same time, Baku's tough treatment of journalists and the media has been criticised by Western embassies and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The journalists to be freed include an editor in chief and a reporter jailed for four and three years respectively for stoking religious hatred after their paper reprinted Danish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad seen by some Muslims as blasphemous. Also pardoned was reporter Faramaz Allahverdiyev of the independent paper Nota Bene, jailed for two years in January after being found guilty of insulting the interior minister. But the amnesty bypassed Einulla Fatullayev, a critic of the government, whose original jail sentence for terrorism and inciting racial hatred was quadrupled to 8-1/2 years in October. Two other Azeri journalists are in custody, awaiting trial. Aliyev, who succeeded his father as leader, responds to criticism by saying that his country meets its international commitments on freedom of the press
