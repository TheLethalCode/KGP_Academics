 UNITED NATIONS, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council denounced the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Thursday as a "heinous act of terrorism" and called on all Pakistanis to exercise restraint. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon separately condemned the killing in the city of Rawalpindi as an "assault on stability" in Pakistan. "The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist suicide attack by extremists," said a formal statement read out by Italian Ambassador Marcello Spatafora, current council president, at a specially convened meeting.

"The world has much at stake in the success of Pakistan's democratic institutions," he said in a statement. "A tribute to her (Bhutto's) memory would be lasting democracy in Pakistan." Pakistan's deputy permanent UN representative, Farukh Amil, said it was too early to say who had carried out the attack, but added: "The government of Pakistan remains absolutely committed to fighting terrorism in all its forms." Apart from aid agencies, the only UN presence in Pakistan is a small team of military observers, currently standing at 44, which has monitored the country's border with India since 1949.
