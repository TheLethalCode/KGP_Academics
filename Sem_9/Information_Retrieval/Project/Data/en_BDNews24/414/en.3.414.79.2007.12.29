 NAIROBI, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition claimed victory on Saturday in the presidential election but fears of rigging after counting delays ignited ethnic violence across the east African nation. In opposition strongholds hundreds of machete-wielding youths from rival tribes fought, looted and burned homes. Police fired teargas and several people died in scenes marring what foreign observers had praised as a broadly peaceful election. The unrest, caused by delays in counts, continued after the latest official results gave opposition challenger Raila Odinga 49 percent against President Mwai Kibaki's 45 percent after three-quarters of constituencies had reported. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) claimed victory. "Honourable Raila Amolo Odinga is therefore the winner and fourth president of the Republic of Kenya," party vice-president Musalia Mudavadi told reporters. Kibaki's party, hoping to secure their man a second five-year term, scoffed at the claims and said it would wait for the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). "Kangaroo results given by any Tom, Dick or Harry deserve every contempt," said a spokesman. ECK Chairman Samuel Kivuitu urged restraint by the ODM: "How many times have we met mad people on the road saying 'I own this shop,' and the man has no trousers? ... I can even announce that I am president of Kenya. Will that make me president of Kenya?" If Odinga -- a wealthy businessman who paints himself as a champion of the poor -- does fulfil a long-held ambition to lead Kenya, Kibaki will become the first of the country's three post-independence leaders to be ejected by the ballot box. The opposition led early tallies, but as Kibaki narrowed the gap overnight, Odinga's party said it feared ballot fraud. From Kisumu in the west to Mombasa on the coast and many towns in between, trouble broke out on Saturday pitting Odinga's Luo supporters against members of Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group. The tribes, two of Kenya's biggest, have a long history of rivalry during the country's four decades of independence. "We are sensing a plan to rig the elections," taxi cyclist Eric Ochieng, 18, told Reuters in the middle of riots in Kisumu city, in Odinga's homeland. "We will not accept this." FATHER'S DREAM Residents said one person was killed in Kisumu -- a normally sleepy city by Lake Victoria -- as hundreds of youths took to the streets, burning tyres, ransacking shops and blocking roads. As in other pro-opposition areas, rioters attacked Kikuyu businesses before being driven off by police. Looters torched a hardware shop on Kisumu's main Oginga Odinga Street, which was named after Odinga's father. "The government has failed to declare Odinga the winner," said 11-year-old Kennedy Ochieng, stumbling under the weight of a box of clothes, mobile phone chargers and other stolen goods. "They stole our votes so we are looting everything we can." As black smoke billowed overhead, one crowd waved machetes and yelled "Death to Kikuyus". Young boys swigged looted beer. "We have just started. We will loot all Kikuyu shops and kill them on sight," said Richard Ondigi, 23, a driver. Locals said two people were killed in another hotbed of support for Odinga, Nairobi's huge Kibera shantytown. Shots were fired and dozens of shacks burned after trouble began in the slum -- one of Africa's biggest -- before dawn. Armed police struggled to keep apart two gangs, one Luo, the other Kikuyu, who were brandishing knives, whips and clubs. Groups of youths held protests elsewhere in Nairobi and city centre streets were near-deserted as business owners pulled down their shutters. Truckloads of military police patrolled. Kibaki's party was also protesting, claiming "egregious irregularities" in six constituencies in the opposition's western heartland and calling for those results to be nullified. "We remain confident that Mwai Kibaki is on course to win the presidency again," the Party of National Unity (PNU) said. If Odinga does seal victory, he will realise a dream that eluded his late father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, a nationalist hero who became vice-president. The inauguration of Kenya's next president will take place in days. If it is Odinga, his priority will be to enlist support of the economically powerful Kikuyus, ensure a peaceful handover and allay business fears that he is a left-wing radical. Educated in communist East Germany and with a first-born son named Fidel Castro, throughout the campaign Odinga has tried to quash concerns he may have a hidden socialist agenda. The ECK forecast record turnout figures for what became Kenya's tightest race since British colonial rule ended in 1963.
