<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  The bowlers Thursday enjoyed the first day of the ninth round four-dayer in the National Cricket League. Leaders Khulna made 21 for two at stumps after bowling title contenders Rajshahi out for 188 in the first innings at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Dhaka scored 88 for two at the close of Day 1 after restricting Chittagong to 98 all out in the first innings at Birshreshtho Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Sylhet also struggled at 149 for eight at the end of first day after being put in to bat first against Barisal at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Khulna vs Rajshahi After being asked to bat first, Rajshahi fell in trouble losing both openers before Shakil Haider steadied the innings with the highest 61. Mushfiqur Rahman and Anisur Rahman chipped in with 33 and 25 not out, but could not stop the slump as off-spinner Jamal Babu cleaned up the tail with three for 15. Robiul Islam, Ziaur Rahman and Aslam Khan ran though the top and middle orders taking two wickets each. In reply, Imrul Kayes (5) and Jamal (0) remained unbeaten after pacer Delwar Hossain sent Nazmus Sadat (11) and Mostafizur Rahman (1) back cheaply. Dhaka vs Chittagong Dhaka pacers Mohammad Sharif (3/11) and Mahbubul Alam Robin (2/23) made the way difficult for Chittagong, who were reduced t0 28 for four and never recovered the damage. Skipper Ehsanul Haq provided a bit resistance with 36, but that could not help the hosts avert from blues. Spinners Arafat Sunny (3/28) and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (2/31) destroyed the middle and late orders. Dhaka batsmen Anwar Hossain and Shamsur Rahman were unbeaten on 30 and 15 when the bails were drawn for the first day. Sylhet vs Barisal Openers Imtiaz Hossain (25) and Golam Rahman (45) gave Sylhet a fine start, but Sylhet lost the momentum after being slipped to 141 for eight from 90 for three. Alok Kapali made a stroke -filled 39 off 46 that was studded eight fours before he was bowled by Monir Hossain to leave the side at 90 for three, sparking a collapse. Medium pacer Arafat Salauddin was the pick of the attack with three for 36 while Monir (2/33) and Sumon Saha (2/43) shared four wickets.
