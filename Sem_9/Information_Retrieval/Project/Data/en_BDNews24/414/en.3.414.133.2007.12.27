<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Forty two artefacts and relics, sent to France for display at the Guimet Museum, are being packed for their return to Dhaka, cultural affairs secretary ABM Abdul Haque Chowdhury said Thursday morning. "We contacted the French Embassy and were told that the artefacts were being packed. Two representatives from Bangladesh will be present during the packing and to receive the artefacts," Chowdhury told reporters in his office. On what measures will be taken if any further artefacts go missing on the return journey to Bangladesh, the secretary said: "What the law suggests." He said there was no scope to make replicas of the relics because of secret marks they bore for security. "Our representatives will receive them after checking the marks." Asked if there was any possibility that the incident would strain bilateral relations with France, the cultural affairs secretary said: "It will be unfortunate if it happens." The first shipment of 42 relics for an exhibition at the Guimet Museum in Paris left Dhaka on Dec 1. Two statues of Vishnu, which were included in a second shipment to Paris, disappeared from Zia International Airport. The incident came to light Dec 22. Following the alleged theft of the two statues, the government decided not to send the second shipment to France until the disappearance was investigated. The government formed a five-member committee on Dec 23 to investigate the incident. It was assigned to file a report within three workdays. bdnews24.c
