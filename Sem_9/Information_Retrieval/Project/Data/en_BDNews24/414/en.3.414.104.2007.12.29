 Dubai, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten Saudis returned to Saudi Arabia on Saturday from detention in the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay where suspected al Qaeda militants are held, the Saudi Interior Ministry said. Washington has returned dozens of Saudis over the past year in an effort to reduce the numbers detained at the controversial camp ahead of finally closing it. The release brings the number of Saudis remaining in the prison to around 13. Public anger over the treatment of Saudi detainees in Guantanamo Bay has been high in the kingdom, a close US ally but one which applies strict Islamic law. Two Saudis were among three prisoners who hanged themselves at the naval base in June. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States were Saudis and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden himself is Saudi-born. Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told the official news agency SPA that efforts were underway to bring home the remaining Saudis detained at Guantanamo and that US authorities were cooperating in those efforts. Washington has designated Guantanamo prisoners, who were mainly seized in Afghanistan during the US invasion in 2001, as "enemy combatants". They have been denied the prisoner of war status that would guarantee them certain rights under international law. Those repatriated to Saudi Arabia have received financial help from the government to rebuild their lives and many have been allowed to go free
