 Tel Aviv, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak makes a fence-mending visit to Egypt on Wednesday after Israel's foreign minister accused Cairo of jeopardising regional stability by failing to stop arms smuggling to the Gaza Strip. Egypt, the first Arab country to recognise the Jewish state, is a key Israeli-Palestinian mediator. Israel and Egypt both border the coastal Strip but have at times differed on how to handle the volatile territory, seized by Islamist Hamas in June. "Peace with Egypt is a strategic asset for Israel and our disputes must be resolved," a Barak spokesman quoted him as saying before his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and security officials in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Tuesday said Egypt's efforts to prevent smuggled arms from reaching Gaza were poor and risked boosting Hamas over its Western- and Israeli-backed Fatah rival, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Livni's comment was rejected by Cairo, already smarting from calls in the U.S. Congress for the Bush administration to curb military aid to Egypt over arms smuggling from the Sinai desert to Gaza, as well as human rights concerns. "It would certainly be better for the Israeli minister to focus her attention on negotiating efforts with the Palestinians instead of making indiscriminate comments on subjects that are inappropriate for her to deal with without adequate knowledge," Egyptian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossam Zaki said. Egypt has championed efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to restart peace talks with Abbas, although the Palestinian leader's mandate has been reduced to the occupied West Bank since Hamas took over Gaza. Israeli forces and settlers withdrew from the Strip in 2005. Further clouding prospects of a diplomatic breakthrough have been Israel's threats to invade Gaza in response to cross-border rockets fired by Palestinian militants. The Egyptian government has said it is doing its best with the personnel it is allowed to deploy at the border under the 1979 peace treaty and a subsequent agreement with Israel. The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted an unidentified Egyptian official as saying that Cairo, using US grant money, had ordered an advanced system for detecting smuggling tunnels on the Gaza border. The Egyptian embassy in Israel had no comment. Barak's talks in Egypt were expected to focus on border security as well as Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, abducted in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and whom Hamas has refused to free unless Israel releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Olmert, who in the past has ruled out an amnesty for senior jailed militants, set up a ministerial committee this week to review Israel's criteria for releasing Palestinian prisoners as part of any future Egyptian-mediated swap with Hamas
