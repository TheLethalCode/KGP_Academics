 NAUDERO, Pakistan, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of mourners began the funeral on Friday of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, whose assassination plunged the nuclear-armed country into one of the worst crises in its 60-year history. Her killing on Thursday after an election rally triggered a wave of violence, especially in her native Sindh province, where at least 16 people, including three policemen, were killed. It stoked fears that a Jan. 8 election meant to return Pakistan to civilian rule could be put off, although caretaker Prime Minister Mohammadmian Soomro said there was no change in timing for now. Mourners wept and beat their heads as Bhutto's body was carried out of her ancestral home in Sindh, in the south of the country, at the start of the funeral procession. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, accompanied the closed coffin draped with the green, red and black tricolour of her Pakistan People's Party as it began the 7-km (4-mile) journey by ambulance to the white, domed family mausoleum. "Show patience. Give us courage to bear this loss," Zardari earlier told the crowds after arriving in Sindh with his wife's body, accompanied by their three teenage children. World leaders urged Pakistan not to be deflected from a course toward democracy, as fears of instability in a region racked by Islamist militancy upset markets on Friday and triggered a flight to less risky assets such as bonds and gold. "Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike North Korea or Iran, is known to really have nuclear weapons," said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments. Sixteen people, including three policemen, have been killed in violent protests in Sindh since Bhutto's assassination, Sindh Interior Minister Akhtar Zaman said. "We're anticipating the situation might get worse after the funeral," he told Reuters. Many of Bhutto's supporters blamed Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf for her death, along with the United States which has backed the former army general, dismissing speculation that she had been killed by Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda. Chants of "Shame on the killer Musharraf, shame on the killer U.S." were heard from the throng lining the road and standing on rooftops during her funeral procession. "No matter how many Bhuttos you will kill, a Bhutto will emerge from each house," others cried. Authorities issued an order to shoot violent protesters on sight. Hundreds of cars, trucks and buses smouldered in the interior of Sindh and crowds of men set up road blocks and chanted slogans against Musharraf. Meanwhile, a blast at an election meeting in Pakistan's troubled northwest killed six people including a candidate for the party that supports Musharraf, police said. SHOT IN HEAD AND NECK Bhutto, 54, returned home from eight years of self-imposed exile in October, hoping her huge following among the poor would propel her to power for the third time in a vote intended to stabilise a country struggling to contain Islamist violence. But as she left the campaign rally in Rawalpindi, where she spoke of threats to her life, she stood to wave to supporters from the sun-roof of her bullet-proof car. An attacker shot at her before blowing himself up, police and witnesses said. She was killed by bullets to the head and neck. "The shooter was either very well trained or he was very close so he could hit her in the temple and neck," a security official said. She was pronounced dead in hospital in Rawalpindi, home of the Pakistan army and the city where her father, former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 after being deposed by a military coup. She will be buried alongside him. Across Pakistan, a country used to political violence and ruled by the military for more than half of its life, friends and foe alike were stunned by her death. "Benazir Bhutto was a ray of hope for the moderate people," said Abbas Raza, a bank officer in the city of Lahore. "But with her death, we've lost all hope." Bhutto had spoken out strongly against Islamist violence and had been threatened by pro-Taliban militants. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Bhutto's old political rival, said his party would boycott the January election. He blamed Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 military coup but retired from the army last month, for the instability. Musharraf imposed a state of emergency in November in what was seen as an attempt to stop the judiciary from vetoing his re-election as president. He lifted emergency rule this month. "ELECTIONS STAND" Authorities ordered the central bank and all schools across Pakistan to close for three days of mourning. The United States, which relies on Pakistan as an ally against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan, had championed the Harvard- and Oxford-educated Bhutto, seeing in her the best hope of a return to democracy. "The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy," President George W. Bush said. He called Musharraf and urged Pakistanis to honour Bhutto's memory by holding elections as scheduled. "Elections stand as they were announced," Prime Minister Soomro told reporters. But analysts said the assassination, which followed a wave of suicide attacks and the worsening of an Islamist insurgency, could make this impossible. Musharraf condemned the attack on Bhutto, in which a total of 16 people were killed, and called for calm. "We will not sit and rest until we get rid of these terrorists," he said. In 1988, aged just 35, Bhutto became the Muslim world's first democratically elected woman prime minister. Deposed in 1990, she was re-elected in 1993, and ousted again in 1996 amid charges of corruption she said were politically motivated. Bhutto, who escaped unhurt from a suicide attack in October, is survived by her husband and a son Bilawal, 19, and two daughters, Bakhtawar, 17 and Aseefa, 14. Her husband said the government should step do
