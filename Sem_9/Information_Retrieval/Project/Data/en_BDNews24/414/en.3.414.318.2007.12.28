<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury Friday called on the non-resident Bangladeshis to invest and tap the country's abundant renewable energy sources. He said at a conference for NRBs that the government would try to ensure all facilities, but they must have a realistic expectation of such facilities considering Bangladesh's situation. Over 700 NRBs from the United States, Europe and the Middle East launched the first-ever three-day conference Thursday at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. They said they had the means to contribute to the development of the country. The expatriates announced that their talent, technological know-how and money would help rebuild the country but to be able to do so they needed opportunities and congenial policies. The NRBs could play an important role in building and preserving the image of the country the world over, they added. Speaking at one of the seminars held titled "The Untapped Energy Mine: The Revolutionary Scope of Renewable Energy Technologies for Bangladesh", Tapan said biomass, solar, and wind are the major renewable sources. There is potential for solar photovoltaic energy within an overall rural electrification programme, the adviser said. He said, at present electricity coverage in Bangladesh is only 43 percent and per capita electricity generation is about 165 kilowatt, one of the lowest in the world. The government has now set a target of providing electricity to 60 percent of the population by 2010, he added. The government is also considering establishing Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA) to facilitate expansion of renewable energy in private and public sector, Tapan added. There are some 18 seminars spread over three days on topics ranging from agro productivity to foreign investment, as well as exhibitions and job fairs. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will attend the closing ceremony Saturday as chief guest. About four million high-earning Bangladeshis live abroad, and according to the central bank, Bangladesh earned about $6 billion from the NRBs in fiscal 2006-07. bdnews
