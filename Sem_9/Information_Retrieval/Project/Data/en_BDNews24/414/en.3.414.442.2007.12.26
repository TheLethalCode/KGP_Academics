 Luxor, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for a private holiday accompanied by his new girlfriend, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Sarkozy and Bruni held hands as they arrived at the city of Luxor on the banks of the Nile. Sarkozy is spending a few days in Luxor before he makes a formal state trip to Cairo at the end of the month. Earlier this month, pictures of the 52-year-old president accompanying Bruni, 39, at Disneyland Paris were splashed all over the French press. Sarkozy and his second wife Cecilia split amicably in October after 11 years of marriage. It was the first time in modern French history that a serving president had separated from his wife. The Italian-born Bruni has recently become a singer after ending her modelling career. The dark-haired former catwalk queen has previously been linked with rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton, as well as US businessman Donald Trump. Bruni has a son from a previous relationship, while Sarkozy has two elder sons from his first marriage, and a third son from his marriage to Cecilia. According to French media, Sarkozy borrowed a private plane from French billionaire Vincent Bollore for the trip. The French president's department has declined to comment on Sarkozy's trip to Luxor, saying it is a personal affair
