 ISLAMABAD, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani paramilitary forces were put on 'red alert' across the country on Thursday after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto sparked violent protests by her supporters. "We have put the country on red alert. We have put paramilitary forces in the provinces at their disposal so they can ensure security and peace," said Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Cheema. Bhutto was the target of terrorists, he said.
