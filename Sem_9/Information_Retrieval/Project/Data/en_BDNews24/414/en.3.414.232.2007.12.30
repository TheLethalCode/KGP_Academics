<TITLE> Benazir`s party to decide on successor, election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Benazir Bhutto's party was to discuss a successor to the slain Pakistani opposition leader on Sunday and decide whether to contest an election due in little over a week, as controversy swirled about exactly how she died. Bhutto's assassination in a suicide attack on Thursday has stoked violence and thrown into doubt the Jan. 8 election, deepening the crisis in the important US ally against terrorism as it struggles to emerge from military rule. Anger against President Pervez Musharraf burns strongly among Bhutto supporters and since her death sporadic violence has erupted, boosting fears about nuclear-armed Pakistan's stability. The death toll from the violence has reached 44. Streets in Karachi, where much of the violence has taken place, were generally quiet and deserted on Sunday morning, Reuters witnesses said. Sahid Khan, assistant manager at a downtown hotel, said he was forced to walk 2- hours to get to work for lack of transport. "Things are very difficult because of the blast that killed Bhutto. Elections should be delayed by say three months," he told Reuters. "All parties, leaders ... need more time to prepare." Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party has dismissed the government statement that she was killed by al Qaeda, saying Musharraf's embattled administration was trying to cover up its failure to protect her. Without the charismatic Bhutto, 54, her party is in disarray. Bhutto's 19-year-old son, Bilawal, is to read her will on Sunday but the Oxford law student is seen as too young to lead a dynasty whose history is entwined with that of Pakistan. The choice of a successor more likely lies between Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and her top aide, Makhdoom Amin Fahim. The party leadership, due to meet in Bhutto's home town of Naudero in southern Pakistan -- which is also where the will is due to be read in the afternoon -- must decide as well whether to contest the election if it goes ahead. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party has said it would boycott the vote and has been trying to convince Bhutto's PPP to do likewise. So far the government has not announced any decision to call off or postpone the vote, but the Election Commission says it is planning an emergency meeting on Monday. "They should postpone the election, as a mark of respect," Greg Turner, 50, account manager at Siemens Pakistan, who was on his way to church, told Reuters on Sunday. "I think it's crucial elections are held. They are essential for democracy itself and the integrity of Pakistan. But a delay is inevitable," said Turner, among the 2 percent of Pakistanis who are Christian in the overwhelmingly Islamic nation. Although US President George W Bush has urged Pakistanis to hold the vote, a White House spokesman said it was up to Pakistan's authorities to determine the timing. Washington had encouraged Bhutto, relatively liberal by Pakistan's standards and an opponent of Islamic militancy. She returned home from self-imposed exile in October, hoping to become prime minister for the third time. Her death wrecked US hopes of a power-sharing deal between her and Musharraf, who took power in a military coup in 1999 but left the army last month to become a civilian president. When asked by the BBC on Saturday if he wanted to take over the party leadership, Bhutto's husband replied: "It depends on the party and it depends on the will." Zardari can ooze charm, and gained respect for enduring eight years in jail before being released without being convicted. However, political foes accuse him of corruption and some PPP loyalists blame him for tainting the Bhutto name. Many PPP leaders are from Bhutto's land-owning feudal class, yet the party also has a big following among the poor. "LUDICROUS" DEATH THEORY? A close aide who prepared Bhutto's body for burial dismissed as "ludicrous" a government theory she died after hitting her head on a sunroof during the suicide attack. A party spokesman said she was shot in the head. Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said the government's version was based on a medical report and other evidence collected from the scene of the attack. "If the People's Party's leadership wants, her body can be exhumed and post-mortemed. They are most welcome," he added. The PPP has said the government must also show hard evidence al Qaeda is to blame. The al Qaeda-linked militants who were accused have denied any role in the killing. A spokesman for militant leader Baitullah Mehsud said: "We don't strike women." Other militants, however, issued threats against Bhutto when she returned in October, and her triumphal entry into Karachi was met with a suicide attack that killed at least 139 people. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Saturday that Washington should address "troubling questions" about Pakistan's probe of Bhutto's assassination and its cooperation in fighting terrorism before extending any more aid. Democrat Pelosi called for an international investigation into Bhutto's death. In Karachi, hotel assistant manager Khan's main wish was for an end to the strife that has racked the country. "Every six months there's a problem here. Most Pakistanis would like to work outside the country. There are blasts, crimes, too much!
