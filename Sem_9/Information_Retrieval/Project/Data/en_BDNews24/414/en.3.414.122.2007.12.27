 KHARTOUM, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixteen ministers from Sudan's former southern rebels took the oath of office before President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on Thursday, rejoining the national government and formally ending a crippling political crisis. The former southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) walked out of the coalition government in October complaining its northern partners did not want to implement the 2005 peace deal which ended Sudan's north-south civil war -- Africa's longest.

"The presidency will deal with the Abyei issue ... working with the commission of Abyei and the border commission," Fadul added.
