<TITLE> Poland to boost troops in Afghanistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Warsaw, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland will send an additional 400 soldiers to Afghanistan next year, strengthening its commitment to a NATO-led mission aimed at helping restore order there, Poland's foreign and defence ministers said on Friday. Poland, the biggest ex-communist NATO and European Union member, already has about 1,200 troops in Afghanistan. "We had so far the smallest presence in Afghanistan ... too little for a serious NATO ally," Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told TVP3 television on Friday. Defence Minister Bogdan Klich also said the current engagement in Afghanistan did not match Poland's ambitions. He said the character of the Polish mission may be reviewed, but gave no details. The ministers said the dangers faced by Polish troops in Afghanistan could increase if security conditions in neighbouring Pakistan deterioriate. The assassination on Thursday of Pakistani opposition leader and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto triggered some of Pakistan's worst political violence in years. "Our troops would be in danger if it came to 'Talibanisation' of Pakistan. And this, I hope, won't happen," Sikorski said. Asked about Poland's foreign policy priorities next year, Sikorski said he wanted to reestablish Poland's position within the European Union. "This also means regaining the ability to shape the EU's eastern policy, including the energy issues," he said. "The American missile defence system is important, but this is not our national goal." Warsaw has been in talks with Washington about hosting parts of a US anti-missile shield, but negotiations have been on hold since Donald Tusk took over as prime minister after winning October parliamentary elections. Tusk has said Poland and the EU would have to see clear security benefits before Warsaw will agree to host the facility. Tusk is expected to visit Washington early next year
