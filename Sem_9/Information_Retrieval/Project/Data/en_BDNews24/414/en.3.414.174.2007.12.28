 KARACHI, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violence flared in Pakistan on Friday as angry supporters of assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto took to the streets a day after she was killed in a suicide attack, witnesses and police said. A "shoot on sight" order was issued in Bhutto's home province of Sindh after unidentified gunmen shot dead a policeman and wounded three in the southern city of Karachi. "Yes, shoot on sight anybody who wants to damage the life of innocent citizens and public property," provincial Interior Minister Akhtar Zaman told Reuters on Friday. The streets of Karachi, capital of Sindh and Pakistan's biggest city, were largely deserted on Friday with shops shuttered and paramilitary troops and police patrolling. With taxis and buses off the streets, many people travelled on foot, carrying bags on their heads and backs from the railway station and airport. "Since last night a lot of damage has been caused. Shops, cars and government buildings are being burnt," said senior Karachi police official Azhar Ali Farooqi. "We're trying to control the situation but emotions are running high," he said. Violence erupted in different parts of the country on Thursday as news of former prime minister Bhutto's death spread. But worst affected was Sindh, where hospital officials said four people were killed in the capital, Karachi, late on Thursday and early on Friday. Fires blazed across the interior of Sindh, Bhutto's main bastion of support. A Reuters reporter travelling from Karachi to the Bhuttos' home district of Larkana said he had seen hundreds of smouldering vehicles and many shops set alight. Protesters had also set fire to a stationary train. "More and more people are joining the protests. Groups of youths have blocked almost all roads in and around Larkana with burning tyres," he said. "LONG LIVE BHUTTO" Protesters shouted slogans against Bhutto's old rival, President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf condemned Bhutto's killing and called for calm and declared three days of mourning. Bhutto's party said it would observe 40 days of mourning while another opposition leader and former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, called for a nationwide strike on Friday. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, said his wife would be buried in the family graveyard in Garhi Khuda Baksh, a village near the Bhutto home in Larkana district at 3 p.m. (1000 GMT). Thousands of mourners gathered for the funeral, many holding the party's black, green and red flag. In the northwestern city of Peshawar two offices of pro-Musharraf political parties were torched, a witness said. Protesters in the southwestern province of Baluchistan set fire to a railway station, several banks, government vehicles and offices of a pro-Musharraf party, police said. In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, protesters took to the streets but there was no violence, a witness said. "Long live Bhutto ... killer Musharraf, killer," they shout
