 Nairobi, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition claimed victory on Saturday in a presidential vote minutes after official figures gave their candidate a four percentage point lead over President Mwai Kibaki on three-quarters of the count. "Honourable Raila Odinga is ... the winner and fourth president of the Republic of Kenya," Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) vice-presidential candidate Musalia Mudavadi told reporters, citing his party's own tally. Kibaki's party, hoping to land their man a second five-year term at the helm of east Africa's biggest economy, scoffed and said it would wait for the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). "Kangaroo results given by any Tom, Dick or Harry deserve every contempt," said a Party of National Unity (PNU) spokesman. Official results, however, showed Odinga heading for a win. The ECK gave him 3.73 million votes or 49 percent on its tally from three-quarters of the country's 210 constituencies. Kibaki had 45 percent or 3.42 million votes. Delays announcing the results of Thursday's poll ignited ethnic tensions as machete-wielding gangs fought, looted and burned homes on Saturday in opposition strongholds. Most of the trouble was between Luo supporters of Odinga and members of Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group, which have a long history of rivalry in Kenya's four decades of independence. Odinga had led early tallies, but when Kibaki began to narrow the gap on Saturday the opposition said it feared the government was plotting to steal victory by fraud. "We are sensing a plan to rig the elections," taxi cyclist Eric Ochieng, 18, said in the middle of riots in western Kisumu city, in Odinga's homeland. "We will not accept this," he told Reuters as smoke billowed overhead. "KILL THEM ON SIGHT" From early morning, hundreds of youths took to the streets of Kisumu -- a normally sleepy city on the shores of Lake Victoria -- burning tyres, ransacking shops and blocking roads. Residents said at least one person had died. In Nairobi's Kibera shantytown, also a hotbed of Odinga support, locals said two people were killed in skirmishes and police deployed as rival ethnic gangs faced off. Residents said trouble began in the sprawling slum -- one of Africa's biggest -- before dawn. Shots were fired, and numerous shacks torched. Armed police stood between two gangs, one Luo, the other Kikuyu, who were brandishing knives and clubs. "The Luos say the Kikuyus are trying to rig it," said Kibera resident Abdulrahman Ramadhan. In Kisumu, and other pro-opposition western areas, looters targeted Kikuyu businesses. "We have just started. We will loot all Kikuyu shops and kill them on sight," said Richard Ondigi, 23, a driver. One crowd waving machetes yelled "Death to Kikuyus" as youths carried off stolen goods including furniture and crates of drinks. Young boys swigged looted beer. In Nairobi, streets were near-deserted in the city centre as business owners pulled down shutters on their stores. Truckloads of military police poured in to patrol. The ECK said it expects a record turnout for what became Kenya's tightest race since British colonial rule ended in 1963. Results from Kenya's eight provinces were going broadly in line with political analysts' forecasts. Odinga had a massive majority in his Nyanza homeland, was winning in the capital Nairobi, and also had the lead in three other provinces including the crucial, densely populated Rift Valley seen as a possible election decider. Kibaki had overwhelming support in his Central Province, and was also ahead in two others
