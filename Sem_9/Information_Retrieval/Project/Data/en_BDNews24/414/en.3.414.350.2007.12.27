 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Non-resident Bangladeshis, who were taking part in a three-day conference, said Thursday that they had abilities to contribute to the development of the country. They said their talents, technological knowledge and money would help rebuild the country but they needed opportunities and congenial policies for that. Over 700 NRBs from the United States, Europe and the Middle East joined the first ever such conference at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. "Opportunities have to be created for the NRBs," said Chaklader Mahbub-ul Alam who left Bangladesh for Spain about 50 years ago. "Our talents, money and capital will help rebuild the country," said Abid Chowdhury, who lives in Australia. Dr Nurunnabi who teaches at a university in the US hoped that the gathering of the NRBs and resident policy makers will generate some sort of synergies, which he said would encourage them. Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, vice-chancellor of BRAC University, chaired the programme. Dr Kamal Hossain, Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud, Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Rokeya Afzal Rahman, Hafiz GA Siddiqi, Prof Bazlul Mobin Chowdhury and Prof SMA Faiz also spoke on the occasion. They said the NRBs could play an important role in various sectors. They said the NRBs could play a vital role in building and preserving the image of the country across the world. "This conference will build a creative linkage and interaction between the natives and the non-resident Bangladeshis," Dr Kamal Hossain said. He also hoped that the conference would chalk out a comprehensive development strategy. Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud asked the government to tap huge potentials of the NRBs in the national efforts for development. He also asked the organisers to give the NRB conference an institutional shape. Hansen (Hashim) Clarke, a Democratic member of the Michigan Senate, also spoke. But the audience became surprised when they came to know that his father Abul Hashim was a Bangladeshi and left Sylhet for the US in 1910. Hansen said he is interested to work with his rootBangladesh. The NRBs said the gathering represents a kind of hope and optimism for better Bangladesh. There will be some 18 seminars  from agro productivity to foreign investment, exhibitions and job fairs. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed would attend the closing ceremony as chief guest. About four million Bangladeshis live abroad and earn large incomes. According to the central bank, Bangladesh earned about $6 billion from the NRBs in the fiscal 2006-07. bd
