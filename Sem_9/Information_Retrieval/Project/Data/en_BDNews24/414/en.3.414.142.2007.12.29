 MOSCOW, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Hummer owner in Russia's second city St. Petersburg has given antiglobalists the green light to pelt his oversized vehicle with rotten eggs, Russian news agencies have reported. "Peter Antiglobalist" activists told news agency RIA they found a driver willing to let them express their dissatisfaction with consumerism by throwing things at his luxury sport utility vehicle, a spokesman said. A Moscow car dealer puts the base price of a Hummer H3 at $49,500. "Luxury is a false value, clouding modern society's vision. Advertising posters, TV shows and slick marketing constantly tells us that buying things is the most important value in our society," RIA quoted the spokesman as saying. The antiglobalists said throwing eggs and tomatoes at the Hummer will help draw attention to their cause. The vehicle's owner said he will then sell it and donate the proceeds to an orphanage.
