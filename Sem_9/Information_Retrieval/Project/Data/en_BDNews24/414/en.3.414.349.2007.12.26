 Addis Ababa, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two human rights activists received a two-and-a-half year jail sentence on Wednesday for inciting post-election violence in 2005, but will walk free within days as they have already served their prison time. An Addis Ababa court found the pair "guilty of inciting violence and uprising against the government". Their defence lawyer, Mengistu Haile Mariam, said they would however be freed quickly. "The two activists will be released from prison in three days' time because they have already served two-thirds of their sentences," he told reporters at the court. Daniel Bekele worked for ActionAid, while Netsanet Demisse worked closely with the global anti-poverty campaigner through his Organisation for Social Justice in Ethiopia. The two were the last defendants out of 131 originally charged after demonstrators took to the street to protest against polls they said were rigged. A parliamentary inquiry said 199 civilians and police were killed and 30,000 people arrested. The government denied election fraud. Both the activists sentenced on Wednesday were involved in deploying observers at polling stations in and around the capital Addis Ababa at the time of the election. Rights groups have condemned their trial
