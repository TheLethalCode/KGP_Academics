 LONDON, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aston Villa grabbed a 4-4 draw at Chelsea on Wednesday as the Premier League's holiday action kicked off with three red cards and two penalties in an astonishing clash at Stamford Bridge. Gareth Barry converted a last-minute penalty for Villa who had led 2-0 after 44 minutes thanks to two Shaun Maloney goals. Andriy Shevchenko scored twice for Chelsea who had Ricardo Carvalho and Ashley Cole sent off. Villa defender Zat Knight was red-carded just before halftime after a clumsy foul on Michael Ballack that sparked Chelsea's comeback from the penalty spot. There were goals galore and another red card at White Hart Lane where Robbie Keane and Tom Huddlestone both hit two in Tottenham Hotspur's 5-1 drubbing of struggling Fulham who had Moritz Volz sent off. In the day's other early kickoff West Ham United were held 1-1 at home by Reading who also ended the match with 10 men. Premier League leaders Arsenal play at Portsmouth later while second-placed Manchester United travel to Sunderland. Third-placed Chelsea, eager to make up ground in the title race, had only conceded three league goals at home this season but were caught cold by Villa. Maloney volleyed Villa ahead and then made it 2-0 when his shot was fumbled into the net by Petr Cech as Chelsea's long undefeated home league run, stretching back nearly four years, appeared to be crumbling. The match turned on its head a minute later when Ballack tumbled after a challenge from Knight and Shevchenko slotted the penalty past Scott Carson after Knight had been sent off. Shevchenko's fine finish made it 2-2 after 50 minutes and Chelsea appeared to have seized total control when Brazilian central defender Alex put them 3-2 up. In a crazy final 20 minutes Martin Laursen made it 3-3 before Carvalho was shown a red card for a wild tackle. Ballack, who had replaced the injured Frank Lampard in the first half, appeared to have sealed it when he planted a sublime free kick past Carson with two minutes remaining but the final twist was still to come. Gabriel Agbonlahor's header was handled on the line by Ashley Cole and as the England full-back walked off Barry beat Cech from the spot. Defeat leaves Chelsea on 38 points from 19 games and facing a potential eight-point deficit to Arsenal
