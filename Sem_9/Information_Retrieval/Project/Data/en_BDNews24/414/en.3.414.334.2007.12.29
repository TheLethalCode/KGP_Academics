 Sydney, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Cyclone Melanie, a category two storm with winds of up to 130 kph (80 mph), sped closer to Australia's remote northwest coast on Saturday, prompting Chevron to shut down production at its oil fields. The storm was estimated to be 375 kilometres (230 miles) north of Port Hedland, a key terminal for the shipment of iron ore, and 430 kilometres northeast of oil producing region Karratha, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said. It was moving south at about 11 kilometres per hour. Chevron spokesman Scott Walker said the evacuation of non-essential personnel was well-advanced and operations on Barrow and Thevenard Islands were being shut. The fields have a combined production of about 8,000 barrels per day (bpd). Woodside Petroleum Ltd, Australia's second-largest oil producer, said the company was keeping a close watch on the weather, though its offshore oil and gas operations had so far been unaffected by bad weather. Santos, operator of the 4,000-5,000 bpd Mutineer-Exeter field, could not be immediately reached for comment. In March, a powerful cyclone forced oil companies, including Santos and BHP Billiton to shut about 180,000 barrels a day of production, half of Australia's output, for nearly a week. Melanie is the first storm of the November-to-April season to form in Australia's 'cyclone alley', which is also home to the world's biggest iron ore deposits and major oil and gas fields. Normally the area sees about five storms each season. The bureau said it has declared a cyclone warning for coastal areas from Mardie to Wallal including Port Hedland and Karratha-Dampier, while a cyclone watch was issued for remaining coastal parts between Broome and Coral Bay. "Gales with gusts to 120 kilometres per hour are possible on the coast between Mardie and Wallal, including Karratha and Port Hedland, on Sunday as the cyclone moves closer to the coast," the weather bureau said on its Web site (www.bom.gov.au). Widespread heavy rain was also likely in coastal parts of Pilbara from Sunday, the weather forecaster said. Heavy storms at the ore-rich Pilbara region could disrupt production for major miners such as Rio Tinto Ltd and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, which have large operations in that area. During the last cyclone season, Fortescue was forced to shoulder more than A$100 million ($87 million) in construction cost overruns and shipment delays from its Pilbara iron ore project after three storms smashed into its operations, destroying work camps, flooding roads and killing two workers
