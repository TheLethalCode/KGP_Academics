 KARACHI, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violence flared in Pakistan on Friday as angry supporters of assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto took to the streets a day after she was killed in a suicide attack, witnesses and police said. Meanwhile, a blast at an election meeting in Pakistan's troubled northwest killed six people including a candidate for the party that supports President Pervez Musharraf, police said. In Bhutto's home province of Sindh, in the south, authorities issued an order to shoot violent protesters on sight after unidentified gunmen shot dead a policeman and wounded three in the provincial capital, Karachi. "Yes, shoot on sight anybody who wants to damage the life of innocent citizens and public property," provincial Interior Minister Akhtar Zaman told Reuters on Friday. Hours later, police opened fire on protesters in Sindh's Hyderabad city, wounding five as the violence intensified, police said. Police and witnesses said protesters had set fire to about 25 banks, 100 vehicles and foreign fast-food outlets in Hyderabad. Some coaches of a train were also torched. The streets of Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city and its commercial capital, were largely deserted on Friday with shops shuttered and paramilitary troops and police patrolling. With taxis and buses off the streets, many people travelled on foot, carrying bags on their heads and backs from the railway station and airport. "Since last night a lot of damage has been caused. Shops, cars and government buildings are being burnt," said senior Karachi police official Azhar Ali Farooqi. "We're trying to control the situation but emotions are running high," he said. CANDIDATE KILLED Violence erupted in different parts of the country on Thursday as news of former prime minister Bhutto's death spread. Worst affected was Sindh, where hospital officials said four people were killed in the capital, Karachi, late on Thursday and early on Friday. Fires also blazed across the interior of Sindh. A Reuters reporter travelling from Karachi to the Bhuttos' home district of Larkana, where Bhutto was to be buried later on Friday, said he had seen hundreds of smouldering vehicles and many shops on fire. Protesters shouted slogans against Bhutto's old rival, President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf condemned Bhutto's killing and called for calm and declared three days of mourning. Bhutto's party said it would observe 40 days of mourning while Nawaz Sharif, another opposition leader and former prime minister, called on Friday for a nationwide strike. In the northwestern city of Peshawar two offices of pro-Musharraf political parties were torched, a witness said. Protesters in the southwestern province of Baluchistan set fire to a railway station, several banks, government vehicles and offices of a pro-Musharraf party, police said. In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, protesters took to the streets but there was no violence, a witness said. In the Swat valley, where the army has been fighting pro-Taliban militants, a blast at an election meeting of the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League (Q) party killed six people including a party candidate in the Jan. 8 polls, police said. Islamist militants, probably linked to al Qaeda, are at the top of the list of suspects for Bhutto's murder as she left an election rally in Rawalpin
