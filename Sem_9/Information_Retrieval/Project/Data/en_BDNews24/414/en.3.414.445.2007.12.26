<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  NBR chief Md Abdul Majid said Wednesday reforms were needed to the annual budget-making process to make it more competent. The National Board of Revenue chairman said the changes were necessary as the budget bore numerous holes. "A rushed budget bears many holes. Because of such holes the government needs to issue notification later to fix the weaknesses," Majid said at a meeting with businessmen in the port city of Chittagong. He said the NBR was going to unveil a "citizens' charter" on Jan 5 to protect the rights of the people when they deal with the tax issues. Majid said a series of discussion on budget could go on throughout the year to tailor the budget. Suggestions from the businesses and the donors could be incorporated in the budget through scrutiny to help the government avoid issuing post-budget notification for correction, he said. He asked the Chittagong businessmen to make their recommendations ahead of the next fiscal year's budget. "Such recommendations would be considered with importance in preparing the next budget," he said. The businessmen placed a set of recommendations to make the taxation process easier. The issues of modernisation of the laboratory at Chittagong Customs House, removing complexities in the pre-shipment inspection, setting up of a second yard for auction and replacement of the broken down scanning machine at Chittagong Shah Amanat Airport came up in the meeting. Reacting to the pleas, the NBR chief said: "We want to come out of various clauses and sub-clauses of the taxation laws." About the scanning machine at the Chittagong airport, the NBR chairman apologised to the businessmen and said: "I have talked to the civil aviation authorities for a new scanner." "Because of various procedures in the various government departments the installation took too much time," he said, adding that the replacement would be installed soon. He said they had a plan to bring the Chittgaong Customs House under automation system at a cost of Tk 7 crore. "Otherwise, the activities at the customs house would not get momentum," he said. bdnews24
