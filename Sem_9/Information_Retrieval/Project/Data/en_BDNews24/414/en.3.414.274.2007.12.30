 Libreville, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Africa's longest-serving leader, Gabon's President Omar Bongo, has named a new government four weeks after promising a change of team to fight corruption, but kept many of the previous cabinet. Marking his 40th anniversary in power at the start of December, Bongo denounced nepotism and "the race for illicit enrichment" that had poisoned public life and pledged to form a new "tightened-up" government of integrity and good governance. Naming his new ministers in a decree late on Friday, Prime Minister Jean Ndong cut the government to 41 members from 50 -- still a large number for a country of just 1.6 million people. The new lineup retained staunch Bongo allies in key portfolios and failed to include opposition politicians despite some speculation opponents could join the government. "This eagerly awaited government does not meet expectations because it is not sufficiently 'tightened-up'," said Vincent Ngoma, a Gabonese economist. "It looks like a continuation of the previous team, because it is difficult to overhaul the Gabonese political class," he said. Decades of oil exports have given Gabon one of Africa's highest per capita average incomes -- but most of it is concentrated among a rich elite including Bongo's family and allies, while most of the population live in poverty. Despite Bongo's promises to clean up public life, analysts had warned even for a leader facing little open opposition, he would have a tough time tackling vested interests in the establishment in the former French colony. Most key ministers were left in place or handed a new portfolio, with one major change for Richard Auguste Onouviet, who loses the powerful Mines, Energy and Oil Ministry to swap places with Casimir Oye Mba at Planning and Development. The reduction in ministerial ranks saw the previous 11 minister of state posts reduced to two, with Bongo's son Ali Bongo Ondimba among those losing out -- although he retained his strategic post of defence minister. Ali Bongo Ondimba is widely tipped as a possible successor to his father
