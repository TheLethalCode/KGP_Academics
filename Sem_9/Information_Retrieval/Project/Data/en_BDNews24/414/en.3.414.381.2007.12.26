 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri Wednesday said he resigned and turned in a resignation letter to the Cabinet Division over the theft of rare statues. The resignation was on "personal grounds", the adviser told bdnews24.com Wednesday night by phone. Later, he said: "I made hints of resignation when I talked to reporters the other day." "Although the artefacts went missing from a secure place like airport, I strongly felt I should step down as the head of the cultural affairs ministry," he said. The letter, addressed to president Iajuddin Ahmed, was handed over to the Cabinet Division at 4:30pm. The resignation came days after two Vishnu statues went missing from Zia International Airport. Quadri had earlier said he must take the responsibility for the lost artefacts as the head of the cultural affairs ministry. The adviser made broader hints of resignation Monday when he spoke to reporters on the theft of the artefacts. The interim government Tuesday cancelled a second consignment of artefacts and relics to Paris, which was up for display at the Guimet Museum. bdn
