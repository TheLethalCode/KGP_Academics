<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Fast delivery by banks could double the remittance inflow from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh Business Community (BBC) in Saudi Arabia said Sunday. "If banks can reach remittance within 24 to 48 hours, remittance will be doubled," Sharif Hossain, president of BBC in Saudi Arabia, told a news conference prior to the fourth Bangladesh single country trade fair scheduled to be held in Riyadh in March. He said some banks take 10 days to 30 days to remit money. "Money sent for Eid purpose is yet to be delivered to the recipient," an angry Hossain claimed. Remittance inflow is booming in Bangladesh. Between FY 2005-06 and 2006-07, remittances from non-resident Bangladeshis increased from $4.8 billion to $5.5 billion, a 25 percent rise in one year. About four million expatriates sent $2.2 billion in first five months to November of fiscal year 2007-08, according to Bangladesh Bank. Some two million Bangladeshis staying in Saudi Arabia sent 44 percent of the total remittance in the last fiscal year, Hossain revealed. "We've requested army chief General Moeen U Ahmed for steps to remove the barriers with the banks in sending remittances," he said. Moeen, who was in that country to perform hajj, had assured them that Trust Bank would facilitate the service, Hossain added. BBC in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh Embassy in Riyadh will jointly organise the five-day Bangladesh single country trade fair. Some 200 Bangladeshi stalls, 50 from the real estate companies, will be in the fair, organisers revealed. Hossain said Bangladeshi readymade garments and pharmaceuticals have huge market in Saudi Arabia. "The country can earn a lot by exporting non-conventional items like lungi and gamcha there to the Bangladesh and Indian community," Mukhlesur Rahman, another businessman said. b
