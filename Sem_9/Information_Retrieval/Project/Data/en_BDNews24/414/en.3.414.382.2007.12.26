<TITLE> Goa moves to protect tourists from violent protests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mumbai, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed police are to guard beachgoers in Goa after activists opposed to carving out industrial enclaves in India's tourist haven warned tourists to leave by Friday or face violent protests. Authorities in the western state have sought to play down the threat, saying tourists need not worry as extra security was being posted along its golden beaches as a "precaution" during the peak holiday season. "We have made it clear that, if anybody tries to indulge in any undesirable activity, we will act strongly," said J.P. Singh, Goa's most senior bureaucrat. "We will have 200-300 extra policemen provide protection to tourists," he told Reuters. The small coastal state has approved the creation of seven industrial enclaves. But opponents of the development, including the main opposition parties, say industry will damage the region's fragile ecology and hurt tourism, Goa's economic mainstay. "We are not happy holding the protest but we have no option because the government wouldn't listen to us," said Mathany Saldanha, convenor of the Goa Movement Against Special Economic Zones. "We don't want the tourists to face any trouble, so we are requesting them to leave by Friday." India is facing violent protests from farmers over compulsory acquisition of farmland to build hundreds of special economic zones, Chinese-style tax-free industrial enclaves to boost manufacturing and export growth and provide jobs. In the worst violence over attempts to acquire farmland for industry, more than 30 people have been killed in a village in eastern India since January. This resistance has galvanised farmers' opposition to similar projects across India. Usually around this time of year, security is tight in Goa on fears of a "Bali-like" attack, the 2002 bombings that killed 202 people, many of them holidaying foreigners, in the Indonesian island resort. Goa's pristine beaches and swaying palm groves attract nearly 400,000 tourists during the peak October-March season, and the state's languid lifestyle is seen as making it a soft target
