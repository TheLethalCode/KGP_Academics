 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) A gang has broken into pieces two Vishnu statues stolen from Zia International Airport, a senior RAB officer said Thursday. "We are now carrying out operations to retrieve the broken pieces of the statues," additional director general of RAB, Colonel Gulzar Uddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com. Gulzar said RAB Wednesday night arrested eight people with alleged ties to the theft of the artefacts. The RAB officer said Abbas, the suspected ringleader, led the cartel that smashed the artefacts into pieces. The arrested people admitted their links with the theft and five of them would be sent to court for confessional statement, Gulzar said. Gulzar's comments had earlier said the RAB obtained information on the whereabouts of the two missing statues. "We have information about who took the statues from the airport and the car that was used," he said. Earlier, 15 people were arrested and placed in remand for their alleged roles in the theft. Of the arrestees, three were officials of Air France's Dhaka office and seven were cargo handlers. Two statues of Vishnu, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum, disappeared from Zia International Airport. The incident came to light Dec 22. bdnew
