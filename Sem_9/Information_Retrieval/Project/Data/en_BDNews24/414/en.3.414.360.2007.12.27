 RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/BBC) - Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack after a rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Thursday, her party said. "She has been martyred," said party official Rehman Malik. Bhutto, 54, died in hospital in Rawalpindi. Ary-One Television said she had been shot in the head. Police said a suicide bomber fired shots at Bhutto as she was leaving the rally venue in a park before blowing himself up. "The man first fired at Bhutto's vehicle. She ducked and then he blew himself up," said police officer Mohammad Shahid. Police said 16 people had been killed in the blast. Earlier, party officials said Bhutto was safe. A Reuters witness said he saw bodies on a road as well as a mutilated human head. A suicide bomber killed nearly 150 people in an attack on Bhutto on October 18 as she paraded through the southern city of Karachi after returning home from eight years in self-imposed exile. BBC adds: Benazir has been killed in a presumed suicide attack, a military spokesman has announced on TV. Earlier reports said Benazir had only been injured and taken to hospital. Benazir had just addressed a pre-election rally in the town of Rawalpindi when the bomb went off. At least 15 other people are reported killed in the attack and several more were injured. Benazir had twice been the country's prime minister. She was campaigning ahead of elections due in January. 'She expired' The explosion occurred close to an entrance gate of the park in Rawalpindi where Benazir had been speaking. PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar initially said that Benazir was safe. But later he told the BBC that Benazir had died. Another member of the PPP, Wasif Ali Khan, told the Associated Press news agency from the Rawalpindi General Hospital: "At 6:16 pm (1316 GMT) she expired." Benazir returned from self-imposed exile in October after years out of Pakistan where she had faced corruption charges. Her return was the result of a power-sharing agreement with President Musharraf in which he granted an amnesty that covered the court cases she was facing. Since her return relations with Musharraf have broken down. On the day of her return she led a motor cavalcade through the city of Karachi. It was hit by a double suicide attack that left some 130 dead. The PPP has the largest support in the country. Earlier on Thursday at least four people were killed ahead of an election rally that Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was preparing to attend close to Rawalpindi. bd
