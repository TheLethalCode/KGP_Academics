<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A male cheerleader at a Japanese university killed himself after being bullied by other cheerleaders, media reports said on Wednesday. An investigation by authorities at Tokyo's Meiji University found violence was rife in the group, the reports said. Younger members were hit in the face, chased with fireworks and forced to eat grass, the Asahi newspaper said. The dead student, whose name has not been released, was forced to strip naked and videotaped by senior students, the Sankei newspaper reported. "I just wanted him to have a good time," the student's weeping father told TV Asahi on Tuesday. "It's so sad." Besides women cheerleaders, many Japanese colleges have mixed or male cheerleading teams. In the men's groups, their black uniforms, drums and salutes evoke their roots in the militarist 1920s. Meiji University's male cheerleading squad ceased activities in September after the student committed suicide in July, media said. The university could not be reached for comment. Bullying has long bedevilled Japan from schoolyards to workplaces. A government survey in November found 125,000 cases of bullying in elementary, middle and high schools in the year to March, but more cases are believed to go unreported
