 Sulaimaniya/Ankara, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish warplanes bombed Kurdish guerrilla targets in northern Iraq on Wednesday in their fourth such cross-border raid in five days, Turkey's general staff said on Wednesday. The Turkish military said its offensive against outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas inside Turkey and across the border in northern Iraq would continue. "Fighter jets belonging to the Turkish armed forces successfully hit targets belonging to the terrorist organisation in the early hours of December 26," the General Staff said in a statement, adding eight PKK hideouts were hit in the Zap valley.

Up to several hundred ground troops as well as long-range artillery have also been involved in the brief cross-border raids. Turkey says its strikes are aimed at PKK guerrillas based in northern Iraq. Hundreds of civilians have fled villages in the border area. The Iraqi government and US forces say they support Turkey's right to strike back at PKK militants but want any action to be coordinated with them and small in scale to avoid destabilising northern Iraq. The United States is providing NATO-member Turkey with intelligence on the PKK in northern Iraq. Ankara blames the PKK -- considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union -- for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began an armed struggle for a separate Kurdish homeland in 1984.
