 Savar, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The RAB retrieved Friday all the broken pieces of one of the two stolen Lord Vishnu statues and a few pieces of the other. The remains of the rare relics were recovered from the heaps of rubbish in Baliarpur on the eastern fringe of Modhumati Model Town near Dhaka-Aricha highway. During a day-long search, the workers recovered a total of 27 pieces, the officials said. The statue would be re-assembled according to the picture and map, an official of the Bangladesh National Museum said on condition of anonymity. Earlier in the afternoon, Swapan Kumar Biswas, acting keeper of the museum, visited the scene and confirmed to reporters that two of the 12 pieces were parts of the Vishnu images that had gone missing from Zia International Airport. Later, the workers got the other pieces of the statues. Deputy commander Major Khairul Amin of RAB-1 said they retrieved the pieces of the rare archaeological artefacts in a long search since 10am Friday. The RAB officer said they retrieved parts of head, body, feet and fingers of the statues. Conservation chemist of the museum Shafiqul Alam visited the scene and examined the pieces. "It is almost confirmed that the retrieved pieces are the parts of the missing statues," he said. However, National Museum director general Samar Chandra Pal Friday evening said he would not confirm that the recovered pieces were the parts of the missing statues. "We are primarily certain that the pieces recovered are of the missing statues. But it would not be right now to give a final decision since raids are on in some other areas apart from Savar. It would be possible after the operations end," he said. Separately, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said they knew the identities of the people behind the theft. "We have identified the thieves and their patrons. We are seriously investigating the matter and many important information have surfaced. "We have information that many important people are involved with it. But we are not revealing details for the investigation. We will officially unveil everything after we finish our investigation," he told reporters. The Bangladesh and the French government had earlier signed a loan agreement to transfer rare Bangladeshi artefacts to Paris for an exhibition in Guimet Museum. Guimet Museum authorities has cancelled the exhibition of the Bangladeshi artefacts. Bangladesh sent 42 items, in a first shipment, to Paris for the exhibition scheduled for January. But the government decided not to send the second consignment following disappearance of two Vishnu statues from the airport. Their disappearance was discovered on Dec 22, as a second consignment of artefacts was handed over to Air France authorities for transport to Paris. Archaeologists, historians and cultural groups in Bangladesh however had protested the transport of the rare archaeological artefacts to France, saying the proper measures were not being taken by authorities to protect them. Bangladesh authorities and the French embassy in Dhaka were in some disagreement after two rare statues went missing. Shouldering the responsibility for the missing artefacts, cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri resigned Wednesday. bdnews24.com/co
