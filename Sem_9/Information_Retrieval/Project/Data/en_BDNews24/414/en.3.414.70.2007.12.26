<TITLE> EC will seek HC ruling on BNP invitation: Sohul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will seek advice from the High Court on inviting either of the two BNP factions to dialogue on electoral reforms, election commissioner Mohammad Sohul Hossain said Wednesday. "We will invite the faction the court asks us to," the commissioner told reporters in his office. Sohul said the main election office would petition to the High Court for permission after the court reopens. The EC had earlier invited the Saifur Rahman-led faction to talks on electoral reforms. The High Court on Nov 18 put a freeze on the invitation for two weeks after a writ petition filed by the pro-Khaleda faction. The court also wanted to know why the invitation letter would not be declared illegal. In line with the EC schedule, the dialogue between BNP and the EC was set for Nov 22. . Replying to a question on making expatriate Bangladeshis voters, Sohul said the commission would speak to the chief adviser on the matter this week. "We will tell him how we want to do the job. If the government agrees, the law has to be amended." He said they had decided to initially award voting rights to Bangladeshis living only in England. They might collect the voter registration forms from Bangladesh High Commission. Information given on the forms would be examined before sending them to the Bangladeshi High Commission again, Sohul added. Four registration centres would be opened in England to take pictures and fingerprints of the voters. The expatriates would cast their vote using postal ballots, he said. Sohul said the EC would start re-demarcating the border of election constituencies in January by using Geographical Information Technology. There would be no changes to the constituencies in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari, he added. On when the EC would ask the government to lift emergency, Sohul said: "We'll inform the government as soon as we'll be ready for the elections. We'll inform the people as well. It is the government that will take the decision on [lifting] the emergency." bdne
