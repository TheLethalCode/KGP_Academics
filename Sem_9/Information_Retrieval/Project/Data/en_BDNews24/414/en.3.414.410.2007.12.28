 MOSCOW, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin called the death of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan on Thursday "a barbaric act of terrorism", Russian news agencies reported. "This was a challenge issued by the forces of terrorism not only to Pakistan, but the entire international community," news agency Interfax quoted Putin as saying. "We hope that the organisers of this crime are found and punished accordingly." Benazir was killed in a gun and bomb attack as she left a rally ahead of an election due on Jan. 8.
