<TITLE> Trial of war criminals needs broader consensus: Dr Kamal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain Wednesday said trying war criminals was a "national challenge" and they must not be let off the hook for political gains. He however said a broad consensus was needed to try the war criminals. "It is a national challenge and must be achieved through a national consensus," Dr Kamal said at a discussion at the city's Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. "War criminals, miscreants and terrorists must not be spared for the sake of vote." The eminent lawyer also warned that any platform should not try to make an effort to capitalise on the issue for narrow political gains. Dr Kamal's party, which lacks broad support from people, organised the discussion to urge citizens to build a consensus on many burning issues the nation is facing. He was critical of the alleged appointment of inefficient teachers to educational institutions, including public universities. Dr Kamal blamed substandard education on inefficient teachers. The appointment of teachers on political considerations is destroying the education sector, he said. He advised the interim government to listen to the people's voices, especially when it deals with the soaring prices of daily commodities. The issue is important as the government needs to hold elections in 12 months from now in a peaceful manner, he said. "Some politicians with ill-intent may cash in on the issue to create political instability," he said. bdnews
