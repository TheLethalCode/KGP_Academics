 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  RAB officers Thursday claimed that they had retrieved some broken pieces of the two missing Vishnu statues, but museum authorities said they were not the remains of the images of the Hindu god. A senior RAB officer had earlier said a gang broke into pieces the two Vishnu statues stolen from Zia International Airport. "We are now carrying out operations to retrieve the broken pieces of the statues," additional director general of RAB, Colonel Gulzar Uddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com. In a press briefing, the RAB intelligence unit chief Lt Col Asif Ahmed Ansari said: "We have recovered eight broken pieces of the statues. But we cannot say whether those are the remains of the lost Vishnu statues." Bangladesh National Museum's acting keeper Dr Swapan Biswas said the recovered remains were not of the lost Vishnu statues. He said the confirmation was based on multiple examinations of the broken pieces the RAB seized. Gulzar said RAB arrested eight people Wednesday night with alleged ties to the theft of the artefacts. The RAB officer claimed that Abbas, the suspected ringleader, led the cartel that smashed the artefacts into pieces. The arrested people admitted their links with the theft and five of them would be sent to court for confessional statement, Gulzar said. Gulzar had earlier said the RAB obtained information on the whereabouts of the missing statues. "We have information about who took the statues from the airport and the car that was used," he said. Earlier, 15 people were arrested and placed in remand for their alleged roles in the theft. Of the arrestees, three were officials of Air France's Dhaka office and seven were cargo handlers. Two statues of Vishnu, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum, disappeared from Zia International Airport. The incident came to light Dec 22. bdnew
