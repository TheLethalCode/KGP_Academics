 Johanneaburg, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tanzania's ambassador to South Africa was beaten and his wife stabbed and wounded in a robbery during his farewell dinner in the capital Pretoria late on Friday, police said. Police spokesman Paul Ramaloko said seven people were admitted to hospital after the attack at the home of a fellow Tanzanian that left ambassador Emmanuel Mwambulukutu unconscious and his wife with a stab wound to the head. "They were attacked by four heavily armed suspects but we managed to arrest one suspect. We are hoping to make more arrests soon," he said on Saturday. South Africa has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world, and attacks on high-profile figures, including diplomats, have sparked new calls for a crackdown on violent crime. A Vietnamese embassy official was shot and wounded by armed robbers at his home in Pretoria in October, while Dumisani Kumalo, South Africa's Ambassador to the United Nations was robbed at gunpoint at his son's home in July
