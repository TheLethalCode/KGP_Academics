<TITLE> Japan PM says to consider cabinet reshuffle soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JINAN, China, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Saturday that he would consider whether to reshuffle his cabinet early next year. Japanese media have reported that Fukuda was considering reshuffling his cabinet in mid-January in a bit to push up his sagging popularity. "At present, it is a blank paper," Fukuda told Japanese reporters travelling with him on his four-day visit to China. "I will think about it after taking into account next year's schedule following New Year's Day." Noting that some lawmakers from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party want him to change the lineup of his cabinet, Fukuda said: "While listening to their opinions, I will think about what to do. I will think about it next year." When Fukuda succeeded Shinzo Abe as prime minister in late September, he kept most of the ministers from the Abe cabinet. Fukuda's support has fallen below 35 percent in recent voter polls from an initial high of 60 percent, after problems with the public pensions system. PROCUREMENT SCANDAL A high-profile procurement scandal involving a former top Defence Ministry official has also weighed on popularity levels. No lower house election need be called until September 2009, but Fukuda is free to call one earlier. "Considering various political and policy issues for next year, I wonder if a clear-cut timing will come so easily," he said. "Frankly speaking, I have no idea." Analysts and lawmakers say Fukuda could call one early next year if political stalemate over legislation to resume Japan's naval mission supporting U.S. and other ships patrolling the Indian Ocean in search of militants and drug runners deepens. Fukuda has vowed to resume the mission, which Washington says is vital to its war on terrorism in and around Afghanistan, but opposition parties are against it and the mission has been suspended since its mandate expired on Nov. 1. "Isn't there a terrorist threat? Yes, there is," he said. "Japan should get back to the starting point and think once again if it is alright to renounce its mission." Japanese politics were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa discussed a coalition with Fukuda then tendered his resignation when his party executives rejected the idea. He decided to stay on after Democratic lawmakers, fearing he might defect to the ruling camp, begged him not to quit.
