 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks closed lower Thursday amid banking sector shares continuing to lead the trading. "Banks are the best payout in this market for investors as they (banks) maintain the most transparent accounts and the investors have confidence in them as they are regulated by both the central bank and the SEC," said Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of AIMS Bangladesh. The market opened with a decline in the general index. It, however, recovered losses immediately to decline again in the midday sessions. The market remained more or less stable with a slight increase in the ending. "The ups and downs of the market do not necessarily mean anything other than indicating that the market is stabilising," said Sayeed. The DGEN or general index closed 24.78 points or 0.81 percent down at 3003.87. The DSI or all share price index shed 23.47 points or 0.92 percent to 2523.23.

Losers beat gainers 118 to 89 and some 18 issues remained unchanged. UCBL continued to emerge at the peak of the top share board by value. It fell 10.43 percent to Tk 3989 although the bank Wednesday declared Jan 10 for its pending AGMs of the years between 2003 and 2005. "UCBL decided to retain its previous book closure, which means no bonus shares against the ordinary shares," said Sayeed. The bank's board of directors Wednesday recommended nine bonus shares for every ten ordinary shares. Market major Square Pharma continued to rise from Wednesday. It closed 1.73 percent high at Tk 3546.50. Prime Bank followed Square Pharma. It fell 1.42 percent to Tk 917.75.
