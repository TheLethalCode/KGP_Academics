 NAIROBI, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Early tallies by Kenyan broadcasters showed President Mwai Kibaki trailing his main rival on Friday in the country's closest-fought election since independence in 1963. Partial results from three main television stations all gave opposition challenger Raila Odinga a commanding lead over his former ally, although a separate exit poll put Kibaki ahead in the race for the top job in east Africa's biggest economy. Were Odinga to win, this would make Kibaki the first of Kenya's three sitting presidents to be ousted by the ballot box in the 44 years since British colonial rule ended. The unofficial results by the TV channels were compiled from tallies at counting centres. The latest, from KTN at 09:45 a.m. (0645 GMT), gave Odinga 1,170,330 votes to 807,530 for Kibaki. As official counting went on slowly at a Nairobi conference centre ringed by armed guards, the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) released provisional results from two of the country's 210 constituencies. One chose Odinga and the other picked the president, both by large majorities in a reflection of Kenya's tribal allegiances. Officials said formal results would trickle in throughout Friday, but the process could stretch into Saturday. Observers said Thursday's voting had gone smoothly, despite sporadic violence and allegations of rigging by both sides. An exit poll by the Institute for Education in Democracy, a respected non-governmental organisation, gave the president 50.3 percent versus 40.7 for Odinga. However, its figures were based on just 311 polling stations of a total of 27,000. "It is still early stages yet," Ngari Gituku, a spokesman for Kibaki's Party of National Unity told Reuters. "Counting is rather slow so it is still too early to call. About 14 million Kenyans were eligible to vote, although turnout is expected to have been between 8 and 10 million. Local TV said several prominent figures were on the verge of losing their parliamentary seats, including the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai and Vice-President Moody Awori, as well as the current ministers of health, roads and information. Another big name, Kamlesh Pattni, a tycoon accused of being the architect of a graft scandal that nearly ruined Kenya's economy, also looked set to lose his bid to win a Nairobi seat. 'ENVY OF AFRICA' Voters throughout the country, from its Indian Ocean coast to its lush green highlands and northern reaches touching Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan, turned out enthusiastically on Thursday, forming long queues everywhere. Each side had accused the other during the run-up of trying to rig the polls, but ECK Chairman Samuel Kivuitu criticised them sharply for making their complaints in public. "We have done the best we could do in the circumstances," Kivuitu told reporters before dawn on Friday. "Let the people of Kenya decide. Anything else is just stories." Local media broadly praised his commission -- while hoping the eventual losers would accept the final results gracefully. "The ECK has run elections with efficiency and independence that should be the envy of the rest of Africa," the Daily Nation newspaper said in an editorial. Diplomats say the poll was only the second truly democratic one in a nation that votes largely on tribal and geographic lines and spent 39 years under single-party rule broken only by Kibaki's landslide victory in 2002. Kibaki, 76, wants a second five-year term before retiring to his highland tea farm after a political career that has spanned Kenya's post-independence history. With a record of average economic growth of 5 percent, he has the support of his Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's largest and most economically powerful, but trailed narrowly in pre-vote polls. Odinga, 62, wants to be the first in his Luo tribe to take the country's top job. That was the unrealised dream of his father, Kenya's first vice-president, whose falling out with founding President Jomo Kenyatta seeded the Luo-Kikuyu rivalry. Kibaki came to power after Odinga allied with him in 2002, but the two had a bitter split that echoed histo
