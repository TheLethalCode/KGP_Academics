 ISLAMABAD, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A four-member Pakistani police team is investigating the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto with the help of security agencies. A judicial team is also investigating. Former prime minister Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack as she left an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Thursday.

Investigators reconstructed a mangled human head found at the scene of the attack, apparently that of the suicide bomber, as well as severed fingers. DNA tests were being done to see if the head and fingers belonged to the same person but police have not commented further.

One was a clean-cut young man wearing sun glasses, a white shirt and dark waist coat. Behind him stood a man with a white shawl over his head, who Dawn said was believed to be the bomber.
