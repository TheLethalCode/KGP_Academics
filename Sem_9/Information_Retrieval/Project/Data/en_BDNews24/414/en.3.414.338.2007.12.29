 AMSTERDAM, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN war crimes tribunal on Saturday ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of a former Croatian police commander to the Hague after he violated the terms of his provisional release by going on a hunting trip. Mladen Markac, who headed the country's special police, is charged with responsibility for war crimes against Serb civilians including persecution, inhumane acts, plunder, murder and wanton destruction. He had been on provisional release in Croatia since December 2004. "The Judge requested the arrest due to the accused having violated the conditions of his provisional release by leaving his designated residence without due permission," the tribunal said in a statement. Judges have asked the Croatian government to transfer Markac to the court's detention unit on Dec. 30. Photos of Markac out hunting wild boars in Bilogora a few days before Christmas appeared in Croatian media. "The competent authorities of the Republic of Croatia had not reported any breach of provisional release conditions to the Registry or the Trial Chamber by Dec. 27," the court said in its statement, adding it then contacted the Croatian government for confirmation. Markac is jointly accused alongside former Croatian commander Ivan Cermak and Croatian General Ante Gotovina of participating in a "joint criminal enterprise" to drive the ethnic Serb population from the Krajina region of Croatia in 1995. The start of trial has not yet been scheduled.
