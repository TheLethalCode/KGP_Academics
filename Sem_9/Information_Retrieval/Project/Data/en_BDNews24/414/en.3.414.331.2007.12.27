 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  France has accepted Bangladesh's decision not to go ahead with the display of ancient artefacts at the Guimet Museum and cancelled the scheduled exhibition in Paris. France also assured Bangladesh in a statement Thursday that it would extend all cooperation in carrying out investigations into the theft of two rare images of Lord Vishnu. The French embassy in Dhaka has informed Guimet Museum authorities of the Bangladesh request to send back the 42 artefacts and relics from Paris. "France takes note of the sovereign decision of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to cancel the loan agreements between the Guimet Museum in Paris and various cultural institutions in Bangladesh," the French government said in a statement issued through its mission in Dhaka. "We fully respect this decision while regretting the cancellation of an event likely to enhance the cultural presence of Bangladesh throughout the world." "France reaffirms its readiness to carry on its cooperation with the People's Republic of Bangladesh in the friendly manner that has always prevailed," the statement from Paris said. The Guimet Museum has been informed of the decision of Bangladesh and of the request to send back the forty two items already in the museum, said a separate statement Thursday, issued by the French Embassy in Dhaka. "The artefacts are being crated. The Guimet Museum should be contacted directly if more information is sought." Considering the complex situation and the ongoing investigations, the French embassy, while fully cooperating with the investigating authorities, will wait for the results of these investigations before holding any new press conference, said the statement. The Bangladesh government and the French embassy in Dhaka had earlier signed a loan agreement to transfer rare Bangladeshi artefacts to Paris for the exhibition. In a first shipment, 42 items were taken to Paris for the exhibition scheduled for January. Archaeologists, historians and cultural groups in Bangladesh however had protested the transport of the rare archaeological artefacts to France, saying the proper measures were not being taken by authorities to protect them. Bangladesh authorities and the French embassy in Dhaka were in some disagreement after two rare statues of Lord Vishnu went missing from Zia International Airport. Their disappearance was discovered on Dec 22, as a second consignment of artefacts was handed over to Air France authorities for transport to Paris. The Bangladesh government decided not to send the second consignment following the disappearance of the statues. Shouldering the responsibility for the missing artefacts, cultural affairs adviser Ayub Quadri resigned Wednesday. The French embassy was scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday but cancelled it after the statement was issued from Paris. bdnews
