 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A group of politicians Saturday launched a new party, Bangladesh Naya Somaj Dal, the latest in a series launched amid the state of emergency since Jan 11. Rezaul Karim Talukder, chairman of the party, announced the name of the party from a press conference at the National Press Club. "We will release a draft on the organogram of the party at the beginning of the next year," he said. "The main ideology of the party will be democracy, welfare economy, religious freedom and fundamental human rights," Talukder said. "The country cannot afford to go back to the pre-Jan 11 period. The party will be formed not with the mostly known political parties, but with artists, journalists, teachers, lawyers and workers," he said. "Our aim is to fight against corruption and injustice and establish democracy." Talukder sought cooperation and support from countrymen. He made Amin Ahmed Chowdhury general secretary and Panna Chowdhury vice president of the party. Up to 40 leaders and activists joined the programme. A number of new parties, including National People's Party of Sheikh Shawkat Hossain Nilu, Progressive Democratic Party of Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi, Bangladesh Guardian Party of ATM Shafiuddin and Bangladesh Welfare Party of Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, have been launched since the state of emergency. bdnew
