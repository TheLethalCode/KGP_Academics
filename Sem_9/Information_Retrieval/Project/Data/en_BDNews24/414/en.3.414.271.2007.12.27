 Tabassum Zakaria CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush condemned the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Thursday, an act of violence that shredded U.S. efforts to promote democratic elections in a key ally in Bush's war on terrorism. "The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy. Those who committed this crime must be brought to justice," Bush said in a statement to reporters at his Texas ranch. Bhutto, 54, was killed in a gun and bomb attack after a rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Thursday. "The attack shows that there are still those in Pakistan trying to undermine reconciliation and democratic development," a U.S. State Department official said. The United States had been instrumental in Bhutto's return to Pakistan, working to convince President Pervez Musharraf to give up his role as military leader and accept elections and a power-sharing arrangement with Bhutto, a former prime minister. The Western-educated Bhutto was seen as a moderate who would support the U.S. struggle against al Qaeda and Taliban extremists believed to have taken refuge along Pakistan's lawless frontier with Afghanistan. A suicide bomber targeted her motorcade when she gave up life in exile in October and returned to Pakistan. The attack killed 139 people. Her relationship with Musharraf frayed after that, but the United States continued to support her as a central figure in its efforts to promote a democratic transition in Pakistan. It pressured Musharraf to release her from house arrest, which he had imposed to prevent her from leading a protest, and it sent Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte to try to revive a political deal between Bhutto and Musharraf in November.
