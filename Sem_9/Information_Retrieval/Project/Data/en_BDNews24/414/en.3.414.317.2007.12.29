 Lima, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peru's president on Friday defended a former military leader named in an Italian probe into a 1970s crackdown on leftists by South American military rulers. An Italian judge issued arrest warrants this week for 146 South Americans suspected of involvement in "Operation Condor," a secret pact among several regimes to coordinate operations to kill political opponents, including allowing death squads to cross borders. One of the suspects is Peruvian Gen. Francisco Morales Bermudez, 86, who governed Peru from 1975-80. "I think we're seeing a kind of judicial exaggeration in the world," Peruvian President Alan Garcia said. "That's why we see a judge who wants to get attention and grab headlines worldwide. "We've seen several cases like this and I think that we, as Peruvians, must defend the person who brought democracy back to Peru," Garcia said. Morales Bermudez, the second military leader to rule Peru after a coup in 1968, initiated the country's return to democracy by convoking a constitutional assembly that called free elections in 1980. Human rights groups say that during Morales Bermudez's rule the military kidnapped four foreigners who either vanished or turned up dead. The Italian warrants were issued for Argentines, Bolivians, Brazilians, Chileans, Paraguayans, Peruvians and Uruguayans, including former Argentine dictator Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla and former Uruguayan leader Juan Bordaberry. Those named are suspected in the deaths of 25 Italian citizens killed in Latin America in the 1970s. Italian magistrates can investigate the murder of Italian citizens overseas. Morales Bermudez defended himself on Thursday night. "Peru, neither the country nor the government, never participated in Operation Condor ... . There were no assassinations or anything else here," he told local radio. Under Operation Condor, a joint information center was set up at the headquarters of Chile's notorious secret police in Santiago. Rights groups say the U.S. government knew of and supported the operation. On Monday, Italian police arrested one person on the list, a former Uruguayan military official, Jorge Troccoli, whose lawyer said he had turned himself into authorities. The lawyer said Troccoli was innocent and had only followed orders. Brazilian newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo cited Italian public prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo as saying on Thursday that extradition requests would be filed shortly
