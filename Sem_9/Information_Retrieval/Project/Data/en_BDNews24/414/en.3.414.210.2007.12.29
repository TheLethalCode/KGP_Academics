<TITLE> Madonna directing debut set for Berlin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/Hollywood Reporter) - Her movie career did not amount to much, but Madonna will hope for better luck behind the camera when her directing debut makes its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in February. "Filth and Wisdom," which has been described as a low-budget music-based comedy, stars Richard E. Grant, Stephen Graham ("Gangs of New York") and Eugene Hutz, the Ukrainian frontman for gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello. It is among 50 films screening in the Panorama sidebar at the festival, which runs February 7-17, organizers said Thursday. After a promising starring role in "Desperately Seeking Susan," Madonna lost her way with such flops as "Shanghai Surprise" and "Swept Away," which was directed by her husband, Guy Ritchie. On the recording front, she is expected to release a new studio album next year.
