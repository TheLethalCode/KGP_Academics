<TITLE> Tigers try to stay alive </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will look to stay in the series after a disappointing defeat in the first match when they take on New Zealand in the second ODI at McLean Park, Napier Friday. The match starts at 4:00am Bangladesh standard time with satellite channel SAB telecasting the match live. The team management will hope the middle order batsmen have learnt a thing or two from their mistakes in the series opener in Auckland. The top order had justified the team strategy which was not to lose too many wickets in 20 overs with skipper Mohammad Ashraful (70) and opener Tamim Iqbal (50) providing the middle order with the footing to rack up 270-odd runs. But the Tigers slipped to 154 for seven from 150 for four and eventually folded up at 201 despite a strong hope of posting runs. The team management has made one change to add some solidity in the middle order, drafting in Tushar Imran, who has recovered from a shoulder injury, in the place of Mehrab Hossain Junior, according to tigercricket.com, the website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Ashraful should see the middle-order collapse as a new problem and would want consistent performances from the batsmen. He would also need not to throw his wicket after doing all the hard work and settling down as he had done in the first match. After the first game, Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons said the batsmen got their strategy wrong and did not focus on staying at the crease for 50 overs. "Ashraful and Tamim seemed to make it look pretty easy but the two guys threw it away. If you get those sorts of starts you can't afford to fall away that badly. We broke a few team rules, so we'll talk about that and hopefully make sure it doesn't happen again," said Siddons, according to cricinfo. On Thursday morning, the Tigers took the one-hour flight from Auckland to Napier and had a light hour and a half's training session which was followed by swimming. On the other hand, the Black Caps will also be looking to seal the series Friday with a match to go, after their disappointing performances against South Africa and Australia. Kiwi skipper Daniel Vettori would certainly have some plans to restrict his opposing captain as early as possible as he sees Ashraful (who scored a 57-ball 70) a threat for the whole series. "I thought he (Ashraful) was pretty outstanding," said Vettori after the first match. "It sort of reminded us of some of the world class players going round at the moment in his ability to hit good balls for fours and sixes consistently. He's obviously got an amazing eye and is going to be a major threat to us the whole series." Bangladesh squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Zunaed Siddique, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Tushar Imran, Farhad Reza, Mushfiqur Rahim (wicketkeeper), Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak and Shahadat Hossain. New Zealand (From): Daniel Vettori (captain), Brendon McCullum (wicketkeeper), Jamie How, Peter Fulton, Scott Styris , Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Chris Martin, Jeetan Patel b
