 MELBOURNE, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A dominant Australia eased to a comprehensive 337-run first test victory over India on Saturday when they dismissed the visitors for 161 in the final session of the fourth day. The Australians, who have won 15 successive tests, exploited a wearing pitch to restrict the scoring while they chipped away at India's vaunted batting line-up, capturing the 10 wickets needed for victory with more than a day to spare. "We played excellent cricket all the way through," Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters. "To walk off the field at the end of day four with a 337-run win against a very good Indian team is obviously very satisfying." Vangipurappu Laxman top-scored for India with 42 and Saurav Gangly added 40 but the tourists never looked like getting anywhere near the 499 runs needed for victory. All Australia's bowlers contributed to their victory with Mitchell Johnson taking 3-21 off 15 overs, while Stuart Clark took two wickets, bowled nine maidens and conceded just 20 runs off his 15 overs. "I wish I knew what went wrong," India captain Anil Kumble said. "It was important that we batted sessions (on Saturday) and our batting didn't stand up. "It was a difficult wicket to bat on but once you got in it was difficult to get out as well so it was important that we hung in there. "It was a matter of adjusting, which we didn't do enough. Credit to the way Australia bowled and the pressure they built." SWELTERING HEAT The Australians, who were outstanding with the ball and in the field, blasted through any semblance of Indian resistance after tea with the capture of three wickets in four balls highlighting their dominance. Wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni was the first wicket to fall after the break when he was caught by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist off Mitchell Johnson for 11 before India imploded. Kumble was dismissed in the same fashion for eight, while Harbhajan Singh was then run out, without facing a ball, on the first ball of the next over from Brad Hogg when Ganguly sent him back. Ganguly, who had sought medical treatment during the middle session because of the sweltering heat, was trapped in front by Hogg two balls later to leave the Indians on 157-9. Johnson ended the match when he clean bowled Rudra Pratap Singh for two shortly afterwards. All of the top-order batsmen, apart from Laxman and Ganguly were unable to push on after making starts and they were strangled by the Australians from the outset on Saturday with their total not reaching 50 until the 32nd over. The next match in the four-test series, where the Australians will be seeking a world record-equalling 16th successive victory, begins on Jan. 2 in Sydney
