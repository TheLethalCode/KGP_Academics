<TITLE> Tigers look for Test confidence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh take on New Zealand in the third and final one-dayer Monday with the hope of getting some confidence ahead of the two-Test series. The match starts at 4am Bangladesh standard time with satellite channel SAB telecasting the match from Queenstown Events Center in Queenstown. Bangladesh have already lost the series 2-0 with a match to spare and will want to push the Kiwis, who have turned back against the Tigers after their disappointing series against South Africa and Australia. The visitors have a lot of concern over their middle order, which failed to keep the momentum in the first two games despite solid starts by the top order. Coach Jamie Siddons was understandably pleased with the top order, but was concerned with the middle order. "We have two good openers who are doing the job for me every day. Ashraful has moved up to number three which is a great positive for us if he can hold his spot up there," said Siddons after Friday's match in Napier. "The batsmen have to be aware that once we lose one wicket we shouldn't lose two. Three for five is unacceptable and I've told them that," said the Australian. Siddons also expects better effort from the bowlers, who allowed the hosts to post a huge 335 for five, New Zealand's second highest score against Bangladesh, in the previous match. "If the ball is not swinging or spinning, which it really didn't today (Friday) apart from the early overs where I think we bowled really well today, then it is a problem" "The pace is also not there. The first two bowlers are bowling around 132-133 kmph and not 140s. It's really hard to contain when you can't bounce and there were not too many get-out balls." Siddons, however, said his side had no pretensions about upstaging their opposition. On the other hand, New Zealand are determined to make a clean sweep of Bangladesh and grow in confidence ahead of the Test series. "Rhythm, momentum going into the Test series, the goal is to continue building confidence and lift our performance from the other two games, setting the bar a little bit higher each time," the Black Caps coach John Bracwell was quoted by New Zealand Herald as saying. "For us, confidence and self-assessment is extremely important. It's not necessarily important what the opposition is doing, it's what we're doing and I think we can still lift the bar." Mark Gillespie, the right-arm medium-pacer, remains a doubt after aggravating his left shoulder in Napier and will be assessed before the match. Michael Mason could get a game on a track that traditionally favours seam bowling. It is unlikely that off-spinner Jeetan Patel will play, according to cricinfo.com. Inclement summer weather, however, disrupted practice on the eve of the final game and more is forecast on game day, but the mood remained upbeat in the Kiwi camp. Bangladesh (12-man): Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Tushar Imran, Mushfiqur Rahim, Farhad Reza, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain and Javed Omar. New Zealand (12-man): Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Michael Mason, Chris Martin and Jeetan Patel. b
