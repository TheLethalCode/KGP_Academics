<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks snapped a four-session winning streak on Thursday as investors locked in profits on recent gainers such as property firm Mitsui Fudosan in holiday-thinned trade, with Tokyo set to end the year as the world's worst-performing major stock market. One bright spot was Canon Inc, which gained despite a fall in the overall market after hiking its dividend outlook. The benchmark Nikkei average appears headed to end the year down nearly 10 percent, the first annual fall in five years, as Japanese stocks struggle in the shadow of booming markets and vibrant economies elsewhere in Asia. Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at the equity management department at Daiwa SB Investments, said investors took a breather after the four-day winning run, with additional downward pressure coming from a lack of trading factors and a shortage of participants. "The focus now shifts to US economic data and US and Japanese corporate earnings due to come out early next year," he said. "Global stock markets generally rebounded this week, but window dressing had a lot to do with the gains, and the New Year may see a week start." Yutaka Miura, deputy manager of the equity information department at Shinko Securities, said investors cannot be bullish enough to keep buying stocks as uncertainty remains about the U.S. market and currency moves after the New Year holiday. The benchmark Nikkei average finished the day down 0.6 percent or 88.85 points at 15,564.69. It had gained more than 4 percent in a four-day winning run. The broader TOPIX index shed 0.6 percent or 8.53 points to 1,499.94. Dealings were slow on the next-to-last trading day of the year, with 1.4 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, compared with last month's daily average of 2.3 billion. Declining shares beat advancing ones by a ratio of two to one. PROPERTY, SHIPPING FIRMS SOLD Shares of Mitsui Fudosan lost 2 percent to 2,465 yen, while Sumitomo Realty & Development Co Ltd declined 2.3 percent to 2,825 yen and Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd fell 1.1 percent to 2,720 yen. Other recent winners also came under pressure. Shipping firms Nippon Yusen KK shed 2.2 percent to 895 yen, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd gave up 2.4 percent to 1,452 yen and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd lost 2.9 percent to 1,126 yen. Exporters also fell. Industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd fell 0.6 percent to 11,050 yen and Honda Motor Co Ltd was down 1.1 percent at 3,780 yen. Canon advanced 0.2 percent to 5,340 yen after it said it had raised its annual dividend forecast by 10 yen to 110 yen per share. Another notable stock was Central Japan Railway Co The stock tumbled 6.9 percent to 959,000 yen after it said it would fund at its own expense a new $45 billion "maglev" bullet train line it plans between Tokyo and Nago
