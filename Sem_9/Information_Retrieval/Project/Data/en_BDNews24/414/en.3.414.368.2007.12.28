 Karachi, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/AKI/Reuters)  An al Qaeda leader based in Afghanistan has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, according to Italian news agency Adnkronos International (AKI). "We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat [the] mujahadeen," al Qaeda's commander and main spokesperson Mustafa Abu Al-Yazid told AKI in a phone call from an unknown location, the news agency reported Thursday. Al-Yazid is described as "the main al Qaeda commander in Afghanistan" by AKI, who also reported that the decision to kill Benazir was made by al Qaeda No 2, the Egyptian doctor, Ayman al-Zawahiri in October. Al Qaeda is seen as the chief suspect in the murder of former Pakistani prime minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, standing to gain by preserving its remote stronghold, undermining President Pervez Musharraf and destabilising the country, US government and private analysts have said. The militant group, which has rebuilt its command structure on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was blamed for a previous attempt on Benazir and it has denounced her as an instrument of US policy in Pakistan. Al Qaeda's second in command Zawahri earlier this month denounced Benazir's return as a US-orchestrated manoeuvre. "Everything that is going on in Pakistan, from the arrangement for the return of Benazir to the declaration of the state of emergency ... to repressive measures, is a desperate American attempt to remedy the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan," Zawahri said in an interview with al Qaeda's media arm. Bush administration officials have said it was too early to identify a clear suspect in Thursday's assassination. But one US official said: "There are a number of extremist groups within Pakistan that could have carried out the attack ... Al Qaeda has got to be one of the groups at the top of this list." Al Qaeda's Taliban ally, which has publicly threatened Benazir, was another potential suspect, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One analyst said al Qaeda supporters in Pakistan's security services may have also played a role, but it was unlikely Musharraf himself was involved. Killing Benazir undermines Musharraf, viewed by the United States as an essential ally against terrorism, by eliminating the prospect of a power-sharing agreement between the two that could shore up his deteriorating political standing and stabilise the country, the analysts said. That in turn reduces chances that Musharraf can revive efforts to drive al Qaeda and the Taliban out of the remote Waziristan tribal areas. It also fans popular suspicions against Musharraf and sows general confusion. "Their (al Qaeda's) motivation for doing this is entirely clear," said David Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "They have the most to gain." Benazir was assassinated by a suicide bomber after an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi, a two weeks before national elections meant to return Pakistan to a civilian-led democracy. Her death follows a failed assassination attempt in October as she returned from exile to Pakistan. She blamed that attempt on four groups including al Qaeda and the Taliban.
