 Sulaimaniya, Iraq, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish warplanes struck northern Iraq on Wednesday but inflicted no casualties in the latest in a series of small-scale strikes, a spokesman for Iraqi Kurdish security forces said. Jabbar Yawar, spokesman for Peshmerga security forces of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, said the strike lasted about an hour in a mountainous border region of Dahuk province. Turkish aircraft also struck Iraq on Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday, the latest salvoes in a campaign that began with a larger bombing raid on Dec. 16 and has also seen brief cross-border raids by up to several hundred ground troops. Turkey says its strikes are aimed at Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas based in northern Iraq. Hundreds of civilians have fled villages in the border area. The Iraqi government and US forces say they support Turkey's right to strike back at PKK militants but want any action to be coordinated with them and small in scale to avoid destabilising northern Iraq
