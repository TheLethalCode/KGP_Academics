 Karachi, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Benazir Bhutto was shot in the head, a close aide who prepared her body for burial said on Saturday, dismissing as "ludicrous" a government theory that she died after hitting her head on a sunroof during the suicide attack. Sherry Rehman, a spokeswoman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and close aide, was in the car behind her at the end of a political rally when an attacker fired shots at the opposition leader and then blew himself up. Security officials said after the assassination on Thursday that Bhutto had been shot in the neck and head. But on Friday, the government said she died when the force of the blast smashed her head on a sunroof lever. "She has a bullet wound at the back of her head on the left side. It came out the other. That was a very large wound, and she bled profusely through that," said Rehman, who suffered a severe whiplash and leg injuries as the blast threw her out of her car. "She was even bleeding while we were bathing her for the burial," she added. "The government is now trying to say she concussed herself, which is ludicrous. It is really dangerous nonsense." Rehman said the government had denied Bhutto the security measures she had been asking for. "It's sad, but it looks like an attempt at either at a cover up or absolving themselves from responsibility, or both," she said. Rehman did not see the attacker, and was looking the other way just prior to the attack as she and a colleague suddenly noticed they were surrounded by unfamiliar faces. "We were seeing people who were unfamiliar suddenly wearing Bhutto badges," she said
