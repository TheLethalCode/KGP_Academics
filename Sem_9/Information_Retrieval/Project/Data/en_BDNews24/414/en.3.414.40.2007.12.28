<TITLE> Difficult for Dhaka to name products for WTO protection: Debapriya </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh would be hard-pressed to name which export products need protection under the forthcoming WTO regime, according to Debapriya Bhattacharya. "The US ambassador in Geneva told me to hand him the list of Bangladesh products that had lost market without protection. But I could name any such products," Debapriya told a meeting on 'The future of Doha Round' Friday. "Where do the BGMEA and BKMEA feel the heat, I don't know," he said, claiming that Bangladesh's main export industry was not in danger of losing its share of the international market. "Our readymade garment industry has not lost market, rather it has expanded (after withdrawal of quotas)," he said at the meeting organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Debapriya, the Bangladesh ambassador and permanent representative to the WTO and UN offices in Geneva, said Bangladesh at a recent WTO negotiation in Geneva was more focused on 'market access'. The Bangladesh apparel industry is likely to face stiff competition from 2008 when the European Union withdraws restrictions on Chinese garment products as a condition of China's entry to the World Trade Organisation. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturer and Exporters Association and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturer and Exporters Association fear that the apparel industries in Bangladesh might collapse if the sector is not protected under the proposed WTO trade regime. The EC ambassador in Dhaka, Stephan Frowein, also warned at a recent dialogue that it would be difficult for Bangladesh to maintain the apparel market in the EU from 2008 as cheap Chinese products would get access to the European regional block. However, Debapriya, the former executive director of the CPD, said Bangladesh among the least developed countries had the ability to survive in the competitive market regime. "In addition to holding talks in favour of LDCs, Bangladesh needs to hold bilateral talks with the US and the EU to secure its business interest," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said, speaking as chief guest at the meeting. Iftekhar said Bangladesh could gain market access for its products to developing countries as well as developed countries. bdnews
