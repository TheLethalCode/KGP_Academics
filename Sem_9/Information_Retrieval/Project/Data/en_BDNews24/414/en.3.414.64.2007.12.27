 MOGOL, Indonesia, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Landslides and floods triggered by heavy rain have left over 120 people dead or missing on Indonesia's Java island, as rescuers struggled on Thursday to pull out bodies buried under thick mud, officials said. Thousands of people have been left homeless after their houses were submerged by heavy floods or buried by landslides in villages near the Bengawan Solo river, which lies about 500 km from the capital, Jakarta. About 40 people were missing after floods swept away a bridge over an overflowing river in Madiun district in East Java province on Wednesday, a local police officer said. In neighbouring Central Java province, about 1,000 rescuers, police and soldiers tried to unearth 26 people buried in mud from steep slopes in Tawangmangu, a hilly area that was the worst-hit, using manual equipment. "We are only left with basic tools, such as spades and ploughs, yet we face a 7-to 9-metre (yard) blanket of mud," local police chief Rikwanto told Reuters by telephone. Workers pulled out three more bodies on Thursday, bringing the confirmed death toll to 39, said Heru Pratomo, head of the disaster relief agency in Karang Anyar district, of which Tawangmangu is part. Another body was found and 14 were still missing in two neighbouring districts, rescue officials said. Suwarno, a survivor of the landslide in Tawangmangu, said his younger brother survived the landslide after he arrived at his house in time to save him. "It started at four in the morning. I ran to my brother's house and I saw him buried waist-deep. I pulled him out of the mud and rushed him to hospital," he told Reuters Television. Metro TV showed victims' relatives wailing after they found out their loved ones were among those killed. One fainted. Floods as high as two metres also struck Central Java's Ngawi district, leaving three people dead and trapping families on the roofs of their houses, Elshinta radio reported. Rescue teams were sending rubber boats to reach survivors. Landslides and floods are frequent in Indonesia, where tropical downpours can quickly soak hillsides and years of deforestation often mean there is little vegetation to hold the soil. Chalid Muhammad, director of Indonesia's leading environmental group Walhi, said the government had not done enough to prevent the disasters. "For five consecutive years landslides and floods have occurred in Java, claiming many lives. The main trigger is ecological destruction caused by deforestation, forest conversions and chaotic spatial planning," Chalid told Reuters. He said deforestation on Java island had reached a critical stage. "There have been no adequate efforts by the government to protect the people from disasters. When the landslides happened officials were on holiday and there was no access of heavy equipment to the affected areas," he said. An official said on Wednesday the main area affected by the landslides was heavily forested. Thousands of villagers who lost their homes to floods or landslides have moved into temporary shelters in offices and schools and into tents set up by the rescue teams. Pratomo of the local relief agency said aid had reached the victims since Wednesday. "Food aid is not a problem," he sa
