 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A senior army officer Saturday said the roles of the military could be realigned to assist the future governments and maintain domestic security. Quarter master general Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Choudhury spoke of the formation of the National Security Council, saying that such a council could coordinate policy for domestic security and economic issues and advise the "chief executive of the country". "Nowadays, throughout the world, the role of the armed forces is being reassessed, as there is now a global trend towards non-traditional role for military, including the assistance to government and maintaining internal security," Jahangir told the conclusion of a three-day conference of non-resident Bangladeshis in the city. He said of a "comprehensive national strategy" where the capabilities of the military would be linked along with skills of other agencies. "Bangladesh needs a comprehensive national strategy coherently linking national policy with the capabilities of the many agencies charged with internal security including the Armed Forces," he said in the presence of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Jahangir made the comment as acting chief of the army, as General Moeen U Ahmed was away to perform hajj. He suggested the National Security Council could be formed to use the potential of the forces in the formation of the national policies. Describing the background of the Jan 11 when the interim government came to power with the help of the military, Jahangir said: "The political arena has now been purged of undesirable elements but a lot of work still remains to be done." He said the most serious problem before the interim government was the pervasive corruption when it assumed power. Jahangir said the armed forces have been acting in aid of the civil administration since Jan 11. "Its (army's) role has essentially been supportive and occasionally advisory, especially in matters concerning national security, which falls directly within their expertise and purview," he told the participants. Jahangir said he was in favour of giving the NRBs the right to vote. bdn
