 KIEV, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko formally presented a prominent opposition politician to a senior job on Wednesday, a week after overseeing the installation of a government linked to the "Orange Revolution". Yushchenko, making a rare appearance at a cabinet meeting, introduced Raisa Bogatyryova as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council. Bogatyryova is a longstanding ally of former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, the president's arch rival from the 2004 "orange" street rallies that helped sweep him to office. Yanukovich stepped down last week as premier to be replaced by "orange" coalition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. He had initially opposed Bogatyryova's nomination and his Regions Party, now in opposition, endorsed that position. Bogatyryova made no comment on her appointment. During the election, Yushchenko backed the formation of an "orange" coalition, but later said its opponents should also get top jobs to bridge longstanding differences between Ukraine's nationalist west and centre and the Russian-speaking east. Some analysts said Bogatyryova's appointment was aimed at dividing the president's rivals. Others suggested the appointment of a prominent opposition figure could irritate his own allies and lead to erosion of his support. The Security Council, chaired by the president, is periodically convened to deal with issues of strategic interest or national security. Its decisions must be implemented by law. Previous holders have unequivocally backed the president. Tymoshenko, prime minister for seven months in 2005 before being fired by Yushchenko, became prime minister last week on her second attempt. She heads a fragile coalition of her own bloc and Yushchenko's Our Ukraine Party that emerged from a September election and won backing from the minimum number of members. Tymoshenko has promised a comprehensive programme to uproot corruption and vowed to revise the 2008 budget to take account of an increased gas price and higher-than-anticipated inflation.
