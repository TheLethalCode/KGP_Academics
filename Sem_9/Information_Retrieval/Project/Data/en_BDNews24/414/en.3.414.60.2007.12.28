<TITLE> Japan opposition may change tack in bid to oust PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party will likely shift focus next year from a controversial naval mission to pocketbook issues that resonate with voters in its bid to topple Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda from power. The Democratic Party will probably abandon a plan to pass a censure motion against Fukuda if he pushes through an extension to a refuelling mission supporting U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan, newspapers reported on Friday. Such a change of direction would lessen the likelihood of Fukuda's being cornered into a snap election early in the new year, but the opposition is likely to save the censure tactic for later use. "If I were the Democrats, I would go for bread and butter issues," said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Tokyo campus. "I don't think you win elections on foreign policy.... Clearly they're ramping up for an election sometime in 2008." The Democratic Party and its smaller allies hold sway in the less powerful upper house of parliament, where their opposition forced the government to suspend the naval mission in the Indian Ocean when an enabling law expired last month. Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa says the mission is a breach of Japan's pacifist constitution, and many voters also oppose the extension. But surveys have shown the public is more concerned about troubles closer to home, such as botched pension records and whether a hefty tax on gasoline will be retained. Fukuda's support has fallen below 35 percent in recent voter polls from an initial high of 60 percent, after the government admitted it would not be able to sort out millions of mixed up payments into the public pensions system as promised. Defence Ministry scandals have also weighed on popularity levels, as have television appearances by weeping hepatitis C sufferers infected by tainted blood products, who have endured a protracted legal battle with the government over compensation. Fukuda's main ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner plan to use their two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament to push through a bill to resume the naval mission before the end of the parliamentary session on Jan. 15. The Democrats had planned to counter that with the first-ever parliamentary censure to be passed against the prime minister in the hope this would force an election, but Fukuda is seen likely to ignore such a motion. "The LDP has nothing to gain from elections," Kingston said. "It's never going to hold on to as many seats as last time around. So a censure motion from the upper house I don't think is going to knock the house down." That means the opposition is likely to pick a more popular issue to censure the government over, in the hope that Fukuda will be forced to go to the voters, newspapers said. A spokeswoman for the Democratic Party declined to comment on the reports. One possibility may be over gasoline taxes. Fukuda's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, facing a government debt mountain that it has promised to curb, wants to maintain fuel taxes at current levels, while the Democrats favour a cut to help those hit by rocketing oil prices. No lower house election need be called until September 2009, but Fukuda is free to call one earli
