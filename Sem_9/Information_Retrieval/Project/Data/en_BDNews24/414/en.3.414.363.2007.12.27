 ISLAMABAD, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Terrorism is scaring off investment in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and business communities in both countries must press their governments to eliminate it, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Thursday. Karzai arrived in Islamabad on Wednesday and agreed in talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Pervez Musharraf, that they would boost intelligence cooperation to meet the menace of terrorism that Musharraf said was destroying both countries. "One major threat to the promotion of business and investment, actually to the growth of both countries, is the question of radicalism and terrorism, because it brings fear," Karzai told a meeting of the Pakistan-Afghan Business Forum.

Later, Karzai held talks with Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, who survived a suicide bomb attack in the city of Karachi in October that killed nearly 150 people. Bhutto took time out from her campaign for a Jan. 8 election to meet Karzai for talks that included the threat of militancy and religious schools in Pakistan that promote violence. Bhutto has been speaking out strongly against terrorism in her campaign speeches. She has also criticised some Islamic religious schools, or madrasas, in Pakistan that she said train children as killers. Afghan officials say some of the suicide bombers attacking in Afghanistan are trained in Pakistani religious schools along the Afghan border. "The two agreed there is a dire need to contain terrorism," an official of Bhutto's party sa
