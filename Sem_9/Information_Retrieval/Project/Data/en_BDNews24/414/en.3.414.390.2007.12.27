 PARIS, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground in early trade on Thursday, rising for the fourth consecutive session as mining shares advanced on buoyant base metal prices while recently beaten-down banks rallied. Trading volumes were expected to be thin with a number of investors away on holiday. French technology consultancy group Capgemini dropped 4 percent after saying it had had no contact with India's Wipro. The stock surged 10.5 percent on Monday on a newspaper report that Wipro could bid for the company. At 0917 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at a 10-day high of 1,514.21 points. Europe's benchmark index is up a thin 2.1 percent on the year, on track to record its worst annual performance since 2002. "There is not much happening. We'll have to wait for the U.S. data to get some sort of direction. But volumes will remain very low until people are back next week," one trader said.

Energy shares gained ground as US crude oil prices remained above $95 a barrel on renewed supply concerns. Total was up 1.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell up 0.5 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.3 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.6 percent. Banks advanced, with the Dow Jones STOXX bank index up 0.6 percent. UBS added 1.4 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.1 percent. The STOXX bank index is down 16 percent on the year, the worst performance among sectors in Europe, as banking shares suffer from a global credit crunch. Gaz de France shed 0.6 percent on news that the French government has allowed the company to raise its prices by 4 percent, below the 6.1 percent rise proposed by the compa
