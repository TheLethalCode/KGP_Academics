 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)Interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed said Saturday there was enough room for the country to tap talents and expertise of non-resident Bangladeshis to fuel the pace of development. "Non-resident Bangladeshis working in various countries of the world are our pride. But we have not yet been able to utilise their talents," Fakhruddin said as he rounded off a three-day conference of the NRBs in Dhaka with his speech. "It is heartening to note that non-resident Bangladeshis are today playing leadership roles in many renowned organisations, institutions and industries all over the world. Their successes fill our hearts with pride." "There is wide scope to pool their knowledge, skills, expertise and experience to support the socioeconomic base of Bangladesh," he said. Fakhruddin said he hoped the country would become a middle-income country by the standards of the World Bank by 2021 when Bangladesh would turn 50. In line with the World Bank-set standards, Bangladesh has the potential to be a mid-income nation through an increase in per capita income to around $800. Currently per capita income in the country stands over $500. The World Bank in a report recently said Bangladesh could become a mid-income country by 2016 if it could achieve GDP growth of 7.3 percent through addressing nagging power crisis, restructuring the economic baseline and open the economy further. The country also needs to continue its economic reforms and deal with corruption, the bank had said. Bangladesh has maintained GDP growth of more than 5 percent over past few years, and the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank said the trend was positive. After his speech, Fakhruddin took questions from the audience. Many NRBs complained of red tape. They also said they faced hassles in Bangladesh's diplomatic missions abroad and banks. About the harassment by the government officials, Fakhruddin said: "It is undeniable that there is scope for improvement". The NRBs demanded the government enrol them as voters. Fakhruddin promised to take necessary steps for that in line with the recommendations by the Election Commission, which had earlier sent a delegation to the United Kingdom for feedback. "We have to know how we can do that: what logistics are required and what are the legal aspects," he said. After one participant said there was a lot of scope for exporting skilled nurses to New Zealand, Fakhruddin said: "We have been getting offers from many countries where we can send skilled workers. We are trying to use all resources to train them". The chief adviser said all Bangladesh missions abroad needed to update websites regularly. He asked the expatriates and others to email reactions to him at feedback@pmo.gov.bd Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury chaired the session while Michigan senator Hansen Hashim Clarke and UK BRAC representative Sandra Kabir spoke. bdn
