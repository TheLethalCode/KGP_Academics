 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) - The police escorted former law minister Moudud Ahmed out of Dhaka Central Jail to Azimpur graveyard at 4:15pm to attend the funeral rites for his brother. Moudud was granted 12-hour parole Thursday to attend the funeral of his brother, a senior jail official said. The government granted an appeal of Moudud's family for the parole after the death of his elder brother. Moudud's brother Masud Ahmed died Wednesday night. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general (prisons), told bdnews24.com: "I received the documents for his release on parole from the home ministry right now." "We are now waiting for Lalbagh police to come. He will be released after the police arrive," he had earlier said. bdnews24
