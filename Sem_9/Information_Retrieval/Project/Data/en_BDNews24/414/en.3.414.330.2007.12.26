<TITLE> Kumble takes special pride in five-wicket haul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captain Anil Kumble said his five-wicket haul on the opening day of the first test against Australia on Wednesday was the best of his career. Kumble's five for 84 off 25 overs dragged his side back into the match after Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques posted a daunting unbroken century partnership by lunch. The 37-year-old Kumble, however, dissolved that partnership after the break when he dragged Jaques forward with a top-spinner the left-hander missed and was stumped by wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni for 66, with Australia 135 for one. The dismissal sparked a mini-slump with three wickets falling for 30 runs. Despite a series of promising partnerships, the home side were never able to regain their momentum and finished the first day on 337 for nine. Hayden top scored with 124. "To be honest, (this performance is) probably the top of everything," Kumble told reporters after grabbing his 35th five-wicket haul in tests. "To get it on the first day of the Boxing Day test, the first test of the series, against Australia, it is a very special one." The captain, however, said praise must go to all of his bowlers, particularly off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who conceded just 61 runs off his 20 overs. "He bowled well, .... we bowled well together," Kumble added. "He kept it tight at one end and I picked up the wickets at the other and I'm sure in the second innings he will be very effective." Kumble admitted his side had been under pressure at lunch but was pleased with the way they responded. "I have always believed the first test of a series is very important and the way we performed after being on the back foot at lunch, I am very happy with what happened today. "I think we are still in the game. I think it's important that we (have them) 337 for nine. We will get the wicket to finish them off, then go on get a big score.
