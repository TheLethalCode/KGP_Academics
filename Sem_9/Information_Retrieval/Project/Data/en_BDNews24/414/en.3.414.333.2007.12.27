 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)The ties between Bangladesh and France "are too strong to be adversely affected" by the incident of the missing Paris-bound artefacts, the foreign adviser said in a statement Thursday. Ifthekar Ahmed Chowdhury expressed the hope that the government's request for cancellation of the exhibition at the Guimet museum "will have no adverse impact on the larger bilateral relations between Bangladesh and France". "Despite the regrettable incident and its consequences, we believe that the ties between Bangladesh and France are too strong to be adversely affected, and spread across a wide spectrum of bilateral and multilateral activities," said the adviser. France had earlier termed the theft from ZIA International Airport of a Paris-bound crate of artefacts, including two rare statues of Vishnu, either a "conspiracy by a very small nexus of persons" or a theft by petty criminals. "France feels the disappearance of this crate is highly suspicious and could also be the result of a conspiracy by a very small nexus of persons to embarrass France and Bangladesh," the embassy said in a statement Monday. "Although the inquiries are ongoing, the possibility of a mere theft by petty criminals cannot be discounted". A spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry when asked to comment Thursday on these remarks, stated that "it is always helpful when diplomatic agents exercise restraint and calm in their reactions." The BBC reported Wednesday that Bangladesh's decision to cancel the second consignment of relics and artefacts to Paris has apparently upset the authorities of the Guimet Museum, "I am not completely surprised after what happened over the last few days." Vincent Lefvre, a Guimet Museum curator, told BBC World Service. His reactions came a day after the caretaker government cancelled the second shipment in the wake of the theft of two Vishnu statues from Zia International Airport, bound for Paris. Lefvre said there was an official agreement between Bangladesh and French governments. But Bangladesh "did not fulfil its duties", he said.
