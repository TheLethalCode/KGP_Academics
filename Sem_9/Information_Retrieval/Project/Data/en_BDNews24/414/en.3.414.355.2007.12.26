<TEXT>
 Abuja, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 28 people were killed when a pipeline caught fire in Lagos on Tuesday while local residents were scooping fuel from it, the secretary general of the Nigerian Red Cross Society said on Wednesday. Abiodun Orebiyi said Red Cross volunteers were still at the scene looking for casualties and the toll might rise further. "From what people in the area have told our volunteers, it seems that there was a leakage from the pipeline and the people were trying to take advantage of that to scoop fuel," Orebiyi told Reuters by telephone. Such disasters are frequent in Nigeria. On Dec. 26 last year, more than 250 people were killed in similar circumstances in another area of Lagos. A Lagos state police spokesman was quoted in the Daily Trust newspaper as saying 34 bodies had been recovered, while a Red Cross volunteer at the scene put the figure at 45, according to Leadership newspaper. Police spokesmen could not immediately be reached and these figures could not be confirmed from other sources
