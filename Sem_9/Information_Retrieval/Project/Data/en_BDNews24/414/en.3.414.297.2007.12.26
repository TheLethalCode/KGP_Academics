 Bosasso, Somalia, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali gunmen kidnapped a Spanish and an Argentine aid worker with the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) on Wednesday in the latest such abduction in the semi-autonomous northern Puntland region. Witnesses originally said the women -- whose car was ambushed by a gang with machine-guns in Bosasso port as they drove to a local hospital -- were both Spanish, but later clarified one was from South America.

"We have sent troops to track down the kidnappers," said Yusuf Mumin Bidde, deputy governor of the local Bari region, which includes Bosasso. Foreigners in Somalia often run foul of local clans by failing to seek permission to travel through their territories. The women's translator said the assailants, armed with machine-guns, beat up their chauffeur before ordering them into another car and driving them off. "The abductors had a Toyota Surf and they blocked the way we were going," added the translator, who asked not to be named. An MSF spokesman, Javier Sancho, said the incident involved two employees working on a nutritional project for the Spanish branch of the international charity.
