<TITLE> Reverse swing could hold key to test, says Clarke </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pitch conditions and the ability of Australia's pace trio to exploit reverse swing should make India's job of scoring another 493 runs to win the first test a tough one, batsman Michael Clarke said on Friday. India finished the third day at six without loss, with Wasim Jaffer on two and Rahul Dravid on three, chasing a massive 499 to win the test after Australia captain Ricky Ponting declared his side's second innings closed at 351 for seven late on Friday. Clarke top-scored with 73 in an Australia batting effort where every batsman, apart from Ponting who was dismissed for three for arare double failure, got a start. The 26-year-old said the wicket was low and slow and accumulating runs would be difficult, particularly if Australia's pace trio of Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clark exploited the reverse swing opportunities. "Once the ball gets older, reverse swing will play its part and we are lucky that all three of our quicks are good at reverse swing," Clarke told reporters. "One of the advantages they have is that they can swing it both ways. There aren't too many bowlers in the world who do that. "When the ball is reverse swinging it is very hard to face fast bowlers because you don't know which way the ball is going.... (so) I think we're in really good hands once the ball starts to reverse swing." Clarke added that while the conditions may suit the pace bowlers, he expected left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg to also play a part in frustrating the Indian batsmen. "Hoggy can play a big part (on Saturday) as well. "He is a very good bowler and he bowled pretty well without too much luck in the first innings (and) ...if he's not taking wickets then he can tie up one end to give the quicks the opportunity." While the highest fourth innings in test on the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the 417 scored by England, chasing 463 for victory, in 1977 Clarke said there was still the possibilty India could sneak the win. "India have a very strong batting lineup. If they come out and play positively they could win the test match," he said. "The reality is they need 493 runs and have two days to get it, but I believe that if we bowl as well as we can and hold our chances I think there is a possibility the game could be over tomorrow.
