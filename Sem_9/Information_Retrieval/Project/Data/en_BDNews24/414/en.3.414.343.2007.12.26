 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court dealing with charges of extortion against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina stood in recess Wednesday for four days and set Dec 31 for the hearing to resume. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque set the date after he conducted the day's proceedings, following a 15-day break, at a makeshift courtroom on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Hasina and Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim were present throughout the proceedings Wednesday. The ex-premier was taken to the court at 9:40 am from the special jail situated near the temporary courtroom. The hearing was aimed at framing charges against the former premier. The state's counsel notified the court of the charges against the accused and asked that the charges be framed. The defense lawyers said they were not fully prepared for the charge-framing as they had not yet received the documents that the state's counsel had mentioned. They requested more time for preparation, and examining the documents, before the hearing resumed. The judge ordered the state counsel to show the defense lawyers the documents and set the next date. The judge had earlierprior to the Eid breakset Dec 26 for the charge-framing proceedings to resume in the case that also involves Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Selim. The charges involve an alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam J Chowdhury when Hasina was in office during 1996-2001. Chowdhury filed the case on June 13, alleging that he had paid the money to the accused as they threatened to cancel a power plant project. Hasina, Selim and the Awami League have denied the charges, saying the case is aimed at preventing Hasina from contesting the next elections. Rehana, who lives in London, expressed her surprise on learning of the case and said the charges were false. The High Court on Dec 9 had halted the proceedings of the case for three months and stayed the relocation of the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban premises after Hasina's lawyers moved a writ petition. But the Supreme Court on Dec 13 overruled the HC order after the state sought intervention to go ahead with the proceedings. Acting law secretary on Nov 26 enacted a gazette for relocating the courtroom to the Sangsad Bhaban area from Johnson Road on security grounds. But Hasina's lawyers had earlier argued that the government could not do so through such an order following the separation of the judiciary from the executive at the start of November. The trial started Dec 3 at the special courtroom on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Security officials arrested Hasina on July 16 at her husband's Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. Hours after the arrest, she was sent to the jail, pending trial. bdnews24.com/p
