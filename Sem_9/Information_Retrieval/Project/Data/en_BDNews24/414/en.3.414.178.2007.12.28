 WASHINGTON, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal is secure despite political turmoil following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, the Pentagon said on Friday. "Our assessment is that the Pakistani nuclear arsenal is under control," said Pentagon spokesman Col. Gary Keck. "At this time, we have no need for concern." Bhutto's assassination plunged Pakistan into crisis this week, triggering violent protests across her native province of Sindh. But U.S. military and defense officials have said Pakistan's nuclear weapons remain securely under the control of the Pakistani military. Those officials have repeatedly called the Pakistani military a responsible steward of the arsenal and said it would remain out of country's political conflict.
