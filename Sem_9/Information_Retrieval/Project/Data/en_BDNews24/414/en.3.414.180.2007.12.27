 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold futures hit a new one-month peak in U.S. trading Thursday as the falling dollar and the assassination of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto drove investors towards safe-haven assets. Most-active gold futures for February GCG8 were up $1.90, or 0.2 percent, at $831.40 an ounce on the COMEX metals division of the New York Mercantile Exchange by 11 a.m. EST, after rising to $834.70 -- a new peak since November 27. Volume was a hefty 41,034 lots by 10 a.m., against 60,300 lots for the whole of Wednesday. "The volume's pretty good, especially for this time of the year," said Leonard Kaplan at Illinois' Prospector Asset Management. "It's better than I would have expected." In the physical bullion market, the spot price of gold rose as high as $830.05 an ounce, the highest since November 26, as British markets resumed trading after a two-day break for Christmas. By 10:24 a.m., it was quoted at $828.60/829.30, against $823.00/824.30 in New York late on Wednesday. The rally came after news that Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack on Thursday as she left a political rally in Pakistan, putting the country's election on January 8 in doubt. The dollar's fall against the euro for a fifth straight session on Thursday, after a weaker-than-expected U.S. durable goods report that also strengthened gold. Gold prices usually rise in the face of political troubles, inflation and economic uncertainties. Prospector's Kaplan put the range for COMEX's benchmark February gold GCG8 at $805 on the lower end and $850 on the higher end. COMEX silver for March SIH8 rose 1.0 cent to $14.8450 an ounce, moving between $14.6450 and $14.905. Spot silver rose to $14.70/14.75 an ounce. Other precious metals were down, with investors taking profit on recent gains. Platinum futures for January PLF8 were off $6.30 at $1,543 an ounce by 11:20 a.m. EST. They had hit an all-time high of $1,551.50 on Wednesday. Spot platinum rose to a record $1,542 an ounce and was later quoted at $1,539/1,543, the level it closed at in New York on Wednesday. Platinum prices have surged almost 40 percent this year, with physical stocks of the precious metal having fallen to around seven weeks of global consumption due to lower output from top producer South Africa. Palladium for March PAH8 slid $1.55 to $366.75 an ounce. Spot palladium fetched $359/362.
