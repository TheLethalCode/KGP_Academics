<TITLE> Nepal to get UN peace-building funds </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 United Nations, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday declared Nepal the first non-African country eligible to receive money from a peace-building fund set up a year ago to help countries emerging from conflict. The Himalayan state last year ended a 10-year civil war between the government and Maoist rebels in which an estimated 13,000 people were killed. Nepal's provisional parliament voted on Friday to abolish the centuries-old monarchy and elections are due in April. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has instructed UN officials in Nepal to ensure money from the fund go to "priority peace process needs," a UN statement said. UN officials said main needs were improving conditions at camps for former Maoist fighters, preparing for the elections and assisting people displaced by the conflict. No figures were given. Carolyn McAskie, a UN assistant secretary-general, said Nepal was chosen "because there is a pressing need to consolidate the country's peaceful gains." The UN Peacebuilding Fund is intended to provide short-term aid to help prevent countries from slipping back into war. The main beneficiaries so far have been Burundi and Sierra Leone, which have received grants totaling $43 million. Other money has gone to Ivory Coast, Central African Republic and Liberia
