 Karachi, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seventeen people, including three policemen, have been killed in violent protests in Pakistan over the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, police and a provincial government minister said on Friday. The violence began on Thursday evening as word spread of former prime minister Bhutto's murder after an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, and intensified on Friday with widespread destruction across the province. The violence, some of the worst political disturbances in years in nuclear-armed Pakistan, was most severe in Sindh in the south, Bhutto's home province and her main base of support. All but one of the dead were killed there. "We're anticipating the situation might get worse after the funeral," Sindh Interior Minister Akhtar Zaman told Reuters, referring to Bhutto's funeral that got under way in her family's ancestral home in the province on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, in an apparent militant attack, a bomb at an election meeting in the country's troubled northwest killed six people including a candidate in January polls for the party that supports President Pervez Musharraf, police said. Islamist militants, probably linked to al Qaeda, top the list of suspects for Bhutto's murder. In Sindh, authorities issued an order to shoot violent protesters on sight after unidentified gunmen had shot dead a policeman and wounded three in the provincial capital, Karachi. Hours later, police opened fire on protesters in Sindh's Hyderabad city. Police and witnesses said protesters had set fire to about 25 banks, 100 vehicles and foreign fast-food outlets in Hyderabad. Some coaches of a train were also torched. The streets of Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city and its commercial capital, were largely deserted with shops shuttered and paramilitary troops and police patrolling. In the east of the city, more than 2,000 people attacked a police station and set it on fire. They stole some weapons and torched cars outside, police said. "Since last night a lot of damage has been caused. Shops, cars and government buildings are being burnt," said senior Karachi police official Azhar Ali Farooqi. CANDIDATE KILLED Fires also blazed across the interior of Sindh. A Reuters reporter travelling from Karachi to the Bhuttos' home district of Larkana, where Bhutto was to being buried on Friday, said he saw hundreds of smouldering vehicles and many shops on fire. Protesters shouted slogans against Bhutto's old rival, President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf condemned Bhutto's killing and called for calm and declared three days of mourning. Banks and schools were closed across the country. Bhutto's party said it would observe 40 days of mourning while Nawaz Sharif, another opposition leader and former prime minister, called for a nationwide strike on Friday. Violence broke out in Pakistan's other provinces and one person was killed in the eastern city of Lahore, police said. In the northwestern city of Peshawar two offices of pro-Musharraf political parties were torched, a witness said. Protesters in the southwestern province of Baluchistan set fire to a railway station, several banks, government vehicles and offices of a pro-Musharraf party, police said. In the city of Multan in Punjab province, a crowd damaged seven banks and torched eight petrol stations. Protesters took to the streets of Muzaffarabad in Pakistani Kashmir. In the Swat valley, where the army has been fighting pro-Taliban militants, a blast at an election meeting of the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League (Q) party killed six people including a party candidate in the polls, police said
