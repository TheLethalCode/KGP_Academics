<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting was delighted with the way his bowlers responded to conditions more suited to India's style of play in the home side's 337-run first-test victory on Saturday. Chasing an improbable 499 for victory, India were bowled out for 161 in the final session of the fourth day to give Australia their 15th successive test win in the opener of the four-match series. Australia's bowlers exploited the low and slow wicket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to the maximum, producing such a tight line that India were 31-2 in the 22nd over of their first innings and needed 32 overs to amass 50 runs in the second. "It's a very pleasing win, because the wicket we played on was more suited to the sub-continental style of play and we've adapted really well," Ponting told reporters. "The way we started with the ball early on day two, the scoreboard was just not going anywhere, the Indian batsmen were right under pressure and we set the tone very early on in this game." Ponting added the batsmen had also adapted well to the conditions and the 135-run opening stand between Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques on the first day had been a highlight. It was the highest partnership of the test. "Looking back to the first day our opening partnership was tremendous. We were none for 135 and that was one of the biggest partnerships in the whole game. "I thought the discipline we have showed with the bat to grind out the runs... was really pleasing." Ponting added while he never thought his side would lose the match when he declared late on Friday, he was mindful of India's talented batsmen. "I expected it to be really hard work. "I felt thinking about it last night that with (Rahul) Dravid, (Vangipurappu) Laxman and those sorts of guys have been known to bat for long periods of time and particularly on wickets like this one, so I felt it might have been a tough day for us. "But the way we bowled and fielded was outstanding and we took nearly every chance that came our way.
