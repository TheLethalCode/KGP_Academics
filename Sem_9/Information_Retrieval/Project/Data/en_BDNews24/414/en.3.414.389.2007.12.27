 TOKYO, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea may slow the pace of disablement of its nuclear facilities, blaming a delay in the delivery of energy aid promised under a disarmament deal, Kyodo news agency reported, quoting a Pyongyang official. "There is a delay in the implementation of economic compensation obligations to be undertaken by the other countries in the six-party talks," Hyun Hak Bong, deputy director of the North Korean Foreign Ministry's American affairs bureau, was quoted as saying late on Wednesday.

If Pyongyang gives a full accounting of its nuclear programmes, the United States is expected to drop it from a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, which imposes economic and other sanctions on the secretive state. In a separate report, a North Korean official told US negotiator Christopher Hill this month that Pyongyang had about 30 kg (66 lb) of plutonium, the Tokyo Shimbun said on Thursday, citing sources in the United States and South Korea. Hill held talks with top nuclear envoy Kim Kye-gwan during a visit to North Korea in early December. Analysts have estimated that North Korea has about 50 kg of plutonium, which would be enough for six to eight nuclear bombs according to conservative estimates from proliferation experts. US officials have also accused North Korea of engaging in inappropriate uranium-based activities which can be used in nuclear weapo
