 WASHINGTON, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States condemned an attack that killed Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, a U.S. State Department official said on Thursday. "The attack shows that there are still those in Pakistan trying to undermine reconciliation and democratic development in Pakistan," the official said. Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack after a rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Thursday. A party official said Bhutto, 54, died in the hospital. Police said a suicide bomber fired shots at Bhutto as she was leaving the rally venue in a park before blowing himself up. The U.S. official said the State Department had seen the media reports of the attack but had not yet confirmed the details. (Reporting by Deborah Charles, editing by Lori Santos)
