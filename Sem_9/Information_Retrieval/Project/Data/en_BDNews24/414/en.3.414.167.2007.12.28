<TITLE> Pakistan Reels As Benazir Buried </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Benazir Bhutto was laid to rest next to her father in the family mausoleum on Friday after the opposition leader's assassination plunged nuclear-armed Pakistan into crisis. Tens of thousands of mourners wept at the funeral procession of Benazir who was killed by a suicide attacker at an election rally on Thursday. Benazir, who had hoped to regain power in a January election, was slain at a campaign rally Thursday, triggering a wave of violence, especially in her native Sindh province. Officials said 31 people, including four policemen, had been killed since Benazir's death. Most of the dead were killed in Sindh in the south, Bhutto's main power base. It has stoked fears that a Jan 8 election meant to return Pakistan to civilian rule could be put off, although caretaker Prime Minister Mohammadmian Soomro said there was no change in the schedule for now. World leaders urged nuclear-armed Pakistan not to be deflected from a course toward democracy, as fears spread of instability in a region racked by Islamist militancy. Pakistan said there were signs that al Qaeda was responsible. Authorities issued an order to shoot violent protesters on sight Friday as hundreds of cars, trucks and buses smouldered in the interior of Sindh and crowds of men set up road blocks and chanted slogans against Musharraf. "No matter how many Bhuttos you will kill, a Bhutto will emerge from each house," was heard from a throng lining the road and standing on rooftops during Benazir's funeral procession. Meanwhile, a blast at an election meeting in the Swat valley in Pakistan's troubled northwest killed six people including a candidate for the party that supports Musharraf, police said. OUTSPOKEN Benazir, 54, returned home from eight years of self-imposed exile in October, hoping her huge following among the poor would propel her to power for the third time. But as she left the campaign rally in Rawalpindi, where she spoke of threats to her life, an attacker shot at her before blowing himself up, police and witnesses said. She was pronounced dead in hospital in Rawalpindi, the city where her father, former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Benazir, was hanged in 1979 after being deposed by a military coup. Musharraf condemned the attack on Benazir, in which a total of 16 people were killed, and called for calm. "We will not sit and rest until we get rid of these terrorists," he said. Benazir had spoken out strongly against Islamist violence and had been threatened by pro-Taliban militants. The United States, which relies on Pakistan as an ally against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan, saw in Benazir the best hope of a return to democracy and called on Musharraf and Pakistanis to honour Benazir's memory by holding elections as scheduled. "ELECTIONS STAND" "Elections stand as they were announced," Prime Minister Soomro told reporters. But analysts said the assassination, which followed a wave of suicide attacks and the worsening of an Islamist insurgency, could make this impossible. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Benazir's old political rival, however said his party would boycott the January election. He blamed Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 military coup but retired from the army last month, for the instability. Musharraf imposed a state of emergency in November in what was seen as an attempt to stop the judiciary from vetoing his re-election as president. He lifted emergency rule this month. MOURNING THE LOSS Mourners wept and beat their heads as Benazir's body was carried out of her ancestral home in the southern Sindh province. In 1988, aged just 35, Benazir became the Muslim world's first democratically elected woman prime minister. Deposed in 1990, she was re-elected in 1993, and ousted again in 1996 amid charges of corruption she said were politically motivated. Benazir, who escaped unhurt from a suicide attack in October, is survived by her husband and a son Bilawal, 19, and two daughters, Bakhtawar, 17 and Aseefa, 14. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, accompanied the closed coffin draped with the green, red and black tricolour of her Pakistan People's Party as it began the 7-km (4-mile) journey by ambulance to the white, domed family mausoleum. Authorities have ordered the central bank and all schools across Pakistan to close for three days of mourning. "UNCHARTED WATERS" Analysts say Pakistan, a key US ally in the battle against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, is entering "uncharted waters", which could lead to instability in a region that has seen three wars fought between Pakistan and its nuclear-armed neighbour India. Many of Benazir's supporters blamed Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf for her death, along with the United States which has backed the former army general, dismissing speculation that she had been killed by Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda. While Islamic hardliners, including members of the Taliban and al Qaeda, both of which operate in Pakistan, have been named as possible perpetrators of the attack, analysts said Bhutto's political opponents and those close to Musharraf's political party could not be ruled out of suspicion. POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS The Interior Ministry said on Friday that Pakistan has "intelligence intercepts" indicating that al Qaeda was behind the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. "We have intelligence intercepts indicating that al Qaeda leader Baitullah Mehsud is behind her assassination," ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema told a news conference. Mehsud is one of Pakistan's most wanted militant leaders and is based in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border. Cheema also said Mehsud was behind a suicide bomb attack on Benazir in Karachi that killed about 140 people hours after she arrived back in the country from eight years of exile on Oct. 18. Cheema also said Benazir had not been shot, nor had she been hit by shrapnel from the blast but she had been killed when the force of the explosion crashed her head against a lever on the sun-roof of her vehicle. bdnews
