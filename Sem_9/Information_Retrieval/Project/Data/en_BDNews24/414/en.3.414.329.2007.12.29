<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League's Dhaka city unit Saturday asked the central committee to announce a "legitimate programme" amid the state of emergency, fearing that party chief Sheikh Hasina could not be freed through a legal battle alone. The demand came from the AL city chapter's executive council meeting at the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue, chaired by the acting Dhaka city AL president, MA Aziz. After the meeting, Dhaka city AL's acting general secretary Advocate Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com: "We have asked the Awami League central committee to announce a lawful movement." The meeting demanded resignation of law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein without mentioning his name, withdrawal of the emergency rule and unconditional release of Dhaka University teachers. The meeting also decided to inject impetus into the ongoing movement for trial of war criminals, Kamrul Islam told reporters in a press briefing after the meeting. The meeting termed cases against Hasina false, fabricated and baseless. "Sheikh Hasina could not be freed only through a legal battle. So we recommended a movement besides the legal battle. We have also asked the central committee to emphasise the need for building public opinion," Kamrul Islam said. Asked whether the AL planned a broader movement to free Hasina, the city AL's acting general secretary said without giving a direct reply: "We have said what we have to say. And you have understood what we mean. We may go for any legitimate programme." bdnews
