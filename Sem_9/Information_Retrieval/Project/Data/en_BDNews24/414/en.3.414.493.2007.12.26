 LONDON, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 4,000 foreign prisoners have been deported from Britain during the past year, including killers and sex offenders, the Home Office said on Wednesday. The number is in line with government targets, but the Conservative Party said it "should not crow about its lamentable record". The Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) deported more than 4,000 foreign national prisoners in 2007, an increase of 50 percent on the year before. More than 20 killers, 200 sex offenders and 1,100 drug offenders were among the group. "Foreign lawbreakers should be first in line for the first plane out of Britain," Home Office Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a statement. The news comes less than a week after the Tories said a leaked Prison Service memo revealed that immigration officials had "no interest" in deporting those who have spent less than a year behind bars. Shadow Justice Secretary Nick Herbert said it meant 4,000 foreign criminals convicted each year would avoid deportation. Responding to the Home Office announcement on Wednesday, David Davis, the Conservative Home Affairs spokesman, said: "The government should not crow about meeting this artificially set target." He added: "In addition, over 500 foreign prisoners have been released early by this government and our prisons are still at bursting point with record levels of foreign prisoners in them." Prisoner numbers have reached record levels of around 80,000 in recent years, leading to some criminals being released early to ease overcrowding. Two prisons in England are being used solely for foreign nationals to try to speed up the process of deportation, Justice Minister David Hanson said in October. The Home Office said on Wednesday that the BIA had deported about 45,000 people in the first three-quarters of the year, including failed asylum-seekers, foreign national prisoners and other immigration offenders, such as illegal workers. It said it will be introducing a number of measures in the new year which will "shake-up" the immigration system, including an Australian-style points-based system and checking the fingerprint of every single visa applicant in 2008.
