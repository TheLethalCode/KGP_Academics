<TITLE> Bangladesh lose hugely to New Zealand </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Auckland, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Jamie How struck a fine 88 as hosts New Zealand Wednesday handed a six-wicket defeat to visitors Bangladesh in the opener of three ODIs series at Eden Park. The Black Caps raced to 203 for four in 42.4 overs in reply to the Tigers' paltry total of 201 all out. How put on 90 runs for the opening stand with Brendon McCullum (40) and added another 67 runs for the second wicket wtih Peter Fulton (35). How smashed five fours and one six in his 119-ball knock before the 26-year old opener fell the third victim of left-arm spinner Saqib Al Hasan, who returned three for 56. Scot Styris (25) and Mathew Sinclair (1) remained unbeaten to steer the Kiwis home with 7.2 overs to spare. Farhad Reza broke the 90-run opening stand, taking a return catch of Brendon McCullum. Earlier, blitzy unbeaten half-centuries by captain Mohammad Ashraful and Tamim Iqbal took Bangladesh to a commanding 130 for 2 at the halfway stage before a middle-order failure set in. They together put on 97 runs for the third wicket after Bangladesh lost two wickets at 39 for two. But Ashraful's dismissal triggered a collapse in the middle before late orders Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (17) and Abdur Razzak (22 not out) helped the visitors go beyond 200-mark. Mark Gillespie, Kyle Mills and Jacob Oram each grabbed three wickets. Both built on a steady start and led a quick recovery after both wickets fell in quick succession. Put into bat on a rock-hard surface with a hint of moisture, openers Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique chose to get a measure of the conditions and curb their aggression. Kyle Mills and Chris Martin got the ball to kick off a good length early on and the openers showed good technique by covering the line of the ball, save for a few jaffas that fizzed past the outside edge. Tamim brought up the first boundary of the match with a smooth drive past mid-off and debutant Siddique followed suit with a chip over midwicket to bring up his first and Bangladesh moved along steadily through the better part of the first Powerplay. A few inside-out strokes found the gaps on either side of the wicket but the batsmen weren't troubled consistently enough. Mills, after spilling a return catch off Siddique, redeemed himself in the ninth over by getting rid of the same batsman. Using his feet to a good length delivery, Siddique looked in control of the stroke by offering the full face of the bat but failed to get the desired elevation by connecting a little too early. Mark Gillespie took it easily at mid-on and New Zealand finally had an opening. Aftab Ahmed announced his arrival in characteristic manner, shuffling across his stumps and bisecting the gap between cover and mid-off, following it up with an imperious loft over mid-on. The entertainment lasted before one could blink as Aftab's second bravado attempt over the infield found the fielder. Stepping down the track to Gillespie, Aftab closed the face of the bat and as a result, mistimed it and an infuriatingly-brief innings came to an end. The real excitement wasn't a long way off though as Ashraful took a leaf out of Aftab's book. Beginning with an expansive loft over cover off Mills which just fell short of the rope, he then bullied Gillespie with a chip over midwicket, followed by an exquisite pull over square leg and then with a cheeky scoop over short fine-leg, as if stepping out of a Twenty20 match. Fourteen runs off the 14th over saw Vettori swing his arms wildly to change the field to counter the onslaught, delaying the third Powerplay. That made little difference as the run-rate continued to peak. Both Ashraful and Tamim punished anything off-line with controlled late cuts, chips over the on side and smashing cover drives. Tamim fell over while attempting a slog sweep over Vettori but the timing was enough to carry it over the boundary. After surviving a drop by Martin at deep midwicket and rubbed it in further by belting Jacob Oram for six over long-on. Ashraful helped himself to a fifty, off just 38 balls and Tamim followed suit soon after and the pair looked set for plenty more as the sun came out. (Courtesy: www.cricinfo.com) bdnew
