<TITLE> German president criticises Merkel on reforms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German President Horst Koehler sharply criticised the reform course of Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, saying her government needed to do more to prepare the country to meet the challenges of globalisation. In unusually frank comments given in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily, Koehler questioned decisions by Merkel's coalition to extend jobless benefits to older workers and introduce a minimum wage in the postal sector. "One or two steps forward often seem to be followed by a step backward," said Koehler, a former head of the International Monetary Fund, who has openly criticised government policy on only a handful of occasions in recent years. "I had hoped for more reform ambition. We have not done enough to prepare ourselves for the opportunities and risks of globalisation or for other challenges like the decline and ageing of our population." Merkel has been criticised in recent months for agreeing to demands from her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners to unwind labour market reforms put in place by her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder. Koehler was particularly critical of the government's decision to extend the period during which older unemployed workers receive payouts, saying it would likely hurt efforts to create new jobs. He also said a new 8 euro ($11.77) to 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for postal workers could ultimately lead to the elimination of jobs. Both measures are expected to take effect from Jan 1. Koehler was appointed to the largely ceremonial post of president in May 2004 and vowed to "tell Germans the truth" about the need to reform the economy. Since then, growth in Europe's largest economy has steadily accelerated, rising to a six-year high of 2.9 percent in 2006 -- a recovery economists attribute to aggressive restructuring at German firms, robust global growth and Schroeder's labour market reforms. While Merkel has profited from this economic upswing, she has been accused of failing to lay the groundwork for a more lasting recovery with structural reforms. That could come back to haunt her as risks to the German economy -- including the robust euro currency and US financial market woes -- mount.
