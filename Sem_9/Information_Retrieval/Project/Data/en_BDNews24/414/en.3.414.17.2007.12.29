 Chittagong, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong jail authorities have taken cautionary measures to avert any subversive activity in prison, in the wake of the assassination of Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, an official said Saturday. The authorities beefed up surveillance on 26 suspected Islamist militants, including JMB Chittagong regional commander, detained in prison. Chittagong jailor Iqbal Hossain told bdnews24.com: "Safety measures were strengthened after JMB militants detained in Comilla jail tried to escape. We have taken extra caution after the killing of Benazir Bhutto." The Chittagong Metropolitan Police deployed additional personnel to security checkpoints Friday, hours after the news of the killing of the Pakistan opposition leader spread. "To avert any subversive activity, all the 26 militants have been kept in separate cells. They don't have scope of talking to each other." Chittagong jail is home to 26 Islamist militants, including JMB Chittagong regional commander Javed Iqbal. Of them, five are convicted and 21 are on trial. bdnews24.
