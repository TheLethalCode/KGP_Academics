 NAIROBI, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan voters went to the polls on Thursday to elect a new president and parliament with delays reported in some locations and charges from the main opposition candidate that the government was trying to rig the outcome. As dawn broke, thousands of people from the humid coast to the shantytowns and lush highlands turned out in force, forming long queues at polling stations guarded by armed police. The presidential contest -- which analysts say is too close to call -- pits 76-year-old President Mwai Kibaki against opposition challenger and former ally Raila Odinga, 62. Kibaki, whose National Rainbow Coalition unseated Kenya's 24-year ruling party in 2002, faces the possibility of losing his re-election bid despite a sound economic record and the backing of his Kikuyu tribe, the country's largest. Many Kenyans began queuing up three hours before polling stations opened at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), but delays raised tempers in several locations, including Odinga's Langata constituency. "There's so many people here and it's really chaotic," chief EU election observer Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told Reuters, calling for voting to be extended by two hours there and at another polling station nearby. Stony-faced, Odinga left to complain to the ECK electoral commission after his name was missing from the voters' register. "I can see this as a deliberate attempt to try to rig me out ... so that eventually there is a constitutional crisis if I win," Odinga told KTN TV. "If this is not resolved quickly, wanainchi (the people) will take matters into their own hands." A condition for winning the top job is that candidates must be registered and must also win election to parliament. An ECK official said Odinga was in fact registered. Odinga, a former political prisoner under Kibaki's predecessor Daniel arap Moi, has garnered support among ethnic groups who believe the Kikuyu have had it too good. Kibaki voted as expected in his Othaya constituency, a fertile region covered in tea and coffee farms. Analysts say the possibility of a second transfer of power in two elections demonstrates the maturity of Kenya's democracy. Others fear it heightens the prospect of trouble. DELAYS Despite the delays, observers reported calm early on. "What we have witnessed is enormous enthusiasm so far. We just hope things remain peaceful," the EU's Lambsdorff said. There was frantic manoeuvring by both sides on the eve of the vote with Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) accusing Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) of planning fraud. Mobs in the western Nyanza province, Odinga's birthplace, beat to death three policemen and injured a dozen others they accused of being disguised as PNU party agents to gain access to polling stations and stuff ballot boxes. Lambsdorff said he had no evidence of foul play. While Kenya enjoys a reputation as a haven of stability in a volatile region, it has a long history of election violence. Odinga supporters in Kenya's biggest slum, part of his Nairobi constituency, lit bonfires to keep vigil over voting stations as police patrolled the rubbish-strewn streets. Police boss Hussein Ali said 60,000 police and security personnel were deployed at more than 20,000 polling stations. He warned of strong measures to deal with anyone intent on trouble: "If it means shooting them we will shoot people." Kibaki hopes his record of 5percent average annual economic growth will win him another five-year term. Odinga, however, says Kibaki has betrayed Kenyans by failing to end corruption. While Odinga's outspokenness contrasts with Kibaki's more measured character, they differ little in policy. Both pledge to boost growth, provide free secondary education and consolidate democratic advances. Voting ends at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). First official results are expected early on Friday. The candidate who receives more votes than his closest challenger, plus 25 percent in five of the eight provinces will w
