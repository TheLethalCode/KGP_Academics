 Tegucigalpa, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four inmates in a Honduran maximum-security prison died in a machete and knife attack on Saturday, authorities said, the latest slayings in the overcrowded facility just north of the capital. The victims, each serving sentences for murder, were found in a cell they shared with 16 other prisoners, Security Ministry spokesman Hector Mejia told Reuters. It was unclear if they died in a brawl or were murdered in their sleep. The prison near Tegucigalpa is home to about 2,800 inmates -- it was built to hold half that number -- and has seen more than 40 murders this year in turf battles among rival gangs and killings by hired assassins
