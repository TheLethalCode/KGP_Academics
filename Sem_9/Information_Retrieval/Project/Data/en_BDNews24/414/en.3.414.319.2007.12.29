<TITLE> Beijing says democracy possible in HK in 2017 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China ruled out full democracy for Hong Kong in 2012 on Saturday, ignoring the majority opinion in the former British colony, but said it may pick its leader by universal suffrage at the following opportunity, in 2017. Full democracy for forming Hong Kong's legislature would follow in 2020, the Standing Committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), said. Chief Executive Donald Tsang welcomed the ruling, saying it offered an opportunity for Hong Kongers to shelve their differences and work together to hammer out the details. But the city's vocal pro-democracy camp, a key voting block in the legislative council, was disappointed and planned a protest march on Saturday. "We must treasure this hard-earned opportunity," Tsang told reporters. "I sincerely urge everybody to lay down all disagreements and start moving toward conciliation and consensus." The decision to rule out democracy in 2012 was effectively the NPC's second veto of a possible date for unversal suffrage after a 2004 ruling that squashed hopes for full elections in 2007. However, the NPC's statement that Hong Kong "may" have universal suffrage in 2017 -- the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule -- marked Beijing's clearest indication yet as to when full democracy might finally germinate. Still, Civic Party lawmaker Audrey Eu said the pledge to consider full democracy in 2017 was not a promise to allow it. "It's an expectedly disappointing decision," she said. "A lot of people concentrate on the reference to 2017 and think there's hope, but to say you may have universal suffrage in that year doesn't mean it's going to happen ... there's no guarantee that it won't be vetoed again." ULTIMATE AIM Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, promises universal suffrage as the "ultimate aim" but is vague on a date, giving Beijing scope to dictate a glacial pace of progress. The chief executive is currently picked by an 800-seat election committee stacked in Beijing's favour, and only half of the city's 60-member legislature are directly elected with the others picked by various business and interest groups. Saturday's ruling by the Standing Committee of the NPC came in response to a report submitted by Tsang which said a majority in Hong Kong wanted direct elections by 2012, though a delay until 2017 stood a "better chance of being accepted". Despite the veto of direct elections in 2012, the NPC said it would allow some marginal tweaks or "appropriate amendments" to electoral methods for selecting Hong Kong's leader and legislature in 2012. The ruling is the latest twist in Hong Kong's quixotic quest for universal suffrage since the free-wheeling, affluent British colony reverted to Communist China in 1997 as a Special Administrative Region. Of the basket of promises enshrined in the city's mini-constitution, Beijing has upheld pledges to allow economic freedoms, but kept the city on a tight leash politically. While most Hong Kongers want universal suffrage by 2012, a public opinion poll by the Chinese University found 60 percent of citizens would accept 2017, if 2012 were ruled out
