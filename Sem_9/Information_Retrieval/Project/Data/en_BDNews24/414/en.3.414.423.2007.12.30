<TEXT>
 Dec 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia is holding an early presidential election on Jan. 5. Here are some details and rules of the vote: ELECTORATE - The Central Election Commission (CEC) says there are about 3.4 million eligible voters in the Caucasus nation of 4.5 million. POLLING STATIONS - 3,400 in 76 electoral districts. VOTING HOURS - Voting opens at 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) and closes at 8 p.m. (1600 GMT). RULES - Georgian presidents are elected every five years. The presidency is limited by a maximum of two terms. There is no turnout threshold for an election to be valid. A candidate must get at least 50 percent plus one vote to be elected outright in the first round. A second round of voting between the top two vote-winners is held two weeks after the first round if no candidate wins in the first round. The candidate who wins a majority wins the polls. RESULTS - First partial unofficial results are expected on Jan. 6. Final official results are due within a week. OBSERVERS - About 1,000 observers, including 400 from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), will monitor the election. Exit polls and parallel counting will be held by local non-government organisations. REFERENDUM - Georgia will also vote in a plebiscite on Jan. 5 to say if their post-Soviet country should join NATO. Voters will also decide if a parliamentary election is to be brought forward from the second half of 2008 to the first half. Below are facts on the presidential candidates: MIKHAIL SAAKASHVILI, Georgian president since 2004. Saakashvili, 40, graduated with a law degree from Kiev University. He then received a masters degree at Columbia University, New York before entering parliament in 1995. In January 2000 he became minister of justice. In 2001 he formed and became leader of what was Georgia's biggest opposition party, the United National Movement. In 2003 he was swept to power by peaceful protests that toppled former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze from the presidency. In November 2007 he faced his biggest street protests, when opposition leaders accused him of corruption and undemocratic rule, charges he denies. LEVAN GACHECHILADZE, a wine entrepreneur and member of parliament, was at the forefront of protests against Saakashvili. His candidacy is fielded by the main nine-party opposition coalition. The 43-year-old studied economics, first at university in Tbilisi and then in Belgium.

SHALVA NATELASHVILI, 49, leader of Labour Party which split from the opposition coalition. His party is left-wing and mainly campaigns on social promises.

BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI, 52, a media magnate and one of the richest Georgians. He has said he will not run in the election, but the CEC says his application has yet to be withdrawn. He has close links to Boris Berezovsky, a fugitive Russian tycoon who wielded huge political influence in Moscow in the 1990s and now lives in a self-imposed exile in London.
