 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's decision of cancelling a second consignment of relics and artefacts to Paris has apparently upset Guimet Museum authorities, BBC reported Wednesday. "I am not completely surprised after what happened over the last few days," Vincent Lefvre, a Guimet Museum curator, told BBC World Service. "But you can imagine since I have worked on the project for the last five years," Lefvre said. His reactions came a day after the caretaker government cancelled the second shipment in the wake of the theft of two Vishnu statues from Zia International Airport, bound for Paris. Lefvre said there was an official agreement between Bangladesh and French governments. But Bangladesh "did not fulfil its duties", he said. Lefvre said it was difficult for him to believe that there will be stronger cultural ties between the two countries in future. BBC said the curator did not rule out any legal action against Bangladesh. Lefvre said he does not see any museum in France, which will be encouraged to make new deals with Bangladesh. The interim cabinet made no decision Wednesday on bringing the artefacts back from France. "No decision has so far been made on bringing back the relics already sent to France for display at the Guimet Museum before the exhibition begins," law and information adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters in Dhaka after the meeting. bd
