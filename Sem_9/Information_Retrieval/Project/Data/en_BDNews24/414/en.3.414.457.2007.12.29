 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested LDP leader Redwan Ahmed after he was freed on bail Friday. Shahbagh police official Akhter Morshed said Friday night that they arrested the Liberal Democratic Party leader after he was freed from the prisons cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. He was arrested on grounds that he could "break emergency rules after being freed", the official said. "He is now under our custody. We'll produce him before court Saturday," he said. DIG (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Redwan was freed Friday evening after he obtained bail from the higher court. "I have heard that the police arrested him again. I have no other details," Siddiqui told bdnews24.com by phone. Redwan's lawyer Abdullah Mahmud Hasan said he was facing three separate charges. On June 26, security officials arrested Redwan when he was on his way home from a party meeting. The police later filed a case with Uttara Police Station under emergency powers act. bdnew
