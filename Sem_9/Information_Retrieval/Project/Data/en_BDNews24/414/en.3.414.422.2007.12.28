<TITLE> Shocked, gloomy Pakistanis mourn Benazir </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ordinary Pakistanis were engulfed by feelings of shock, disgust and despair on Friday over the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. For a people apparently long inured to the violent death of political leaders, Benazir's killing on Thursday in a suicide gun and bomb attack after an election rally in Rawalpindi cast a particularly mournful gloom. "This is the last incident, after this I just don't want to live here any more," said Samiya Mir, an executive at a foreign company in Islamabad. "How could people do something like this? Yesterday I just walked out of my office, everybody was crying," she said. Two-time prime minister Benazir returned home from eight years of self-imposed exile in October and hoped to win power in a Jan. 8 general election. Despite allegations of corruption during her terms as prime minister in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she still embodied the hopes of many of her 160 million compatriots. Adored in many poor, rural areas, especially in the south, Benazir was also a beacon for many members of Pakistan's growing middle class. "Benazir Bhutto was a ray of hope for the moderate people. We were thinking we would get rid of extremism and terrorism once she came to power," said Abbas Raza, a bank officer in the city of Lahore standing outside his home in an upmarket neighbourhood. "But with her death, we've lost all hope." Lahore fashion desinger Aelia Mehmood said she was in a state of shock. "I couldn't sleep the whole night, I just can't believe she's no more among us," said Mehmood, fighting back tears. "WE KILLED HER FATHER" Benazir came from a powerful political dynasty. Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, became the country's first popularly elected prime minister but was toppled by the military in 1977 and later hanged for the murder of a political opponent. His supporters said the charge was trumped up by a military dictator. Both of her brothers died in unexplained circumstances. "We killed her father, we killed her brothers and now finally we killed her. We don't deserve people like this," said Mir. "I'm disgusted." A tough stand against Islamist militancy also touched a chord with many Pakistanis weary of growing Islamist violence that has included a wave of suicide bombings in recent months. "Terrorists never liked Benazir Bhutto and that's why they removed her from their path," said Fayaz Ahmed, 40, a Karachi businessman. "Now there is no leader left at the national level of her calibre, she was a leader for all people." Shuja Rizvi, director of broking operations at Capital One Equities in Karachi, said people felt defenceless in the face of the violence. "If the government can't protect the main opposition leader of the country how can we expect the lives or ordinary citizens will be safe?" he asked. Not everyone blamed Islamist militants for Benazir's death. "We have become political orphans," said Syed Qalb Abbas, protesting on the streets of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir. "But we want to tell Musharraf and his cronies that we will avenge her death. They will have to reap tomorrow what they have sown today," he said. President Pervez Musharraf, who has himself survived two militant bomb attacks, condemned Benazir's killing and appealed for unity and calm. But not all Pakistanis were mourning Benazir. "Most of us are happy because at least one US stooge has gone," said Mudasir Khan, a shopkeeper in Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan region on the Afghan border which is a hotbed of support for al Qaeda and the Taliban.
