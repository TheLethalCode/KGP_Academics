 OSCEOLA, Iowa, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shotgun in hand, rising Republican candidate Mike Huckabee bagged a pheasant on Wednesday as US presidential hopefuls hunted for votes just eight days before the first contest in a wide-open nomination race. "Hopefully we'll just shoot pheasants, not each other," the former Arkansas governor told reporters at High Prairie Farm in snowy southern Iowa before a hunting expedition that sought to reinforce his folksy image. On Jan. 3, Iowa kicks off the state-by-state process to pick the Democratic and Republican candidates who will run for president in November 2008. Opinion polls show Iowa and other early voting states like New Hampshire are up for grabs. After a brief hiatus for Christmas, the contenders were dashing back and forth between the early states, wooing voters and donors they will need to keep their candidacies alive in the crucial weeks ahead. The two top Democrats, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, are in a fierce battle in Iowa and New Hampshire, although Clinton still leads Obama in national polls. The momentum could change after Iowa, and both were campaigning in that state on Wednesday. Clinton, a former first lady, is striving to become the country's first female president, while Obama hopes to be the first black president. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, still a strong contender in the Iowa Democratic race, was in New Hampshire. If he wins or places a close second in Iowa, he could try to catapult himself from New Hampshire into a more competitive national position. With the races in both parties the most unsettled and mercurial in decades, candidates will try to build momentum if they do well in Iowa or regroup for a comeback if they falter. Republican Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor, is taking the unorthodox approach of not concentrating on Iowa and New Hampshire but trying to harvest wins in big states that vote later on. The biggest single day is "Super Tuesday" on Feb. 5 when 22 states hold nomination contests. Giuliani was in sunny Florida but is due to return to Iowa and New Hampshire later in the week. "It's an aggressive schedule that reflects the campaign we've always been running," said his spokeswoman Maria Comella. HUNTING PUBLICITY Huckabee, a former Southern Baptist minister whose conservative social agenda has helped him connect with Christian "values voters" here, shot one pheasant. The image of the gun-toting candidate-hunter is iconic in U.S. campaigns, partly because the gun lobby is politically powerful, particularly in more rural states. In this case, it was also a Huckabee jab at former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, whose claim of being a lifelong hunter was deflated when it turned out he had hunted exactly twice. Romney, who would be the first Mormon president, had long led comfortably in opinion polls in Iowa but Huckabee's recent surge has put the outcome in doubt. Romney was campaigning in New Hampshire, where his dominance as a resident of the adjacent state is being tested by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who was headed back to Iowa. If Romney underperforms in Iowa, most analysts believe he must come back strongly in New Hampshire on Jan. 8 if he wants to do well in the numerous races on Feb. 5. McCain, in contrast, has seen his political fortunes reviving in New Hampshire after being nearly written off and his campaign almost going broke a few months
