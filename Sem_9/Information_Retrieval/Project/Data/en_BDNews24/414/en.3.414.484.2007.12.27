<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary David Miliband voiced shock at the killing of Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Thursday and called for restraint. "In targeting Benazir Bhutto extremist groups have in their sights all those committed to democratic processes in Pakistan. They cannot and must not succeed," Miliband said in a statement. "All those committed to a stable future for Pakistan will condemn without qualification all violence perpetrated against innocent people," he said, adding that he was "deeply shocked" by the attack. "Benazir Bhutto showed in her words and actions a deep commitment to her country. She knew the risks of her return to campaign but was convinced that her country needed her. This is a time for restraint but also unity," he said.
