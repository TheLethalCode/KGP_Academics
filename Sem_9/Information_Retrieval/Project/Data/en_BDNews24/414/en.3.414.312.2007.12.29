 BAGHDAD, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki flew to London on Saturday for what he said was a routine medical checkup, but an official in his office said it was treatment for exhaustion. The official said Maliki, 57, would also undergo a series of routine checkups, including tests on his heart. "He is suffering from mild exhaustion. He is also going to have a heart scan," the official said. "He should have gone to London for the checkup more than a month ago but he waited until after Eid (the Muslim Eid al-Adha feast). Now he has a good opportunity to go for the checkup." State television showed Maliki, who has been in office since May 2006, boarding his private plane at Baghdad international airport. He appeared healthy and walked to the plane from the terminal building. "I am going for some routine medical checkups and I hope to return soon," Maliki told a reporter on the tarmac. A British Foreign Office spokesman in London said he understood Maliki was on his way to London for medical treatment. He had no further details. Maliki's Shi'ite Islamist-led government has been paralysed for months by infighting between the major sectarian and ethnic blocs that has largely stalled progress towards national reconciliation. He has been under pressure from Washington to speed up the passage of laws seen as crucial to easing sectarian tensions and reconciling Iraq's warring sects. Sunni Arabs withdrew from his government earlier this year, accusing him of being too sectarian.
