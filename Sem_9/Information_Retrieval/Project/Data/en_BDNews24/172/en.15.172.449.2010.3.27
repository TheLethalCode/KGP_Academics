 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Waqar Younis, the new Pakistan coach, has hailed the appointment of all-rounder Shahid Afridi as captain for the World Twenty20 starting next month in the West Indies, reports Cricinfo. The PCB installed Afridi at the helm earlier this week, after initially announcing the squad for the tournament without naming a captain.

"But someone had to do the job and I dared to accept it and I assured the nation and the Pakistan Cricket Board that I would not disappoint them." He tried to temper the expectations of the country's passionate fans, and said things couldn't be changed overnight.

The depth of Pakistan's talent pool excited Waqar, who set his sights on next year's World Cup in the subcontinent. "World Cup 2011 is the real target. I have seen immense talent in Pakistan A and Under-19 teams which needs to be groomed and I am sure that in next few months the things would start moving in the right direct
