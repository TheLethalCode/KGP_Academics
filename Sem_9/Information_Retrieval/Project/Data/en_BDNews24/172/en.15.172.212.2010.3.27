 MIAMI, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former champion and world number two Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Sony Ericsson Open on Friday, falling 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 to Belgian Olivier Rochus in his opening match. After two rain delays that forced organisers to reschedule some matches to Saturday, Rochus secured his biggest win since he beat then world number two Marat Safin at Wimbledon in 2002. "He was motivated to win against somebody who's better ranked, top player," said Djokovic, who won the Miami title in 2007. "He didn't have anything to lose." The Serb committed 62 unforced errors and nearly lost his cool during the two hour, 55 minute second round match.

"Novak, he has won a Masters Series five times; he won a Grand Slam, many things I have never did in my life. He is number two, so I think he has more experience than me." Djokovic's loss was the biggest surprise of the day but Spanish fourth seed Rafa Nadal was in no mood to be upset, breezing through his match with a 6-4, 6-3 win over American Taylor Dent. In the women's draw, world number two Caroline Wozniacki also struggled through her opening match but advanced with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova. Justine Henin beat world number five Elena Dementieva 6-3, 6-2 to register an eighth triumph in nine attempts against the Russian, while fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters sped through her 6-1, 6-1 win over Czech Petra Kvitova in just 55 minutes. Serbian Jelena Jankovic and champion Victoria Azarenka of Belarus also won in the women's draw. In late matches, Andy Roddick ousted Russian Igor Andreev 6-4, 6-4 in a match that stretched into early Saturday morning, and Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-4, 6-3 to move on in the men
