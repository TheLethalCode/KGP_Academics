 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh Railway is planning to reconstruct a rail route it shut down 12 years ago, reportedly under pressure from donors, for being unprofitable. The plan to rehabilitate the 55.3 km-long line from Panchuria in Rajabri to Pukuria in Faridpur is designed to connect the capital with Barisal and Jessore after the construction of the Padma bridge in 2014. To complete the proposed project, railway authorities will also build another 6.6 km-long new track from Pukuria to Bhanga in Faridpur. According to officials, a project proposal costing over Tk 291 crose has been submitted to the planning commission for the rehabilitation and construction of the 62 km-long Panchuria-Faridpur-Pukuria-Bhanga track. The commission, however, has reportedly asked the railway authorities to investigate why the track was closed after 10 years since its inception in the 1980s. "We have submitted a proposal to the planning commission for the rehabilitation and construction of the track from Panchuria to Bhanga via Faridpur and Pukiria," a senior railway official told bdnews24.com Thursday. The official said the railway has taken the decision as the route would be very important for Dhaka's connection with Barisal and Jessore over the proposed Padma bridge. The government has kept the provision of railway on the bridge, which will connect Dhaka via Mawa in the North and Madaripur's Jangira in the South of the river Padma. The railway has also taken a project for constructing a 78 km-long line from Dhaka-Bhanga via Janjira. The 62 km-long Panchuria-Faridpur-Pukuria-Bhanga and Dhaka-Bhanga will meet in Bhanga, which will also allow trains to run from the northern part of Bangladesh. The railway will continue from Bhanga to Barisal. Official documents, obtained by bdnews24.com, show that after Bangladesh's independence the railway department started extending the British-era Panchuria-Faridpur line upto Bhanga via Talma and Pukuria. In 1980, train operation up to Talma and Pukuria started. The railway authorities acquired land and carried out feasibility study to build line from Pukuria to Bhanga. In 1990, the government abandoned train operation between Faridpur and Pukuria. Again, the rail track from Panchuria (Faridpur's North) to Faridpur town (South) was abandoned in 1998. "It is necessity to find out the causes of closure of the Panchuria-Fraidpur-Pukuria in just 10 years," a railway document quoted planning commission as saying. Railway sources say the department closed down Panchuria-Faridpur rail link in 1998 as per the prescription from the donors. "As far as I know the government shut down the non-profitable route due to pressures from the donors," Abdul Halim Miah, a former railway additional director general, told bdnews24.com Friday. He said the tracks could have been very important for connecting Barisal, Jessore and Khulna over the Padma bridge. The Asian Development Bank is the major donor in the railway sector. Bangladesh Railway's chief planning officer Sagar Chakravarty Friday told bdnews24.com that the 62 km-long rail track from Panchuria to Bhanga must be built for connecting Dhaka with Barisal, Khulna and Jessore via the proposed bridge. There is no rail link in the Southern Barisal division comprising six coastal districts. "We have also prepared a proposal on building rail track from Bhanga to Barisal," said Chakravarty. "Of the total 61.9 km, the railway will have to rehabilitate the 55.3 km Panchuria and Pukuria line and construct 6.6 km new track from Pukuria to Bhanga," he said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her recent visit to China had sought Chinese support for at least 20 different infrastructure projects including Bhanga-Barisal rail track and its feasibility study. Foreign ministry officials say the Chinese government is yet to respond to Dhaka's request for the project
