 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  Reconditioned automobile importers claim that the capital's unbearable traffic congestion can be reduced within six months if the government accepts and executes their proposals. Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Imports and Dealers Association (BARVIDA) has long been asking the government for zero supplementary import tax on commercial vehicles like buses to ease demands for personal cars. The current tax rate is between 20 and 25 percent. The association also proposed building elevated highways in the city saying that the constructions could be funded with the revenue paid by the industry annually. The importers were speaking at the inauguration ceremony of reconditioned motor vehicle exhibition 'Auto Expo' on Thursday in the capital's Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. BARVIDA's president Md Habib Ullah Don said, "The untenable traffic situation will never end if the government fails to formulate a rational policy." He claimed that the situation will radically change if the government considers the proposals made by the importers. "Availability of more public transportations like buses would lower demand for small cars, which are a huge contributing factor to Dhaka's traffic congestion." Don also stressed building an elevated highway in the capital to ease the traffic situation, saying that the government can do the job by revenue collected from their sector. "The reconditioned vehicle importers alone paid the government taxes worth Tk 2,000 crore and we hope this year it would be around Tk 2,500 crore," he said. According to the BARVIDA president, an elevated highway from Uttara to Jatrabari would reduce the city's traffic jam significantly. He also said that the amount of car loans in the banks should be doubled to Tk 40 lakhs from the existing Tk 20 lakhs. BARVIDA's general secretary Mahbubul Haque Chowdhury complained that the policy makers did not sit with professionals or people involved in the auto trade with a view to easing the unbearable traffic condition. He said, "Reconditioned cars are not to blame for traffic congestions, it is the low-quality small vehicles that are causing the problem. Our long experience in the field of transports should be utilised." United Commercial Bank's vice president Mizanur Rahman said, "Cars are not a luxury anymore, it has become a necessity. Banks will try to strike a balance between choice and ability." Some 40 organisations are participating in the fair. Buyers and visitors will be able to judge prices and quality at the fair. Auto Expo is being organised by sponsors Autoline, BARVIDA, UCB and Southern Automobiles. bdnews24.com is the media partner of the fair. bdnews24.
