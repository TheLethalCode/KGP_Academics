<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka City Corporation renewed its drive against illegal hoardings in the capital on Saturday, with the High Court's backing, following an abortive attempt earlier this month. The city authority launched the drive from 9pm in the city's Kalabagan and Dhanmondi areas, which saw 12 billboards successfully dismantled within about three hours. The drive would continue up to 5am, executive magistrate of the DCC, Khalil Ahmed, told bdnews24.com on Saturday night. Six of the billboards were removed during the drive by workers of the advertising agencies themselves. The DCC gave the companies the option to take down their own hoardings before the city authority moved in and destroyed them. An emergency meeting of the Dhaka City Corporation on Mar 23 decided that the drive to remove unauthorised billboards in the city would be restarted immediately in line with the High Court directive. DCC chief urban planner Serajul Islam told bdnews24.com at the time the decision was made despite the pleas of members of the Outdoor Advertisement Owners Association that such steps could result in losses of "Tk 100 crore". Rafiqul Islam, OAOA president and Neptune Advertising managing director, claimed there would be a significant financial loss suffered by the billboard business and that "several thousand people would become unemployed". However, the DCC was unmoved, maintaining that illegal billboards were a threat to security and must be taken down as per the High Court directive. The meeting also decided that additional equipment and increased manpower will be organised for the dismantling process. Islam previously told bdnews24.com that are only about 500 legal billboards and mega signs in the capital, while a further 2500 were unauthorised. But the city authority faced a struggle to remove the illgal hoardings with lack of workforce and resources. On Mar 15, two people were killed when a storm ripped down a massive rooftop billboard in the capital's Gulshan area. In February, collapsing billboards at Bijoy Sarani and Dhanmondi also caused injuries. The owner of the Gulshan billboard had failed to obtain permission from the DCC to build the structure, and ignored a number of DCC notices demanding that he remove the illegal billboard, Islam has said. Following the Gulshan tragedy, the DCC on March 18 launched an overnight drive at Shahbagh. But magistrate Khalil Ahmed was forced to stop the operation after just two hours citing police non-cooperation. On March 22, the High Court, on a petition by a rights group, gave a directive to the DCC to remove unauthorised billboards in the city without delay. Shahbagh police were also ordered to explain the police's non-cooperation with the DCC's drive. The DCC decided to resume the process of removing billboards starting with the area between Dhanmondi and Russell Square on Saturday night. It will start the process between Kuril and Notun Bazar on April 1 and from Farmgate to Bijoy Sarani on April 8. On April 15, the operation will take place at Agargaon and adjacent areas. bdnews
