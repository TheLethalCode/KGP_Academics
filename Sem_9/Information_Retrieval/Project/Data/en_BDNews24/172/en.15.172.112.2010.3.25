<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines Limited will offload shares by the end of this year, civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader said Thursday. The national carrier is taking preparations to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission and is likely to enter the market by December, the minister said at the launch of the three-day long second annual Share Bazar in the capital arranged by Hotel Sheraton. Last year at the same event, the minister had said that Biman should float its shares, but had not given a time frame. Speaking to bdnews24.com on Thursday after the share fair, he said, "The Biman management is in the process of going to the share market." "We will approach the SEC for going to the share market by December" With regard to the capital's two oldest 5-star hotels, which the ministry controls, Quader said that Hotel Sheraton can offload 20 percent share in the market under its present situation. Hotel Sonargaon is also getting ready to enter the share market, but only after some of its legal problems are resolved, the minister said. The government is truly concerned about the stability of the share market and is now trying to boost up public-private partnership, Quader added. SEC member Mansur Alam urged the tourism industries to come forward and join the stock market. Chittagong Stock Exchange president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed said investors can join online to play a part in CSE. Hotel Sheraton director general Ahmed Bukhari Hamjah, Dhaka University Finance Department chairman Mahbub Uddin Chowdhury, Dhaka Stock Exchange president Rakibur Rahman and others also spoke at the programme. bdnews
