 Chittagong, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong port workers observed an 8-hour work stoppage demanding reinstatement of previously sacked workers. The strike from 8am to 4pm halted loading and unloading of ships anchored at the port's dock. However, work is ongoing normally on ships at the outer anchorage. Mohammad Alamgir, the organising secretary of Dock Port Workers and Employees Federation, which called the strike, said the workers went on strike from 8am as Saturday night's meetings with the authorities did not bear fruit. He told bdnews24.com, "All workers have responded and stopped work." He also claimed that work has stopped in all docks. However, Chittagong port secretary Syed Md Farhad Uddin told bdnews24.com, "The strike has only halted loading and unloading at the port. It is continuing normally at the outer anchorage." Farhad also claimed that other work, including traffic of ships, is continuing normally. He said, "Another section of the workers are carrying out their duties." He further informed bdnews24.com that there were five ships in the 12 docks until Sunday morning. There were a few more scheduled to dock at the port by noon and another 21 ships are at the outer anchorage. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan expressed his dissatisfaction on Sunday, speaking to journalists, claiming that the strike was being held even after the main demand had been met. He said, "It is not possible for the government to meet all their demands. But some of them may be considered in future." Khan said that the workers' key demand had been to reinstate laid off workers, which the government had agreed to. "But they stopped work nonetheless and were making further demands that the government could not meet." He said that the berth operators had agreed to reinstate 2,500 dock workers in phases. But still the dock workers' federation called the strike to keep their hold on power, which conflicts with labour laws. The shipping minister urged the workers to observe strikes according to labour law. He also pointed out that discussions were the primary method of settling such disputes and said that the government would solve the problems through discussions unlike the previous regime of BNP, which tried to settle issues forcibly. The port authority on Oct 26 last year decided to reconsider its decision to lay off port workers at a high-level meeting in Dhaka with the shipping minister, labour state minister and workers' leaders. Subsequently 2,700 workers were adjudged eligible for reinstatement in a week-long review that began in Jan 26 but still has not been implemented. The striking workers are also demanding recruitment of berth-operators through tender and establishment of hospital and dormitories for them. bdn
