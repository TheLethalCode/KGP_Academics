 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  Political leaders and others are claiming that the Election Commission is "exercising unwanted authority" on party activities, while the commission says that it is working, according to its remit, to assist parties to comply with the law. Grievances have surfaced among party leaders as the commission has sent letters seeking explanations from three major parties regarding their involvement with respective "student wings". "The letter issued by the Election Commission should be sent back. Who has assigned them to talk about party affairs?" Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, a senior figure of the opposition BNP, said in a TV interview last week. Senior Awami League leader Suranjit Sen Gupta, asked by bdnews24.com what view the ruling party had of the matter, said, "There should be an explanation regarding the limit of the Election Commission's powers." The commission issued letters to the ruling Awami League, and opposition parties BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami asking them to clarify their stand on their student organisations, which according to amended electoral laws, parties have been required to "disassociate". The commission's letter to AL, quoting different newspaper reports, said that three Awami League leaders have reportedly been assigned to "oversee the activities of Bangladesh Chhatra League", which stands in contrast to the law and to AL's amended and ratified party constitution. The commission asked for clarification regarding the reports. In its letter to BNP, the EC similarly stated that some newspapers had reported that BNP leaders were still associated with Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and again asked the party for clarification. The Representation of the People Order, amended ahead of the December 2008 general elections, cancelled the provision for parties to have student wings, among others, requiring parties to set them free. Political parties have amended their constitutions on paper in line with the new law. They submitted drafts amendments ahead of the last election in order to get registration, and later submitted their ratified constitutions. The Election Commission has said it is still working to ensure that parties are complying in following their new constitutions, including on the issue of former student wings. BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com last week, "The party is yet to discuss the issue. We'll talk formally after seeing the language of the letter." His party colleague, SQ Chowdhury, also questioned the amendment of the RPO itself, which was executed during the past caretaker government. But even a former caretaker government adviser has called for restraint by the EC. Former adviser Akbar Ali Khan, speaking to bdnews24.com this week, called on the EC "not to be excessive" in its actions "if it wants to preserve its image". "The constitution has empowered the Election Commission to hold elections, not to control the political parties," he said. Also criticising the EC's queries over student associations, Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general, M Kamaruzzaman, told bdnews24.com, "It's too much on the part of EC. It is showing unwanted authority." He said the EC would destroy its image if it shows "a domineering attitude towards party activities". If the political parties do not respond to the letters, moreover, the EC will face a dilemma, he said. But election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain has said the commission has initiated the move, to press parties for clarification on the student organisations, only to help parties comply with registration conditions. "The letter was issued to the parties to get their feedback," he told bdnews24.com. "The Election Commission has no wish to control party politics," he said. bd
