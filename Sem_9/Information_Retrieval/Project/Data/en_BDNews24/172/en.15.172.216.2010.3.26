<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  'Marked' war criminals will not be allowed to flee the country, home minister Sahara Khatun said on Friday. She said this speaking to reporters at the Rajarbagh Police Lines after paying tribute to the police personnel killed by the Pakistani armed forces during the Libeation War in 1971. The minister was asked whether the government had any plans of barring 'recognised' war criminals from leaving the country on the 39th anniversary of Bangladesh's Independence. She replied that there was already a 'ban' and they could not be able to escape from the country. The security along the border and at the airports has also been tightened, she said. Sahara, however, did not disclose who the marked criminals were or when exactly the bar was imposed. Several ministers of the ruling Awami League had earlier said that the government would publish a list of the war criminals. However, the government later decided to leave it to the newly formed investigation agency. The government on Thursday, declared a three-member war crimes tribunal, a seven-member investigation agency and a 12-member panel of prosecutors to try war criminals of 1971. bd
