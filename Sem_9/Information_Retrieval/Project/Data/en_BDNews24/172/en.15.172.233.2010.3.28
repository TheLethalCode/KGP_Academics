 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com) The ruling Awami League is expected decide on its nomination for by-election of a Bhola constitutency on Sunday. An AL parliamentary board is expected decide on the nomination for the by-polls, set for April 24, a party spokesperson said. The meeting, headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is scheduled to be held at 1pm, deputy office secretary Mrinal Kanti Das told bdnews24.com. The deadline for nomination submission is Mar 29 and withdrawal April 8. The Election Commission declared the constituency void on Feb 3 as AL's Mohammad Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated time. Electoral law stipulates that a government official cannot run in the election within five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2006, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat against BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed, with a lead of 12,000 votes. But Hafiz challenged Jashim's candidacy at the High Court following which Jashim's seat was declared vacated. The AL presidium had a meeting over this nomination on Wednesday. One of the presidium members, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that barring legal complications, Md Jashimuddin was the frontrunner for an AL ticket. bdnews
