 Tanim Ahmed Gabura, Satkhira, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  Jainul is almost like an ant. The five-year-old has developed a capacity to carry heavy loads for long distances. Rain or shine, every morning, along with his sister, he walks about five kilometres and crosses a river to fetch drinking water. He carries back four litres of muddy water from a pond in two bottles tied to a pole that rests on his young shoulders. His older sister, Reema Khatun, brings back an even a heavier load, of about 10 litres. She is in the fourth grade. But Reema hardly finds the time or energy to go to school after the long walk everyday. For about three months, the four-hour trip has been a regular chore for Jainul Abedin and his sister since their family returned to their home in Ghorpara of Shora 9 village under the Gabura union after being displaced by cyclone Aila on May 25. Gabura, with a population of about 35,000 at the southern edge of Satkhira district bordering the Sundarban was devastated by Aila. This small island surrounded by the Kobadak river on one side and the Kholpetua on the other, was almost entirely inundated with only parts of the embankment remaining above the water. As a result, all sources of sweet water were flooded, and 10 months on drinking water remains a crying need for the entire residents of Gabura. On a recent day, Reema and Jainul were seen hiding among the crowd on the large engine-powered boat trying to avoid the searching eyes of the boatmen so that they are not asked for the fare of Tk 2. Even that small amount is too much for Reema's family of five, which subsists on the meager income of her father, a rickshaw puller in Khulna. There are several non-governmental organisations, besides the government, providing water and relief to the Aila victims. "But all of that is for the people living on the embankment," said Nazim Khan, Reema's neighbour. They too had returned to their homes about three months ago. Since then, Khan, an agriculture labourer and four members of his family, or his neighbours have not received any assistance. "We have been completely on our own", he said They said people living in the villages away from the embankments were not given 'cards'. The cards, apparently distributed by different agencies, were given to their selected beneficiaries, entitling them to certain benefits. Ashek-E-Elahi, head of Progoti, a local non-governmental organisation, said while his organisation's programme tried to reach out to the people, it was impossible to cover everyone. "Furthermore, due to several constraints, we had to cut down the number of beneficiaries from 5,000 to 1,500 recently." He explains that Progoti's programme, assisted by Oxfam and the European Commission, was designed in such a manner that gradually their beneficiaries would require less direct assistance and more services. Elahi said that the funds were not there anymore. Moreover, the programme is now concentrating on delivering other services deemed more suitable for longer term usefulness. These include setting up sand filter units and tube-wells. While Progoti also has plans to revive sweet water sources, particularly ponds, Elahi agrees that they are hardly enough to cover the needs of the entire union. The union chairman, Shofiul Azom Lanin, admitted that the inhabitants of Gabura were suffering immensely for lack of drinking water. He also said that there were a number of initiatives by organisations like Oxfam, which works through Progoti locally, and Muslim Aid who plan to pump out the existing saline water from the ponds and replensih them with rainwater in the monsoon. "But till then, there is simply nothing we can do." Lanin also pointed out that the repair work of the embankments was not progressing satisfactorily. "I doubt if the new enclosures that the Water Development Board is building, will hold during the high tides in the monsoon." The Gabura chairman blamed the water board for inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape. "It is their tardy, complicated process that has delayed the rebuilding work so much." Mazibur Rahman, an executive engineer of the water board in Shatkhira, said the water board was doing all that it could. He denied the allegations saying that contrary to what the others had said, water board experts thought the makeshift embankments would hold and if needed would be strengthened. "We are very hopeful that people will be able to return to their homesteads before the monsoon." As for the delay, Rahman said, "There are certain processes that we must follow and we are trying to work as fast as we can." Another Gabura resident, Md Matiar Rahman of Lokkhikhali village, had come back to his small hut from the nearby cyclone shelter a few months ago. He runs his small shop and tries his luck at catching fish in the narrow canal in front. Rahman's daughter had just returned from school, excited about the upcoming celebrations to mark the Independence Day. He listens absent-mindedly for a while before turning his head to say, "I really don't know what she is talking about. I would like some clean water
