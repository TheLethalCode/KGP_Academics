 LONDON, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A local club born out of disillusionment with the running of Manchester United are seeking to build a new stadium in the suburb where the 18-time English champions were founded. FC United, a semi-pro team established in 2005 after the American Glazer family took over the Old Trafford club, took a step closer this week to its dream of a ground in Newton Heath, where the Premier League behemoth first came to being over 140 years ago.

"We are trying to create a positive alternative for ordinary fans, we are not trying to claim the moral high ground. "The vast majority of people watch their football through the television and that is something we want to change." The funding for the new ground will be raised through a community share issue, Spencer said, and the new 5,000 capacity ground has a 2012-2013 completion date. The original green and gold colours of the Newton Heath club are being used as part of a separate fan campaign by Manchester United supporters to protest at the Glazers' ownership.
