<TITLE> BA cabin crew set to strike again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Airways cabin crew begin a four-day strike on Saturday, the second walkout this month that will cost the company millions of dollars and lead to more travel chaos before the busy Easter holiday period. BA said its contingency plans would mean that 75 percent of its customers would be able to fly despite the action, although the Unite Union said the ongoing and increasingly bitter dispute was damaging the airline's finances and reputation. The action over pay and jobs is also embarrassing for Prime Minister Gordon Brown as Unite is the Labour Party's largest financial backer. "I am delighted that we will be able to fly such a large proportion of our customers to their chosen destinations in the coming days," said BA's chief executive Willie Walsh. "At the same time, I feel really sorry for those customers whose plans have been ruined by Unite's completely unjustified action. Despite the union's promises, this strike has affected the Easter holiday plans of thousands of hard-working people." The dispute began because BA wants to save an annual 62.5 million pounds to help cope with falling demand, volatile fuel prices and greater competition. Last weekend's three-day stoppage, which the airline said cost it about 7 million pounds a day, led to claim and counter-claim from BA and Unite. BA said it had been able to operate much of its usual schedule and that almost 60 percent of its 12,000 cabin staff had turned up to work. This time it plans to operate a normal schedule from London's Gatwick and City airports and 70 percent of long-haul flights from London Heathrow, overall flying more than 180,000 of the 240,000 passengers originally booked. Another 18 percent have been rebooked to travel on other carriers or changed the dates of their flights. DISPUTE OVER STATISTICS Unite, which represents about 90 percent of BA's cabin crew, says the company's statistics have been misleading, adding that support for the strike had been very strong. It puts the daily cost of the action at between 15 and 20 million pounds, taking into account lost revenue and the hire of other aircraft and staff from other airlines. "Over seven days of strikes, this dispute will therefore have cost British Airways over 100 million pounds," the Union said in a statement. "Unite believes that the company has embarked on an ambitious and expensive attempt to destroy trade unionism among its cabin crew. Some may perhaps see this as a price worth paying if trade unionism is fatally weakened in part of BA's operations." The Guardian said in its Saturday edition BA had commissioned a report three years ago from an academic consultant who had encouraged it to take on the union. But in a letter to the paper, BA said the report did not represent the company's views. No further talks are planned on Saturday but both sides have said a settlement is possible. The dispute, coupled with plans for rail staff to hold the first national rail strike in 16 years in April, is proving a headache for Brown, facing an uphill battle to win re-election in an election expected on May 6. "We cannot tolerate large-scale industrial disputes in this country, particularly at this time as the economy comes out of recession," Brown told a news conference in Brussels on Friday. The Conservatives have used the strikes to accuse Brown of weakness because of his party's links to unions which provide most of its fundi
