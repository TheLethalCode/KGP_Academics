 Sikander Ali Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com) - The Port City League Bashundhara Cup T20 cricket tournament begins at the Sharjah Stadium on Sunday. On the opening day, Chittagong Mohammedan SC will take on Top Sports Noakhali while Dhaka Sports Club meet Bangladesh Biman. Due to late visa complications, organisers had to defer the tournament by two days. The PCL chairman AZM Nasiruddin disclosed this in a press conference. Addressing a media briefing at the Ramada Hotel on Saturday, he said they had to undergo some difficulty to secure visas as the local authority was very cautious in issuing entry permits. But he said they were determined to make the tournament a success. Meanwhile, former Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said there no difference between PCL and IPL. "I think the fans will come to the stadium on match day and support us to play good cricket." Participating teams: Group A - Chittagong Mohammedan SC, Chittagong Brothers Union Club, Chittagong Tigers and Top Sports Noakhali Group B - Dhaka Sports Club, Pirates of Chittagong, Bangla Tigers (India) and Bangladesh Bima
