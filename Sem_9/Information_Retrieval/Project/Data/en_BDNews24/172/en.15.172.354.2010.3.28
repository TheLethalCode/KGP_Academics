<TITLE> BTRC probing 'all bandwidth use' </TITLE>

 Rohan Ziad Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)The telecoms regulator is investigating the total consumed bandwidth of the country's internet service providers (ISPs) in an attempt to curb illegal call terminations or unlicensed VoIP activities. "A committee of the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission is now assessing the use of bandwidths of ISPs," the commission's chief Zia Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The regulator, in recent raids against unlicensed VoIP activities, has shut down operations of 19 ISPs as their usage of bandwidth didn't match their subscriber base, Ahmed said. The mismatch is attributed as evidence of illegal VoIP activities. VoIP or Voice over Internet Protocol is a technology that allows telephone calls to be made free over the Internet. VoIP has been legalised in Bangladesh, but licensed operators have to give away more than 50 percent of revenue to the government, making illegal operations lucrative. In 2008, the government awarded VoIP licenses to a handful of companies Novotel Limited, Bangla Trac Communications Ltd, Mir Telecom, M & H Telecom and Getco Telecommunications Ltd. The regulator launched a fresh drive this month against all other illegal, or unlicensed, VoIP operators. BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the total bandwidth available through the country's fibre optic network amounts to 12 gigabytes. "Traffic worth 500 megabytes has already been halted as 19 ISPs were shut down recently." "The committee is exploring the use of the remaining 11.5 gigabytes," Ahmed said. Asked how long the probe would take, he said "a picture could emerge" as soon as Monday. Regarding what kind of action the regulator would take against suspect companies, he said they would initially be asked to explain any discrepancies. Of the 19 ISPs shut down recently, five have responded by applying for reconnection, claiming any VoIP activities through their services had occurred "beyond their knowledge", Ahmed told bdnews24.com. But the remaining 14 ISPs have yet to respond, "which proves that they are guilty," according to the BTRC boss. Among other anti-VoIP measures, the telecoms regulator has also decided not to grant any more licenses for setting up VSATs. A VSAT or Very Small Aperture Terminal is a satellite communications system used to connect with the Internet. "Renewal of existing VSAT licenses will be done after justification of ISP activities and will be only allowed as a back up system", Ahmed said. Along with ISPs, the telecom regulator this month has closed down five private land phone operators for alleged involvement in the illegal VoIP business. The crackdown on the PSTN operators began with a raid on Dhaka Phone on March 14. WorldTel, RanksTel, PeoplesTel and National Telecom were also shutdown in subsequent days. BTRC said total call activities of the companies were much higher than their subscriber base. "The difference is evidence of illegal VoIP call activities," the BTRC chief told bdnews24.com. In all about half a million land phone users of the five companies were cut-off due to BRTC's actions. On March 23, the regulator conditionally allowed reconnection of call facilities for certified subscribers, but shut them down again the same day for non-compliance by the phone companies. The BTRC attached conditions for reconnection of their customers. These included submitting a certified subscribers list, getting approval from the regulator for E1 connections30-slot telephone connections used for call terminationsand alerting the regulator before making any kind of changes in their technical infrastructure. "It seems that they are reluctant to provide their subscriber lists," Ahmed told bdnews24.com.
