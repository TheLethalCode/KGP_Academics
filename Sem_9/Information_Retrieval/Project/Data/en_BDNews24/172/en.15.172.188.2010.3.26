 BANGKOK, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition parliamentarians joined anti-government protesters on the streets of Bangkok on Friday and leaders promised another "historic rally" this weekend as they continued a bid to oust Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. The street campaign, led by supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, is into its 13th day but tens of thousands of demonstrators in their red shirts remain near Bangkok's old town, calling on Abhisit to dissolve parliament and hold elections. "Every Thai who wants to oust this government should join us right here tomorrow," protest leader Nattawut Saikua told the crowd, calling on supporters to meet in "the largest number ever" on Saturday morning. The protest leaders have not decided whether to repeat last Saturday's march through the capital. In general the protest has been orderly. A number of grenades have been lobbed at government buildings this month but there has been little damage and no casualties. Authorities have not blamed the attacks on the protest movement. Foreigners have returned to the market in recent weeks despite the protests. They have bought a net 45.97 billion baht ($1.4 billion) of stocks since Feb. 22, helping the stock market show a gain of 6.8 percent so far this year. Opposition parliamentarians held a mock no-confidence debate on Friday on the protesters' makeshift stage. "Since the parliament is no longer a conducive place for democracy, we are taking the debate to the people on the streets," said Puea Thai Party member Anudith Nakornthap. A real confidence vote is expected in the next two months. Analysts believe Abhisit will ride out the storm, backed by his coalition allies, the military and the establishment elite. "The 'red shirts' have given the government a rough time from the beginning of its term and the political rift still presents a long-term risk. But there are no signs that they are weakening Abhisit enough to change the political equation," said Pichai Lertsupongkit, head of sales at Thanachart Securities. TAKING IT TO THE STREETS However, some analysts see a risk of public opinion in Bangkok turning against the government if the impasse continues. "Abhisit has the upper hand but it's a delicate situation," said Sombat Thamrongthanyawong of the National Institute of Development Administration. "The longer protesters hold on to the streets, even without clear direction, the more people are exposed to their cause. Those who are annoyed with the 'red shirts' could turn against the government as well for failing to make a decisive move." Abhisit insists any crackdown could end in bloodshed, which would only weaken his own legitimacy. About 500 "red shirt" supporters fanned out across Bangkok on motorcycles and pick-up trucks on Friday in a bid to persuade residents to join their movement, hoping to diversify their support base in the traditionally pro-establishment capital. Although some protesters have opted for the relative comfort of hostels, others remain camped out on the street on mats. "We can stay for a long time. We have been raising funds from villages and small donors who are sympathetic to the cause and we have adapted to living on the streets," said Kwanchai Praipanna, a radio host and community organiser from the northeast. "We have worked out a system where people can go back home when they need to and come back to join their brothers and sister
