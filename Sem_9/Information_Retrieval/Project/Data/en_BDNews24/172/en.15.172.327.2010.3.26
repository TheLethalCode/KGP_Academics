 David Bergman Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  A mark of respect to the 1971 Black Night victims and a salute to Independence Day, the government's naming of a war crimes tribunal and its related investigation and prosecution bodies on Thursday is the long-awaited single biggest step in decades towards trial of war crimes committed during Bangladesh's nine-month long Liberation War. But the most significant challenges remain ahead. The present Awami League government came into power at the start of 2009 on a wave of enthusiasm for war crimes trials, fuelled by the campaigning activities of the Sector Commanders Forum and others. But, even though the holding of trials was a clear AL manifesto commitment, doubts remained about whether the government could or would carry it through. There had been high hopes before, that the previous AL administration, when it came to power in 1996, would initiate war crimes trials. The People's Tribunal's led by Jahanara Imam in the early 1990s had then provided a springboard for Sheikh Hasina's government to take action  however Hasina instead focused on bringing to justice those who killed her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. This time around many thought that the government's attempts to prosecute over 3000 border guards, accused of the BDR mutiny in February 2009, wouldlike the Sheikh Mujib trialderail efforts for war crimes trials. Hasina has now firmly answered her doubters. This is, of course, not the first attempt to try 1971 war crimes. Bangladesh did hold trials soon after independence. The 1972 Collaborators Ordinance allowed for prosecution of political collaboratorsthose who gave political support to the Pakistan military, as well as those individuals who committed crimes of violence. Many were convicted, but the trials were not seen as terribly successful in Bangladesh, and were also criticised from outside by human rights organisations including the then nascent Amnesty International. Moreover, most of the senior leaders of the Al Badr and other militias had fled Bangladesh in the dying days of the warto Pakistan, the Middle East, the US and the UKand so were not even available for trial. The momentum for the trials soon ebbed away. In 1973, the Mujib government repealed provisions in the ordinance that allowed prosecution for political collaboration, and trials for the more serious offences also ceased. There remained, however, huge public demand for holding the Pakistan military to accountand in 1973 the new Bangladesh parliament passed the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act with the intention of prosecuting 195 members of the Pakistan army who were being held in Bangladesh as 'prisoners of war'. However political expediency got in the way, and in April 1974 a tripartite agreement between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was signed in which the Bangladesh government agreed that the POWs would be repatriated to Pakistan "as an act of clemency." With the assassination, moreover, of Bangladesh's founding president Sheikh Mujib in August 1975, any hope that people might have had for war crimes trials came to an end. Three months later, in December 1975, the Collaborators Ordinance was repealed altogether, and under the rule of General Zia Rahman, Islamist politics returned to Bangladesh and with it high profile individuals who were seriously tainted with war crimes allegations. Now, almost 40 years on from war and independence, Bangladesh has again returned to the quest for justice. It will not be easy. Although the history of war crimes trials, those of World War II, show that successful trials can take place even 60 years after the event, it will be a challenge in the context of Bangladesh to obtain credible evidence after four decades. There is no dearth of allegations, but unlike Germany after WWII, there is very little documentary evidence that helps support the allegations. And at present, at least in the public domain, there is little substantive evidence to tie the alleged political collaborators and militia leaders to the most serious war crimes. The just-formed special investigation team will have a tough job on its hands. Whether the team has the experience to undertake the meticulous research necessary to piece prosecution cases together in relation to events that took place so many years ago is uncertain. Significant concerns also remain about whether Bangladesh's war crimes legislation meets international standards for investigation, prosecution and trial of accused. The tribunal was formed, and the trials will be held, under the 1973 International Crimes (Tribunal) Act as amended last year, but a recent legal opinion written by the International Bar Association's War Crimes Committee recently suggested that 17 further changes to the Act  some of them quite major  should be made. The government has said that it supports international standards and has repeatedly avowed its commitment to hold fair trials. However, Bangladesh has minimal experience of holding any kind of trial in line with international standards. Nevertheless, the government, just days before Thursday's announcement of formation of the tribunal, ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which sets international standards for prosecution of individuals who commit crimes against humanity and calls on countries to adopt a number of measures, including bringing their own laws into line with international standards. This ratification does not necessarily have an impact upon the trial process that is now being embarking upon. However, some may see it, and indeed the government has claimed it, as a sign that "Bangladesh is determined to follow international standards to prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide". It should also be pointed out that ordinary Bangladeshis may not be overly concerned about whether those accused of 1971 war crimeswhich include genocide, torture and rapereceive "international standard" trials or not. It may even be rather abhorrent to some if those accused of war crimes were given greater rights than ordinary Bangladeshis have in the normal courts. However, it would be a mistake if this was taken as a reason to ignore the issue of standards; it would be a tragedy if those guilty of war crimes managed to find loopholes in the proceedings  or gain sympathy through allegations that the process is unjust or unfair. Projonmo Ekkatorer is one group, of men and woman whose parents were killed in 1971, who say they want the trials to be "above reproach" so the process cannot be criticised from any quarter. Concerns about politicisation of the trials have also emerged, raised by the Bangladesh opposition as well as rights organisations and other non-partisan groups. Some of the most high profile war crimes suspects are leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, one of the AL's political opponents, while the main opposition party BNP, Jamaat's major ally, has long been accused of "patronising and protecting" war criminals. The government must tread a careful path to avoid being seen by some as conducting a political vendetta against its old foes. Both the issue of standards and politicisation, however, may be avoided by ensuring that the trials are transparently fair and any conviction is based on credible evidence. A key question, harder to avoid, is who should be the subject of the new team's inquiry. Should the investigators take a scattergun approach and prosecute anyone against whom there is good evidence? Or instead should they aim for trial of a few key suspects? The government indicated this week that it preferred the latter strategy, but it was roundly criticised the next day by the Sector Commanders Forum who suggested that all who committed war crimes should be prosecuted. With only seven investigators appointed by the government, however, the forum's wish is hardly realistic. There are also those who still consider that the trials should address the war crimes committed by Pakistan. Theoretically, this is a fair pointprosecuting the accomplice does seem unfair when the principal offender is off the hook. There is little doubt that the vast majority of crimes committed during 1971 were committed with the support, direction or encouragement of the Pakistan military. However Bangladesh has enough of a fight on its hands in undertaking credible trials against its own citizens for war crimesand no one should blame the government for this focus, particularly if it can overcome the challenges ahead to pull off the trials with integrity and success
