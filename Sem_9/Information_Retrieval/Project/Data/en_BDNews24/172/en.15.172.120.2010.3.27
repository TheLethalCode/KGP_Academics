<TITLE> Rift raises questions on Obama intel czar's future </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A power struggle within the US intelligence community has strained relations and raised questions about the role and future of Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair, US officials said. Infighting between US intelligence agencies is nothing new, but Blair's behind-the-scenes tug-of-war with CIA Director Leon Panetta has fueled doubts for some within the administration about the Director of National Intelligence's (DNI) oversight. "Something has to give," one source said. A senior intelligence official with ties to the DNI said the storm has passed and voiced confidence Blair would remain in the post for the foreseeable future. "So much of this has been resolved," the intelligence official said. "It's a working, professional relationship. They talk almost daily. Although there are some differences of views, there is a lot of congeniality and common interest." But other officials said problems remain and Blair may leave by year-end or sooner. One former White House official close to the discussions said there was "frustration" and "a ton of tension" that could lead to Blair's departure, provided Obama finds a replacement. Asked if the tensions raised doubts about Blair's tenure, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said: "The president very much appreciates the work of Admiral Blair and the entire intelligence community, which he relies on every day." Arthur House, director of communications with the office of the DNI, said: "Director Blair has every intention of serving for the full four year term at the will of the president." Blair's often blunt style is seen as a source of candor on Capitol Hill, aides say, but it has irked some in a White House that prizes staying on message. The DNI serves as the head of the intelligence community, but his control of the CIA and its operation is limited. Within the bureaucracy, Blair faced an uphill battle from the start. Panetta, an ex-congressman, is considered a Democratic eminence grise. As a former White House chief of staff and chairman of key congressional committee, he has extensive ties within the administration and Congress. Panetta's high profile was welcomed by many in the CIA who were hopeful he would help raise the agency's stature. He was able to overcome initial skepticism over his lack of experience in the intelligence field. "He's managed his public image extremely well," said former Clinton administration official David Rothkopf. OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE The senior intelligence official said there was no doubt about Panetta's political savvy but the White House also valued having a four-star admiral with deep roots in intelligence. Blair has operated largely out of the public eye, especially since the failed attempt by an Islamic militant to blow up a US passenger jet as it approached Detroit on Dec. 25, observers say. President Barack Obama took ultimate responsibility for lapses exposed by the Christmas Day plot. But the intelligence community's reputation suffered, Blair and Panetta included. To contain the political fallout from the failed plot, the White House dispatched top counterterrorism aide John Brennan, rather than Blair, to lead the public relations pushback. Blair has pressed aggressively for expanded authorities that many experts say he needs to make the DNI post effective, but the results have been mixed. In a classified order issued in December, the White House National Security Council reaffirmed the CIA's leadership role in covert action. The DNI has "policy oversight" but no veto power over operations, officials said. Under the ruling, if a covert operation is deemed an emergency, the CIA would work directly to the president and notify the DNI concurrently. The White House also strengthened the CIA's hand at US missions overseas. Already empowered to choose the station chief, the White House ruled that the CIA's pick would concurrently serve as the DNI's representative in country, rebuffing attempts by other agencies and Blair to open the field for the slot. Many current and former intelligence officials trace tensions back to 2004, when legislation overhauling the intelligence system created the DNI without clearly delineating all of the new office's powers. "The DNI model is under assault," said a former National Security Council official involved in creating the post. "Most people thought, all things considered, they gave the DNI lots of authority. But that's where the struggle lies. It's worth asking the question if it (the position) was set up to fail?" In a January statement to lawmakers, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, who led the commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and recommended the DNI's creation, said Obama needed to make clear who was in charge and urged a strong DNI. Rothkopf said clashes between Blair and Panetta were probably "inevitable." "My guess is that to the extent to which there are personality issues, it's a consequence of the structural issue," he said. "Both Denny Blair and Leon Panetta are first class professionals who have worked extraordinarily successfully in a whole variety of other challenging bureaucratic settings." Rothkopf, author of "Running the World," a book on the NSC, said he has the "utmost respect" for Blair, but if he were to leave, Obama should consider eliminating the DNI office and empowering the CIA director to what it was created to do. The 1947 law that created the CIA gave its director broad reach to oversee and coordinate intelligence gatheri
