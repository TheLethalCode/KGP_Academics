 Dinajpur, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  Barapukuria coal mine workers called off their indefinite strike on Saturday, after four days. Nurul Islam, general secretary Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union, said they would return to work from noon. The decision to withdraw the strike came following a fruitful meeting between miners, the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) and the Chinese contractor, XMC Consortium, on Friday night, mediated by the district administration. The authorities agreed to raise miners' salaries by 22 percent. Over 1,000 miners went on strike Monday midnight demanding pay hike from XMC. Earlier on Thursday, a government delegation led by state minister for energy Enamul Haque held talks with the workers but they failed. The strikers became more desperate and blocked roads and railways. They also confined officials of BCMCL and their families to their living quarters near the mine site. Last month, a similar strike demanding a profit bonus was called off after just two days, following assurances from the employers. According to a tripartite deal between BCMCL, CMC-XMC and workers in 2008, miners are supposed to negotiate their annual increment each February. bd
