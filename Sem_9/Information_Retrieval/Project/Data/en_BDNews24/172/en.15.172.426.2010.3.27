 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com) -- New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori took 4-36 in his 100th Test match as Australia were skittled for 231 on the first day of the second Test in Hamilton on Saturday, reports BBC Sport. Vettori ran out Ricky Ponting for a world record 13th time as the Aussies' decision to bat proved disastrous. Simon Katich top-scored for Australia with 88 as Vettori and paceman Tim Southee, who also took four wickets, destroyed the tourists' lower order. The Black Caps then reached 19 for one at stumps in Hamilton. After Ponting won the toss and sent his side in to bat, Shane Watson fell for just 12 when he was caught by Brent Arnel off Southee. Ponting and Katich both scored freely, however the skipper did not last long as he hit a Jeetan Patel delivery to mid-off and Vettori swooped to throw down the stumps and leave Australia on 63-2. Ponting's run out beats the earlier record of 12, jointly held by compatriots Allan Border and Matthew Hayden. Katich and Mike Hussey, both playing in their 50th Tests, helped the tourists reach lunch on 84-2 but Southee ended Hussey's innings on 22 when he edged a catch through to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. Michael Clarke, who scored 168 in his side's first Test 10-wicket victory, started solidly before eventually holing out for 28 to Patel off Southee. "I was obviously pretty disappointed after the last Test as I didn't play very well," said Southee, who bounced back from a wicket-less opening defeat in Wellington. "To come back the way we did was pleasing. We bowled well as a unit and I was just the one that picked up the wickets," he added. "It was good to be able to give the selectors a bit of payback for sticking with me do that was pleasing." Katich appeared to be cruising towards a 10th Test century until he hit a Vettori delivery into the hands of BJ Watling to end his innings on 88, leaving Australia 180 for five. After the interval the wickets continued to spill, with New Zealand at one stage capturing three breakthroughs in eight balls. Vettori watched Mitchell Johnson push a catch to bat pad before accounting for Ryan Harris and Doug Bollinger as Australia went for just 232. That was not the last of the wickets either, with Tim McIntosh shouldering arms and losing his off stump to Bollinger in the first over of New Zealand's reply. "We've got a bit of hard work ahead of us," reflected Katich. "But I think the way we bowled tonight, it'll be pretty hard for the Kiwis as well. "There's no doubt we're disappointed with only 230 given that we were only about three for 160 and it seemed like we were going all right. "We've got to do some hard work with the ball but there's plenty of Test cricket left in this ma
