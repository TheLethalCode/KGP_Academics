 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's captain for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20, has called on Mohammad Yousuf to reconsider his decision to retire from international cricket, reports Cricinfo. Yousuf, banned indefinitely by the PCB in the aftermath of a disastrous tour of Australia, is expected to make a formal announcement on Monday. "I think Yousuf is taking an emotional decision, but I think he must reconsider his decision because he still has a lot to give to Pakistan cricket," Afridi was quoted as saying by PTI.

India's master batsman quit the format in 2007 but has been in superb form in the Indian Premier League. Several leading figures have asked him to return for the tournament in the West Indies but the 36-year-old recently ruled out the possibility. "The way he has blossomed in the last few years he is only getting better and better as a batsman," Afridi told Sunday's Times of India. "If Tendulkar had played in this World Cup I am sure he would have made a big impact. If he is not playing... it is certainly a big advantage for other teams.
