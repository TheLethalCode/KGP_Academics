 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com) - Kings XI Punjab captain Kumar Sangakkara was on Sunday slapped a one-match ban, apart from a 50,000 dollar fine, for the team's slow over-rate for the third time in the Indian Premier League, reports PTI. As if their nightmarish performance was not enough, Kings XI Punjab were dealt a further blow when Sangakkara was penalised for not completing the overs on time during their 39-run defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders in Mohali on Saturday night. "Since it was Kings XI Punjab's third offence of the season, under the IPL's Code of Conduct relating to minimum over rate offences, captain Kumar Sangakkara was fined 50,000 dollars and each player in the team 20,000 dollars," the IPL management said in a statement. "Sangakkara is also banned from playing in the team's next match, a clash against Mumbai Indians on March 30," the statement added. At the end of Saturday night's match, Kings XI Punjab were assessed to be one over behind the required rate after allowances were taken into consideration. The IPL organisers have come down hard on captains for slow over-rates this season and after the first three games this year, four captains -- Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir and Sangakkara -- were fined 20,000 dollars each for slow over-rates. Sangakkara's ban adds to Kings XI Punjab's woes as they are languishing at the bottom of the table with as many as five defeats out six games they have played so
