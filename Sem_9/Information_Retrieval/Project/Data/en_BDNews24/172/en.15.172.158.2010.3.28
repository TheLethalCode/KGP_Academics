 Chittagong, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Loading and unloading at Chittagong port came to a halt for eight hours on Sunday as dock hands stopped work to demand reinstatement of previously laid off workers. "They resumed work at the end of the strike and loading and unloading at the docks resumed", Chittagong port secretary Syed Md Farhad Uddin told bdnews24.com. The Dock and Port Workers and Employees Federation (DPWEF), which called the half-day strike, organised a meeting in the port area after the work stoppage. The speakers, including the organisation's joint secretary Abdul Ahad, threatened to go for tougher actions if their demands were not met immediately. Ahad told bdnews24.com that the programme will continue with the same demands. A new programme will be declared by the federation on Monday-Tuesday. Mohammad Alamgir, the organisation's organising secretary, earlier said the workers went on strike from 8am as Saturday night's meetings with the authorities did not bear fruit. He told bdnews24.com, "All workers responded to the strike and halted work." SHIPPING MINISTER REACTS Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan told journalists that he was unhappy to learn that the strike was held even after the workers' main demand had been met. "It's not possible for the government to meet all their demands. But some of them may be considered in future", he said. Khan said that the workers' key demand had been to reinstate laid off workers. "But they stopped work nonetheless and were making further demands that the government could not meet." He also pointed out that discussions were the primary method of settling such disputes, saying the government would solve the problems through discussions unlike the previous regime of BNP, which tried to settle issues forcibly. DEMANDS The port authority on Oct 26 last year decided to reconsider its decision to lay off port workers at a high-level meeting in Dhaka with the shipping minister, labour state minister and workers' leaders. Subsequently, 2,700 workers were adjudged eligible for reinstatement in a week-long review that began on Jan 26. But still they have not been reinstated. The striking workers are also demanding recruitment of berth-operators through tender and establishment of hospital and dormitories for them.
