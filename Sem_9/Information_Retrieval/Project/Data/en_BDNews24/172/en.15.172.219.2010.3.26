<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  Head of the elite crime fighting unit, the Rapid Action Battalion, has implicitly admitted that his personnel have broken the law. The battalion's director general Hassan Mahmood Khandker said on Friday that RAB members, too, were vulnerable to 'moral degradation' and 'deviation'. "We never boast of being fully honest." Khandker made the comments at an annual meeting of the anti-crime unit to mark the sixth anniversary of its establishment. This law enforcement agency was established by the BNP-led alliance government to improve law and order situation of the country. The RAB chief warned his personnel of tough action for any illegal activities but also congratulated them for doing their work with sincerity. Since its establishment, 654 people have died in custody due to 'crossfire' or what the unit prefers to call 'encounter'. It is widely perceived that these extra judicial deaths are not entirely accidents. Thus far 984 RAB members have faced punishments for a range of offences. The battalion, which is essentially a hybrid of civil law enforcement agencies and armed forces, has about 9,000 members in total. Khandker told the meeting that RAB's reputation must not be allowed to crumble due to the 'wrongdoing of a handful' of his personnel He praised the battalion members for their efficiency and patriotism with which they served the people and the country. It was apparently for this reason that the RAB members had earned the trust of the countrymen, Khandker said. Among his unit's singular achievements, the RAB DG said, the elite crime busters had ridden the movie industry of vulgarity, which was predominant before RAB became active. Khandker claimed that it was because of the battalion's efforts the movie industry had become comparatively cleaner now. But he did not elaborate the kind of efforts that the battalion undertook. bdn
