 Rajshahi, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  Police took RU Shibir chief Shamsul Alam Golap for a week of questioning on Friday for the Feb 8 campus violence and killing of BCL activist Faruk Hossain. Motihar police appealed for a 10-day grilling after presenting Golap to the Metropolitan Court. Judge Ziaur Rahman approved seven days following the hearing. Tofazzal Hossain, Motihar Police Station's OC, said that Golap has been taken for questioning on charges of vandalising Shah Makdum Hall and possession of explosives. He was arrested by RAB at Bhuapur in Tangail on Thursday. Golap has been a fugitive since the killing of RU's Chhatra League activist Faruk Hossain in February. Police arrested 135 members of Rajshahi Jamaat and Chhatra Shibir for Faruk's killing and attacks on several BCL activists. On Feb 14, Rajshahi police sent emergency bulletins to all districts with a list of 54 Islami Chhatra Shibir activists, including RU Shibir president Shamsul Alam Golap and general secretary Mobarak Hossain, accused of Rajshahi University violence and student killing. bdnew
