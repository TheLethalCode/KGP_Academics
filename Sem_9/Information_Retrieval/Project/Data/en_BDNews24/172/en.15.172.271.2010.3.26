<TITLE> Chile's Medel becomes Boca icon with goals against River </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new Boca Juniors icon was born on Thursday when Chile's Gary 'Pitbull' Medel scored both goals in their 2-0 victory over arch-rivals River Plate in Argentina's 'Superclasico'. Medel scored from a Juan Roman Riquelme free kick after 13 minutes and blasted home his second from outside the box four minutes into the second half of Argentine soccer's biggest derby. Being sent off 15 minutes from time for a foul, his second bookable offence, appeared to merely heighten the esteem of the hard-core Boca fans who maintained a high tempo atmosphere of chanting throughout the match at the Bombonera.

The atmosphere in the Bombonera compared with the best derbies between the two sides when they were fighting neck and neck for the league title. The chanting was constant, the sound deafening and the ticker tape abundant. The match, however, was mediocre even if it was fought with passion, particularly from a Boca side determined to put behind them a run of seven games without winning. Riquelme, with his intelligent playmaking and prompting of both goals, and Medel, with his commitment and scoring, were the outstanding performers. Boca, after their second win in 10 matches, climbed to joint 14th with 11 points. River are a point ahead in
