 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday ordered the government to submit a report on what steps it has taken to apply the court's previously issued guidelines on preventing sexual harassment against women. The court, in its order, asked the cabinet, the law, labour, education and communication secretaries, inspector general of police, Bangladesh Television director general, presidents of trade bodies BGMEA and BKMEA and Bangladesh Bar Council chairman to answer within seven days. A High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and A. T. M. Fazle Kabir issued the order upon a petition by Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association. The High Court, on Mar 14 last year, laid down a set of guidelines, including installation of complaint cells headed by women, to prevent sexual harassment of women and girls at educational institutions, offices, factories and other workplaces. The government was also asked to treat the guidelines as law until necessary laws are enacted by the parliament on the basis of the guidelines. The Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association filed a contempt of court petition with the High Court on Mar 8 accusing the government of not implementing the court's guidelines and thus dishonouring the order. "The court has asked to know about the developments regarding its guidelines on preventing sexual harrassment," Fauzia Karim, a leading member of the association, told reporters on Thursday after the court order. " "The hearing on our petition will be held after the government elucidates its stance." bdnew
