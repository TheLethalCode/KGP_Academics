 NAD ALI, Afghanistan, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heir to the British throne Prince Charles made his first visit to troops on the front line in Afghanistan on Thursday, thanking soldiers who have advanced deep into territory held by the Taliban. During a two-day visit to Afghanistan, Charles also met US and British commanders of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and toured a renovation project in Kabul's old city run by a charity he sponsors.

"We have greatly reduced the use of lethal force," Cowan said. "As a result we see many people coming over to our side and starting to trust us."

Britain has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, the second largest contingent behind the United States, which is increasing its own force to 100,000 this year under an escalation strategy ordered by President Barack Oba
