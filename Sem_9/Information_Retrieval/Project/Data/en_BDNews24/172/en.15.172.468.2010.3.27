 LONDON, Mar 27 (bdnews24com/Reuters) - England captain Andrew Strauss made no apology for enjoying two months of relaxation while his team toiled in the heat of Bangladesh on Friday as he looked forward to getting back out into the middle. Strauss was spared the three one-day internationals and two Tests in Bangladesh to recharge his batteries for a busy year ahead which includes the Twenty20 World Cup, a home series against Pakistan and culminates with the Ashes in Australia. "I wasn't getting up at three-o-clock in the morning to watch every ball but I was getting up quite early," Strauss told reporters after helping with renovation work at Old Millhillians Cricket Club in London as part of an ECB grassroots scheme. "It was strange watching them go out but I knew it was in safe hands with Cookie (Alastair Cook) leading the side and (coach) Andy Flower being there and I had every confidence they would get the results they needed, which they did. "Of course when the tour is going on you think it would be nice to be out there with the lads. But I genuinely believe that the benefits of me taking time off will be seen later on in the summer and into the winter." Strauss' absence raised some eyebrows but he said he was happy with the decision. "I can understand people (questioning the decision)," he said. "Their argument is that as the captain you should be there all the time. But I think we have to look at ways of making the most of the players we have got and getting the best out of players when we need them to be playing their best. "We've got the Ashes which is huge. We need to be peaking there and have to look at how best to do that. "It wasn't a unilateral decision where I said I don't want to go to Bangladesh. This was something we talked about for a number of months with Andy Flower and (ECB managing director) Hugh Morris. When you do something different there will always be criticism. "I've had a solid break for two months and feel refreshed. Now I can't wait to get out there and play." Strauss, who has made a good start to his career as England captain after taking over from Kevin Pietersen, was full of praise for Essex batsman Cook's leadership of the team in his absence. England won all three ODIs in Bangladesh and both Tests against stubborn opponents. "Before he went I said to him you must do it your way to get a real benefit from it," Strauss said. "You have to learn what it's like to captain the team and I felt he did that and by the sounds of things it went well. "I had the odd text message with him and I congratulated him when he did well but it was his show and Andy Flower's show and they should take great credit. "Alastair led by example and I knew he had the respect of the players anyway. It was a steep learning curve for him but I think he would have benefitted from it immensely." Strauss will pick up the reins again with England in good shape but he said there was plenty of hard work to come. "I've got some thoughts about how we can improve things over the next nine months and now is the time to start implementing them," he
