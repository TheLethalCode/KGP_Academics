 BAGHDAD, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's supporters demanded a manual recount of Iraq's election result on Friday, hours before officials were due to release the final vote tallies. In the latest in a series of demonstrations that followed Maliki's call for a recount, protesters gathered at Baghdad's provincial government building waving banners that read: "No, no to fraud" and "Where have our voices gone?"

Major General Qassim al-Moussawi, Baghdad's security spokesman, said security forces were not imposing a curfew but would be ready for any signs of trouble as the vote results were released.
