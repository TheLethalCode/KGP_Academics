 Chittagong, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  A strike by Chittagong bus owners suspended services along 19 routes of the south east region on Sunday. The strike was called to protest an alleged incident of extortion by a local Awami League leader following the death of a child in a bus accident. The strike suspended road communication between Chittagong city and southern districts, including Cox's Bazaar and Bandarban, stranding thousands of passengers. Md Musa, joint convener of the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar-Teknaf route owners-workers coordination council, said they called the strike protesting against demands of extortion following a road accident on the route. A child was killed in a road crash on the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway on Mar 25. Local people detained the bus driver and conductor and handed them to the police. A local leader of the ruling Awami League intervened into the affair, the bus owners claim. They say he demanded Tk 5 lakh saying that he would "negotiate the matter". The AL leader also threatened the bus operator that his service would be stopped until he received the money, Musa said. He said the bus owners would not allow any buses on the road until the security of the workers was ensured. b
