<TEXT>
 Satkhira/Benapole, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)India began dredging of the common Ichamati river at the border with Bangladesh on Saturday, to restore navigability and prevent flooding in West Bengal. Dhaka gave its consent during water talks earlier this year for Delhi to dredge the Ichamati river on the Bangladesh side as well as the Indian, as emergence of a 20 kilometre shoal has been causing floods in West Bengal. Irrigation and waterways minister for the West Bengal Shubhas Naskar inaugurated the programme Saturday at the Pipli-Goga border. Pipli is a small village on the border, in Gaighata, North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, lying opposite Goga village, near Benapole landport, in Sharsha upazila of Jessore on the Bangladesh side. India's central government will bear the expenses of Rs 356,800,000 (around Tk 55 crore), according to the agreement. The Ichamati will be dredged for a 20km stretch which acts as a divider along the shared border. It will be widened by 7.5 metre on each side, measured from the border line in the middle of the river. The preliminary work of dredging 11 kilometres is expected to be completed by June before the monsoon, while the remaining work will begin later in November, Naskar said. Meanwhile, a BDR-BSF flag meeting was held Saturday at Kaliani in Kushkhali union of the Sadar upazila over the dredging of a canal of the Ichamati river along the Satkhira border. Major Jahangir Alam of Satkhira 41 Rifles Battalion said members of India's Border Security Force accompanied by workmen came to dig along Gorar Khal on the Kushkhali frontier on Friday. But they ceased the digging and retreated when BDR challenged them. BSF in a letter invited the BDR for a flag meeting Saturday. The meeting decided that no side would work within 150 yards of the frontier without permission. bdnews24.c
