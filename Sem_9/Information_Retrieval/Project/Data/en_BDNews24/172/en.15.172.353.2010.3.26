<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is commemorating the 39th anniversary of its independence on Friday with long sought trial of war crimes coming a step closer thanks to formation of the country's first war crimes tribunal the day before--four decades on from the war. Thousands of people streamed to Savar National Memorial from early morning to commemorate the millions who made the ultimate sacrifice to realise the dream of a new nation. President Md Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina placed wreaths at the memorial at dawn for the freedom fighters who gave their lives during the nine-month war against Pakistan occupying forces. The president in his Independence Day called upon all Bangladeshis both at home and abroad to work together for the country's betterment and to truly establish the spirit of the liberation war on Bangladesh soil. The prime minister massage called upon the people to remain aware against "all conspiracies to thwart upcoming war crimes trials". The opposition leader Khaleda Zia also urged the people to unite against "conspiracies to make Bangladesh a country that depends on others for its sovereignty". On March 26 1971, following the Bloody Night of March 25 when Pakistan forces killed thousands of innocent civilians, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed Bangladesh free, which launched the nine-month war for independence. On the eve of the Independence Day this year, the government declared a three-member war crime tribunal, seven member investigation agency and a 12-member prosecution panel, which, long-awaited by Bangladeshis, was welcomed as the single biggest step in almost four decades towards trials of 1971 war crimes. The Sector Commanders Forum organised a symbolic blackout at Suhrawardy Udayan on Thursday night at 11.59 pm to mark the Black Night of torture and killing of innocent and unarmed Bangladeshis by Pakistani invading forces that sparked the independence war in 1971. The forum then led thousands in a candle lighting ceremony at the Shikha Anirban at midnight as a symbolic celebration of the dawn of Bangladesh's independence. On Friday morning, millions of individuals from all strata of life and thousands of political, cultural and other organisations gathered at independence and martyrs' memorials throughout the country to pay tribute to those who lay down their lives for a free Bangladesh. Colourful programmes were also organised nationwide to celebrate the day. The main opposition BNP also brought out a colourful procession from its Naya Paltan headquarters ending at the National Press Club. At a brief rally before the procession, standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said that the Awami League feared Zia. That is why they were out to wipe out his name, he said. "But Zia can not be removed from people's mind." "People of the country know well that it was Major Zia who declared the independence in 1971," Mosharraf said. bd
