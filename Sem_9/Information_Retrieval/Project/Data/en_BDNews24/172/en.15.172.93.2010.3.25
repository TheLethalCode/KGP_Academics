<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com) As temperatures rise in the capital, the power crisis and consequent load shedding, already a source of immense frustration in most parts of the city, also gave rise to water protests among Dhaka residents on Thursday. Residents of the capital's Badda area laid a half-hour siege Thursday on Kuril-Biswaroad demanding uninterrupted water supply, which water officials say is impossible due to increasing power cuts. The 30-minute siege, which began at noon, caused huge traffic gridlock in the area. The situation, however, eased after the protest ended. Assistant police commissioner of Gulshan region Nurul Alam told bdnews24.com that more than 100 residents of Madhya-Badda area blockaded the road demanding regular water supply, leading to a complete halt of traffic. This was the second demonstration for water by Badda residents in as many days. Al Amin, a resident of Badda, told bdnews24.com there is hardly any water in the pipeline. "What little there is, is very foul-smelling," he said. Most Badda residents cannot even store water because they do not have reserve water tanks in their houses, he said. "I am one of the lucky ones with a tank. But others around me sometimes have no water in their tanks for 24 hours at a time," said Al Amin. Badda union council chairman Ali Hossain told bdnews24.com that there are water pumps at every ward, but they cannot be operated at full capacity because of chronic power shortages. "We demanded generators to be set up at every pump. But all our pleas fell on deaf ears," he said. Hossain also urged the government to take immediate steps to resolve the water crisis and threatened to launch a tough movement if the situation is not improved. WASA chairman engineer Golam Mostafa also said that power crisis was hampering water supply in many areas of the capital. In some areas, power outages last for 12 hours, he said. Regarding the water crisis in Badda, the WASA chief said a generator and an additional water pump were being installed to address the issue on an emergency basis. He said he hoped that the crisis would ease immediately as there might be less power cuts on Friday and Saturday. bd
