 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com) - Riding on Naman Ojha's belligerent 49-ball 80 Rajasthan Royals beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs in the Indian Premier League on Sunday, reports Times of India. Chennai Super Kings dealt a blow to their run-chase when skipper MS Dhoni was dismissed against Rajasthan Royals in the IPL encounter. The Super Kings were chasing their target comfortably, but the table turned suddenly towards Rajasthan when Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina were dismissed in quick succession. After losing Matthew Hayden, Chennai Super Kings lost their second opener when Vijay (42 off 28 balls) was run out by Yusuf Pathan. Raina (14 off 12) was clean bowled by Shane Warne immediately after Vijay went to the pavilion. Undeterred by the dismissal of opener Matthew Hayden, the Super Kings maintained a steady run rate in their attempt to chase 178 runs before losing Vijay. Rajasthan Royals gave a denting blow to the Chennai Super Kings early in the innings when Matthew Hayden (19 off 14 balls) was dismissed. Yusuf Pathan scalped the hard-hitting opener when he caught off his own bowling. Earlier, after electing to bat first, Naman Ojha hit a belligerent 80 to propel Rajasthan Royals to 177 for eight. Ojha and Michael Lumb (30 off 16 balls) took the onus on themselves to justify skipper Shane Warne's decision to bat first at the Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera and Chennai skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni didn't know how to stop the boundary flow as long as the duo were in the middle. The Rajasthan Royals openers forged a brief and brisk 47-run opening partnership inside four overs that provided the perfect platform to put on board a really big total even though the Royals eventually settled for a score which could have been higher. Albie Morkel opened the bowling for Chennai Super Kings and a nonchalant Lumb dismissed his third delivery over long-on ropes to signal his intention. His partner Ojha responded by hitting a boundary off the last delivery of the over to open his account and both were seen making merry at Chennai's expense. Morkel returned to send down his second over when Lumb hit him for a four, following it up with a massive six before he fell to a slower ball and returned just when he was looking dangerous. Ojha added 53 runs with Faiz Fazal (17) in seven overs before his partner fell to Shadab Jakati. Jakati dealt even a bigger blow in his next over, removing Yusuf Pathan (8) to reduce the Royals to 117 for three in the 13th over. Ojha, however, was unstoppable. Twice he hit Muttiah Muralitharan out of the ground, a treatment he meted out to Suresh Raina as well. Having completed his fifty in just 32 balls, Ojha hit Jakati for two sixes in the high-yielding 17th over before he fell to Thilan Thushara in the next over. Ojha's 49-ball blitzkrieg studded with six fours and five sixes. Adam Voges chipped in with a characteristically cheeky 19-ball 20 and the Royals lost three wickets -- including two run out dismissals -- in that crazy last over from Thushara which yielded just seven
