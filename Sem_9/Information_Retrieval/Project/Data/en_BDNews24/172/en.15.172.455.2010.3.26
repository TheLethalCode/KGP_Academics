 Shamim Ahmed bdnews 24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com) ---- With existing manpower and resources, Dhaka City Corporation may take up to five years to dismantle an estimated 2500 illegal hoardings in the capital, a DCC official has said. Currently, the city authority's drive against illegal billboards in the capital is managing to remove just 10-12 billboards a day, with the demolition campaign running just once a week. The slow pace is due to lack of adequate workforce and proper equipment. DCC chief urban planner Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com, "If the companies remove the billboards themselves, the job could be completed in just one year." "A single campaign requires some 30-40 workers, four gas cutters, one crane, two dumpers, two trucks of which two gas cutters are hired from outside." Sirajul said, "It is not possible to dismantle more than 45-50 billboards in a month." "If the campaign goes at such slow pace, it will take at least five years to demolish all illegal billboards, he said Given the enormity of the task and its slow pace, DCC is pondering to give out the work to a private contractor. However, some companies have started removing their billboards following a recent DCC directive. Some billboards have been removed at Danmondhi area, Sirajul said. Sirajul was hopeful that all the illegal billboards could be removed in a year, provided the companies take the responsibility. He also said they can meet the campaign expenses by auctioning off the billboards. Companies need Tk 1.5-2 lakh to install a single billboard. If the DCC dismantles the billboards, the companies won't get any compensation. In order to avoid that, he said, the companies should get the boards removed to minimise their loss. The DCC demolition campaign began shortly after an accident in Gulshan when two people were killed by a billboard, which collapsed during a storm on the night of Mar 15. The campaign began at Shahbagh on Mar 18 but DCC had to stop due to non-cooperation of the police. The campaign, however, resumed following directives of the High Court on Mar 21. Managing director of Neptune Advertising and president of Billboard Association Rafiqul Islam said, "Association has not taken any decision to remove the billboards as DCC has failed to locate the risky billboards." "If risky billboards were identified, companies would remove them willingly," he said The number of legal billboards and mega signs is only 500, Sirajul said, adding that DCC has no exact list of illegal and risky billboards. According to its plan, DCC will carry out its demolition campaign on Mar 27 from Danmondhi field to Rashel Square, on Apr 1 from Kuril intersection to Natun Bazar, on Apr 8 from Farmgate to Bijoy Sarani and on Apr 15 from Agargaon and its adjacent areas.
