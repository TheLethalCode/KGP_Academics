<TEXT>
 ROME, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Luca Toni goal gave AS Roma a thrilling 2-1 home win over Inter Milan on Saturday that took them within a point of the Serie A leaders and kept the three-way title race wide open approaching the final stretch. The striker controlled a mis-hit Rodrigo Taddei shot and fired home in the 72nd minute as the hosts continued their remarkable recovery from the disarray they found themselves in at the start of the season. Inter's Diego Milito had equalised just six minutes earlier with a goal that looked offside, after Roma's Daniele De Rossi opened the scoring in the 17th by capitalising on a blunder by goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Champions Inter hit the woodwork three times, the last occasion from Milito deep in stoppage time. Third-placed AC Milan can pull level with Roma on 62 points with seven games to go if they overcome injuries, suspensions and poor form to beat Lazio on Sunday (1845 GMT). "This is a great, beautiful night," Toni told Sky television. "We've been chasing for a while. "It was important to win tonight to try to realise a dream. Now we're a point away we'll see what happens." CESAR ERROR Roma were on top for most of the first half, with Mirko Vucinic and John Arne Riise going close after De Rossi tapped the ball in when Cesar spilled a Nicolas Burdisso header. Former Roma defender Walter Samuel then roused Inter when he headed against the crossbar in the 42nd minute. Argentine forward Milito, back after missing Wednesday's 3-0 win over Livorno with a hamstring problem, also hit the upright before scoring a goal that should probably have been disallowed for offside against Goran Pandev earlier in the move. Toni struck soon after to extend Roma's unbeaten league run to 21 games while the post denied Milito at the death. Roma captain Francesco Totti came off the bench in the closing stages to make his return from a long-standing knee problem. Inter, who meet CSKA Moscow in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, may be suffering from fatigue because of their packed fixture list, having only won two of their last nine league games. Elsewhere Palermo consolidated fourth place, which is worth a slot in next season's Champions League preliminaries, with a 3-1 home win over Bologna courtesy of a Fabrizio Miccoli hat-trick. The striker nutmegged keeper Emiliano Viviano on 10 minutes and then restored his side's advantage with a penalty in the 43rd after Adailton had been on target from a free kick for Bologna. Miccoli then sealed victory for the Sicilians 11 minutes from time. Palermo have 51 points, four more than fifth-placed Sampdoria who host Cagliari on Sunday (1300). bdnews24.com/lg/1735h Sports-Football-Barcelona Ibrahimovic fires Barca to top of La Liga MADRID, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored for the third straight match to fire Barcelona to a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Real Mallorca on Saturday and send the champions three points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. The Sweden striker smashed the ball into the roof of the net from close range in the 63rd minute for his 15th league goal of the campaign to end Mallorca's stubborn resistance and give his side 74 points from 29 matches. Real Madrid, who host Barca in two weeks for the 'El Clasico', can climb back above their arch rivals on goal difference with a win at home to Atletico Madrid on Sunday. Barca have been relying on a flood of goals from league top scorer Lionel Messi to keep their title bid on track but coach Pep Guardiola started with both the Argentina forward and fit-again Spain midfielder Xavi on the bench. Mallorca, who had won all but one of their 13 home matches, almost stunned the visitors in the second minute when Aritz Aduriz smashed a shot against the post and Gonzalo Castro forced a fine save from Victor Valdes with a follow-up shot. After weathering the early storm, Barca began to exert their customary control and Mallorca goalkeeper Dudu Aouate reacted well to palm away a Gabriel Milito header in the 17th. The Israeli goalkeeper twice denied Ibrahimovic and forward Jeffren, handed a rare start with France captain Thierry Henry not included in the squad, shaved the bar with a powerful strike just before the half hour. Mallorca midfielder Borja Valero gave the visitors a scare when he curled a freekick against the post shortly before halftime, although Valdes, who is pushing for a place in Spain's World Cup squad, looked to have his goal covered. LATE PRESSURE The introduction of Messi and Xavi early in the second half gave Barca a fillip and it was from Xavi's corner that the ball eventually found its way through to an unmarked Ibrahimovic who gave Aouate no chance. The Sweden striker showed his versatility shortly after when he used his back to divert a deep Pedro cross into Messi's path but the Argentine's powerful shot flew over the bar. Messi squandered another chance to double Barca's lead in the 83rd when he carved an opening at the edge of the area but skewed his left-foot strike well wide. The Catalans survived some late pressure but survived and the defeat leaves Mallorca in fourth on 47 points, two ahead of Sevilla, who play at Villarreal on Sunday in new coach Antonio Alvarez's first match in charge. "I scored another goal but the important thing was the win," Ibrahimovic said in a television interview. "It was a hard match and they were difficult opponents but in the end we got the three points." Third-placed Valencia, 18 points behind Real, play at Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late k
