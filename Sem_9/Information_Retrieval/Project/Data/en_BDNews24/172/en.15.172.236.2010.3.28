 Chittagong, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of Chittagong port are observing an 8-hour work-stoppage over reinstatement of previously sacked workers between 8am and 4pm on Sunday. Mohammad Alamgir, the organising secretary of Dock Port Workers and Employees Federation, said Saturday night's meetings with the authorities did not bear fruit. The workers federation had demonstrated in the port area on Saturday. Their demands included recruitment of berth-operators through tender and establishment of hospital and dormitories for the workers. The port authority on Oct 26 last year decided to reconsider its decision to lay off port workers at a high-level meeting in Dhaka with the shipping minister, labour state minister and workers' leaders. Subsequently 2,700 workers were adjudged eligible for reinstatement in a week-long review that began in Jan 26 but still has not been implemented. bdnew
