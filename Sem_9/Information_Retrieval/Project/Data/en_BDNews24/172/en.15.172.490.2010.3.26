<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)  The government has asked main opposition BNP for information about war criminals. LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam, also general secretary of the ruling Awami League, urged the opposition on Friday to come forward with any information it had regarding war criminals and provide it to the government. The AL policymaker said he hoped that the trial would be held soon. "I think the opposition also wants the trial of war criminals to be held," he said after paying tributes to the martyrs of Liberation War at the national memorial in Savar. The fundamentalist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which was part of the BNP-led government between 2001 and 2006, is accused of actively opposing the Liberation War in 1971 and committing crimes against humanity at that time. The right-wing religion-based party remains a major ally of the BNP-led opposition in parliament currently. Top-ranking BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury is also alleged of being a war criminal and Qamrul Islam, the state minister for law, had said recently that he would be tried as well. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Friday morning expressed his confusion over transparency of war crimes trial process. Ashraf refuted the statement saying, "The trial will raise no questions. International standards will be maintained at every turn." On Thursday, the eve of the 39th Independence Day, the government declared a three-member war crimes tribunal, seven-member investigation agency and a 12-member prosecution panel. Meanwhile, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh (BDB) president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury welcomed the declaration of the tribunal and said: "The people of the country want the trial to be held. Peace will have been finally established on this land, if the trial is held." Dhaka University vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said, "It's a matter of joy that at last the government is going to start the trial." bdnews24
