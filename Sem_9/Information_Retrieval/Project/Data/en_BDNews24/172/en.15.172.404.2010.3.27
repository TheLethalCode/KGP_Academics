 Al Amin Dewan bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)Consumers are not getting the benefit of the drop in wholesale prices of essentials as retailers are reportedly refusing to follow suit, arguing they bought their produce when the prices were high. For the last one month, prices of food items including rice, wheat, sugar, palm oil, lentils, ginger and garlic fell in the local wholesale markets. "Prices of essentials have fallen in the local wholesale markets because of drop in the international market," Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association president Mahbubul Alam told bdnews24.com. So it was expected that it would have an impact on the retail market as well, he added. Mahbub said the consumers are deprived of the price benefits as the government has no regular 'monitoring system' on the market activities. While visiting the retail markets Friday, bdnews24.com correspondent observed a wide gap between wholesale and retail price. Retailers say they cannot cut prices as they bought the goods before the prices fell. In the retail markets of the port city sugar is being sold at Tk 46-48 per KG, while it is Tk 40-41 at the country's largest wholesale market at Chaktai-Khatunganj. In February, when the wholesale price of sugar was Tk 54, retailers used to sell at Tk 56. But now, when the wholesale price is reduced by Tk 14, price in the retail market is reduced by only Tk 8. It was the same case with rice prices. With the fall of rice prices, wholesalers are selling coarse rice at Tk 24-27, Miniket at Tk 29 and Paijam at Tk 30.40, but the retailers in Riazuddin Bazar are selling at Tk 28-32, Tk 35 and Tk 36 respectively. But, it was observed that retailers at Kazir Deuri and Karnafuli were asking for Tk 1 to 2 more than in Riazuddin Bazar. Omar Azam, general secretary of Chaktai Rice Traders' Association, said, "Retailers raise the prices immediately after an increase in the wholesale market, but they don't reduce price in the same way when it's down." Prices of the other essentials have also not come down yet in the retail markets in line with the wholesale markets. The retailers are making more profits, the wholesalers say. Md Aziz, a retailer at Karnafuli Bazar, however, rejected the allegation. "Retailers usually purchase goods in a lotfor one or two weeks. So it takes time to cope with the wholesale market until those stored goods are sold out," he told bdnews24.com. Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB), Chittagong president SM Nazer Hossain, urged for government's intervention to address the price gap between the retail and wholesale markets. "The retailers, using their syndicate, are refusing to reduce the prices," he told bdnews24.com. bdn
