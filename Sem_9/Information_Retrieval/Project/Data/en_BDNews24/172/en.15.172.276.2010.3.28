<TEXT>
 Feni, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)A BDR special court in Feni resumed trial of 62 suspected mutineers on Sunday after a two-month break. The special court, set up at the 19 Rifles Battalion headquarters in Daganbhuiyan Upazila, resumed proceedings at 11am with BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam heading the panel of three judges. Eight out of 31 witnesses gave testimony until midday. Fourteen witnesses had given their testimony at the last hearing on Jan 25, said commander of 19 Rifles Battalion Lt Col Gazi Md Salahuddin, also prosecutor in the case. The remaining witnesses do not need to be heard, he said. Previously, 58 of the 62 accused border guards pleaded guilty to acts of rebellion in Feni, sparked by the bloody mutiny at the BDR's Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka last February, and sought pardon from the trial court. Daganbhuiyan police filed a case last year accusing the border guards in Feni of armed rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutiny. All 62 accused are being detained in Feni jail. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 at Pilkhana, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. Among the acts of rebellion during that time, a contingent of Feni border guards took up arms, fired shots in public and blocked the Feni-Maizdi Road on Feb 26. Six special courts, including two in Dhaka, are trying some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. bdn
