<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)  A volatile week for the capital market saw Dhaka stock's benchmark index start the week with the second highest single-day gain in the bourse's history, only to fall again steeply. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark, the general index (DGEN), opened the week at 5408.66 points and closed at 5617.93, rising 3.87 percent or 209 points over the week. Of the five trading days, the bourse was up on the first two days followed by a slump on Tuesday due to investors' panic selling over a directive of the regulator. The market bounced back on Wednesday but ended slightly lower on Thursday. The week's first trading session on Sunday saw the DGEN surging by 2.58 percent mainly due to a hefty rise in Grameenphone (GP) as its dividend declaration lifted investors' morale. The index rose by 139 pointsthe second highest gain since January 25 this year when it gained 155 points. GP which makes up nearly a fifth of Dhaka stock's market capitalisation, climbed 8.75 percent on the day to Tk 341.80 after its board recommended a 60 percent dividend on Friday. Brokerage house officials said retail investors bought GP shares heavily although the company was trading at the spot market where stocks can be bought only with cash. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an attempt to halt the spiralling price of the country's lone telecom issue, sent it to the spot market last month with no margin loans and suspended netting facility. The suspended netting facility means that investors cannot purchase GP shares with the immediate proceeds from the sales of other stocks. Market analysts said smooth DSE polls and the market regulator easing credit facilities boosted investors' confidence. "The DSE annual polls on Sunday removed all uncertainties over how the stock exchange would be run. At least there was no brazen meddling by the government," said a leading stockbroker. The current president Rakibur Rahman retained his directorship after winning the DSE polls and is expected to keep his presidency for another term. Banking sector, the bellwether of the market, declined marginally by 0.22 per cent while the non-banking financial institutions edged up 0.87 percent. The pharmaceuticals gained 1.99 percent, insurers 1.37 percent and cement 1.07 percent. Mutual funds dropped by 0.85 percent and energy by 0.02 percent. Daily turnover amounted to Tk 9.75 billion  an increase of 8.5 percent over the previous session's Tk 8.97 billion. "This is a good sign. It shows retail investors are coming back into the market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former DSE chief executive. Market players, however, questioned the sustainability of the gain. "The market is still overheated and might dive once the hype over GP dividend is over", a top official of a merchant bank, preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com. On Monday, the daily turnover hit a one month high, crossing the Tk 10 billion mark for the first time since February 24. In a volatile market, the index hit the highest level at 5580.17 due to a hike in banks but dropped to 5548.22 after GP declined nearly one per cent. The benchmark index rose by 14 points or 0.25 percent from the previous day's closing. Meanwhile, the turnover amounted to Tk 10.10 billion, up by 3.72 percent from Sunday's Tk 9.75 billion. Banking shares moved up by 1.55 percent with insurers and engineering sectors also performing well, rising 1.32 percent and 1.63 percent respectively. Non-banking financial institutions edged down by 0.74 percent while pharmaceuticals, mutual funds and cement shares fell by 0.72 percent, 0.24 percent and 0.22 percent respectively. On Tuesday, the market fell by almost one percent amid volatile trading, as the investors reacted negatively to a new directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the directive, the market price of an individual's share portfolio has to be calculated by adding the closing prices and net asset value of the shares and dividing in half. Market price of a portfolio is a key determinant for the margin loan requirement of an individual. The news was posted on DSE website around midday that prompted panic selling by the investors. The market started with a positive note as the benchmark index climbed around 70 points but took a nosedive of more than 56 points when the news hit the market. A group of investors demonstrated in front of the SEC office after trading hours and DSE building during the session demanding withdrawal of the directive They claimed that they would not get any credit facility as per the new directive. The SEC, however, rejected the demands and said that it would not affect the margin loan ratio ceiling of 1:1.5 set by the market regulator on March 16. "There was no fear for not getting credit as per new directive as credit facilities will not be affected," Mansur Alam, an SEC member told the press. The merchant bankers and stockbrokers will use the order in making valuation of margin loan of portfolios or securities of their clients but not in disbursing loans, according to him. Strong buying in the morning session and panic selling afterwards caused the turnover to stand at Tk 11.02 billionrising by over 10 percent from Monday's Tk 10.10 billion. All the major sectors except telecom and mutual funds went down on the day. The mutual funds advanced 0.65 per cent while the lone telecom issue, GP rose slightly by 0.35 percent. The banking sector lost 1.17 percent though it was up in the early trading hours. Energy shares lost 1.52 percent, non-banking financial institutions 1.21 percent, general insurers 2.10 percent, pharmaceuticals 0.89 percent and cement 0.92 percent. The SEC's clarification cooled down the investors as on Wednesday the stock's hit a three-week high. The index surged by 114 points or 2.07 percent  the highest gain since March 4. The market rose across the board as all the sectors except banks, gained. The banking sector, which accounts for over 40 percent of the total market capitalisation, declined by 0.31 percent. Brokerage house officials said investors opted mainly for GP, energy and pharmaceuticals, taking the market to a three-week high. "Some of the investors decided to 'wait and see', leading to the turnover shrinking drastically," an official of Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Total turnover stood at Tk 8.96 billion, down 18.68 per cent from Tuesday's Tk 11.03 billion. The buying spree caused more than 80 percent issues to gain in value as out of 250 issues traded, 204 increased, 43 declined and three remained unchanged. GP closed at Tk 356.90 from Tk 339.60. Pharmaceuticals gained 2.38 percent, energy 1.52 percent, non-banking financial institutions 1.51 percent, insurers 0.88 percent and cement gained 1.02 percent. The closing day of the week, Thursday, left Dhaka stocks ending slightly lower, with the deciding factor, GP, gaining by less than 1 percent. Most of the banks as well as the lease financers suffered losses. Insurers had a mixed day while the day turned out to be a bad one for power and energy. The total market capitalisation of Thursday stood at Tk 2,289 billion, a 3.49 percent hike from Tk 2,212 billion at the beginning of the week. Meanwhile, the daily average turnover of the week also rose by 36.11 percent to Tk 9.73 billion from last week's average of Tk 7.14 billion. GP, Beximco, Beximco Pharmaceuticals, Bex Tex and Summit Power were the week's turnover leaders
