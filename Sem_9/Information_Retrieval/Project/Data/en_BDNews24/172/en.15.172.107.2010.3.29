 By Jeff Mason KABUL, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama made the first trip of his presidency to Afghanistan on Sunday, where he said the military campaign had made progress but President Hamid Karzai still had to tackle corruption. Air Force One landed in darkness at Bagram airfield north of the Afghan capital, and Obama was whisked by helicopter to Karzai's palace in Kabul, where he was greeted by the Afghan president and a band playing the U.S. national anthem. "I want to send a strong message that the partnership between the United States and Afghanistan is going to continue. We have already seen progress with respect to the military campaign against extremism in the region," Obama later told Karzai in front of reporters inside the palace. "We also want to continue to make progress on ... good governance, rule of law, anti-corruption efforts -- all these things end up resulting in an Afghanistan that is more prosperous, more secure, independent," he added. Karzai said he hoped "the partnership will continue in the future toward a stable, strong, peaceful Afghanistan that can sustain itself, that can move forward into the future." U.S. officials said Obama would press Karzai to crack down on corruption and battle drug trafficking. He would later hear a briefing from the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Army General Stanley McChrystal, and give a speech to U.S. troops. The president left Washington on Saturday night. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, speaking before the trip, said Obama wanted to get an "on the ground update" about the war from McChrystal and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador. National security advisor General James Jones told reporters on Air Force One that Obama would tell Karzai "in this second term that there are certain things he has to do as the president of his country to battle the things that have not been paid attention to almost since day one." In December, Obama ordered the deployment of an extra 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan and set a mid-2011 target to begin withdrawal. About a third have so far arrived, participating in a major offensive in the south of the country last month. The Obama administration has had an uneasy relationship with Karzai throughout Obama's 14 months in office, reaching a low point during a three-month Afghan election dispute last year. Eikenberry wrote in a classified cable in November, later leaked, that Karzai was "not an adequate strategic partner." Obama speaks to Karzai infrequently, unlike his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, who launched the war after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. TROOP INCREASE The trip allows Obama to see any early results of his troop increase, show support for military personnel and counter critics who say his focus on passing healthcare legislation has diverted attention from foreign policy. Since Obama took office, the eight-year war in Afghanistan has shifted from a second priority behind Iraq to the main effort of the U.S. military. By the end of this year, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan will have tripled under Obama's watch to 100,000, along with about 40,000 from NATO allies. Obama's domestic victory on healthcare reform last week gives him political space to turn his attention to the Afghan war, which has mixed support from the American public amid rising casualties, costs, and corruption among Afghan leaders. Obama traveled to Afghanistan during the 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign after being criticized by Republican challenger John McCain for failing to tour the war zone, but has not been back since his victory. The White House official said weather and logistical reasons thwarted previous attempts at a presidential visit since Obama took office in January 2009. Afghan policy has been transformed during Obama's year in office. Top U.S. officials held two long reviews of the White House's war policy, both times electing to send tens of thousands of extra troops. The war has become far deadlier and far more costly, setting records last year for the numbers of troops and civilians killed. Karzai, who remained in power after a fraud-marred election last August, has launched a high profile effort to reconcile with the Taliban, who have made a comeback more than eight years since U.S.-backed Afghan militias drove them from Kabul. The Taliban have so far spurned his offer to talk, although another insurgent group, Hezb-i-Islami sent a delegation to Kabul this month to present a peace plan. The palace revealed this week that Karzai had received them. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last week the timing was still not right for reconciliation with senior Afghan Taliban lead
