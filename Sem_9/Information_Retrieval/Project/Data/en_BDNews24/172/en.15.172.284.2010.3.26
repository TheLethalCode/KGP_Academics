 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  The CID has been given the green light to interrogate BD Foods chairman Badruddoza Momen and five others in connection with a 2006 seizure of heroin bound for the United Kingdom. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Munshi Abdul Mazid gave approval for the questioning on Thursday based on CID assistant police super Ershad Ali's remand plea on Mar 1. The remand order said that they will be grilled at CID headquarters, SI Shakhawat Hossain, the court's recording officer, told bdnews24.com. The Criminal Investigation Department filed two cases on April 21 2006, accusing BD Foods of attempting to smuggle 75.5 kilogrammes of heroin to the United Kingdom hidden in consignments of vegetables. The five others to be questioned in the case are BD Foods managers Abu Bakar Siddiqui Mithu and Moinuddin, employee Nazmul Haider Bulbul; also Abul Bashar Selim, the owner of Green Heaven Company, a BD Foods sister concern, and his associate Kazi Zafar Reza. The fate of the two heroin-smuggling cases against the owners and employees of BD Foods and its sister concern became uncertain after the investigating officer was unable to visit the United Kingdom to conduct further investigations. The UK authorities said more evidence was needed to allow the such investigations there. b
