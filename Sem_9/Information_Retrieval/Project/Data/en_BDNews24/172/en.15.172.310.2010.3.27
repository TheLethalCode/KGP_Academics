<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  The war crimes tribunal will start work from Monday, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Saturday. The government on Thursday named the three-member tribunal, seven-member investigative agency and 12-member panel of prosecutors to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes in 1971. The prosecution team and investigators have already met to draft up terms and conditions of their work and to begin sifting through the existing evidence on war crimes. Shafique said on Saturday that the judges of the tribunal can also provide assistance to the investigators and prosecutors if they require. More tribunals could be formed and number of prosecutors might be increased if required after the investigative agency is done with investigation, he added. He also said that the accused could appoint foreign lawyers but they need to be cleared by the bar council. The minister was speaking at a workshop on child law organised by non-governmental organisation Aparajeya Bangladesh. He alleged that some political leaders are creating confusion over the trial process. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Friday expressed confusion over the transparency of the trial process. Shafique said: "We have been saying from the very beginning that nobody will be tried for politically motivated charges. "Those who had committed crimes against humanity in collaboration with the Pakistan occupation army will be prosecuted. "Nobody should be in confusion about that," he said. Shafique said many countries, except Pakistan, had welcomed Bangladesh's initiative to try 1971 war crimes. "Pakistan has tried to create misunderstandings but failed," he said.
