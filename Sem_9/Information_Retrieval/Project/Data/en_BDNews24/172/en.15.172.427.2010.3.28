 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com) - Ross Taylor hit the fastest ever Test century by a New Zealander but his team missed the chance to open up a lead over Australia in the second Test on Sunday, reports BBC Sport. New Zealand began the second day looking dominant, having bowled the tourists out for just 231 in Hamilton. Taylor hit 138, reaching three figures in just 81 balls, but only opener BJ Watling (46) offered any support. Mitchell Johnson took four wickets as the Kiwis posted 264 before Australia reached 35-0 in their second innings.

Taylor's onslaught continued, however, and he belted spinner Nathan Hauritz for 25 runs from one over. After Jeetan Patel was caught by Ricky Ponting for seven, Taylor's luck finally ran out when he was given out after a referral on 138, his highest score against Australia. Southee hit 22 to pad New Zealand's lead a little with Chris Martin, the last man to fall, bowled by Ryan Harris for a duck. Johnson claimed four for 59, while Bollinger and Harris took three wickets apiece. Australia progressed steadily after tea and Watson had reached 28 by the time bad light forced the players off the f
