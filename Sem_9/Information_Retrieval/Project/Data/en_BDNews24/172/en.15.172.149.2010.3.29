<TITLE> DAE seeks 'prayers' as water crunch hits Jessore farmers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jessore, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)The Department of Agriculture Extension has taken the unusual step of issuing letters seeking "special prayers for rain" as hundreds of farmers in Jessore are unable to water their Boro crops with more than 230 shallow tube-wells running dry. Due to lack of rains, the ground water-level in some areas has gone down by 5-6 feet which means that the irrigation pumps cannot operate properly. Farmer Iqbal Hossain from the Sadar upazila said, "We have nothing to do but look into the sky and pray for water." Ramoni Mohon Saha, plant conservation expert of Jessore DAE, told bdnews24.com that the water-level was going down fast. "At this time of year, water is expected to be 26-30 feet below the surface, but it has gone down to 36-37 feet as there has been no rain," he said. The problem is particularly acute in Monirampur, Sadar and Sharsha upazilas, where respectively 78 shallow tube-wells out of 11,358, some 60 out of 8,383 and 54 out of the 14,268 shallow tube wells cannot draw water. Moreover, 18 tube-wells in Obhoynagar, eight in Chowgacha and 18 in Keshobpur are also facing the same problem. DAE deputy director GM Abdul Hakim said that the numbers may not seem to indicate a serious threat and, till now, the agricultural impact has not been too great. "But the situation will be very unpleasant if there's no heavy rain within a week." This would result in farmers facing significant economical problems and may also mean that the government subsidy of Tk 236,700,000 to achieve higher levels of production in this area will have been wasted, Hakim said. "In this situation, farmers are advised to be efficient about using water and to use the time to dig the land," he said. Letters were also issued to the religious institutes asking them to hold special prayers for water, Hakim said. This year, Boro cultivation in the district covers 155,325 hectares of land, which is completely dependent on irrigation water. There are around 73,370 shallow and 1,500 deep tube-wells used for Boro production in the area. bdnews24
