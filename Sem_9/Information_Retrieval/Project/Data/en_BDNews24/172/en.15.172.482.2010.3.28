<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud has been asked to appear before court on April 28 in a defamation suit for alleged slurs against the prime minister. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mehdi Hassan Talukder gave the order on Sunday. In the complaint filed by Awami Ainjibi Parishad's member PK Abdur Rob stated that Shawkat Mahmud, also a member of the BNP chairperson's advisory body, threatened to 'crush' the hands of prime minister Sheikh Hasina at a recent BNP meeting in Cox's Bazar. The complaint, who did not explain in what context the press club president had allegedly made the comment, claims that this comment defamed him as a supporter of the Awami League. Rob also said in his complaint that Shawkat had claimed in his Cox's Bazar speech that Ziaur Rahman was the first person who had declared the independence of Bangladesh. The legal complaint said that this was in contradiction to a High Court order that had ruled last year that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, not Ziaur Rahman, was the 'declarer of independence'. This is the second defamation suit filed against Shawkat over comments he made at the Cox's bazaar meeting. Last week, Bangabandhu Foundation president Moshiur Malik filed a suit over Shawkat's claim that the state minister for law Qamrul Islam was not a real lawyer.
