 UNITED NATIONS, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed frustration on Thursday at slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, where planned elections have been derided in the West as a sham. Ban spoke after discussing Myanmar with a group of key countries, but diplomats said any Security Council action was blocked by objections from China and Russia to what they see as interference in the Asian country's internal affairs. Thursday's meeting and a Security Council discussion of Myanmar on Wednesday came after the ruling junta this month published rules for the elections, for which no date is set.

The group comprises Australia, Britain, China, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam and the European Union. But diplomats said divisions between major powers precluded any action. One envoy said Russia and China insisted on their usual stance of not interfering in the internal affairs. China has long been unwilling to take punitive action against neighboring Myanmar, whose coastline provides it with easy access to lucrative Asian markets. The differences were also apparent after Wednesday's closed-door Security Council discussion of Myanmar. "A general election being held in any country is a matter of a sovereign state, so that should be respected," China's Ambassador Li Baodong told reporters. But British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant did not agree. "The instability that could be caused by a flawed electoral process is a threat to international peace and security," he sa
