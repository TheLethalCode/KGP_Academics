 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said that her government is pledge-bound to complete trial of war criminals despite all obstacles, and nothing would stop them. "We will finish this," she told a gathering at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Saturday. It was organised by the Awami League to mark the 39th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence. The government formed the long-awaited special tribunal for war crimes trials on Mar 25, along with related investigation and prosecution teams. The law minister told reporters on Saturday that the tribunal and its related agencies would formally start functioning on Monday. Hasina at the AL programme later in the day called on people to be aware of "conspiracies" until the trial was over. "There will be conspiracies as the trial proceedings have already started. But everyone has to be alert so that none can stop them," she said. Hasina said "confusions" about the upcoming trials are already being spread in a planned way against the government, adding, "some are instigating people by saying wrong things in public placestea stalls, buses, and even in the secretariat lifts". The war criminals, she also said, now possessed thousands of crores of taka. They were now established, both politically and socially, she said. The prime minister said they would now try to create chaos in society and plot so that the trial would not be held. People of the country already know the war criminals, she said. "It's not needed to say who they are. Their speeches prove who the criminals are," she added. The meeting, presided over by Sajeda Chowdhury, was also attended by senior leaders of Awami League. bdn
