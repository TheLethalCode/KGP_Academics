 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com)  The northeast Indian state of Tripura is offering Bangladesh investment incentives, and has suggested electricity export from its under construction Palatana plant as part of recent Bangla-Indo power sharing initiatives. The visiting chief minister of Tripura Manik Sharkar told businessmen in Dhaka on Saturday that his state could become a destination for Bangladeshi garments and for profitable investments in the construction and industrial sectors. "We will welcome any investment from Bangladesh, which, with use of our resources, promises to generate earnings and employment for Indians," said Sharkar. "Bangladeshi investors will get double incentives, the existing incentives from the central government and now also from the state government," he told a meeting organised by the India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries. "Tripura is experiencing huge growth, higher than the Indian average," said Sharkar. He said the state was seeing a particular boom in the construction industry and was also inviting investment in the industrial sector. "Tripura can ensure the required electricity and gas for new industries," he added. POWER EXPORT He also said Tripura was more than happy to export its surplus electricity to Bangladesh, from the under-construction 726 MW Palatana plant of India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), for Bangla-Indo power sharing. The Palatana power plant would be operational by the first-quarter of 2012, Sharkar added. Bangladesh and India recently signed an MoU on cross-border grid connectivity, agreeing to install 130km of distribution lines. The connection will facilitate Bangladesh's import of 250 megawatts of electricity from India, though specifics of the agreement are yet to be worked out. Sharkar also said that according to surveys of ONGC, Tripura has a vast reserve of natural gas and the state is planning greater electricity production with this which could also be exported to Bangladesh in future. But, in answer to a question, the minister said he could not say anything at present on exporting gas to Bangladesh. "The assessment of our local need is not yet complete." HT Imam, one of the prime minister's advisers, said Bangladesh would allow businesses to invest in India if they could repatriate funds and profit. "This government is also serious about strengthening regional connectivity," Imam said.
