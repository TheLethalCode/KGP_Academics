 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League party has backed two candidates for the April 24 election to the vacant Bhola-3 constituency, a party spokesperson said Sunday. The AL parliamentary board chose Mohammad Jashimuddin, the formerly elected MP from Bhola-3 whose election was ruled unlawful, and Nurunnabi Chowdhury, a Dhaka metropolitan Jubo League leader, deputy office secretary Mrinal Kanti Das told bdnews24.com. The meeting, headed by party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was held at Gano Bhaban, official residence of Hasina, Sunday noon. The meeting interviewed some of the eight hopeful candidates who had put their names forward for selection on Thursday, before settling on Jashim and Nurunnabi. A senior leader, who attended the meeting, said if the Election Commission gives the green signal to both, the party will then decide on who to run. The deadline for submission of nominations to the EC is Mar 29 and withdrawal April 8. The Election Commission declared the constituency void on Feb 3 as ex-army officer Jashimuddin contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated time for retired officials. Electoral law stipulates that a government official cannot run in the election within five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat against BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed, with a lead of 12,000 votes. But Hafiz challenged Jashim's candidacy at the High Court following which Jashim's seat was declared vacated. The AL presidium had a meeting over this nomination on Mar 24. One of the presidium members, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that barring legal complications, Md Jashimuddin was the frontrunner for an AL ticket. bdnews
