<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked Jamaat-e-Islami, and 13 other parties, to amend its charter in full compliance with registration requirements and electoral law by April 30. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said on Thursday that "steps will be taken in accordance to registration regulations" if Jamaat and others fail to respond within that time. He also mentioned that there is provision under the regulations to cancel registration if any party fails to submit an amended constitution within a given deadline. Jamaat's constitution contains at least seven clauses that conflict with electoral law, the Election Commission has said. It is not the only political party, however, to still require constitutional amendments. Thirty-nine parties registered with the Election Commission by submitting draft constitutions amended in line with new electoral laws, ahead of the ninth parliamentary elections in December 2008. They were given a year up to January 2010 to submit their fully amended and ratified constitutions to the Election Commission. The EC has since asked a number of parties, who failed to respond following letters for further amendments, to submit their final constitutions by April 30. They include Jamaat, Bangladesh Jatiya Party, Jaker Party and Krishak Sramik Janata League. The commission has sent 'congratulatory' letters to the rest of the parties including the ruling Awami League, main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of Bangladesh, announcing the acceptance of their amended constitutions. "But we issued letters to Jamaat and other parties asking them to further amend certain points. No time limit was mentioned in those letters. But we did ask the 14 parties including Jamaat to inform us about the amendments," Hossain said. "Even though we have provisions to cancel registration, we must give the parties time. If any party wishes to discuss any issue with us then they can. We want the parties to tell us of their progress, we want to help them with their problems," said the commissioner. bdnew
