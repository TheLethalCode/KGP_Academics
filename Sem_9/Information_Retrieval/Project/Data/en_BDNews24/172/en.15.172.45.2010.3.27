 Feni, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)BDR trial proceedings will resume on Sunday in Feni against 62 suspected mutineers, two months after it was adjourned in Jan 25. The special court, formed at 19 Rifles Battalion headquarters under Dagonbhuiyan upazila, is due to sit from 10:30am, battalion commander Lt Col Gazi Salahuddin told reporters at a press conference Saturday. BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam will head the judge's panel. The trial of 62 BDR men in Feni was launched in December last year, when the court took testimony of the 14 witnesses out of 31 before it adjourned. Lt Col Gazi, who is also the prosecutor in the trial, said testimonies of the remaining 17 witnesses will be recorded and they will be cross-examined. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the BDR's Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka killed over 73 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. The rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts across the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The BDR men on trial at Feni have so far been charged with rebellion in sympathy with the Pilkhana mutineers. Witnesses say they took up arms, blockading the Feni-Maijdi Road and also firing their weapons in public. Dagonbhuiyan police filed the case against the 62 suspects, who are currently being detained in Feni jail. bdnew
