 HAVANA, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A replica of the 19th century slave ship Amistad, made famous in a Stephen Spielberg movie, sailed into Havana Bay on Thursday with US and Cuba flags flying side by side in a hopeful display of friendship. The double-masted, black-hulled schooner arrived at a stormy time in US-Cuba relations, but it cruised through smooth waters before tying up at a pier opposite Old Havana, the Cuban capital's historic center.

But on Wednesday, Obama denounced Cuba for the recent death of dissident hunger striker Orlando Zapata Tamayo and its sometimes rough treatment last week of the dissident group Ladies in White during protest marches. He said the events showed that "Cuban authorities continue to respond to the aspirations of the Cuban people with a clenched fist." Cuba has not responded to his remarks. Obama's statement followed the December detention in Havana of a U.S. contractor accused by Cuba of involvement in espionage. The contractor, Alan Gross, remains in jail but has not yet been officially charged with a crime. The United States has said he was in Cuba to help set up Internet services for Jewish groups and it demanded his relea
