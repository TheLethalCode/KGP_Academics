<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Daniel Vettori is keen to put his 100th Test celebrations behind him early on Saturday and switch his focus to beating Australia, reports Cricinfo. Vettori will become the second New Zealander to reach the milestone after Stephen Fleming - he will do it at his home ground in Hamilton - but finishing the home summer on a high is the captain's number one priority. "It's exciting but it's almost got to the stage where I just want to get it out of the way," Vettori said. "It's a big Test for us, the last Test of the summer, and fortunately it's my 100th and it's in front of family and friends.

Ponting first faced Vettori in the 1997-98 Test series in Australia and was impressed at how Vettori had developed into an all-rounder. "He's always been a very good bowler and a very good competitor," Ponting said. "The last couple of years he's really brought his batting on and become a high-class all-rounder at international level. For someone to play 100 Test matches I think is a great feat. "I know when I brought up that milestone it was one of the things I was most proud of in my career, to have the longevity and stay in the game that long.
