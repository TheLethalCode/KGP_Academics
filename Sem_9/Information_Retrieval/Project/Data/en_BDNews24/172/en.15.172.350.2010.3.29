 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)Ministers and members of special investigation and prosecution teams met on Sunday to consider how the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973 will be put into effect for upcoming war crimes trials. "We have never had to use the law before. The meeting discussed its probable implementation process," state minister for law Quamrul Islam told reporters after a two hour meeting that began just before 7.30 pm. The home minister Sahara Khatun, along with the law and home secretaries, also attended the meeting at the Indira Road residence of law minister Shafique Ahmed. The government announced the long-awaited formation of the war crimes tribunal on Mar 25. The three-member tribunal, a seven-member investigating agency and 12-member panel of prosecutors are set to begin functioning formally from Monday. Quamrul said Sunday's meeting discussed how the investigating agency and the prosecution panel members would cooperate. "We'll gather information from those individuals and organisations who have been working on collecting evidence," he said. "Moreover, we all know who the 'collaborators' are," he added. Tribunal chairman Md Nizamul Huq, and tribunal members Fazle Kabir and AKM Zahir Ahmed took office Sunday; among the 12 prosecutors, Mosharraf Hossain Kajal and Sanjida Khanam also attended their offices as did chief investigator Abdul Matin. INVESTIGATORS SEEK POWER TO ARREST Matin on Sunday sought powers to arrest suspected war criminals. He said that the the newly created investigation agency needs to be made effective under the existing war crimes legislation. Currently, the agency does not possess the authority to arrest someone under the 1973 Act, he told reporters after assuming office Sunday. Matin also said spoke a little about the modus operandi of the new agency and how it would proceed in making sure that alleged war criminals are brought to justice. Asked about the first steps, he said, "Initially, we'll collect information, according to existing allegations and from archives at home and abroad, newspapers, video footage, cassettes and so on." The agency will also look into lists of alleged war criminals from different sources, he said. "Lists prepared by the Sector Commanders' Forum and the Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee will also be taken into consideration." "But new rules need to be formulated in line with the Act so that the agency has the power to arrest anyone accused of crimes against humanity during the liberation war," Matin said. bdnews24
