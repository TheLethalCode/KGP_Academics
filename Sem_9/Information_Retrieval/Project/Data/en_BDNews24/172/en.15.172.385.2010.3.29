<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested the two prime suspects in connection with the murder of a couple in the capital's Gulshan area last week, one of whom confessed to the killings in front of reporters on Sunday. Businessman Sadikur Rahman and wife Romana Nargis were shot dead at their Kalachandput home in Gulshan on Mar 24. The suspected killers Rubel and Mithun were arrested in Jhalakathi early Sunday, Walid Hossain, Detective Branch additional police commissioner, told bdnews24.com. An alleged accomplice, Rabbi, was arrested at the same time, Hossain said. On Saturday, police also arrested Delwar Hossain Dipu in the Tongi area of the capital in connection with the double murder. The Detective Branch organised a press conference at their headquarters in the capital at noon, where Rubel confessed to shooting the couple dead. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Shahidul Haque said the murder occurred due to relationship problems with their daughter. Rubel revealed the details to journalists, saying that he had been in a relationship with the daughter Eeti for the last two and half years. He also said he had loaned Tk 110,000 to the parents for sending their son Shihabur Rahman to Malaysia three months ago. Following the loan, Rubel's relations with Eeti and her parents started deteriorating, he said. At one stage, Rubel said he discovered that Eeti had become involved with another boy by chatting over the Internet. Rubel started pressuring Eeti's parents for marriage to their daughter. They declined his proposal and treated him badly, he claimed. He said on the day of the murder, he borrowed a gun and bullets from a relative and talked with Mithun before going to Eeti's house. Rubel again pressured Eeti's parents for marriage. He shot Eeti's father and then her mother after they turned him down again, he said. Rubel then contacted his brother-in-law, Rabbi, and the two fled to Rupganj. From there they went into hiding at Jhalakathi. DMP commissioner Shaidul Haque said that they had not yet discovered which relative lent Rubel the gun and were looking into the matter. bd
