 Thakurgaon, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Thakurgaon district Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Mawlana Abdul Hakim is being kept under watch, after his name was found to be on a list of alleged war criminals, police said on Sunday. But questions are being raised as he was reportedly only 11 years old in 1971. According to various reports, Hakim is on the list of 36 war criminals in Thakurgaon. "He is being kept under watch as his name came up in war criminal lists of various investigation organisations and news media," Thakurgaon police super BM Harun-ur-Rashid said. "Hakim's house has not been surrounded; police have been deployed for his own security. He can go outside if he wants to", the police super said. Meanwhile, Baliadangi upazila chairman and Awami League general secretary Probir Kumar Roy said that he had known Hakim for a long time as they were both from the village of Ziabari. "He was only 11 years old, a student of class six at Kalmegh Madrasa in 1971," the local AL leader said. Hakim also issued a statement to journalists with a copy of his national ID. He said there was no chance of him being a war criminal as he was only 11 then. He said he became involved with Jamaat-e-Islami in 1985. His name was included in the 'war criminals list' to harass him politically, Hakim said in his statement. bd
