<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)  A 23 to 26 percent increase in tax on tobacco products will cut consumption and significantly increase excise revenue, a researcher said on Sunday. "A disproportionately higher tax on tobacco than income growth will reduce tobacco consumption" said Dr. Mahfuz Kabir an economist of Unnayan Shamannay, an NGO. Presenting the findings of a research, Kabir said a 15 percent rise in tobacco product price will effectively reduce consumption. To get the expected result, tax has to be increased by 23 percent on cigarettes and 26 percent on 'bidi', he added. "A 23 percent increase in tax on cigarettes of all brands will cut consumption by 4 to 6 percent." At the same time, the tax increase would raise cigarette price by 15 percent. More importantly, Kabir said, tax hike by that percentage will also result in an increase of revenue earning by at least Tk. 903 crore in 2010-11 financial year. Research has found that the consumers of 'bidi' are among the worst affected by tobacco consumption. Kabir calculated that 26 percent tax increase on 'bidi' will cut consumption by 1680 million sticks, while increasing price by 15 percent and will yield additional Tk. 68 crore as revenue in the next financial year. According to Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), 43.3 percent population of Bangladesh consumed tobacco products in 2009; of them, 23 percent smoked cigarette or bidi. Every year 57,000 people die from tobacco consumption and nearly 382,000 become disabled. At present, the average tax on cigarette and 'bidi' are 64 and 56 percent respectively. Total consumption of tobacco product during 2008-09 was between Tk. 9,000 and Tk. 10,000 crore, according to the research. Bangladesh earned a total of Tk.5,393 crore from tax on tobacco product in the last financial year. Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, chairman of Bangladesh Krishi Bank, said that they are trying to formulate a policy that would bar any agriculture loan for tobacco farming. He, however, hastened to add that the loan could be provided to the export-oriented tobacco farming. Khaled also said that it is unrealistic to expect that everyone will quit smoking. To minimise the pernicious effect of tobacco consumption, he suggested that they can smoke local 'hukka'
