<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation Tuesday decided to appoint Shafiqul Islam Manik coach for the national side. The decision was taken at the national team management committee (NTMC) Tuesday at the BFF House. "Not only the national side, Manik will also be involved with other training programmes conducted by the BFF," said NTMC chairman and BFF vice president Badal Roy. Initially Manik would sign a six-month contract and it would be extended further depending on his performance, added Roy. Bangladesh will participate in Malaysia's Mardeka Cup, one of the oldest football tournaments in Asia held annually in Kuala Lumpur. Manik, a former national player, last time coached Mohammedan Sporting Club, which finished runners-up in 2007 inaugural B. League and emerged champions in 2005 Nitol-Tata National Football League. The defender-turned-coach, considered a proponent of the defensive strategy, also guided Muktijoddha Sangsad that bagged the Premier League title (twice), the National League (once), the Federation Cup (twice), Independent Cup, DAMFA Cup and the 1998 McDowell Cup in Kolkata.
