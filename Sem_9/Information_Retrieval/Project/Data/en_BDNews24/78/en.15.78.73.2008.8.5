 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) -- A special court has again deferred testimony in a bribery case against Tarique Rahman and others, relating to the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin on Tuesday set Aug 14 for proceedings to continue after defence lawyers appealed for time. The Special Judge's Court-3 began trial of the case against senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar and six others on July 14. Babar and Bashundhara Group director Abu Sufian, another accused, were taken to court Tuesday, while Tarique has been exempted from personal appearance on medical grounds. Other accused in the case are Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan (Shah Alam), his two sons Safiat Sobhan and Shahdat Sobhan, Tarique Rahman's associate Miah Nuruddin Apu and businessman Kazi Salumul Haque Kamal. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on May 6 against the eight. They are charged with exchanging Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered in 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdnew
