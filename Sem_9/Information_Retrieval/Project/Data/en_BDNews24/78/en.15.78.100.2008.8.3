<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman was taken from Apollo Hospital to the High Court Sunday, seeking bail in the GATCO graft case. Lawyer for the ailing BNP leader, Abdur Rezzaque Khan, submitted the bail plea to a High Court bench of justices Sharifuddin Chakladar and Md Imadul Haque. Saifur was taken into the courtroom in a wheelchair around 3.40pm to await the bail hearing. Saifur, facing charges in the GATCO scam case, returned home shortly after Saturday midnight from Singapore. Suffering from prostrate gland ailments, the BNP leader was taken straight to hospital in Dhaka on arrival. Airport security officer Awlad Ahmed said the former minister had been wheelchaired out of the airport. Saifur went to Singapore for medical treatment in May, a day before he was formally charged in the GATCO case, which also names former prime minister Khaleda Zia as one of the 24 accused. bdnews
