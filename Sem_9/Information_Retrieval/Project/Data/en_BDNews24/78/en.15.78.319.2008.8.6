 Beijing, Aug 6 (bdbnews24.com/Reuters) - Euphoric crowds chanting "Go Olympics, Go Beijing" cheered the Olympic flame through Tiananmen Square on Wednesday at the end of its troubled global relay. Two days before the Games start, foreign protesters tried to spoil the party for China's government by unfurling "Free Tibet" banners from electricity poles near the main "Bird's Nest" venue. Police rushed to detain the two Britons and two Americans. Most of the 10,500 athletes from 205 countries have now arrived. The first competition -- women's soccer -- was to start on Wednesday night ahead of Friday's Games opening, giving Chinese fans the first chance to show their Olympics fervour. Men's soccer, which has drawn the likes of Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazil's Ronaldinho, starts on Thursday. Then at the weekend, the eagerly awaited swimming competition begins in the new "Water Cube" pool, another shimmering landmark for the Olympics. American Michael Phelps is seeking to smash compatriot Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven golds in one Games. In Tiananmen Square, a Beijing landmark best-known to the world for the crushing of 1989 student protests, one of China's most famous sportsmen, 7ft 6in basketball player Yao Ming, held the flame above a sea of beaming faces. Though not fully fit, NBA player Yao will lead China's team when basketball starts at the weekend, also featuring a U.S. squad pumped to avenge missing gold in Athens four years ago. Children wore "I Love China" T-shirts and workers waved flags and pom-poms, while drums and cymbals resounded around Tiananmen under a portrait of late revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. China's first man in space, Yang Liwei, started the Beijing torch relay. Beijing hopes such images of the torch's final passage through the host city will help banish memories of Tibet protests dogging the flame in Paris, London and elsewhere. So police were quick to react to Wednesday's protest, taking 12 minutes to remove the protesters, according to state media. "MAO WOULD BE HAPPY" The Games have given China an unprecedented chance to showcase its modern face but have also galvanised critics of its human rights record. China's half-century rule in the Himalayan region of Tibet is the most contentious issue. Demonstrations around the torch's international legs offended many Chinese, who see the Games as a moment of national pride for a nation some view as the emerging 21st century superpower. "It's not just about the sport, it's about the image of China," said Xi Li, among the officially-organised torch crowd. "Chairman Mao would have been happy if he were here today!" Sadly for organisers, the start of the flame's passage through Beijing took place under smog-filled skies. Some $18 billion of cleanup measures have reduced contamination to safe levels, according to Olympics chiefs, but not produced the sunshine and blue skies China longs for. Some anxious U.S. sportsmen arrived with face-masks on, though that drew disapproval from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which said it was unnecessary. Other Olympians were in a more mellow mood. Italian weightlifter Giorgio de Luca wound down in flip-flops after a tough gym session with a surreptitious cigarette. "I'd say 70 out of 100 athletes in the Olympic village smoke," he said, perhaps exaggerating a little. And while most teams tuck themselves away, Jamaica's athletes took over a jazz club to celebrate their Independence Day. Some strutted their stuff on stage and 100 metres runner Usain Bolt, an amateur DJ, span some reggae. To protect athletes and guard against terrorism or protests, a 100,000-strong force is on hand in Beijing. Authorities intensified security this week after suspected Muslim separatists attacked a group of jogging policemen with homemade explosives, killing 16, in the far west. Several million visitors are pouring into China to watch the Games. Big names abound, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, for example, bringing their long-running tennis rivalry to China. Runners Bolt, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay are favourites to fight it out in the 100 metres men's race -- the highest-profile event for the title of Fastest Man on Earth. On another international pressure-point for China, Team Darfur, a coalition of athletes seeking to draw attention to the conflict in Sudan, said Beijing had revoked the visa of its co-founder and Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek. He called his visa denial "part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur". Doping scandals dominated the start of Athens 2004, and national teams have pulled about 20 athletes in the run-up to Beijing. The IOC plans some 5,000 tests here to catch cheats. In the latest case, India said on Wednesday it withdrew woman weightlifter Monica Devi after she failed a dope test at home.
