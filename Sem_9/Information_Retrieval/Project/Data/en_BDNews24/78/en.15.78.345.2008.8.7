 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) - Sigma Huda, wife of former BNP communications minister Nazmul Huda, was released on bail Wednesday in a corruption case after the Supreme Court granted her two months' bail on Tuesday. Jailor Faruk Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "We released her at 10 pm after getting the bail papers." On July 5 last year, Sigma appeared before a court and was sent into jail. A five-strong Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin Tuesday set her free on bail in the case regarding purchase of vehicle for newspaper "Khaborer Antorale". The High Court on June 5 granted her three months' bail in a case and the Supreme Court upheld the ruling on June 19. But, before she came out on bail, the Anticorruption Commission on June 18 filed a case against her with Motijheel Police Station on charges of taking bribe. The High Court on July 16 rejected Sigma's bail prayer, prompting her to appeal the High Court order in the Supreme Court. During the hearing of the appeal the court on Aug 4 summoned Sigma's medical report and on examining it, the court granted her bail on physical grounds. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq appeared for Sigma while advocate Khurshid Alam Khan participated in the hearing for the ACC. Sigma's daughter Antora Huda told journalists, "When mother was about to come out of jail on bail in the earlier case this case was field. There is no other case against her. If no other case is filed there is no bar on her way to release from jail." A Special Judge's Court on Aug 27 last year sentenced Nazmul Huda to seven years in jail and Sigma Sigma Huda to three years. The ACC on March 22 last year filed the case with Dhanmondi Police Station against Nazmul and Sigma on charges of taking Tk 2.40 crore bribes in the name of the newspaper "Khaborer Antorale". bdne
