 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League-backed nominees unofficially swept all four major city corporations and eight of the nine municipalities that went to the polls on Monday in a startling show of grassroots strength that left rival BNP in a daze. The AL charge was led by none other than the embattled Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran, the former Sylhet City mayor now in prison on corruption charges, who rode on a wave of sympathy votes to earn a second stint. He won 115,436 votes in the 120 polling centres with a huge lead over his nearest rival BNP candidate AFM Kamal who finished a distant second with 32,097 votes, according to the latest figure released by the local Election Commission office early Tuesday. Awami League leader Talukder Abdul Khaleque clinched the mayoral race for Khulna City Corporation. In the 239 centres, Khaleque scored 157,812 votes, winning a victory over BNP-backed Moniruzzaman Moni by a margin of 25,836 votes. Khulna divisional deputy election commissioner Mohammad Mohsin Ali declared Khaleque the winner of the mayoral race. Khairuzzaman Liton, backed by the AL-focused 14-party alliance, finished the mayoral race in the polls to 129 centres of Rajshahi City Corporation. He came out victorious with 88,360 votes, edging out his nearest contender Mosaddek Hossain Bulbul, a Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal leader, at 74,550 votes. A nervy Shawkat Hossain Hiron, who cried foul play by intelligence agents at a hurriedly-called press conference early Tuesday after he saw his lead suddenly erode, won the Barisal City Corporation elections. The Awami League leader polled 46,796 votes, 588 more than his nearest contender S Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu of Progressive Democratic Party who bagged 46,208 ballots. Hiron had rushed the news briefing to blame the government for what he feared to be an imminent defeat. "My victory has been snatched," he said. Hiron accused intelligence agents of tampering with the balloting in up to eight centres where he failed to win. MUNICIPAL WINNERS Amid the AL rampage, Jahangir Alam pulled one back for BNP when he clinched the first municipal mayoral win as counting finished in Dupchanchia, Bogra.
