 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)  Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, facing charges in the GATCO scam case, returned home after months away in Singapore for medical treatment, his aide said early Sunday. Saifur arrived at Zia International Airport shortly after Saturday midnight by a Malaysian Airlines flight, his personal assistant Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com. Suffering from prostrate gland ailments, the BNP leader was taken to hospital in Dhaka on arrival. Airport security officer Awlad Ahmed said the former minister had been wheelchaired out of the airport. Saifur went to Singapore for medical treatment in May, a day before he was formally charged in the GATCO case, which also names former prime minister Khaleda Zia as one of the 24 accused persons. All the accused except for Khaleda and Saifur won bail from the High Court. Saifur's role in a divided BNP kicked up a controversy, with him leading the charge of the so-called reformists against those loyal to Khaleda. bdne
