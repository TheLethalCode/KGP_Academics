 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)--The labour unrest in Kuwait has come to a halt, said the foreign ministry Monday. "The Bangladeshi workers have returned to their workplaces as the situation has become normal," said a foreign ministry press statement. The statement also said the Bangladesh embassy in Kuwait was trying to realise the dues of the deported workers. Bangladesh embassy officials had a meeting Sunday with officials of Kuwait's social welfare, labour and finance ministry regarding settlement of the workers' unpaid wages and other benefits. The meeting decided that the government would collect necessary information about the deported workers from the concerned companies and take necessary measures to realise the compensation, the statement said. The foreign ministry suggested that the deported workers submit photocopies of passports, civil identity cards, workstations, the date of joining, date of return and other relevant data to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET). BMET would send the data to the Bangladesh mission for necessary action to realise compensation and outstanding wages, the statement said. Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait staged demonstrations in July, demanding pay hikes and better working conditions. The Kuwait authorities quelled the demonstrations, made arrests and deported workers for violation of laws. According to the immigration wing of the Zia International Airport, at least 363 Bangladeshis were deported since the demonstrations ended last week. Around 86,000 Bangladeshi workers had returned to their workplaces in Kuwait until Sunday. There are around 150,000 Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait. bd
