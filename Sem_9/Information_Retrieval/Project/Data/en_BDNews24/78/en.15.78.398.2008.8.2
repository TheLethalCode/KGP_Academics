 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)--Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Saturday that Bangladesh was committed to eliminating all forms of terrorism. In his address to the 15th SAARC summit in Colombo, Fakhruddin condemned all terrorist attacks and said his government had taken initiatives to make new laws and modify the existing laws to curb terrorism. The chief adviser urged SAARC leaders to help enhance cooperation among the militaries of the eight members of the regional grouping. Fakhruddin also stressed inclusion of the services sector in the South Asian Free Trade Agreement, provided that it should be a "win-win" situation. The chief adviser also underlined the need for guaranteeing food security to cut poverty in the South Asian region, home to half of the world's poorest people. "I would like to reiterate that Bangladesh stands firm in her resolve to deal with these issues forcefully and effectively." "Let me announce unequivocally that Bangladesh is committed against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," Fakhruddin told the summit in the Sri Lankan capital. The chief adviser said terrorists perpetrated brutal acts in every part of the world. "We condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of valuable lives and properties," he said. The chief adviser spelled out Bangladesh's strong commitment to curbing terrorism as India pointed an accusing finger at Bangladesh for "support" to the terrorists, an allegation denied by Dhaka. "Bangladesh, as a signatory to international conventions against terrorism, both globally and regionally, is in the process of enacting and modifying relevant domestic laws for their effective implementation at the national level," said Fakhruddin. The finalised SAARC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters will be an "important tool at our disposal for effective and meaningful cooperation in our fight against all serious and organised crimes", he said. On cooperation among the militaries of the SAARC region, Dr Fakhruddin said there should be a methodology for structured contacts between armed forces of the SAARC countries. "Already at bilateral levels such links exist. Together we provide a huge majority of the world's peacekeepers." "I believe it may be worthwhile to devise such a system that can periodically bring the senior officers of our military forces together to determine how best we can advance our mutual interests". "We may also share training facilities under this scheme." The chief adviser said the global price hike of food had created a situation similar to a food crisis which warranted ensuring collective food security. "This requires our immediate attention to ensure constant and steady supply of food for our people." "We need to develop strategies, not only to address short-term supply-side shocks but also to strengthen cooperation to increase agricultural productivity," said Fakhruddin. The chief adviser said the SAARC countries must work together to ensure energy security. "In the wake of sky-rocketing prices of fossil fuel, we must harness renewable sources of energy such as hydro-power, solar, bio-fuel and wind to address the energy crisis in the region." "We should strive to develop conventional as well as alternate sources of energy to ensure its steady supply at affordable cost," said Fakhruddin. Fakhruddin, a former central bank governor, referred to para-tariff and non-tariff barriers as obstacles to the functioning of the SAFTA. He said the services sector emerged as most dynamic with an average annual growth rate of over 8 percent. "I am happy to note that negotiation is about to commence on a Framework Agreement on Trade in Services. This should pave the way for the trade liberalisation," said Fakhruddin. "That will be a win-win situation for all of us." bdn
