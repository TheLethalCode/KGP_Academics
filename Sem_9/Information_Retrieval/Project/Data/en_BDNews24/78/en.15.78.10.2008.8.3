 CHANDIGARH, India, Aug 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 145 people, mostly women and children, were crushed to death under the feet of thousands of pilgrims in a stampede at a temple in northern India on Sunday, police said. "We have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed," Daljit Singh Manhas, a senior police officer told Reuters by telephone. Iron railings leading to a Hindu temple in the state of Himachal Pradesh broke, causing the stampede, senior police officers said. Thousands of worshippers gather at the temple in Bilaspur district every year to pray to a Hindu goddess during an annual festival.
