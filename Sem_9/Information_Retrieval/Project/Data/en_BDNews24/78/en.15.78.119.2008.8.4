 Sylhet, August 4 (bdnews24.com)The first prospective voters in the Sylhet City Corporation polls Monday morning were unable to cast their votes on production of their National ID cards, they said, as confusion arose when they were asked to show a voter serial or slip. Hanufa Khatun, returning from Chhararpar Pilot High School polling centre told bdnews24.com: "I showed my ID card, but they asked for my voter serial, which I was never provided with." "So I had to just come back without voting." Many others said the same about being unable to cast votes. Mayoral candidate AFM Kamal told bdnews24.com: "We provided some voters with serial numbers." But ward councillor Jamal Ahmed said: "We were never told about providing voters with serial numbers. The responsibility lies with the Election Commission." SCC deputy election commissioner and returning officer Khandakar Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Those who'll come to the centres with their ID cards will be allowed to cast their votes. The same goes with the serial number holders too." "But it takes less time to cast one's vote if one has the voter's slip." Asked whose responsibility it is to provide the voters with their serial numbers, Rahman said: "It's the responsibility of the candidates." "We supplied the candidates with the lists of voters on compact discs and they were been asked to do the rest." Councillor candidate Kumar Ganesh Paul, running for a seat in Ward 16, told bdnews24.com: "Yes, we've been provided with the voter lists, but nobody told us anything about supplying the voters with any serial number or slip." Meanwhile, the Chief Election Commissioner and election officials in different polling areas pointed out on Monday that National ID Cards are not required for casting votes, but voter slips were needed for speedy voting. bdnews24.
