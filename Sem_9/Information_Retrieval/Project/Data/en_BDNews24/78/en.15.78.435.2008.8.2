<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Aug 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has offered to investigate last month's bomb attack on India's embassy in Kabul that killed two Indian diplomats among 58 people, India's top Foreign Ministry official said on Saturday. The Kabul attack, a ceasefire breach, and media speculation about Pakistani links to a series of bombings on Indian cities last month has jeopardised a four-year-old peace initiative between the two nuclear-armed rivals. "Prime Minister (Yousaf Raza) Gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation," India's Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told reporters. Gilani and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met on the sidelines of a South Asian summit on Saturday.
