<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former France defender Lilian Thuram, a member of his country's 1998 World Cup-winning team, announced his retirement from football on Friday. The 36-year-old had expected to join French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint Germain on a one-year deal before a heart problem was spotted during a medical examination last June. "The doctors thought I had a heart problem, it is not the case. I do not have the illness." "However, it is difficult for me to continue. I would have liked to sign with PSG (but) I prefer not to take risks," he told a news conference. Having been reassured about his medical condition, Thuram decided to end his career for family reasons. "I talked to my mother, who advised me not to continue. My family wants me to stop. I did not want them to worry." Last month, Thuram explained one of his brothers, Antonio, died of a heart attack playing basketball in the 1990s and that other members of his family suffered from heart problems. "I was not expecting to end my career like this. I would have liked to have been the Paolo Maldini of Paris Saint Germain but sadly it will not be possible," added Thuram. He was referring to the 40-year-old AC Milan captain who said in June he would delay his retirement for one more season. Thuram had already announced his international retirement after the country's group-stage exit from Euro 2008. The acclaimed defender won a record 142 caps for his country. One of the most popular French players, Thuram helped the national side win the 2000 European Championship and reach the 2006 World Cup final. He started his club career in 1990 with Monaco and went on to play for Italian side Parma, with whom he won the UEFA Cup in 1999. He then joined Juventus where he won two Italian league titles before signing for Barcelona in 2006
