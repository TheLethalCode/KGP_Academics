 BEIJING, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reigning Olympic champions Australia are disappointed not to be able to test their mettle against eight-times hockey gold medallists India in Beijing. Hockey celebrates its Olympic centenary at the Games but, for the first time, India will not be at the event that starts on Sunday after they lost to Britain in the final of a qualifying tournament in Chile in March. India's absence is already being felt by Australia's captain Bevan George. "It's disappointing that they are not going to be there," the defender said. "I was looking forward to playing them. But I am sure they will be back at the next Games." Australia, who won their first hockey gold four years ago, start favourites after a remarkable year in which they won a record-equalling ninth Champions Trophy in June to leapfrog Germany to the top of the rankings. The Kookaburras followed that up with a 2-0 victory in a three-match series against South Korea at home last month to lend the finishing touches to their preparations. "We are feeling good  the lead-up has been really good," George told Reuters on Tuesday. Field hockey was first played at the London Olympics in 1908 but became a regular medal sport 20 years later at the Amsterdam Games. India, who sent their first team in 1928, won six consecutive titles until 1956 on grass, mesmerising rivals with their magical stickwork and colourful turbans worn by some of the players. They won two more gold medals in 1964 and 1980, apart from a silver and two bronze medals, before falling on hard times. "It's very sad that they (hockey team) are not here," Randhir Singh, secretary-general of India's Olympic association, told Reuters. India's decline coincided with the game's switch to artificial turf with the emphasis shifting to power, speed and accuracy rather than deft stickwork. India finished seventh in the previous two Olympics and 11th at the last World Cup, the downturn blamed on the country's hockey federation, suspended on corruption charges. "They have some terrific young players and I am sure they will work their way back," George said
