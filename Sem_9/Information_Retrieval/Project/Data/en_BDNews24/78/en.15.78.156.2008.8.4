<TITLE> Prayers for Italian climber as K2 claims 11 lives </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD Mon Aug 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Days after 11 climbers were killed on K2, a frost-bitten Italian man was seen stumbling down the world's second highest mountain on Monday in the hope of being airlifted to safety. Three Pakistani high altitude porters and an American climber had set off up the mountain to try to bring Marco Confortola down to a height where he could be reached by a rescue helicopter. "People at the base camp are continuously monitoring his movement and praying for his return," said retired Brigadier Mohammad Akram, vice president of Pakistan's Adventure Foundation. A Pakistani army helicopter had earlier plucked two Dutch climbers off the slopes of the remote 8,611 meter (28,240 foot) peak, deep in the Karakoram range, bordering China. They were airlifted at a height of 5,500 meters. Confortola could be seen making painful progress coming down from 7,000 meters, a height deemed too risky for helicopters. "His movement is very slow because of frostbite and he would soon reach soon Camp 1, which is little over 6,000 meters," Akram said, adding Confortola's hands and feet were badly affected. Pakistani authorities confirmed that 11 climbers were dead but rescuers were unsure whether anyone else was missing. Among the dead were three Koreans; two Nepalis; two Pakistani high altitude porters; French, Serbian, and Norwegian climbers; and an Irishman earlier listed as missing. Several died when an ice wall collapsed and tore away the fixed lines they were relying on to return after reaching the summit of K2 on Friday. Others succumbed in the freezing, oxygen-starved air, stranded at an altitude known as the "Death Zone". "On K2, when they're missing they're dead," said Sher Khan, a retired colonel and vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, and one of Pakistan's most experienced climbers. Several teams had massed on the mountain for an assault on the summit. At least two climbers died during the ascent, then disaster struck during the descent at a steep gully known as the Bottleneck, above 8,200 meters. The ice fall killed three Korean and two Nepali climbers, and left around a dozen more, exhausted from the ascent, stranded in the thin air above the Bottleneck. "Anybody hit by an avalanche above the Bottleneck will be swept way down the South Face, and there's no way they'll ever find them," said Khan. Anxious fellow climbers kept vigil at K2 base camp scanning the steep flanks of the towering pyramid of rock and ice. One Swedish survivor, Fredrik Strang, described to U.S. broadcaster CNN how people "froze to death" during the night. He also spoke of a sense of foreboding after a Serbian climber and a Pakistani plunged to their deaths on the ascent. Questions will inevitably arise over whether the climbers' judgment was fatally clouded by desire to reach the summit, a condition known in mountaineering circles as "summit fever". Some teams reached the top in darkness after 8.00 p.m. on Friday, according to Nazir Sabir, president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan. Critics spoke of summit fever in the wake of the previous deadliest day in K2's history, August 13, 1995, when six people fell or disappeared during a storm, including British female climber Alison Hargreaves. MORE CLIMBERS, MORE DANGER Risks multiplied when small teams made simultaneous summit bids, Sher Khan said in comments that echoed his former climbing partner, the legendary Italian alpinist Reinhold Messner, who says commercial mountaineering had led to more fatalities. "They are strong people, but they do not now how to react ... They don't know how to behave in the case of emergencies -- in the case of missing ropes, in the case of bad weather," Messner said in a telephone interview with Reuters in Rome. K2 is considered technically more difficult to climb than Mount Everest, and while more fatalities have occurred on the latter, statistics show the risks of dying are far greater during the descent of K2 than for other mountains. More than 70 climbers have died on K2. In mountaineering records the ones who lost their lives after conquering the mountain have an asterisk by their name
