 ISLAMABAD, Aug 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Partners in Pakistan's ruling coalition led by the party of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto agreed on the major issues on Tuesday that have bedevilled their four-month-old alliance, a party official said. Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and head of the coalition met former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for nearly six hours, and the two leaders would meet again on Wednesday to build on the consensus reached in talks, the official said. They formed a coalition government in March after defeating allies of President Pervez Musharraf in a February elections, but the alliance had been under strain by differences over how to handle Musharraf and restore judges he sacked in November while the country was under six weeks of emergency rule. "A consensus has been developed on major issues between the two main coalition partners," Zardari's spokesman, Farhatullah Babar told journalists after the meeting but refused to give details. "There has been a very positive progress in the meeting." Sharif, who heads the second major party in the coalition, withdrew his party's ministers from the cabinet in May, after Zardari failed to honour a commitment to restore judges as agreed in a declaration they signed after the elections. But, after Tuesday's meeting, a Sharif party leader said the next agreement would spell clear terms for the coalition. "This time the modus operandi would be decided and there will be an agreement which will be without any ambiguity ... there are more chances of make and less chances of break tomorrow," said Khawaja Muhammad Asif. The outcome could determine the fate of Musharraf, who came to power as a general after overthrowing Sharif in a 1999 coup, and the chances of the new civilian government surviving a tortuous beginning. Sharif wants wheels set in motion to impeach U.S. ally Musharraf but Zardari has so far warded off a confrontation with a president who neither the army nor the United States wants humiliated. The political uncertainty has compounded problems for the government which is facing Islamist militancy across Pakistan's northwest, an economy at risk of meltdown, acute power shortages and higher fuel and food prices that have hit the poor. While US ally Musharraf remains overwhelmingly unpopular after the defeat of his allies, many people are rapidly losing faith in the new civilian leaders to pull the country round
