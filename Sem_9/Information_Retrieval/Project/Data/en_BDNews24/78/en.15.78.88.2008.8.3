<TEXT>
 Patna, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 32 labourers were killed in Bihar, when the goods-laden truck they were travelling on veered off a bridge and plunged into a river, police said on Sunday. The dead were farm labourers returning to their villages from work, Vinay Kumar, a senior police officer said. "Divers have fished out 32 bodies so far, but we presume a few more bodies might be out there," Kumar said by telephone after a night-long rescue operation. Many villagers died after being crushed under heavy sacks of grain, while the rest drowned, Kumar added.
