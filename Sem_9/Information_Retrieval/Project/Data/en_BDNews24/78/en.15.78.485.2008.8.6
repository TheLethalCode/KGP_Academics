<TITLE> Iran is `root of all evil': Israel PM contender </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Wed Aug 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli cabinet minister Shaul Mofaz, a contender to succeed the prime minister, denounced his native Iran on Wednesday as "the root of all evil" and said its nuclear program constituted a threat to world peace. Mofaz was speaking a day after he launched a campaign for a party leadership election next month that will lead to the replacement of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Opinion polls show that Mofaz, a deputy prime minister and transport minister, is a frontrunner in the contest to lead the centrist Kadima party but trails Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. Olmert, dogged by a corruption probe, said last week he would step down once a successor for the party leadership was chosen. "The Iranians are the root of all evil," Mofaz said in a live interview on Israel Radio, adding that Tehran's nuclear program would pose "a threat to Israel's existence". He urged the West anew to impose stiffer sanctions on Tehran to pressure Iran to stop a nuclear program that Israel believes is intended to produce atomic weapons. Iran says the developments are for civilian purposes only, to produce energy. Israel is widely believed to have assembled the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal which experts say comprises as many as 200 warheads. Israel does not discuss its nuclear capabilities under a "strategic ambiguity" policy designed to ward off enemies while avoiding the sort of provocation that can trigger arms races. Mofaz, who was born in Tehran before many Iranian Jews moved to the new state of Israel, accused his native country of trying "simply to bide its time," by rejecting Western proposals to stop enriching uranium. "This has been the Iranian strategy for years, to bide their time and continue with their enrichment," Mofaz said. Mofaz, a former head of the Israeli military, has been one of Israel's most outspoken ministers against Iran. While he supports diplomacy to resolve the standoff with Tehran, Mofaz said in June an Israeli attack to halt the project may be "unavoidable" unless a deal was reached. Israel's security cabinet met behind closed doors on Wednesday to discuss its intelligence assessments that Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon have been rearming with rockets since a 2006 war. Some 1,200 Lebanese and 159 Israelis died in that month-long war. Israel launched an air campaign and then invasion after Hezbollah staged a lethal cross-border raid against a military patrol. Security officials said ministers discussed reports the guerrillas were seeking to obtain anti-aircraft missiles to fire at Israeli warplanes that fly over Lebanese territory on reconnaissance missions
