<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)- Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah has echoed Mannan Bhuiyan's sentiment that only the BNP chairperson can unite the troubled party, but added that Bhuiyan himself was responsible for the divide. "Only the leader can remove the division created in the party. We want quick release of our chairperson Khaleda Zia," BNP Hannan Shah said Saturday at the grave of BNP founder and late president Ziaur Rahman. Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said Friday if Khaleda Zia was released there would be no more division within the party and BNP would go to election unitedly. On the proposals for party reform that arose last year, the just-released BNP leader said the party council would take a final decision on the matter after the release of the BNP chairperson. Asked for his reaction to Bhuiyan's comments, Hannan Shah said: "Disunity was created in the party because of Mr Mannan Bhuiyan. Now he has realised his mistake. So the leader can remove any division among us. " BNP became divided after the promulgation of the state of emergency as a group emerged led by Bhuiyan, which came to be known as the 'reformist' faction. Bhuiyan on June 25 last year forwarded a 15-point reform proposal that included curbing the powers of the chairperson. When Khaleda Zia was arrested in September last year, she expelled Bhuiyan as BNP secretary general. At a meeting of the party's standing committee in October, meanwhile, M Saifur Rahman was named acting chairman of the party and retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed acting secretary general. But the so-called 'pro-Khaleda' faction carried on their activities led by the Khaleda-nominated secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain. Delwar, standing committee member M Shamsul Islam and Jubo Dal general secretary Moazzem Hussein Alalboth recently released on bailwere among those present Saturday morning, alongside hundreds of party leaders and supporters offering prayers at the grave of Ziaur Rahman and calling for Khaleda's release. When asked whether he had any conflict with Delwar, Hannan said: "I have no conflict with party secretary general Khandker Delwar." bdnew
