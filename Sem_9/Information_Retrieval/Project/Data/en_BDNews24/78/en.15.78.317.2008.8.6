<TEXT>
 Dhaka University, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Chhatra League on Tuesday temporarily withdrew a call for a strike on Dhaka University campus, after university authorities assured them their demand to free a student leader would be addressed. The activists of AL's student wing had earlier confined DU vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz for three hours inside his office, and called the campus strike for Wednesday to demand release of a BCL central leader from jail. About 100 to 150 leaders and supporters surrounded the VC's office in the administrative building at around 4pm, demanding release of BCL central committee general secretary and Dhaka University student Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton from Mymensingh jail. BCL's DU president, Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com that the strike was called off "for the time being", after the VC requested time until Wednesday noon to resolve the issue. "The VC told us he and other teachers had met with education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Prof Faiz said the adviser had assured them of a positive outcome over Roton's release by noon tomorrow," Tipu said. Social sciences dean Harunur Rashid, who attended the meeting with Hossain Zillur along with the VC, also told bdnews24.com that the adviser had assured a "positive result" in the matter. Immediately after his release at around 7pm Tuesday, VC Faiz told reporters: "I have been making contacts in the appropriate places for the release of Roton." "The atmosphere at the university has so far been proper. We want every conscious student and all involved with the university to remain alert in maintaining a conducive atmosphere for academic activities. I hope for positive results." BCL central president Mahmud Hasan Ripon told bdnews24.com at the time that Faiz had been released as he and four DU teachers would meet the education adviser around 10pm Tuesday. "We will continue our vigil in front of the university's administrative building peacefully until the return of the teachers' delegation," said Ripon. However, the VC said nothing about the meeting with the education adviser. BCL activist Shamsul Kabir Rahat told bdnews24.com earlier in the day that Roton had nbeen freed from Mymensingh jail at about 10.30am Tuesday, and was kept sitting in the visiting room of the jail. Police later rearrested him from the visiting room at around 2.30 pm, Rahat said. The news prompted the BCL leaders and supporters to march on to the VC's office, under the banner of "Human Rights Conscious Students", saying they would continue their protest until action was taken about Roton. BCL's DU president, Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu said: "Chhatra League supports the strike called for Wednesday by the Human Rights Conscious Students." The activists had earlier damaged teachers' vehicles parked outside of the administrative building, and locked the main gates with the vice chancellor and other university officials held inside. Police took up posts on campus after BCL surrounded the building, but later withdrew from the campus. They then took up places outside the campus grounds across the road from the Teacher-Student Centre and Nilkhet gate. Joint forces arrested Roton on Jan 18, 2007, on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. Chhatra League observed a 24-hour token hunger strike demanding his release on Sunday. bdnews24.
