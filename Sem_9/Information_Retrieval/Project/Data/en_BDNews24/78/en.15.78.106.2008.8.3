<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) - A writ petition has been filed with the High Court challenging the legality of the Anticorruption Commission (Amendment) Ordinance. Supreme Court lawyer Ahsanul Karim filed the public interest writ petition with the High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed Sunday. Writ petitioner Ahsanul Karim told bdnews24.com that the hearing on the writ petition would be held on Monday, with barrister Rafique-ul-Huq represenitng the petitioner. The president promulgated the Anticorruption Commission (Amendment) Ordinance on April 18 last year amending the Anticorruption Commission Act. The petition highlights a recent High Court ruling which stated that the president cannot promulgate any ordinance other than election related or emergency requirements during the tenure of the caretaker government. The new ACC ordinance falls in neither category. The promulgation of the ordinance is therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the president and unconstitutional, the petition argues. The writ petition further stated that if the chief adviser or the government advised the president to promulgate of the ordinance that advice, or the president's acting on such advice, is also illegal and unconstitutional. The new ACC ordinance includes a provision to allow any official with the approval of the antigraft body to arrest a person before filing a case. It also states that crimes under the Anticorruption Act will be non-bailable, The petition, claiming the two provisions curtail human rights and that such provisions are unconstitutional, demands cancellation of the new ordinance. bdnew
