<TITLE> Odhikar calls for probes into 'extrajudicial killings' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com) - Human rights organisation Odhikar, claiming that 'extrajudicial killings' at the hands of law enforcement agencies were on the rise, has demanded that the government form an independent probe body into such incidents. An Odhikar report, published Friday, said extrajudicial killings had taken a serious turn in July. "From July 1 to July 31, a total of 16 persons became victims of extrajudicial killings. Of them seven were killed by RAB and nine in 'crossfire', 'encounter' or 'shootout' with police." Mentioning the recent killing of a Purba Bangla Communist Party faction leader Dr Mizanur Rahman Tutul, in a so-called 'shootout' in Naogaon, Odhikar said: "After Tutul was arrested, his mother appealed for her son's trial by law." "But within a few hours of the appeal, Tutul was killed at the hands of law enforcing agencies. This killing has threatened the lives of persons believing in specific political ideals." Odhikar feared that if the extrajudicial killings were not challenged, despite national and international concerns, more people would become victim to such incidents in the coming months. Odhikar therefore called for a stop to 'extrajudicial killings' in the name of 'crossfire' or 'shootouts' as well as trial of the law enforcers involved in such incidents. It demanded the creation of an independent probe body to investigate such incidents, with the power to take action and punitive measures. Mentioning the eight Bangladeshis, including two Bangladesh rifles personnel, reportedly killed by India's Border Security Force in July, Odhikar urged BSF to abide by international laws. In its report, the human rights body also said that, 27 women and children had been raped, and nine of them killed after being raped, during the month of July. Twelve women were victim to acid attacks during the period, and 13 women died due to 'dowry torture' in the same month. Odhikar said that the report was prepared based on its own observations and different sources including media reports. bdne
