 COLOMBO, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have retained the same 15-man squad but are expected to make one change to their bowling line-up for the third test against India starting on Friday. India levelled the series 1-1 with a 170-run victory in Galle and Sri Lanka hope that some additional pace will help them at the more seamer-friendly P. Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo. Fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekera is likely to be replaced in the final XI by either left-armer Thilan Thushara or the uncapped Dammika Prasad. "There was no need to push the panic button over just one defeat," a selection committee source said. "The need for a bowler of extra pace to support Chaminda Vaas was discussed and we decided that Thushara or Prasad should be considered." The final decision will be made after practice on Thursday. Sri Lanka are missing three fast bowlers -- Dilhara Fernando, Lasith Malinga and Farveez Maharoof -- due to injuries, limiting their pace bowling options. Out-of-form opener Michael Vandort, who has scored 17 runs in three innings, is expected to play after being backed by captain Mahela Jayawardene. "Michael has been one of the consistent bats in the last six months," Jayawardene told the media after Sri Lanka's defeat in Galle. KIRSTEN'S DEPARTURE India's preparations for the deciding test have been hampered by the departure of coach Gary Kirsten, who left the tour to be with his critically ill mother. Paddy Upton, the mental conditioning coach, has taken over as head coach and will work alongside bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh. Upton was confident that Kirsten's sudden departure would not have a negative impact on preparations. "Each person knows their role," he told reporters. "It's a case of just doing what we've always been doing and doing that well." India's only selection dilemma is whether to replace Dinesh Karthik with Parthiv Patel as wicket-keeper. Karthik has grassed several important chances during the first two tests and has scored just 36 runs in four innings. Squads: Sri Lanka - Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Malinda Warnapura, Thilan Samaweera, Michael Vandort, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Chamara Kapugedera, Thilan Thushara, Chaminda Vaas, Prasanna Jayawardene (wk), Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekera, Dammika Prasad India - Anil Kumble (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Rohit Sharma, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Parthiv Patel (wk), Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan, RP Singh, Munaf Patel, Pragyan Ojha
