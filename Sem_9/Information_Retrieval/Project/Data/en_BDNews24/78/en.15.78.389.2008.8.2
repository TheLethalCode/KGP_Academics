<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com) - A swashbuckling century from Roqibul Hasan helped the Bangladesh A team thrash the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) by 80 runs at Durham University ground, England Friday. The MCC were bundled out for 195 in 40.4 overs, chasing a challenging total of 275 for six laid by the visitors, as pacer Dollar Mahmud claimed five scalps for 47. After losing opener Akbar Ansari on nought, opener Kunal Jogia and one-down Stuart Law threatened the visitors putting on 98 runs for the second wicket. Law was more destructive with 65 off 52 balls before being caught by Shakib Al Hasan off spinner Mosharraf Hossain, who finally returned three for 36. Jogia was the fifth batsman out for 51, triggering a collapse, and the hosts eventually were restricted below the 200-mark losing the remaining five wickets for just 28 runs. Earlier, Bangladesh being sent in to bat first fell into trouble losing opener Nazimuddin (1) with scoreboard reading only one for two. After removing Nazimuddin, pacer Jonathan Miles also dismissed Tamim Iqbal (11 off 13 balls) and first-change bowler Will Gidman bowled Rajin Salah (5 off 23 balls) to reduce the visitors to 27 for three. Then, Roqibul and Shakib Al Hasan turned things around with defying the MCC attack, and they together put on 71 runs for the fourth wicket before the latter was bowled by Faisal Shahid for a 54-ball 41 that studded with five boundaries. Roqibul along with Naeem Islam (25) added another 51 runs for the fifth wicket and racked up 113 runs for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh. Dhiman quickfired 55 off 40 balls smashing two fours and two sixes before being Gidman's second victim. Roqibul finally remained unbeaten on 112 facing 124 balls that featured eight fours and one six.
