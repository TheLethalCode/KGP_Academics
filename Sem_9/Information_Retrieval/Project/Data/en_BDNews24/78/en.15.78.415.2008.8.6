 Dhaka, Aug 06 (bdnews24.com) Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Wednesday requested the Kuwaiti government to carry out an investigation into the recent labour unrest reportedly led by Bangladeshi workers. He also mentioned Bangladesh's contribution to protecting the Sheikhdom's sovereignty and freedom. The adviser made the request in a letter to the Kuwaiti interior minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Khalid Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. Including Wednesday's, Iftekhar has written three letters to three Kuwaiti ministers since the labour unrest began three weeks ago. The foreign adviser previously wrote letters to deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Kuwait Sheikh Mohammed Sabah Al Salem Al Sabah and the Kuwaiti labour minister Bader Fahad Al Duwalia. "I have written another letter to the Kuwaiti interior minister to carry out an inquiry into the incidents," Iftekhar told reporters at the foreign ministry Wednesday. "For the faults of a few, many are being mercilessly deported empty-handed." "While we affirm our principled position that all should abide by the law, it is our earnest hope that the otherwise peace-loving workers will not suffer," said Iftekhar. The adviser hoped that all Kuwaiti employers would abide by the government decision of paying a minimum wage of 40 Kuwaiti Dinars to workers. "I am sure they are also not forgetting that when Kuwait suffered foreign aggression, Bangladeshi soldiers fought to restore its freedom and sovereignty," the foreign adviser said. Bangladesh contributed 12,000 soldiers to take part in the Gulf War in 1991 to fight the Iraqi forces that invaded Kuwait. Bangladesh soldiers were in charge of defusing thousands of land mines planted by the Iraqi forces that occupied Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Bangladeshi soldiers also protected the Kuwaiti royal palace. bd
