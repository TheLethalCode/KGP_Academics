 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday adjourned the GATCO graft case proceedings against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and others, for almost two months, in line with a High Court stay order. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin's Special Court-3 set Sept 11 for the next hearing, after the certified copy of the order reached the special court. A High Court bench halted the GATCO case proceedings on July 9 for two months on a petition by Khaleda Zia, challenging the legality of the case. The detained former prime minister did not appear in court Tuesday morning as she was ill, the jail authorities told the court. Four accused former ministers released on bail, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, M Shamsul Islam, Motiur Rahman Nizami and MK Anwar, and Ismail Hossain Simon, son of late shipping minister Akbar Hossain, were present in the court. Another 10 accused in the case, including former minister , Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, were also brought to court from Dhaka Central Jail. Lawyers of Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco and former finance minister M Saifur Rahman represented their clients, as Coco is undergoing treatment in Bangkok and Saifur has been hospitalised. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against Khaleda, Coco and 11 others on Sept 2 last year, on charges of awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and Coco as accused in the GATCO case on Sept 3. The commission later pressed charges against a total of 25 people, on May 13 this year. bdnews
