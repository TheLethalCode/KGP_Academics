 DALIAN, China, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Young American sprinter Walter Dix has the unenviable task of facing Jamaican world 100 metres record holder Usain Bolt in both the 100 and 200 metres  and he's relishing the challenge of not being the favourite. "It's like a boxing match," Dix told reporters at the U.S. athletics training camp on Tuesday, three days before the Beijing Olympics begin. "You've got eight rounds (four each in the 100 and 200 metres), and I've got to go in there with my gloves on every round." Dix's tenacity has already delivered one knockout. The former collegiate sprint champion eked by Olympic gold medallist Shawn Crawford to win the 200 metres at July's U.S. Olympic trials. He won his 100 metres berth by finishing second behind world champion Tyson Gay. Now the challenge is Bolt, the favourite in both the 100 and 200 metres. "That guy's fast, but I am going to be in the race," said a confident Dix. "I'm not a favourite, and that doesn't matter, I'm never a favourite in my eyes (in training)," the 22-year-old from Florida added. "And it's making me more hungry." Former record holder Asafa Powell proved in Stockholm last month that Bolt can be beaten in the 100 metres. Now Dix will attempt to sneak into the Olympics final with Bolt, Powell and American world 100 and 200 metres champion Gay. Unlike many, Dix does not favour Bolt to win the 100 metres gold. "I know Usain is the world record holder, but I've got to look at Tyson," said the first-time Olympian. "He knows how to run those rounds and has run fast times at the end of those rounds. "Some times the fastest guy doesn't win, but definitely the strongest always wins.
