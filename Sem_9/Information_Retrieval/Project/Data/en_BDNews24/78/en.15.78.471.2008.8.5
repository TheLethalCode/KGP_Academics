 Barisal, August 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Shawkat Hossain Hiron, who cried foul play by intelligence agents at a hurriedly-called press conference early Tuesday after his lead suddenly had eroded, won the Barisal City Corporation elections held Monday. The Awami League leader polled 46,796 votes, 588 more than his nearest contender S Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu of Progressive Democratic Party who bagged 46,208 ballots. Hiron had rushed a press conference early Tuesday where he blamed the government for what he feared to be an imminent defeat. "My victory has been snatched," he said. Hiron accused intelligence agents of tampering with the balloting in up to eight centres where he failed to win. bdnews
