<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leaders have expressed doubts over the neutrality of the city corporation polls, while acting AL president Zillur Rahman stated if the elections were fair the 14-party alliance would certainly emerge as the clear winners. Speaking to reporters Sunday, AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury said that the caretaker government was preparing to twist the results of the polls in a different light. Fellow AL presidium member Abdur Razzak told reporters that voters were panicked in some of the constituencies. The two AL leaders made the remarks after visiting city corporation areas on Saturday. Motia travelled Khulna city, while Razzak made a tour of the Rajshahi city corporation electoral area. "The voters are being threatened and rumours are being spread to that end," said Motia at a press conference at the home of acting AL president Zillur Rahman. She also demanded the release of central working committee member and former aviation and tourism minister engineer Mosharraf Hossai, who was rearrested Friday shortly after his release from jail on bail. Razzak said that he had requested the local administration to keep the situation under control during polls. "I have asked the authorities not to create any situation that frightens the people," he said. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman told reporters that if a fair election was held the 14-party alliance would certainly emerge as the clear winners in city corporation polls. Also demanding the release of Mosharraf Hossain, Zillur questioned why he had to return behind bars after he was released on bail. Mentioniong the relase of "collaborator and a war criminal, Motiur Rahman Nizami", the veteran AL leader said: "The AL, along with the people, is upset by the government's dual policy." "We have been saying that the anti-graft drive should not turn into an anti-political move." "The way the government is releasing some people and holding some other people is proving that our fears are true." "It is definitely a bad signal for the country," Zillur added. bdnews24.c
