<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday granted former home minister Mohammad Nasim six-month bail in the Prime Minister's Office siege case. The High Court bench of justices Sikder Mokbul Haque and Md Fazlur Rahman issued the order on a bail petition. The court also issued a rule on the government seeking to know in four weeks why Nasim would not be given permanent bail in the case. Advocate Enayetur Rahman defended Nasim in court. At the hearing, Rahman said: "Two years have elapsed since the case was filed. No charge-sheet was submitted either." "There was no specific allegation against Mohammad Nasim. Besides, he was seriously ill. His life may be threatened if he is not given better treatment abroad," Rahman said. Assistant attorney general Iqbal Kabir opposed the bail prayer and said guidance of the higher authorities was necessary for the appeal. Police SI Abdur Rauf filed the case with Mohammadpur Police Station against about 800 to 900 leaders and workers of the 14-party combine, including Nasim on September 12, 2006 on charges of ransacking and obstructing police duty during the Prime Minister's Office siege programme. Nasim was arrested on Feb 4, 2007 under emergency rule. Later, he was shown arrested in the case on February 28. After the bail, Nasim's counsel Enayetur Rahim told bdnews24.com that the High Court had summoned Nasim's medical report in the corruption case that alleged he had earned wealth beyond his known income. A special court on October 8 last year sentenced Nasim to 13 years in jail in a corruption case. bdnew
