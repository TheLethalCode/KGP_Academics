<TITLE> Mumbai court rejects woman's abortion plea </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bombay High Court on Monday rejected a woman's petition to undergo abortion after her 24-week foetus was diagnosed with a congenital heart problem. Under Indian law, it is illegal to abort a foetus more than 20 weeks old but Niketa Mehta's plea has raised an ethical debate in a country where illegal abortion of female foetuses is common. The court, which consulted medical experts, said doctors had found little evidence the child would suffer serious problems. "The court has opined that the medical expert body which was directed to submit a report has submitted that the child will not be a permanent disabled as contemplated," Rajendra Raghuvanshi, Additional Solicitor General for Mumbai, told reporters outside the court. The case has gripped India and sparked feverish media coverage this week. It was not clear whether Mehta would file an appeal in the Supreme Court. Many European countries allow abortion on demand, up to 12 or 13 weeks into pregnancy, after which it is limited to cases where the baby or mother is at risk. Termination is legal up to 22 to 24 weeks in Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
