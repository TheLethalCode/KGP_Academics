 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Agents of candidates set up camp outside polling centres to provide voters with serial numbers Monday, after early media reports from city corporations highlighted confusion among voters and election officials over voter identification. Voting began in four city corporations and nine municipalities from 8am Monday, to continue uninterrupted to 4pm, in the first set of elections to be held by the Election Commission under the present caretaker government and the ongoing state of emergency, which was back in full force for voting after being 'relaxed' in polling areas during campaigning. A number of candidates voiced satisfaction with the overall election atmosphere Monday, but bdnews24.com correspondents reported confusion over parts of the voting process. Meanwhile, the Chief Election Commissioner and election officials in different polling areas pointed out on Monday that National ID Cards are not required for casting votes, but voter slips or regitration numbers were needed for a smooth voting process. But many voters were seen returning from polling centres without casting votes, as they said they did not know where to collect their 'serial numbers'. A Khulna city presiding officer told bdnews24.com there should be no such confusion, but added: "Some polling agents may not be very well trained, so such mix-ups may be arising." bdnews24.com correspondents Reazul Bashar and Muktadir Ahmed reported from the Sylhet that voters were making their way to polling centres since morning defying rains. But, many said they had been unable to cast votes though they had brought ID cards. They had been unable to vote as they did not know where they were supposed to collect their registration numbers for the voting process on the day. Sylhet divisional commissioner Zafar Ahmed Khan visited a number of polling centres, while Barisal returning officer and deputy election commissioner Mizanur Rahman ruled out such complaints. "The candidates were asked to make sure the voters knew their registration numbers," he said. But candidates claimed that the Election Commission had not made any such instruction clear to them. bdnews24.com correspondent Mushtak Ahmed and local Barisal correspondent reported that many voters were facing problems as they had not taken ID cards with them. Vote-casting was also delayed as the voters did not have their registration slips or numbers. bdnews24.com correspondent Rohan Ziad also reported the same confusion about voter registration numbers in Khulna. Voters were arriving at the polling centres from morning. But they faced trouble without their 'serial numbers'. Many people returned home without casting votes. Abdur Rashid, presiding officer of Alia Madrasah polling centre, ruled out the complaints, but conceded some confusion might occur as not all officials were not properly trained. Ziad caught up with Awami League-backed mayoral candidate Talukder Abdul Khaleque as he cast his vote, to ask how the election was proceeding. "Polling seems to be going very well so far," said Talukdar. "The election atmosphere is good." Md Moniruzzaman Moni, known locally as 'the BNP candidate', was also impressed, saying: "The election is going very well. The election atmosphere is good even under EPR." When pressed further about elections being held under a state of emergency, however, Moni replied: "It is not an ideal situation. The emergency should of course be lifted." bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib reported that the voter turnout appeared low in Rajshahi over the morning. All preparations for polling were completed Sunday, with a public holiday being announced in the electoral areas and security beefed up for almost 600 polling centres in the four city corporations. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com Sunday: "I hope good elections will be held, with voters being able to cast their ballots without any hazard in a peaceful atmosphere." Apart from city corporation polls, elections were also being taking place in upazilas including Manikganj, Chuadanga, Shariatpur, Golapganj in Sylhet, Dhupchanchia in Bogra, Naohata in Rajshahi, Sreepur in Gazipur, Fulbaria in Mymensingh and Sitakundu in Chittagong. A total of 46 candidates are contending for mayoral posts in the city corporation polls, with some 750 running for councillor seats and 187 for reserved councillor seats. bdnews24.com/ans
