 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Monday that polling centres would not be closed until all people queuing to cast their votes had done so. "The voting that began from 8am will continue uninterrupted till 4 pm, but the polling centres will not be closed however long it takes for voters queuing inside the centres to cast their votes," the CEC told reporters after visiting a polling centre in Manikganj. Huda termed the four city corporation and nine municipal elections a step forward on the path to national elections. "We will take lessons from this election. We will recognise the hurdles, taking place in these polls and review them." "The local polls mark the start of the journey to the national elections, slated for December," he said. The CEC voiced satisfaction with the election atmosphere at Manikganj. "I am happy with the atmosphere. I have talked with the voters, election officers and law enforcing officials." The voter lists with photographs is a new system for the Election Commission, Huda said. "Many voters have brought ID cards though they were not required. I have heard voting has been delayed in some places as the voters and the election officers did not have any prior experience," he said. bdnews
