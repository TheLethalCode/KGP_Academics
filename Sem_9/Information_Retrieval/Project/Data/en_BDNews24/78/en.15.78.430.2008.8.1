 GALLE, Sri Lanka, August (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malinda Warnapura and Kumar Sangakkara scored aggressive fifties as Sri Lanka replied positively to India's first innings 329, reaching 126 for one at tea on the second day of the second test. Warnapura, a centurion in the first test, stroked his way to 60 from 81 balls with nine fours and a six while Sangakkara was 59 at the break having faced 84 balls with eight boundaries. The only Sri Lanka casualty of the afternoon was opener Michael Vandort (four), who was caught in the slips off Zaheer Khan in the first over of the innings. Earlier, opener Virender Sehwag, resuming on 128, continued his domination of the Sri Lanka bowling from the first day while wickets tumbled at the other end with spinner Ajantha Mendis claiming career-best figures of six for 117. Sehwag's incredible unbeaten 201, the first double century by an Indian against Sri Lanka, spanned 231 balls and included 22 boundaries and four sixes. When Mendis trapped last-man Ishant Sharma lbw to close the innings Sehwag became only the second Indian after Sunil Gavaskar to carry his bat through an entire innings. India, resuming on 214 for four, started the day well with VVS Laxman (39) and Sehwag surviving the first hour without alarm and extending their fifth-wicket partnership to 100. In the second hour, though, Sri Lanka turned back to Mendis and he inspired the second collapse of the innings, the final six wickets falling for 51 runs. Laxman was the first to perish as he attempted a wristy pull but was surprised by some extra bounce and caught at mid-wicket. Dinesh Karthik (seven) was pinned lbw by Mendis' straighter ball. Muttiah Muralitharan also chipped in with a couple of wickets, finishing with two for 93, as Anil Kumble was stumped and Zaheer Khan top edged a slog-sweep. Mendis wrapped up the innings with a leg break to bowl Harbhajan Singh and a straighter ball to win an lbw shout against Sharma, who offered no stroke. India's hopes were buoyed by an early breakthrough, but Warnapura and Sangakkara then seized control. India's bowlers gave the pair too many scoring opportunities and their fielders also missed chances. Wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik missed a stumping chance off Sangakkara on 58 and Harbhajan Singh was unable to hold on to a caught and bowled chance off Warnapura on 5
