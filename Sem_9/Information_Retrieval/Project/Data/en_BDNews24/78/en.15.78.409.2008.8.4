<TITLE> Bangladesh first to get $170 million ADB food crisis loan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)--The government signed a $170 million agreement with the Asian Development Bank on Monday, to help the poor cope with rising food prices. Bangladesh is the first developing country to receive such a loan since ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda announced in May immediate budgetary support of $500 million to Asia-Pacific countries hit by global food price crisis. Joint Secretary to the External Relations Division Monwara Begum and ADB's resident mission head Nurul Huda signed the loan agreement at a ceremony in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Food production in Bangladesh, a net importer of grains, was severely hampered by two severe floods and a devastating cyclone in 2007. The country faced a production shortfall of 1.2 million tonnes affecting the food security of an estimated 25 million people. Rapidly increasing food prices further worsened the situation, seriously hitting the poor, vulnerable, and fixed income earners. Soaring food prices have led to particular hardship for the poor as they spend about 70 percent of their total income on food. bdnews2
