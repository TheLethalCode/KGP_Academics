 GUANTANAMO BAY US NAVAL BASE, Cuba Wed Aug 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A jury of US military officers on Wednesday convicted Osama bin Laden's driver on charges of providing material support for terrorism in the first US war crimes trial since World War Two. But the panel at the remote US naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba acquitted Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan on additional charges of conspiring with al Qaeda to commit war crimes. The judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for Wednesday afternoon for Hamdan, who faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The jurors deliberated a little over eight hours before reaching their verdict. Hamdan, wearing a white turban and long white robe topped with a tan blazer, stood tensely in the courtroom beside his lawyers as the verdict was announced, listening through headphones to the English-Arabic interpreter. The trial is the first full test of the controversial Guantanamo tribunal authorized by the Bush administration to try non-US captives on terrorism charges outside the regular civilian and military courts
