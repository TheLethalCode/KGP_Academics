<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Wednesday that his party would not participate in the national elections amid the state of emergency. "We have taken part in the local elections amid the state of emergency. But we will not do the same in the national elections," Ashraf told reporters after a meeting at the home of acting AL president Zillur Rahman. "The upcoming elections should be made acceptable to the world," Ashraf said. Visiting European parliament member for southeast England, Nirj Deva met with Zillur Rahman Wednesday. Ashraf and AL president Sheikh Hasina's special assistant Hassan Mahmud were also present. Ashraf said the meeting had discussed bilateral issues, adding that the European MP said that the EU did not send observers to countries holding elections amid a state of emergency. AL will accept an invitation to a planned third round of dialogues with the government and the Election Commission, Ashraf said. "We want that all decisions should be taken on the basis of discussions." The third round dialogue is expected to include issues such as how appointments to the High Court, Public Service Commission and Anticorruption Commission can be made neutral. The AL leader alleged that BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain was destroying the election atmosphere by delivering provocative remarks. Delwar said Tuesday that the election to city corporations and municipalities was "stage managed". "BNP should accept the results of the elections," Ashraf said, speaking of AL-backed nominees' near-clean sweep of mayoral seats in all four city corporations and eight of nine municipality elections. On the city polls he said: "It was a test case. The EC should take preparations for the national elections by amending any mistakes in this election." bdnews
