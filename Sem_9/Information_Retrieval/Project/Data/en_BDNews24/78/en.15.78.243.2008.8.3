 Mingora, Pakistan, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb blast killed at least 8 Pakistani policemen on Saturday, part of a resurgence of violence in the northwestern Swat Valley since the collapse of a peace deal with pro-Taliban militants, police said. The policemen were heading towards Kabal, a militant stronghold, when their vehicle hit the bomb. Three to four policemen were wounded. Ali Rehmat Khan, the local police chief, said 15 policemen were travelling in the vehicle. "We were returning from holiday and going to Kabal when the bomb exploded under our vehicle," Inspector Mohammad Wisaal, one of the wounded men, told Reuters in a hospital in Swat's main town, Mingora. Pakistani authorities signed a peace deal with the militants in May to end a wave of violence that erupted late last year when militants tried to enforce Taliban-style rule in the region. But clashes have broken out again recently in the mountainous Swat region, whose beauty made it a top tourist destination until the militant bid for power last year. Nearly 50 people have been killed in the fighting, and earlier this week militants killed three intelligence officials and captured up to 30 police and paramilitary troops in an attack on a checkpoint.
