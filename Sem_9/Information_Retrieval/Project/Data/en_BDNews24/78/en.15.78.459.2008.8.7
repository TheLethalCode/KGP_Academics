 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government will release Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) president Azizul Bari Helal tentatively by Thursday night, said Dhaka University vice chancellor SM Faiz Wednesday. After a late night meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, Faiz told reporters around 10.30pm at his office: "The government has decided on the Chhatra League general secretary and the Chhatra Dal president. We hope they will be released by Thursday night." The VC met with the interim government head to discuss the situation after the BNP's student wing JCD joined the Awami League's student front BCL in announcing a plan to surround the home ministry on Thursday to demand release of the leaders, proctor AK Firoze told bdnews24.com. The vice chancellor spoke to the student activists around 8:40pm, although he was earlier given until 7pm by BCL activists to redress the arrest of Roton on charges of violating emergency powers rules. He spoke to the student leaders for about 20 minutes before leaving to meet with the chief adviser. The JCD activists came to the campus around 8:30pm in a procession and demonstrated demanding Helal be released. They broke the windows of the Registrar's Office before leaving around 9:45pm. Joint secretary of JCD's university unit Akramul Hasan told bdnews24.com that the order for Helal's release was given on Aug 4 and The prison authorities received the documents on Aug 5. But he had yet to be released. He said having waited until Wednesday evening in front of the prisons the activists came to the campus to demonstrate. They were pressing on with the legal battle as Helal had not been released even after the courts ordered his release. They will file a lawsuit against the authorities, he added. Hasan said they would surround the home ministry at 11am on Thursday to demand the release of Helal. The BCL adherents however stayed in front of the VC's residence until 10pm even after he had left. Earlier, hundreds of BCL activists staged a sit-in in front of the VC's s office to pressure authorities into releasing Roton. They later withdrew after the VC sought time until 7pm to make headway with the release. BCL acting general secretary Syed Abdul Kalam told bdnews24.com that the VC had talks with the government high-ups about the release of the BCL leader. Earlier on the day, Roton's father Afsar Uddin Haider Chowdhury met the VC. The BCL on Tuesday called a strike at Dhaka University for Wednesday for the same cause only to call it off shortly afterwards on assurance by university authorities that their demand would be taken care of. Earlier on the same day, the activists confined the VC for three hours inside his office. About 150 adherents surrounded the VC's office in the administrative building at around 4pm, demanding release of Roton from Mymensingh jail. BCL's DU president Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com that the strike was called off "for the time being", after the VC requested time until Wednesday noon to resolve the issue. BCL activist Shamsul Kabir Rahat told bdnews24.com Tuesday that Roton had been freed from Mymensingh jail at about 10:30am Tuesday, and was kept seated in the visiting room of the jail. Police later rearrested him from the visiting room at around 2:30pm, Rahat said. The news prompted the BCL leaders and supporters to march on to the VC's office, under the banner of "Human Rights Conscious Students", saying they would continue their protest until action was taken about Roton. The activists had earlier damaged teachers' vehicles parked outside of the administrative building, and locked the main gates with the vice chancellor and other university officials held inside. Joint forces arrested Roton on Jan 18, 2007, on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. BCL observed a 24-hour token hunger strike demanding his release on Sunday. bdnews24.co
