 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) Police rearrested Obaidul Moktadir Chowdhury, assistant personal secretary of Awami League chief Shiekh Hasina, from Dhaka Central Jail gate immediately after he was freed from jail on Sunday. Jailer Faruk Hossain told bdnews24.com that Obaidul was released around 7pm. Gulshan police sub-inspector Ashok Chouhan said police rearrested Obaidul under Emergency Power Rules from the jail gate, and sent him to Dhaka Cantonment Police Station. He will be sent to the court Monday, said the sub-inspector. The Anticorruption Commission filed a graft case against Obaidul, and wife Fahima Khatun, on Nov 4 last year. Obaidul and Fahima surrendered to the court on May 20. The court granted bail to Fahima but sent Obaidul to jail. bdn
