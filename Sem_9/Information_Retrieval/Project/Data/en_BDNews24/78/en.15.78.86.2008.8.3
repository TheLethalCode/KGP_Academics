 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has awarded Saifur Rahman 6 months bail in the GATCO graft case, less than 24 hours after the ailing BNP leader landed back home after seeking medical treatment abroad. A High Court bench of justices Sharifuddin Chakladar and Md Imadul Haque the ailing Saifur was not a flight risk and should remain in hospital. The court also ordered the government and the Anticorruption Commission to show cause within four weeks why Saifur should not be granted permanent bail. The former finance minister was taken from Apollo Hospital to the High Court Sunday, seeking bail in the GATCO graft case. Lawyer for the ailing BNP leader, Abdur Rezzaque Khan, submitted a bail plea to the High Court bench Sunday. Saifur was later taken into the courtroom in a wheelchair for the bail hearing around 3.40pm, returning to hospital an hour later after being awarded bail. Saifur, facing charges in the GATCO scam case, returned to Dhaka shortly after Saturday midnight from Singapore. Suffering from prostrate gland ailments, the BNP leader was taken straight to hospital in Dhaka on arrival. Airport security officer Awlad Ahmed said the former minister had been wheelchaired out of the airport. Saifur went to Singapore for medical treatment on May 7, a day before he was formally charged in the GATCO graft case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year against 13 people, including Khaleda Zia and her son Arafat Rahman Coco, for awarding Global Agro Trading Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. The commission later pressed charges against a total of 25 people including Saifur on May 13. bdnews24.com
