 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)Advisers praised the success on Tuesday of the first round of local elections, but cautioned voters against supporting unworthy candidates in future polls. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Monday's polls proved that holding fair elections was very much possible. Calling the local government polls 'a test case', both advisers said the government would now deliberate on and decide how far the state of emergency might be lifted during the forthcoming Jatiya Sangsad elections. Leaving the local government ministry, Iqbal told reporters: "The successful staging of the polls has also been a huge success for the government." "The Election Commission will have identified the problems associated with holding elections using voter lists with photos and address those problems to do better in the forthcoming national polls," he said. "The elections have been well held despite our journey under the emergency. The polls have been conducted in a free, fair and disciplined environment," the former police chief said. Asked if the government's image has taken a dent since some of the polls winners also happen to be graft suspects, he replied: "We only hope the candidates in future will be more aware, transparent and accountable." Quader, the communication adviser, told reporters at the ministry: "You and I everyone has seen that Monday's elections have been successfully." "On the wins of those accused of graft, I'll say that it's the responsibility of the voters, after allto elect or not to electof rejecting or supporting a black money holder or a rogue." "The government cannot have any say there," Quader said. "The government's goals will not be possible to achieve unless the people vow to change their mindset and the nation's fate." "Social movements will have to be waged first to effect change in the people's attitudes and behaviour. This election has initiated the process," said Quader. "The government aims to hold really free and fair election, which it is gradually learning to be able to in the near future." "The Election Commission will learn the lessons so that it may overcome any wrong steps taken of late," the adviser said. bdnews24.com/mk
