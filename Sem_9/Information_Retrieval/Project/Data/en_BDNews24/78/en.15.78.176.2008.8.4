 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)- BNP former joint secretary general and whip Syed Ashraf Hossain was released from Dhaka Central Jail Monday, after being granted bail by the High Court, only to have police pick him up again. Jubo Dal central leaders, Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com: "After Ashraf Bhai got released plainclothes policemen took him away in a microbus. The policemen said, 'Sir, get in our car. We need to talk with you.'" But jailer Faruq Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "Former whip Ashraf Hossain was released at 9pm as the High Court has granted him bail." Faruq said he did not know what happened after Ashraf left the jail. A High Court bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Md Imdadul Haque Azad granted Ashraf six months bail on Thursday, in a case filed against him by the Anticorruption Commission relating to the purchase and sale of vehicles. Ashraf was expelled from the party as joint secretary general, along with Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at the time of her arrest last year. He was arrested in July. bdnew
