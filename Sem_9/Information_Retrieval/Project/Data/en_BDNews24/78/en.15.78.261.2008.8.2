 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene backed the International Cricket Council's (ICC) technology trial after India's Rahul Dravid was dismissed on the third day of the second test on Saturday. The home team overturned a not-out lbw decision against Dravid after calling for a review of the original verdict given off the bowling of spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Third umpire Gamini Silva eventually adjudged the ball would have hit the stumps, a decision vindicated by 'Virtual Eye', ball-tracking software used by the television broadcasters. But the length of time that elapsed between the appeal and the final decision sparked debate and when Dravid was given out for 44 he looked visibly upset. "In this series there have been quite a few obvious mistakes we have managed to turn around because of the referrals so we think it has been good for the game," Jayawardene told reporters. "In the space of time we have been given I should be able to ask the umpire why he said not out. They have given us time to ask a few people, like the wicketkeeper and bowler, and at the same time I can ask the umpire as well. OFF STUMP "He (Billy Doctrove) said it had struck the pad outside off stump." Jayawardene said India were on top on 200 for four in their second innings, a lead of 237. "The Indians are probably in front but getting two late wickets was crucial and if we keep them down to a decent score we can chase it down on the fourth or fifth day," he said. Opener Gautam Gambhir was upbeat about India's chances of squaring the series 1-1. "Sri Lanka have a quality spin attack but so far in this test we have done well and have set the game up for our bowlers," said Gambhir after hitting 74. "Anything above 350 is going to be a very good target as the pitch is going to deteriorate, especially with (spinners) Harbhajan (Singh) and (Anil) Kumble in our armoury. It is going to be very difficult for them
