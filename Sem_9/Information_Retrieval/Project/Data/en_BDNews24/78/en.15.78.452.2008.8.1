 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Multimode Group that boasts businesses in a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, textiles and consumer goods, held its 25th founding anniversary on Thursday. "The company believes in working towards the country's progress," said Multimode founder and CEO Abdul Awal Mintoo, speaking at the company's Corporate Night at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. "That's why our latest initiative has centered on agriculture," said Mintoo, referring to Lal Teer, a market leader in the hybrid vegetable seeds market with nearly 8 percent of national demand. Lal Teer has developed 96 varieties, 42 of which are registered. Lal Teer has witnessed "tremendous" business growth over the last 10 years. "Sales have increased by 85 percent," Mintoo said. Touching on some future plans, the country's leading businessman said the group would expand into the ICT sector. "As ICT is a skills-based sector, Bangladesh has the potential to do well in it because our strength is the hard-working manpower we have," he said. Mintoo thanked all employees and partners for their cooperation in business ventures in the last 25 years. Mintoo gave away awards to 20 employees of different levels in the group in recognition of their good work and loyalty to the company.
