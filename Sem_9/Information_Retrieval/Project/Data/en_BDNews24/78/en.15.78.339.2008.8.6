<TITLE> Emergency was no hindrance to local polls: Lord Avebury </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) Visiting British parliamentarian, Lord Eric Avebury said Wednesday that the state of emergency did not appear to create any obstacle to the holding of local government polls on Aug 4. After a meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry, he said it seemed people were able to vote in the polls without obstacles. "Everyone who had wanted to vote in the recent local government polls was able to do so without fear or hindrance," Lord Eric told reporters in reply to a question on whether fair and credible elections were possible under a state of emergency. "People were able to freely elect the candidate of their choice, without being impeded by the state of emergency," said Avebury, who is known internationally as a "Champion of Human Rights". Echoing the caretaker administration, Avebury termed the successful holding of the election a test case for the present government. The Member of the House of Lords, who is on a personal visit to Bangladesh, said that he was convinced there was no doubt that the caretaker government would be able to hold a free, fair and credible election by December. bdn
