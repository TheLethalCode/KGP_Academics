 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Tuesday extended until Sept 6 former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's period of release from prison for treatment, hours after her husband appealed the chief adviser for an extension. A statement from the home ministry Tuesday afternoon citing the government order on the extension was made available to the media. The statement said on the appeal by her husband Dr M Wazed Miah, the government has extended it until Sept 6. The extension of the tenure would come into effect on August 7. Hasina, also the Awami League chief now standing trial on corruption charges, was released on June 11 after remaining confined for 11 months. As per the Criminal Procedure Code, she was released on parole from June 11 to August 6. The day after her release she went to the USA for better treatment and is staying there now. Dr M Wazed Miah, the husband, had earlier appealed to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed for an extension of her period of release and withdrawal of all cases against her. Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud and counsel and nephew barrister Fazle Noor Tapash reached the written appeal to the Chief Adviser's Office. After reaching the appeal to the visitor's room at the CA's office, barrister Tapash told waiting journalists, "The appeal has been made to extend the tenure of parole and to withdraw all cases against Sheikh Hasina." Replying to a question he said, "The appeal seeks extension of the tenure of (her) freedom. No specific date has been mentioned."
