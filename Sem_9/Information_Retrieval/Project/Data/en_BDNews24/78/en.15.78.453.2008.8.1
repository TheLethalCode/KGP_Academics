 HYDERABAD, India, Fri Aug 1, (Reuters) - At least 13 people were killed when a fire believed to have been sparked by a short circuit spread through a train in Andhra Pradesh early on Friday while many passengers were asleep, police said. Five coaches of the Gautami Express, which was travelling from Hyderabad to Kakinada on the coast, were gutted in the massive pre-dawn fire. Railway officials have ruled out sabotage and said the fire was apparently caused by a short circuit. Rescue workers had difficulty reaching the accident site, which was inaccessible by road. Darkness hampered the rescue work
