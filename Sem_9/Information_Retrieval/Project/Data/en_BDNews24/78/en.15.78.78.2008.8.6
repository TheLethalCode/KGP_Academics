 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against Fazlur Rahman Patal, youth and sports minister of the former four-party alliance government, on Wednesday, for earning wealth disproportionate to his income and submitting a false statement of wealth. ACC assistant director Md Helaluddin Sharif submitted the chargesheet to the court of the chief metropolitan magistrate. The investigation officer of the case recommended exemption for Patal's wife Kamrunnahar and son Md Yasir Arshad as preliminary charges could not be established against them. A case was filed with Ramna police against Patal, currently behind bars, his wife and son on April 15 this year. bndne
