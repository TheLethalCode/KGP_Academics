 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) - Archrivals Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club will not face each other in the season's curtain-raiser Citycell Federation Cup unless they progress to the semifinals, with the old foes drawn into separate groups for the finals. B. League champions Abahani take on Jatrabari KC in the inaugural match Wednesday with BFF president Kazi Shalahuddin declaring the 16-team finals open. A draw for the 16 teams in the Federation Cup finals was held Sunday at a city hotel where top four teams of the inaugural B. League  Abahani, Mohammedan, Muktijoddha Krira Sangsad and Sheikh Russel KC  were chosen top seeded in groups A, B, C and D. Top two teams from each group will qualify for the quarterfinals. If both Abahani and Mohammedan emerge champions from their groups, the two heavyweights will set up a mouth-watering clash if they progress to the final. Abahani are expected to reach the quarterfinals easily as their Group B has comprised of Chittagong Mohammedan, Chittagong Abahani Krira Chakra and Jatrabari Krira Sangha. The Dhanmondi-based outfit, however, might face comparatively tough Group C teams in the quarterfinals as Group C comprises holders Brothers Union, Sheikh Russel KC, Victoria Sporting Club and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. Mohammedan SC will play their Group D matches against Arambagh Krira Sangha, Rahmatganj MFS and Sunrise SC, and if all goes well, then the Motijheel-based outfit will face comparatively weaker team in the quarterfinals from Group A consisting of Muktijoddha Sangsad, Farashganj Sporting Club, Khulna Abahani and Dhaka Wanderers Club. "We (are about to start) fulfilling our commitment by going to launch the Federation Cup as we had promised you on being elected," said BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi during a brief ceremony. The former Bangladesh international said the BFF committee, led by Salahuddin, is now more committed to keep football in on the pitch round the year. Model Sadia Islam Mou and actor Jahid Islam were present during the programme with Mou picking up the name of Muktijoddha for Group A while Jahid collected the second name of Abahani for Group B. Swadhin Bangla Football Team's captain Jakaria Pintu and Protap Sankar Hajra chose Sheikh Russel and Mohammedan for Group C and D respectively.
