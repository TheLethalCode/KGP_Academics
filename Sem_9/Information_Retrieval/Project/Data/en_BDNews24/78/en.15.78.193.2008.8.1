 BIRMINGHAM, England, August 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa achieved a first innings lead of 83 runs after they were bowled out for 314 by England before lunch on the third day of the third test at Edgbaston on Friday. Rain delayed England's reply and forced an early lunch. England, who only managed 231 on Wednesday, needed quick wickets and got the perfect start when Ryan Sidebottom persuaded the normally patient Ashwell Prince to drive a ball that was not quite a half-volley. He was caught behind by Tim Ambrose for 39. Number nine batsman Morne Morkel made 18 after square cutting and then off-driving Andrew Flintoff for consecutive boundaries from the third over with the new ball as the England all rounder struggled to recapture the menace and movement in his bowling from the previous evening. Flintoff conceded 21 runs from his four-over spell of the morning to end with figures of four for 89, again missing a five-wicket performance in tests. He has the lowest number of five-wicket hauls of bowlers to have taken 200 test wickets. Andre Nel was bowled by a Sidebottom in-swinger before Mark Boucher attempted some late hitting to stretch his team's lead. Boucher was dropped by Monty Panesar at fine leg -- a straightforward chance -- when on 37 after he top-edged his hook shot to Sidebottom. He was finally dismissed for 40 when England captain Michael Vaughan showed Panesar the way with a diving catch at deep extra cover off James Anderson. South Africa are 1-0 up in the four-match serie
