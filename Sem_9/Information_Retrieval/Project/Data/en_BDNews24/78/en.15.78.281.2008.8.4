<TITLE> FBCCI concerned at worker deportations </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)-- The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry expressed deep concern over the forced deportation of Bangladesh workers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In a press statement on Thursday, FBCCI president Annisul Huq feared that it would create a negative impact on the total economy by hampering the flow of remittance from abroad. He observed that the foreign ministry and the Bangladesh missions in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait did not carry out their role in containing the situation that developed. Though the FBCCI wrote to the foreign ministry on May 8, about the distress and sufferings of Bangladesh workers in Kuwait , the ministry did not take the matter into consideration, Annisul alleged. He feared that in future such a situation might create problems in case of workers in other countries such as including Malaysia. To solve the current issues, the FBCCI chief urged concerned organisations of the government to send officials to countries including the Middle East to discuss the problems on a priority basis. The Middle East is biggest remittance source. Last financial year, remittance worth $7.91 billion came to the country from Bangladeshi workers worldwide, of which $4.97 billion came from eight Middle East countries, and Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait alone remitted $3.18 billion. Annisul Huq said the forced sending back of workers from Saudi Arabia was mainly due to violations of law because of living there without work permits and passports. If recruiting agents were responsible for the situation, proper steps should be taken, he added, suggesting a probe into what way agents are responsible in respect of workers' papers, employment and wages in the Middle East. Annisul mentioned reports that some labourers working for the full month got only eight dinars, equivalent to $20 or Tk 2000. But the FBCCI does not support workers taking the law into their own hands, the federation president stressed. bdnews
