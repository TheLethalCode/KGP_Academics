 DUBAI, Sun Aug 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda confirmed on Sunday that Abu Khabab al-Masri, a chemical and biological weapons expert, was killed with three other militants in a suspected US air strike in Pakistan's border region last week. Masri, who carried a $5 million US bounty on his head, had been earlier identified as the likely target of the attack on a house in a Pakistani tribal area bordering Afghanistan, according to Pakistani officials. An al Qaeda statement posted on Islamist websites said Masri, referred to as the "expert", had left behind him a generation of students who would avenge his killing. The statement, signed by al Qaeda's leader in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, named three other militants killed alongside Masri on July 28. It said some of their children also died.

Masri, a 55-year-old Egyptian chemist, was regarded as one of the group's top bomb makers
