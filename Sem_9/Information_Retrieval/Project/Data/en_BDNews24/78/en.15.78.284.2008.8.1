 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com) - A swashbuckling 112 from Roqibul Hasan powered the Bangladesh A team to a fighting 275 for six against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Friday at Durham University ground, England. Being asked to bat first, Bangladesh fell in trouble losing opener Nazimuddin (1) with scoreboard reading only one for two. After removing Nazimuddin, pacer Jonathan Miles also dismissed Tamim Iqbal (11 off 13 balls) and first-change bowler Will Gidman bowled Rajin Salah (5 off 23 balls) to reduce the visitors to 27 for three. Then, Roqibul and Shakib Al Hasan turned things around with defying the MCC attack, and they together put on 71 runs for the fourth wicket before the latter was bowled by Faisal Shahid for a 54-ball 41 that studded with five boundaries. Roqibul along with Naeem Islam (25) added another 51 runs for the fifth wicket and racked up 113 runs for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh. Dhiman quickfired 55 off 40 balls smashing two fours and two sixes before being Gidman's second victim. Roqibul finally remained unbeaten on 112 facing 124 balls that featured eight fours and one six. In reply, MCC were 111 for two in 20.5 overs when this report was filed. Opener Kunal Jogia was batting on 35 while Bradshaw on four. One-down Stuart Law was more destructive with 65 off 52 balls before being caught by Shakib off spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. Stuart and Jogia put on 98 runs after pacer Dollar Mahmud removed opener Akbar Ansari (two-ball duck) in the first over.
