<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation's national team management committee (NTMC) is likely to take the final decision on appointing a local coach for the national team at its second meeting in the BFF House Tuesday. Speculation that Shafiqul Islam Manik was going to take charge of the national team mounted Monday when Manik came to the BFF House to discuss with NTMC chairman and BFF vice president Badal Roy. Roy refusing to go into details said that they would sit Tuesday to discuss the matter. A source, however, seeking anonymity, told bdnews24.com, "Initially Manik will be given a six-month term and the contract will come to effect from this month so that he can choose players after observing their performances in the Citycell Federation Cup." Bangladesh will participate in Malaysia's Mardeka Cup, one of the oldest football tournaments in Asia held annually in Kuala Lumpur. Manik, a former national player, last coached Mohammedan Sporting Club, which finished runners-up in 2007 inaugural B. League and emerged champions in 2005 Nitol-Tata National Football League. Manik, considered a proponent of the defensive strategy, also guided Muktijoddha Sangsad, that bagged the premier league title (twice), the national league (once), the federation cup (twice), Independent Cup, DAMFA Cup and the 1998 McDowell Cup in Kolkata. NTMC vice chairman Nurul Alam Chowdhry said that the appointment of a local coach for the national team would be one of the top agendas at Tuesday's meeting. Chowdhury said that the meeting would also discuss player selection process for the Mardeka Cup in October. The BFF officials earlier said they would appoint foreign coaches for the national team after employing a foreign technical director, who would give an expert's opinion on the matter.
