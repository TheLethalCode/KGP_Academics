<TITLE> Lewis says drugs make athletics "farcical" </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian officials have advised outspoken runner Tamsyn Lewis to keep her opinions to herself and concentrate on her events after she launched a blistering attack on Olympic drug testing. Lewis, the world indoor champion for 800 metres, said she had become completely disillusioned with athletics because she believes her sport is riddled with drug cheats. "I have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit," she told Sydney's Daily Telegraph from her training camp in Darwin. "I have no doubts that when I line up next week, I will look left and right and know the other girls aren't all clean. "That is such a disgrace and I've lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar." Athletics has been hard hit by a series of spectacular doping busts in the past few years, including the confession of 2000 Olympic champion Marion Jones that she used drugs for years despite never failing a test. Seven Russian athletes have already been banned from competing at the Beijing Olympics for doping-related offences, prompting the head of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission to accuse the Russians of systematic doping. Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) officials said they shared Lewis' concerns but said she would be better off concentrating on her events rather than doping issues. "We agree with Tamsyn that it's a problem but it's a problem that the IOC is throwing enormous efforts at to solve," AOC vice-president Peter Montogmery told a news conference on Wednesday. "I think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities. "Tamsyn's free to speak out as much as she wants but if she's got any specific allegations to make about anyone she should raise them with us and we'll forward it to the IOC.
