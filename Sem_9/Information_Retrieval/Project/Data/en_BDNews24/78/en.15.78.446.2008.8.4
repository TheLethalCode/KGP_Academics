 Seoul, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The three South Koreans who died on K-2 in Pakistan last week were experienced climbers who belonged to a prestigious club that has put several of its members on the world's second-highest peak, a group leader said on Monday. At least nine climbers perished when a chunk of ice broke off and tore away fixed lines from a gully known as the Bottleneck, above 8,200 meters (26,902 ft), in the worst day for mountaineering on K-2. "The members have either climbed the Himalayas or have gone through some hard training," Cho Hyung-gyu, who heads the South Gyeongsang provincial chapter of the Korean Alpine Federation, told Reuters. Three South Koreans, two Nepalese, a Serb, a Norwegian and Dutch and French climbers have been confirmed dead. Unconfirmed reports said one Pakistani had died and several foreign and local climbers were unaccounted for. Media reports in Seoul said two other South Korean climbers had made it back alive. One of the leaders of the South Korean team, Hwang Dong-jin, whom local media said was 45, had previously climbed three of the Himalayas's 14 peaks above 8,000 meters and was a nationally recognized athlete, Cho said. The group had put the first South Korean on Lhotse, dubbed the South Peak in the shadow of Mount Everest, in 1995 and sent a team of eight members to the peak of K-2 in 2000. Cho said following the K-2 tragedy, Himalayan mountaineering could be put on hold for a while but not for long. "We will continue climbing the Himalayas." Climbing legend Reinhold Messner, who famously scaled Mount Everest without bottled oxygen in 1978, said following last week's disaster, that the alarming number of casualties was partly because of the growth of commercial mountaineering. But Cho dismissed the criticism, saying: "We're not into any commercial mountaineering whatsoever." The Korean team was making its descent after summiting the 8,611 meter peak in northern Pakistan when an avalanche at the Bottleneck hit them, a tour operator said. The previous deadliest day in the history of the K-2 was on August 13, 1995 when six people fell or went missing during a storm, including British female climber Alison Hargreaves. Although K-2 is not the deadliest in terms of number of fatalities, records show chances of dying making a descent after summiting are far greater than for other peaks.
