<TITLE> Tata walks out on investment plan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Tata Group abandoned a $3 billion investment plan for Bangladesh after it failed to win commitments from the government for the supply of natural gas to the projects, it said Thursday. "It is clear that the government will not be in a position, in the foreseeable future, to grant the projects the natural gas commitment they would require,'' the Indian conglomerate said in a statement on its website. "Consequently, there is no prospect of taking these projects further," it added. Tata handed a letter over to the Board of Investment. The statement said the group would continue to develop its other interests in Bangladesh. Md Kamaluddin Ahmed, executive chairman of the Board of Investment, told bdnews24.com by phone that it was not possible for Bangladesh to supply the huge amount of gas Tata would need for its project. "Tata has informed us that it will not pursue the proposal for gas-based projects in Bangladesh," Ahmed said. Most of the Tata proposals were based on coal, he said. "We need to make the coal policy before having talks on the issue." Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told bdnews24.com that Tata's withdrawal would taint the image of the country abroad. He feared Tata's decision might affect investment in the country. The FBCCI president said Tata's decision was pending for long because of political indecision. "Foreign investment in the country is not good in the country. Tata's withdrawal might put a negative impact on investment," he added. Zaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said it was not "unexpected". "Bangladesh overlooked rising domestic demand for gas over the last few years which widened the gap between demand and supply," he said. "We had long sat on the proposal. This kind of situation always discourages investors," he added. Bakht termed Tata's withdrawal from the investment plan as a failure of the caretaker government. "It could have finalised the deal as it had the opportunity to work more dispassionately than political governments." Tata, with interests ranging from computer software to automobiles, planned to set up a steel plant with an annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes. "The Tata Group first proposed four large projects in Bangladesh in 2004 and had intensive discussions with the government of Bangladesh up until 2006," it said. The Group suspended "further work" on the projects, as agreement on key issues with the government was not possible, the statement added. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Oct 03 last year said the caretaker administration was not in a position to approve or reject the Tata proposal. Tata signed a memorandum of understanding with Bangladesh in 2004 on a $2 billion investment and later hiked the proposal to $3 billion. Tata's investment proposal includes a 1,000 megawatt gas-fired power plant and a 500-megawatt coal-fired power plant. Also on the cards was a plant capable to produce one million tonnes of fertiliser a year and a 2.4 million-tonne steel mill in Ishwardi. The government had earlier rejected Tata's initial offer to buy gas at a fixed rate of $1.10 per unit over a 20-year period. Later, in April 2006, Tata came up with a new proposal that offered to pay $3.10 per thousand cubic feet (TCF) of gas for its fertiliser plant. The revised deal also included a proposal to pay $2.60 per TCF for the steel plant's power supply. However, the plan remained pegged to a 20-year guarantee to supply natural gas to the projects. Tata in July 2006 suspended work on investment because of dithering by the government. bdnews24.com/
