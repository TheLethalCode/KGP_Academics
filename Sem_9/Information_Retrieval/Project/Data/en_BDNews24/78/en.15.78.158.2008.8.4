 Beijing, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Assailants killed 16 Chinese police in the restive Xinjiang province on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said, in just the sort of violence Beijing had hoped to prevent four days before the start of the Olympics. The unidentified attackers drove up in two vehicles and tossed grenades into a border station of the northwestern province, the Xinhua agency reported. Twelve policemen were also hurt. Under heavy security scrutiny in the run-up to the Aug. 8-24 Games, Xinjiang is home to a large Uighur Muslim population, many of them discontent under strict Chinese rule. Some Uighur groups are campaigning for an independent homeland for their Turkic-speaking people. And China says it has foiled terror plots there targeting the Games. "Rioters drove two vehicles to break into the border patrol armed police division" near Kashgar city, Xinhua reported on Monday's incident, giving no more description of the attackers. In further disappointment for China, athletes and spectators pouring into Beijing found a pollution-fuelled haze ending a rare run of blue skies on Monday. China longs for a sunny start to the Games on Friday. The local Communist government says drastic anti-pollution measures -- like ordering nearly 2 million of Beijing's cars off the road and closing smoke-belching factories -- have guaranteed safety for athletes during the Aug 8-24 Games. They were not enough, however, to extend three days of sunshine that brought foreign visitors and Beijing residents onto the streets in shorts and T-shirts at the weekend, enjoying parks and taking photos of the futuristic Olympic venues. A spokesman for the Beijing Games Organising Committee (BOCOG) attributed Monday's return of the smog largely to a drop in wind. He noted that hundreds of anti-pollution measures had produced "good" weather on official measures. "You have to remember our geographical situation, the mountains around the city," BOCOG's Sun Weide said. "Obviously we hope it is fine on Friday (for the opening ceremony). That depends not only on human endeavour but on Mother Nature too." China has some even stricter last-minute contingency plans up its sleeve to cut smog, such as pulling yet more cars off the road. And officials may also try to play God by firing chemicals into clouds to try and induce rain before they reach Beijing. GLOBAL CRITICISM Using a Chinese number associated with fortune and prosperity, the Olympics are to start on the eighth day of the eighth month in the brand new "Bird's Nest" stadium. Chinese leaders hope the Games will showcase the economic progress and new global clout of the world's most populous nation. But in a turbulent buildup, they have had worse clouds than just the Beijing smog to deal with. Many of the more than 10,000 athletes, roughly 30,000 journalists and total 2.5 million visitors to China for the Games were arriving with images of global protests around the Olympic torch relay earlier this year fresh in their mind. Monday's attack was a reminder of China's many internal problems. The Games have galvanised global critics of China on a range of issues from treatment of internal dissidents, particularly in Tibet, censorship of the Internet, and Beijing's close ties with Sudan's government despite the Darfur conflict. China has a 100,000-strong security force on hand just in case. And several hundred thousand smiling volunteers, mainly students, man every Beijing street corner. "You see, we are not as nasty as some of you in the Western media say we are!" one 21-year-old female engineering student said, handing coffee to visiting reporters. At the weekend, Nepal briefly detained 253 protesters, including Tibetan monks and nuns, who tried to stage a silent protest march in front of a Chinese visa office in Kathmandu. When attention finally turns to sport, China and the United States are expected to go head-to-head in the gold medal table, though largely in different sports. With China third in the Sydney 2000 table, then second in Athens 2004, the big question is whether it can go one better this time. Its Soviet-style training system plucks physically promising athletes from an early age and sends them to special schools with an eye to maximising medals hauls. A clutch of world leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush, are due into Beijing for this week's opening ceremony.
