The protesters carried Tibetan flags and banners demanding "free Tibet" and some that read "we want religious freedom". They were dragged away by police and put in waiting vehicles to be taken into custody. Some were seen weeping and begging. Police said the 253 Tibetans would be freed later on Sunday. Tibetan refugees began regular protests after deadly anti-government riots broke out in the Tibetan capital Lhasa and other areas in China in mid-March, to mark the anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
