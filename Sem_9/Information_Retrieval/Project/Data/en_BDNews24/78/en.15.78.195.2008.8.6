 BEIJING, Wed Aug 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four foreign protesters displaying a "Free Tibet" banner in the Chinese capital were held by police on Wednesday, state media reported and an activist group said, as the Olympic Games torch made its way through the city. The protesters unfurled Tibetan flags and banners declaring "One World, One Dream: Free Tibet" and "Tibet will be free," the group Students for a Free Tibet said in an emailed statement. One banner said "Free Tibet" in Chinese. The three men and one woman gathered near the main Bird's Nest Stadium, where the Games open on Friday, and two of the men climbed electricity poles to unfurl the banners, China's official Xinhua news agency said. Tenzin Dorjee, deputy director of Students for a Free Tibet, said the protest was intended to dramatise complaints about Tibet days before the Games begin. "As the Chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in Beijing ... it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside Tibet," he said in the emailed statement. Police rushed to the scene after 12 minutes and took them away, the report said. Students for a Free Tibet said the protesters displayed the banners for nearly an hour. Xinhua said the four were all British nationals, but the group said they came from Britain and the United States. Separately, a small group of foreign reporters attended the screening of a new documentary about what Tibetans think of the Olympics, produced by a pro-Tibet group. Held in secrecy in a dingy Beijing hotel, the screening was not interrupted by security officials, though the organiser, Jean-Jacques Schwenzfeier, who would only describe himself as an "activist", said he was aware he could be deported. "It may happen, but there are worse things than being deported," he said. "It wasn't possible for Tibetans to participate like they wanted, so this was the minimum we could do, to show our presence." The Beijing Games torch relay was dogged by protests over Chinese rule in Tibet when it made its way through Paris, London and other cities earlier this year. On Wednesday, the torch began the final stage of its relay through Beijing under tight security. China has accused followers of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader, of stirring riots and protests in Tibetan regions in March in a bid to upstage Olympic preparations. The Dalai Lama has denied the claim and said he does not oppose the Games. But groups campaigning for an independent Tibet have said the Beijing Olympics should be an opportunity to voice criticism of Chinese policy. The Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule
