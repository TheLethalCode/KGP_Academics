 ANKARA, Mon Aug 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Land forces commander Ilker Basbug has been appointed head of Turkey's powerful armed forces, a hawkish general who is expected to avoid open confrontation with the Islamist-rooted governing AK Party. The General Staff said in a statement on Monday Basbug would take charge of NATO's second biggest army on August 30 from retiring general Yasar Buyukanit, who has often clashed openly with the government. The move comes as Turkey, a key US ally, hopes to put behind it a long power struggle between the powerful secularist establishment, including generals and judges, and the AK Party. "Unlike the often impulsive incumbent... Buyukanit, Basbug is known for his cool and calculating nature," said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at political risk think-tank Eurasia Group. "The result will be less likelihood of abrupt escalations in civil-military tension, but at the same time more effective political pressure from the military," he said. Turkey's highest court on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a chief prosecutor -- seen as backed by the secularists -- to shut down the AK Party but imposed financial penalties on it for anti-secular activities. The government has long been at odds with the secularist establishment over the role of religion in Turkey. Turkey, predominantly Muslim, has a secular constitution, and the military considers itself the ultimate guardian of the republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
