 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Election chief ATM Shamsul Huda sees no problem in holding parliamentary elections under the state of emergency, having witnessed what he has termed 'surprisingly' fair elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities under emergency. The chief election commissioner's observation came Monday, while talking to reporters at the Election Commission conference room. "I had earlier commented that a fair election is not possible under emergency, but I am surprised to see fair elections have taken place in such circumstances," Huda said. "After the way elections have been held in the four city corporations and nine municipalities, I do not see any problem in holding parliamentary elections in the same environment. We would want that proper environment for voting to prevail." "There may be ideological and psychological differences in opinion among different quarters regarding the state of emergency. However, practically speaking I do not see any problem," the CEC said. Huda pointed out that during his visit to different centres, none had complained about the state of emergency. "I have talked with many people. None complained about the emergency. The problem that exists is purely psychological." Asked whether any action would be taken against those accused of violating the election code of conduct, he said allegations had been raised against 21 people. The EC had issued notices against them and action would be taken after investigation, he added. According to EC officials, notices have been sent to 15 mayoral and six councillor candidates. "Action will be taken even if they win. If they lose, cases would be filed against them," said Huda. The election chief felt that this time, women and first-time voters would play an important role in determining the results of the election. He said that the turnout of women and first time voters was remarkable. "The political parties would have to think about the matter in future," he added. The CEC spoke frankly about the hindrance in voting due to confusion over voter slips and national ID cards, long queues for female voters and 'fake' votes. Admitting that voter slips had caused some hindrance in voting, he said: "The voters who came only with national ID cards had to face some hassles at the polling centres due to delay in collecting their registration numbers." "We will be more alert in this regard in future." He also conceded that women had waited in long queues to cast their ballots for to two main reasons. "It took more time to tally the six digit numbers and the women took more time in applying the seals to the ballot papers inside the booths." The CEC said that there was no scope to cast 'fake' votes. However, enquires would still be conducted into allegations, if any. bdnew
