 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  A midnight fire that spread through a house in Old Dhaka killed at least 10 people, including two children, firemen said early Monday. The blaze was spotted minutes past Sunday midnight in the house owned by the late Abu Bakar Siddique on Aga Sadek Road. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Ataur Rahman, duty officer at the Fire Service and Civil Defence headquarters, could only give details on the death count. Rahman could not explain how the fire originated. A bdnews24.com correspondent counted two children among the dead, but most bodies were charred beyond recognition. Shanto, son of Abu Bakar Siddique, was seen crying on the scene. He said his mother, brother and sister "went missing" after the blaze. Witnesses said the fire might have started in a ground-floor shop and spread through other floors of the five-storey building in the crowded neighbourhood. Local people blamed the loss of lives and property damage partly on the late arrival of firemen. bdn
