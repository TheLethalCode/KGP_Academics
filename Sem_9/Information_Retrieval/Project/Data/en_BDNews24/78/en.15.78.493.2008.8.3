 JOHANNESBURG, Sun Aug 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks between Zimbabwe's ruling party and opposition on ending the political crisis resumed on Sunday after adjourning early last week, South Africa's presidency said. Adding to tensions in Zimbabwe, which is also suffering economic collapse, police confirmed that a bomb had exploded on Saturday at the central police station in Harare. There were no casualties and no claim of responsibility. President Robert Mugabe's party began power-sharing talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in South Africa two weeks ago to try to resolve the crisis after Mugabe's unopposed re-election in a poll boycotted by the opposition. Talks adjourned last week so both teams of negotiators could consult their leaders. "The talks have begun," said Mukoni Ratshitanga, spokesman for South African President Thabo Mbeki, who is mediating. Although an initial deadline for the talks ends on Monday, Ratshitanga said that should not be taken literally because of the adjournment. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has said the deadline is flexible. Ratshitanga said the talks restarted at an undisclosed venue in South Africa. Previous meetings were held in Pretoria. Mugabe and Tsvangirai are under pressure from within Africa and the rest of the world to negotiate a national unity government to end a crisis that has ruined Zimbabwe's economy and flooded neighbouring states with millions of refugees. COLLAPSE In a sign of the economic collapse, the central bank redenominated the worthless currency to cut 10 zeroes from the Zimbabwe dollar in response to inflation which is officially estimated at 2.2 million percent a year -- the world's highest. The opposition says only Tsvangirai can lead a new government because he won a first-round presidential vote in March and pulled out of a June run-off vote because of violence he says killed 122 of his supporters. ZANU-PF has said it will not accept any deal that fails to recognise Mugabe's re-election. The parties also disagree over how long a national unity government should remain in power. The MDC wants new elections held as soon as possible while Mugabe, who has ruled since 1980, wants to carry on with his new five-year mandate. Zimbabwe police confirmed on Sunday that a bomb had exploded at Harare's central police station on Saturday evening. "The army bomb disposal unit summoned to the scene recovered the remains of a detonated explosives and one live explosive," senior police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said in a statement. Bombs are rare in Zimbabwe despite political upheaval in recent years, but last year the government accused opposition activists of throwing petrol bombs at some police stations though no one was ever convicted. No-one was hurt in Saturday's blast, Bvudzijena said. There was no claim of responsibility and police said they were investigating
