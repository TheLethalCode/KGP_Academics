 Dhaka, Aug 03 (bdnews24.com)--The 15th SAARC summit Sunday adopted its declaration with a call to cooperate in the "strongest possible" ways to fight terrorism and at the same time giving transit facilities to the landlocked countries of the region. The leaders of the 8-member regional grouping extended support to the proposed UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The heads of the states or governments also underlined the need for removing the trade bars like non-tariff barriers and reducing sensitive product lists, at the conclusion of the two-day summit in Colombo,. They urged member countries to review the list of sensitive products as per the decision of the SAFTA (South Asian Free Trade Area) Ministerial Council. The SAARC leaders welcomed Australia and Myanmar as the two new observers in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was set up in 1985 in Dhaka. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Chief Adviser Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed, Bhutanese Prime Minister Lyonchhen Jigmi Y Thinley, Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa approved the Colombo declaration. "[SAARC heads of states or governments] emphasised the need for strongest possible cooperation in the fight against terrorism and transnational organised crime amongst the relevant agencies of the member states especially in the area of information exchange," said the declaration. The Indian PM in his summit address termed terrorism as the "single biggest challenge" in the SAARC region. All of the leaders condemned terrorism in all forms and vowed to eliminate the menace through collaborative efforts. "They further recognised the growing linkages between the phenomenon of terrorism, illegal trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic substances, illegal trafficking of persons and firearms and underscored the need to address the problem in a comprehensive manner," the declaration said. SAARC leaders reiterated their commitment to strengthen the legal frameworks against terrorism, including undertaking to implement all international conventions relating to combating terrorism to which member states are parties. The SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and the Additional Protocol to the SAARC Regional Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism were two of the legal instruments to fight terrorism, it said. As one of measures for expanding trade in the SAARC region, the declaration "also recognised the importance of development of communication system and transport infrastructure and transit facilities especially for the landlocked countries to promote intra-SAARC trade." Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan are the three landlocked countries of SAARC. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has long been demanding transit facilities from India to boost trade with Bhutan and Nepal, while India has been demanding transit facilities from Bangladesh to reach its northeastern states separated by Bangladesh. The declaration recognised "the need to continue to address the major barriers hindering effective trade liberalisation in the region, which include sensitive lists of items and Non-Trade Barriers (NTBs). It directed that the decision to revise the sensitive lists by the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) be implemented early. SAARC leaders welcomed the decision of SAFTA Ministerial Council to commence negotiation on the Framework Agreement on Trade in Services. The declaration also recommended ways of cooperation in the fields of environment protection, energy security, connectivity, water resources, poverty alleviation, science and technology, tourism and education, including the launch of the South Asian University from the 2010 academic year. bdn
