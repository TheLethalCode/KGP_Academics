 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)  Former army chief Mustafizur Rahman was buried with state honours in the Banani armed forces graveyard following zohr prayers on Sunday. Namaz-e-janazas were held earlier, at the Central Mosque in the Dhaka Cantonment and Mohakhali DOHS. Mustafiz died from cancer in hospital on Sunday at the age of 67, survived by his wife and three daughters. Leaders of Awami League, BNP and colleagues, friends and family were present at the janazas. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed expressed deep condolence over the death of the veteran army chief. He prayed for the salvage of the bereaved soul and expressed sympathy for the family. His daughter Dr Shahnaz told bdnews24.com that her father had been suffering from pancreatic cancer and heart disease. He died at around 5.30am at the Dhaka Combined Military Hospital. The former army chief was one of the accused in a graft case involving the purchase of MiG-29 warplanes during Sheikh Hasina's premiership. He was arrested at Apollo Hospital on May 25. The High Court granted him bail on May 28 and he was exempted from court appearance to allow him to seek medical treatment in India. Mustafiz, born on January 20, 1941, had served as army chief from December 24, 1997 to December 23, 2000. The Awami League government appointed Lt Gen Mustafiz, an uncle of Sheikh Hasina, as army chief in 1997, just days before his scheduled retirement from the army. He was later controversially promoted to the rank of general from lieutenant general, during the AL regime, on the day he eventually retired from the service in December 2000. bdnews2.com/
