 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury called on SAARC ministers Thursday to remove all non-tariff barriers that impeded commerce and posed difficulties for the least developed countries of the region. He also urged SAARC leaders to tackle the major regional and global contemporary problems of food security, trade and climate change, addressing the first session of the SAARC ministerial meeting in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. The two-day Council of Ministers meet started Thursday, ahead of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Summit on Aug 2 and 3. "Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury issued a call to render SAARC more effective to enable it to tackle the major regional and global contemporary problems like food security, trade, energy and climate change," the foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday. "The foreign adviser stressed the need for a holistic approach to climate change and the need to adopt cooperative measures to reduce the impact of natural disasters," the statement said. The adviser also asked for the SAARC Food Bank, which has yet to be made operational, to start functioning at the earliest, the ministry said. Iftekhar described the South Asian Free Trade Area as a "vehicle of progress in trade and investment" and asked for the removal of all non-tariff barriers that impeded intra-SAARC commerce and posed difficulties for least developed member countries. On security, he underlined the need for a comprehensive regional strategy, pointing out that there are already bilateral contacts among the military and proposing a structure of collaboration within the SAARC umbrella of meetings and collaboration of senior military officers of the region, the statement said. Earlier, the chairmanship of the council was transferred from the Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, to the Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitatha Bogollagama. bdn
