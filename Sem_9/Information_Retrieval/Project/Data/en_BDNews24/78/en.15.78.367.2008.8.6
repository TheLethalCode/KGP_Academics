 ABOARD AIRFORCE ONE, Wed Aug 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it believed western powers would have to take further measures against Iran "that would be punitive" because Tehran gave no concrete reply to a demand that it freeze its nuclear activities. "In the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package, we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said aboard Air Force One. Perino, with U.S. President George W Bush who was flying from Seoul to Bangkok, said the major powers were to get together on a conference call on Iran's response. "I think that the Iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies, so I think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps before I get in front of them," Perino said. Iran on Tuesday delivered a letter to European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana in response to an offer in June by major powers that they would refrain from pursuing more UN penalties if Iran froze expansion of its nuclear work. Extracts of the one-page letter obtained by Reuters showed Iran gave no firm reply to the offer but instead promised a "clear response" at an unspecified date. Of the letter Perino said, "We don't have the decent and responsive statement from the Iranians." The major powers say they fear Tehran wants to build an atomic bomb. But Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, insists it is only seeking to master nuclear technology to generate electricity. On Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos warned of "additional measures" against Iran and said the United States would join a conference call with other senior officials from China, Russia, France, Germany and Britain on Wednesday when the major powers would decide how to proceed
