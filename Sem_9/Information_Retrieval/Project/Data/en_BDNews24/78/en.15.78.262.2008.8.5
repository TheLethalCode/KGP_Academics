 Portland, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small plane crashed into a vacation home on the Oregon coast on Monday, killing three children inside and two adults on board, officials said. Authorities had been searching for a third child in the smoldering wreckage of the house in the popular vacation town of Gearhart, according to City Administrator Dennis McNally. The Portland Oregonian newspaper reported late on Monday that the body had been found, according to authorities. McNally said he did not know the victims' ages. The bodies of the two adults in the single-engine plane had not been recovered, but an adult and two other children were hospitalized with injuries, he said. The plane crash in early morning fog was followed by an explosion that also severely damaged the house next door. The plane was rented from Aviation Adventures, a company in nearby Seaside Oregon.
