 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com) - Mayor hopefuls in four city corporations Monday expressed happiness over the atmosphere during the vote, but some of them said a few setbacks might affect the results. "Voting was going on peacefully. But ballot papers were very thin which might lead to the abandoning of many votes," Rajshahi mayor candidate Khairuzzaman Liton told bdnews24.com. BNP leader Mosaddek Hossain Bulbul, another mayor hopeful for Rajshahi city, echoed him. "Ink on one symbol may spread to other symbols when the ballot is folded," he said. Bulbul expressed happiness over the security measures, but alleged that security personnel obstructed his entry into three polling centres. Another mayoral candidate, Rezaun Nabi Dudu, said voting went slowly. In Barisal, Awami League-backed mayoral candidate Shawkat Hossain Hiron also raised the allegation of slow voting. PDP leader S Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu, who is running for Barisal mayor, said Hiron's supporters obstructed his supporters from going to polling centres. Another candidate Ebaidul Haque Chan, a BNP leader, said many voters could not vote despite having voter identity cards as their names were not on the voter list. Enayet Peer Khan, a candidate backed by Nagorik Committee, said some candidates were running to polling centres wearing badges although it was forbidden. AKM Mamunur Rashid, deputy director of Rab-8, told bdnews24.com that security personnel arrested 12 people on charge of influencing voters at Shishu Paribar Biddalay in Alekanda, Government School for Blind, Baptist Mission High School and Udayan Secondary School. Khulna mayor hopefuls expressed happiness over voting. M Firoz Ahmed, leader of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, alleged some candidates paid money to voters in return for vote. A spokesman for Sylhet mayor candidate Badar Uddin Ahmad Kamran told bdnews24.com that poor people faced harassment at some polling centres. Nagorik Committee candidate AFM Kamal said people were voting spontaneously. "The overall situation looks good." Nagorik Jote candidate MA Haque, former president of BNP Sylhet district unit, said many people could not vote as their names were on the voter list. bdnews24
