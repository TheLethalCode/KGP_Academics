 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain said Tuesday that the party's official boycott of the local government elections was the right decision. "This election could have no impact on the people. It was the dress rehearsal of a stage-managed election under the state of emergency," he said. He said the election results proved that the party position on 'the staged election' was correct. Speaking at a meeting at the Institution of Engineers, Delwar slammed the Election Commission and the advisers who expressed satisfaction over a 'peaceful election'. "This is not real peace; this is the peace of the grave," the BNP secretary general said. "The government has held the election unconstitutionally and through an alliance. The election did not at all reflect the people's aspirations." He reiterated his stance on the holding of local government polls before parliamentary election as "unconstitutional and illegal". "The government wants to hold the parliamentary election under the state of emergency to produce a 'rubberstamp parliament'." Delwar also alleged that the caretaker government was working as a 'puppet' of foreign forces. Tuesday's meeting was organised by the BNP to press party demands over Khaleda Zia's release, sending Tarique Rahman abroad for treatment, holding Jatiya Sangsad elections, withdrawing the state of emergency and lowering price of essentials. The Khaleda-appointed secretary general demanded: "Release Khaleda Zia. We want to go to dialogue and election under her leadership." BNP standing committee member Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui urged the secretary general to expel those local BNP leaders who participated in the local government elections violating the party decision. BNP vice president Prof Sarwari Rahman, MK Anwar, joint secretary general Selima Rahman, central leaders and front organisation leaders were also present. bdne
