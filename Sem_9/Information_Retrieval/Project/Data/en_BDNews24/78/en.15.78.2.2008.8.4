<TITLE> Mashrafee returns to bowling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza returned Monday to his bowling action at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium after a week's absence following his knee injury. Mashrafee, on July 28, complained of acute pain in his left knee. He had already experienced a number of surgeries on the knee. On receiving his complaint, the Bangladesh Cricket Board sent Mashrafee to the Apollo Hospital for an MRI, which suggested there was no reason to be worried. "It seems he is getting better as he bowled well in nets and felt no pain today (Monday). He shortened his run-up as a precautionary measure," chief selector Rafiqul Alam told bdnews24.com. The chief selector, however, said that they would wait for Mashrafee's fitness test before deciding on a team for this month's Australian tour. "We don't want to take any risks and we will wait until he goes for a fitness test," said Alam. Bangladesh will play three one-day internationals against Australia, scheduled for August 31 to September 6, in Darwin. They are also scheduled to play two one-day warm-up games in Australia. Members of the Bangladesh "A" Team, who return home Tuesday from England, and middle-order batsman Alok Kapali will also have to go through the fitness test. Kapali sustained a toe injury during the practice, but the chief selector said his injury was not serious. The chief selector also said that a 15-member squad for the Australia tour would be declared by August 10. bdne
