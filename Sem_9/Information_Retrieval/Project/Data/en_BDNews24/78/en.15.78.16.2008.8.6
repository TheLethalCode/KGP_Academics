 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com) The High Court on Tuesday granted four months' bail to corruption convict former Awami League minister Mohammad Nasim in another case involving accumulation of illegal assets. An HC bench of Justice Md Mozammel Hossain and Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haque granted Nasim bail on a petition. A special court set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises sentenced Nasim on Oct 8, 2007 to 13 years in jail for having wealth beyond his known sources of income. Barrister Amir Ul Islam, Nasim's chief of counsels, told reporters after the verdict that Nasim had no other case against him pending trial. Another lawyer Enayetur Rahman, however, said the AL leader had another case filed against him under the Emergency Powers Rules. Earlier, the HC granted Nasim six months' interim bail in a case that charges him with besieging the Prime Minister's Office. Nasim was arrested on February 4, 2007 under the EPR. He filed a bail petition with the High Court on July 28 in a case filed against him on charges of amassing wealth illegally. The HC ordered for Nasim's medical reports on July 30 and the inspector general (prisons) and private hospital LabAid submitted the said reports to the court on Tuesday. Barrister Islam and advocate Rahim took part in the hearing on Wednesday on behalf of the AL leader and submitted to the court that since their client was seriously ill and that his illness might deteriorate further unless treated abroad, he had applied for bail. They further submitted that even a convicted person might be bailed out in case s/he was seriously ill. The Supreme Court clarified the point in its verdict of Sigma Huda and Mir Helaluddin cases, they said. The AntiCorruption Commission filed the graft case against Nasim on March 21, 2007 with Dhanmandi Police Station on charges of amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 1.26 crore. Nasim had filed an appeal in April challenging the lower court verdict, when the court accepted the appeal for hearing. On behalf of the ACC, Khan Saifur Rahman opposed the bail move and the government side was represented by assistant attorney general Runa Shahrin. The former minister was arrested on Feb 4, 2007, under the Emergency Powers Rules. bdnews24.com/
