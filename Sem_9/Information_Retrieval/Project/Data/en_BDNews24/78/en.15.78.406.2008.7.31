 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Continued sell-offs and price adjustment of UCBL shares led indices on the Dhaka Stock Exchange to finish lower on the closing day of the week. A decline in the prices of more than 70 percent traded scrips caused the prime bourse to fall for a fourth day. The benchmark DGEN or general index was marked by a downward curve across the day to close 40.38 points or 1.44 percent lower at 2761.04. The DSI or all-share price index fell 57.04 points or 2.35 percent to 2426.07. The blue-chip DSE-20 closed at 2526.23, declining 32.63 points or 1.27 percent. All indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange closed mixed, due to losses in blue-chips, mutual funds and non-bank financial institutions. Huge gains in bank shares led the all-share index to edge up. The CSCX or selective categories index lost 60.76 points or 1.08 percent to close on 5517.53. The CASPI or all-share price index closed at 8593.53, up 9.80 points or 0.11 percent. The bourse's blue-chip CSE-30 slumped 81.12 points, or 1.04 percent, to end on 7693.30. Sell-offs dominated the day's trading with some discreet issues going up, an official with brokerage house Lanka Bangla Securities told bdnews24.com. Turnover on the DSE reached Tk 2.69 billion, with 17,817,440 shares changing hands, down from Tk 3.11 billion the previous day. Decliners beat advancers 165 to 52, with 10 issues holding steady. Turnover from 4,007,035 traded shares on the port city bourse slumped to Tk 393.54 million from Wednesday's Tk 530.81 million. Of the 140 traded issues, 112 lost, 24 gained and four remained unchanged. Market participators said the trend was alarming. "It seems retail investors are pulling back from the market," investment consultant Bashir Ahmed said. Shares sold by the institutional investors also affected the market in the last three days, added Bashir who is with brokerage firm Stocks & Bonds. A top official of a brokerage firm said the lower trade volume and turnover indicates that participation is going down. "The last couple of days saw increased volume and turnover as institutional investors were busy to lock in profits," the official told bdnews24.com, preferring anonymity. Turnover leader Beximco lost 3.26 percent to finish at Tk 139.10 following Wednesday's gains. Second in line, Beximco Pharmaceuticals continued to lose, falling 4.73 percent at Tk 102.50. ACI gained 3.27 percent to Tk 507.70. Price adjustment led UCBL to end on Tk 3242.25, down 50.66 percent. Keya Cosmetics eroded the previous day's gains to decline 3.11 percent to Tk 93.20. Among the other scrips on the turnover boardSquare Pharmaceuticals, Square Textiles, Lanka Bangla Finance and Grameen Mutual Fund One slipped on profit-taking.
