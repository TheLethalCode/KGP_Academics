 Barisal, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  Local PDP leader S Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu, who lost the Barisal mayoral race to Awami League-backed candidate Shawkat Hossain Hiron, filed a general diary Wednesday against returning officer Monirul Islam for not providing him a copy of the election results. Santu alleged that he sought a copy of the centre-wise results on Aug 5, the day after the polls, but he did not receive it. Nor were his polling agents able to obtain results from every polling centre, he added. Assistant police commissioner Hayatul Islam of Kotwali Model Police Station said that a copy of the GD would be sent to the office of the deputy election commissioner. Returning officer Monirul Islam said that the defeated candidate had not followed the rules of application. A copy of the election result had been prepared for him, but he did not contact the office of the deputy election commissioner, Islam said. bdnews
