 NEW DELHI, Aug 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 68 people were killed and 47 injured in a stampede at a temple in Himachal Pradesh on Sunday, police said. Iron railings leading to the Hindu temple in Bilaspur district broke, causing panic, senior police officer K.K. Indoria said, adding: "We think around 68 people have died." Thousands of worshippers gather at the temple every year to pray to a Hindu goddess during an annual festival. On Sunday, more than 3,000 people were trying to enter the temple premises at the same time when part of the railing broke, leading to panic, officials said. Most of the worshippers were from neighbouring Punjab, they said. Children were among those who fell to the ground and were trampled by pilgrims running to safety, officials said. Television pictures showed people being carried on stretchers to a hospital, many writhing in pain. "There were a lot of people inside and we were trying to fight for space when everyone started falling over," one female worshipper, Bimala, told television reporters. Stampedes at temples are not uncommon in India where thousands of people gather to pray during festivals. In 2005, about 265 pilgrims were killed in a stampede near a temple in Maharashtra.
