 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP-led four-party alliance Sunday demanded that May 30, the day former president Ziaur Rahman was assassinated, be declared as national mourning day. The demand was made at a meeting of the alliance at Khandaker Delwar Hossain's NAM Flat residence. "We do not have any objection to Awami League observing August 15. Both the days can be observed as national mourning days as both Ziaur Rahman and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman are treated as national leaders," BNP secretary general Delwar told reporters after the meeting. The alliance leaders also demanded a government holiday be restored on Nov 30 as national revolution and solidarity day. In Sunday's meeting, the alliance leaders also took a decision to hold a rally on Aug 10 to press their demands for the release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and overseas treatment for Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman. "We demand release of our leader for a meaningful dialogue. Our leader must be present at the dialogue with the government," Delwar said. The party leader reiterated that the four-party alliance would not participate in local government polls. "Neither the BNP nor the alliance has backed any candidate for the local body polls," Delwar pointed out. The former chief whip said the caretaker government's job was to hold the national polls, not the local government polls. He said the caretaker government wanted to create a group of its own through such 'unconstitutional' polls. Polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities will be held on Monday. bdnews
