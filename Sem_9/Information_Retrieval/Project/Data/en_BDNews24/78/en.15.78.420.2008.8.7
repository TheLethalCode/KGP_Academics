 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday that the national elections would be held amid the state of emergency. His remarks came a day after the European Union had said in a meeting with acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman that it would not send observers if the national elections were held amid the state of emergency. "The elections will be held amid emergency and it is expected that the EU will change its stance in this regard," the adviser told reporters at the Secretariat. "The government is lobbying the EU and we hope everything will be all right eventually," he said. Mentioning the recent city and municipal polls, Iqbal said: "The elections were held nicely amid emergency. All political parties accepted the polls results." Asked again if the national elections must be held under emergency, Iqbal said: "During the Aug 4 elections, none of the candidates complained of any trouble with the state of emergency." He continued: "When we held dialogues with the political parties, we asked them if they had any problems anywhere, when they said there's none." "The polls will certainly take place amid emergency, which will be relaxed, as required." bdnews24
