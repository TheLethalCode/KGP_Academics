 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said Monday the elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities yielded a better outcome than expected. Speaking to bdnews24.com at the main election office in Dhaka, Sohul said: "We have got a better result in this election than expected." The elections to the city corporations and municipalities played out in an environment of new laws and rules, new voter lists and many new officials, the commissioner said. "Although the state of emergency has not been completely withdrawn, there has been no difficulty in voting." "The reforms we made worked out. This success will help us take more dynamic and effective steps in future," he said. Asked whether the next elections will be held with the state of emergency still in force, Sohul said: "The government will look into the matter." "An environment must be created so that there is no obstacle to electoral publicity and voting." Replying to a question, the election commissioner said: "We did not receive any complaint from any area of any problem to be created by the state of emergency." bdnews
