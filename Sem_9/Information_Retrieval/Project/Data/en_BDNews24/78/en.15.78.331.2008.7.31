 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Wanderers Club and Bangladesh Navy brightened their hopes of moving into the finals of the Citycell Federation Cup after winning their respective qualifying matches Thursday. Dhaka Wanderers Club handed a 2-0 defeat to Victoria Sporting Club at Shaheed Barkat Stadium in Gazipur while a second-half strike from Sikon helped Bangladesh Navy edge Bangladesh Air Force 1-0 at Army Stadium in Banani. With their first triumph, both Wanderers and Bangladesh Navy jointly topped Group B point table with four points each from two outings as they played a goalless draw among them on Monday. Victoria Sporting Club, who made a flying start thrashing Bangladesh Air Force 4-1, stuck to their previous three points. Dhaka Wanderers face Bangladesh Air Force Friday. After the barren first half, Sikon scored the all-important goal in the 79th minute for Navy, who will face Victoria Sporting Club Saturday in their last match. Away at Gazipur, Dhaka Wanderers went ahead in the very third minute with a Saidul strike before Idris Modarika sealed the match scoring team's second goal in the 40th minute.
