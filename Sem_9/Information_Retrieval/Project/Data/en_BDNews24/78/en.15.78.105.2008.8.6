In a joint statement, they urged "all our supporters and members and any organs and structures under the direction and control of our respective parties to stop and desist the perpetration of violence in any form". ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) began power-sharing talks following President Robert Mugabe's re-election in a widely condemned June poll boycotted by the opposition. The appeal to stop political bloodshed came as a South African newspaper reported a draft agreement was being circulated aimed at ending Zimbabwe's political stalemate, which sparked much of the violence. Under the plan, Zimbabwe's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai would run the country while Mugabe would become ceremonial president. The two sides are under heavy international pressure, including from within Africa, to resolve a crisis that has ruined the once prosperous economy and flooded neighboring states with millions of refugees. "The Parties express their readiness to work individually and together in the ongoing dialogue to make public undertakings in ensuring the safety of any displaced persons and their safe return home," said the joint statement. It also vowed to enable humanitarian and social welfare organizations to assist Zimbabweans, who are suffering from an economic meltdown
