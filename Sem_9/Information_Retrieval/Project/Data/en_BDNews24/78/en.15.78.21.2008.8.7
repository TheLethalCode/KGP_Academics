<TITLE> Showdown with Musharraf looms for Pakistan coalition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of Pakistan's civilian coalition consulted into the early hours of Thursday morning on whether to strip President Pervez Musharraf, a key US ally, of his powers and possibly impeach him. Such a move would almost certainly plunge the nuclear-armed Muslim nation into a new bout of political instability unless the former army chief, who came to power in a coup nine years ago, decided to go quietly. Musharraf was due to go to China on Thursday to attend opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics and meet the Chinese leadership, having already put off his departure by a day because of the uncertainty hanging over him. He lost parliamentary support after an election last February that resulted in a civilian coalition government led by the party of the late Benazir Bhutto, a two-time prime minister who was assassinated while campaigning last December. Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and head of the ruling alliance, met with Nawaz Sharif, leader of the second largest party, to resolve differences over the issues of Musharraf's impeachment and the restoration of Supreme Court judges who were dismissed by Musharraf last November during a period of emergency rule. Zardari has sought to avoid any confrontation with Musharraf. Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf overthrew, wants him impeached or tried for treason. He pulled his party's ministers out of the cabinet in May after Zardari backtracked on a commitment to restore the judges. After a first round of talks with Sharif on Tuesday a spokesman for Zardari's Pakistan People's Party told reporters the pair had reached a consensus, prompting media reports that that they had opted to go for impeachment. Wednesday's talks spilled over into Thursday morning but the outcome remained uncertain. "There has been some interruption over the judges' issue but we hope to overcome it tomorrow," Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for Sharif's party, told reporters after the marathon session. The United States would be reluctant to see him impeached. Aside from any residual loyalty to Musharraf for his support in the war on terrorism, a constitutional crisis could distract Pakistan from the fight against an al Qaeda network that has regrouped in tribal areas close to the Afghan border. ARMY RESPONSE Musharraf has previously said he would resign rather than face impeachment proceedings but Pakistani political circles are awash with speculation that he could dismiss parliament, even though he has said he would not. "He has not only clung to power but has continued to hatch conspiracies against a democratic system with the support of PML-Q," Iqbal said, referring to the pro-Musharraf party. How the army responds to the prospect of a humiliating exit for its former chief will be crucial. Last November, Musharraf passed command of the army to General Ashfaq Kayani, who had previously headed the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. Kayani has tried to withdraw the army from politics but he maintained close ties with the president, who has otherwise become overwhelmingly unpopular. People's confidence in the civilian government is already rapidly draining due to multiple crises. Pakistan is suffering inflation at a three-decade high, frequent power cuts, food and fuel shortages, and rising militancy across the northwest. The uncertainty has taken a toll on Pakistani markets, with the main share index at its weakest in nearly 23 months and the rupee headed back towards all-time lows posted in early July.
