<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  A former BNP lawmaker has challenged the Election Commission's gazette on the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies. Abdul Mannan, former MP from Dhaka-2 constituency, filed a writ petition before the High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Masuk Hossain Ahmed on Wednesday. The court is set to hear the petition on Thursday, said lawyer of the petitioner barrister Nasimuddin Ashim. The Chief Election Commissioner, two election commissioners, the EC secretary and the principal secretary to the chief adviser have been made respondents. The petition argued that though parliamentary constituencies could be redrawn prior to the preparation of voter lists according to laws, the gazette relating to the demarcation of constituencies was published after 99 percent voters had been registered. It was therefore illegal and unconstitutional, the petition said. The function of the Election Commission was to hold the election within 90 days, not to delimit constituencies, claimed the petitioner. On May 12, the HC on another writ filed by Abdul Mannan issued a rule nisi on the EC and the government asking them to explain why the delimitation of 133 constituencies should not be declared illegal. The EC published a gazette on the delimitation of 133 constituencies on April 29. bdnews2
