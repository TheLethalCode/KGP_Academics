<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Wednesday that the government was making progress towards holding political dialogue with BNP. "The government is continuing its contact with BNP. It has also taken additional steps in this regard," the adviser told reporters after a meeting with communications adviser Ghulam Quader at the Secretariat. "We hope for a result soon. But the whole process does not depend on us, [BNP] also has responsibilities to this end," he said. Zillur said that he and Quader had discussed holding dialogues with the two parties that have yet to join the process. Quader made no comment about the meeting. The two advisers also discussed plans to hold dialogues with representatives of workers women, and youth, Zillur said. Saying that the government had reached a milestone by holding elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities, he added: "There are some more milestones awaiting us." "We (advisers) are holding meetings everyday to ensure success. We want to ensure the participation of all parties in the national elections," the adviser said. "We are working to overcome the political crisis. But we have to stimulate economic activities as well." "The advisory council will hold a meeting on August 13 in Chittagong to take decisions on fortifying the economy," he said. Zillur rejected any idea of a 'stalemate' over the release of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia. "The government has given instructions to release her, along the lines of Sheikh Hasina's release." "But there are some problems that need to be further resolved through discussion," the adviser said. bdnew
