<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  Those who get clemency from the Truth and Accountability Commission (TAC) cannot run for elections in next five years, chairman Habibur Rahman Khan announced Sunday. At the first press conference of the commission at its Hare Road office, Khan said those people cannot hold a post of any political party, business organisation or any other organisation, either. People who want to disclose information voluntarily about the crimes they have committed will have to apply to the commission by Sept 1, the chairman said. Khan said only those who had not yet been charged with corruption by the national coordination committee or the Anticorruption Commission could seek clemency from the commission. He said the main goal of the commission was to encourage people to voluntarily disclose information about corruption and to establish a corruption-free society. "In addition to these, the commission will work to save time, energy and resources for advancement of the economy through relieving the burden of trial process and checking crime," he said. Asked if the names of those who will approach the commission will be published, he said such a measure would discourage people to approach the commission. Khan, however, said he would recommend to the government to publish the names. "It is up to the government whether the names will be published or not," he added. The chairman said, "We will continue our utmost effort. We hope we will get positive result." The government appointed Khan to the Truth and Accountability Commission as chairman on Wednesday. Retired major general Manzur Rashid Khan and former comptroller and auditor general Asif Ali were appointed members to the commission on the same day. The interim cabinet on May 25 approved the Right to Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance 2008, paving the way for forming the three-member commission. The ordinance stipulates that the truth commission will run for five months with three members appointed by the president. According to the ordinance provision anybody already convicted of graft, with a sentence of two years or less, will get the scope of leniency if he confesses and returns any illegal earnings within a given timeframe. But the people convicted of arms, drugs, child trafficking and rape cases will not get clemency. The government has appointed 26 officials and staffers on deputation to the commission and established its office on Minto Road. bdnews24
