 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)A High Court ruling on Thursday lifted restrictions on political parties and their nominees taking part in local government polls. Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Md Abu Tarique gave the ruling on a writ petition filed by advocate Jasimuddin Sarker. The ruling means candidates can now run in previously 'non-political' local body elections along political party lines. The court also cancelled rule No. 3 in the electoral code of conduct for local government polls, which banned using names and symbols of political parties, and politicians during an election campaign. "The ordinance does not prescribe that people have to quit politics for signing up for local government polls. It says one will have to quit politics, if elected," the court said. The HC said rule No. 3 was laid out in violation of the local government polls ordinance. "It was illegal." Election Commissioner lawyer Shahdeen Malik told bdnews24.com that the HC ruling would not stop the Aug 4 polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities. "The writ petition was filed seeking an order to declare the polls without a final voter list illegal. But it was proved in court that final voter lists were ready in the electoral areas," the lawyer said. The petitioner's lawyer Tajul Islam expressed unhappiness over the verdict. "We will appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling." Petitioner Jasimuddin Sarker was not completely happy and said: "I filed the writ petition challenging the announcement of election schedule without a final voter list. It was a partial victory. I will appeal against the verdict." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said the EC would abide by the HC ruling. Huda said the commission would recommend necessary reforms for the local government ministry to take up to make the local government polls non-political. "We will do what law says," Huda told reporters in his office in his reaction to the verdict. Asked if the EC would appeal against the court ruling, the CEC said: "I did not think about it." bdnew
