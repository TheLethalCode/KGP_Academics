 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Tuesday ordered the disclosure of the source of a report published in the Bangla-language weekly 'Shirshakagoj', headlined "One judge whitens black money." A High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Abu Tariq directed editor Ekramul Huq and reporter Nasrin Akhter to disclose the source of the report. Shirshakagoj in its Jan 7 issue published the special report alleging that a senior judge of the High Court took full advantage of the NBR's offer to declare previously undisclosed income. On Jan 10, following the publication of the report, the High Court issued a contempt of court rule on 18 people including Shirshakagoj editor Ekramul and reporter Nasrin. Following Tuesday's hearing, the editor and reporter were asked to disclose the source of the report by next Monday in the form of an affidavit. bdnew
