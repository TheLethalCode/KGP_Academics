<TITLE> S.Africa's Smith labels match-winning century his best </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BIRMINGHAM, England, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa skipper Graeme Smith said his match-winning innings of 154 not out that steered his team to their first series win in England for 43 years on Saturday was the best of his 16 test hundreds. "This victory is bigger than just us, so therefore I would have to say that it is my best," said Smith, whose side followed the Proteas teams who lost in England in 1994, 1998 and 2003. England went down in fading light as South Africa successfully chased 281 to win by five wickets and subject the hosts to their second home series loss in their last three. Smith's innings of almost six hours, made after he took pain-killing tablets for a back injury, guided his tam through a tense period when they slumped from 65 for none to 93 for four. "I've got some really meaningful innings in my life, like the double hundreds here at this ground and at Lord's in 2003 -- they have got to go down as some of my greatest achievements. "But so many (South Africa) teams have come here since readmission and strived for victories so there are so many people back home who I'd like to have shared this with tonight." He added: "We got off to such a good start at 65 for none and I thought a couple of more partnerships and we are there and all of a sudden after a couple of good deliveries and some sightscreen issues we were 93 for four. "Then I just started focusing on taking my innings by ten runs at a time. I thought, 'If I can get half of that target who knows what can happen?'" SPECIAL INNINGS England skipper Michael Vaughan preferred to pay tribute to Smith's "special innings" than apportion blame to his players. "It's a real bitter blow because when we had that partnership in the morning between Paul Collingwood and Ryan Sidebottom and set them 280 I would have put us to win because I knew the wicket was wearing," he told reporters. "We've just witnessed a very special innings by Graeme Smith under that kind of pressure. We had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon when I thought we'd blow them away but Graeme Smith and South Africa, over the last three matches, have been better than us." There is now sure to be an inquest in the England camp and the squad for the fourth Test at The Oval may indicate where the selectors wish to go for the all-important series in 2009. Vaughan said his form has not been good enough after scoring 40 runs in five innings in the series at an average of eight -- the second-lowest of England players ahead of Monty Panesar. With Vaughan as captain, England have not won a test against the three high-ranking test nations they have played -- India, Sri Lanka and South Africa -- since he returned from injury. "I have no doubts about my captaincy abilities," Vaughan said. "(But) I'm not scoring runs. As a number three batsman I have to score runs. I set myself a lot of high standards and in this series I haven't got anywhere near those standards
