<TITLE> JP will contest upazila polls: Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad announced Friday that his party would take part in upazila elections, in the light of a recent High Court ruling that lifted restrictions on political parties participating directly in local body polls. "The High Court ruled Thursday that political candidates can contest in local polls along party lines," the former president told JP leaders and supporters at his Rangpur home. "Accordingly, Jatiya Party will directly nominate candidates to run in the upazila polls under the party banner," he said. Asked to clarify JP's stance with respect to the Awami League-led alliance, Ershad said: "Of course we will go to the parliamentary election as part of the grand alliance." bdnews24
