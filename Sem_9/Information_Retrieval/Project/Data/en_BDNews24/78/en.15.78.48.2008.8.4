 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)Early reports on Monday from polling centres in Barisal, Khulna and Sylhet highlighted confusion among voters and election officials over voter registration slips, though candidates voiced satisfaction with the election atmosphere. bdnews24.com correspondents said the confusion arose, as election agents are turning voters away who have brought ID cards but did not bring their registration slips or pick up voter their registration numbers at the polling centres on arrival. A Khulna city presiding officer told bdnews24.com there should be no such confusion, but added: "Some polling agents may not be very well trained, so such mix-ups may be arising." bdnews24.com's correspondent in Khulna caught up with Awami League-backed mayoral candidate Talukder Abdul Khaleque as he cast his vote, to ask how the election was proceeding. "Polling seems to be going very well so far," said Talukdar. "The election atmosphere is good." Md Moniruzzaman Muni, known locally as 'the BNP candidate', was also impressed. "The election is going very well under EPR." When pressed further about elections being held under a state of emergency, however, Muni replied: "It is not an ideal situation. The emergency of course should be lifted." Voting began in four city corporations and nine municipalities from 8am Monday, to continue uninterrupted to 4pm, in the first set of polls of the Election Commission under the present caretaker government and the ongoing state of emergency. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com Sunday: "I hope good elections will be held, with voters being able to cast their ballots without any hazard in a peaceful atmosphere."
