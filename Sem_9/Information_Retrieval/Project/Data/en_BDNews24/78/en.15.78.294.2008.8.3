 Dhaka, Aug 03 (bdnews24.com)--Kuwait has ordered its law enforcers not to arrest or harass any Bangladeshi workers if they refrain from getting involved in any further violence, according to a government statement Sunday. The labour department of Kuwait has assured the Bangladesh mission in Kuwait City that wages and other outstanding payments of the deported workers will be sent through the Bangladesh embassy, said a handout issued by the Press Information Department. The belongings of the workers will also be returned through the Bangladesh mission. The statement said Kuwaiti police arrested a total of 850 Bangladeshis for staging demonstrations demanding pay hikes and better working conditions, of whom 400 have already been released. Bangladeshi workers have ceased their strike and returned to work, it added. Foreign workers from Bangladesh and other South Asian countries took to the streets just over a week ago finding no alternative to surviving in the Sheikhdom in the face of raising food prices. Media reports in the Gulf state said Kuwaiti employers in some cases paid as little as Tk 2000 per month (8 Kuwiati dinars or US $30). At least 50 more Bangladeshis were forcefully sent back to Dhaka from Kuwait on Sunday, according to the immigration desk of Zia International Airport. With Sunday's deportation, the total number of Bangladeshis sent back from Kuwait stands at 363. Kuwaiti authorities said they studied video images and photographs to detect those workers who either attacked police or damaged property during the demonstrations, before deporting them. But deported workers returning to Dhaka have alleged that Kuwaiti law enforcers were making wholesale arrests of Bangladeshis and sending them back with nothing but clothes they were wearing. The also claimed they were harassed and ill-traeted at the deportation centres without food and water before being packed onto Dhaka bound planes. There are about 150, 000 Bangaldeshi workers, mostly employed as cleaners, sweepers and in other unskilled jobs, in Kuwait. They remit about $ 1 billion every year. bdn
