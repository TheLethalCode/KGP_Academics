 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's top order produced a solid performance to reach 200 for four at stumps on day three, extending their first innings lead to 237 in the second test against Sri Lanka on Saturday. When bad light stopped play both Saurav Ganguly and VVS Laxman were yet to get off the mark after Sri Lanka grabbed two late wickets. Earlier, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh had claimed six for 102 to bowl out the hosts for 292 in the first session. Leg spinner Anil Kumble got three vital wickets during the morning, including the prize scalp of Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, to finish with three for 81. India had started their second innings positively with Virender Sehwag following his undefeated 201 in the first innings with a brisk 50 from 52 balls in the second innings. Sehwag added 90 with Gautam Gambhir before left-armer Chaminda Vaas forced Sehwag into a false stroke, the right-hander driving to short cover where Tillakaratne Dilshan took a fine high catch. Gambhir and Rahul Dravid (44) then compiled a further 54 runs before Ajantha Mendis produced a sharp-spinning delivery that pitched outside Gambhir's leg stump and hit the top of middle stump as the left-armer shouldered arms. Gambhir had scored 74 from 149 balls with 10 boundaries, his second fifty of the game. Dravid and Tendulkar added 56 for the third wicket before Sri Lanka struck too late blows to give them some hope. First, Tendulkar edged a leg-cutter from Vaas to slip and then Dravid, after a third umpire review, was adjudged lbw to Muttiah Muralitharan. Sri Lanka, resuming the day on 214 for six, added 78 runs in the two-and-a-half hour session and looked set to survive until lunch but a sudden rush of wickets just before the interval led to their collapse. MAIN RESISTANCE Jayawardene provided the main resistance with a patient and skilful 86 from 188 balls with 10 fours. Sri Lanka started the day well with Prasanna Jayawardene (24) helping his captain add 58 runs for the sixth wicket during a tense first hour of play. India nearly broke through in the first over of the day, bowled by Kumble as a catch from Prasanna Jayawardene dropped just short of Dravid at slip. Harbhajan, however, made sure when he found Prasanna Jayawardene's inside edge and VVS Laxman took the simplest of catches at leg slip. Minutes later, Chaminda Vaas (one) misread a Kumble googly and was caught off a leading edge. India switched on to the defensive against Jayawardene, setting deep-set fields to get him off strike and bowling a leg stump line. However, Jayawardene refused to take risks, preferring instead to shield Nuwan Kulasekara from the strike and pick up his runs in singles with the odd boundary. The pair frustrated India with a 36-run stand, edging Sri Lanka closer to India's 329 first innings total. But just before lunch, Jayawardene edged a Kumble leg break and was well caught by wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik. Ajantha Mendis was trapped lbw in the same over and Muttiah Muralitharan was caught in the deep trying to loft a six
