 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  ATM Shamsul Huda said Tuesday the Election Commission was "very happy" with the success of the city corporations and municipalities. "We are very happy and assured that we could hold the elections properly and in an acceptable manner," the chief election commissioner told reporters at his Election Commission secretariat office. "Everybody's cooperation contributed to this success. The way we are advancing, I hope we will be able to hold the next elections properly as well," Huda said. He did voice concern, however, that this time the Election Commission's efforts to ensure the participation of honest and efficient candidates was not that successful. "Our aspiration was that the participation of honest and deserving candidates in the polls would increase. It did not happen completely this time. Local people and political parties will have to come forward for this to happen." Huda observed: "The past leaders have competed in the elections. People have elected whomever they thought fit from among them." "I hope in future newer and younger candidates will also come forward." As it was the first election under the reconstituted Election Commission and first election using a voter list with photographs there were minor mistakes, conceded the CEC. "In the smaller municipalities, up to 95 percent of voters went to the polls. Overall about 80 percent of voters turned out. People's participation in the elections was spontaneous. I have not received any complaints yet since the elections." On news of some voters returning without being able to cast their ballots due to mix-ups, the CEC apologised, saying: "All the experiences we gathered from these elections will help us in the future." "We have identified some issues. We will sit with the reports of the local and foreign observers and also with the issues we ourselves have identified." "Then we will formulate our next plan of action." The CEC said as the elections were held in a peaceful atmosphere and in an organised manner, there was no scope for any complaint against the results announced. But, he added, in Barisal there could be complaints from competing candidates as the competition was neck and neck. bdnews
