 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday concluded hearing charges in a graft case, involving the controversial purchase of MiG-29 warplanes, against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others during her administration. Dhaka divisional special judge Golam Mortuza set Aug 12 to decide whether charges would be framed against the accused. The court earlier heard pleas by two of the accused in the caseUnique Group owner Nur Ali and former joint secretary to the defence ministry Md Hossain Serniabat to be cleared of charges. Lawyers of the two accused said that the case was filed with an ulterior motive and their clients did not have any ties to the alleged losses to the state caused by the purchase of the warplanes. The prosecution argued that they had adequate evidence to prove the allegations brought against the accused. If charges were framed, the allegations could be proved, prosecution lawyers said. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the graft case in 2001 accusing seven people of graft in the purchase of eight MiG-29 warplanes. Charges were pressed against Hasina and others in 2003.. bdnew
