 Hanoi, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US citizen of Vietnamese origin, wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges he sexually abused his daughter, has been arrested and deported from Vietnam after being in hiding for more than three years. The FBI notified Vietnamese police in March that Dang Van Viet, 44, from Waldorf, Maryland was wanted for allegedly sexually abusing his daughter for nearly 10 years, the Public Security Ministry-run People's Police newspaper reported on Saturday. Tracking Viet's record, police investigators found that he returned to Vietnam in January 2005 and lived in Ho Chi Minh City before buying a house in Can Tho city in the Mekong Delta, the paper said. Last year Viet opened a company to provide Internet services and online games in Can Tho, where he was detected and arrested. Viet was handed over to the FBI and deported via Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat Airport on Friday, the newspaper said. bd
