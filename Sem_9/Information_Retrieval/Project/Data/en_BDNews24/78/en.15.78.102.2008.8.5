 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  The open-market sale (OMS) of essentials will start from August 20 and run through to October with a kg of rice priced at Tk 28, the government decided on Tuesday. The food procurement and planning committee took the decision in a meeting at the food ministry, presided over by the president of the committee food advisor AMM Shawkat Ali. Finance and planning advisor AB Mirza Azizul Islam, agriculture advisor Chowdhury Sazzadul Karim, local government advisor Md Anwarul Iqbal, planning secretary Zafar Ahmad Chowdhury and food secretary Mollah Waheduzzaman, among others, were present. Mirza Azizul later told reporters that the OMS programme would start from the upazilas and a person would get 3 kgs of rice for six days a week, with each kg costing Tk 28. The rice would be sold at the price it was bought internally in the last boro season, he said, adding the government had collected the rice giving the farmers 40 percent profit. Dealers would get Tk 1.50 commission on each kg. Mirza Azizul said though OMS of rice would be run through dealers other essentials would be sold in the market through BDR and Ansar, who have been asked to import to buffer their stock. The BDR has increased their stock with imports from abroad. The finance adviser said there was sufficient stock of food grains including rice, seven tonnes of which had been collected internally. The collection had been delayed to some extent due to bad weather and electricity crisis, forcing authorities to extend the time for collection by two months and it would not be extended further, he said. On whether OMS programme would have any impact on the market, the advisor said it was not possible to say definitively right at the moment. But there should be some impact and it can be said with certainty that the OMS programme would be instrumental in solving the food crisis of the poor, Mirza Azizul asserted. bdnews
