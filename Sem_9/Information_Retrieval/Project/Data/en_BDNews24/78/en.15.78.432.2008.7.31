 COLOMBO, Thu Jul 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's foreign minister discussed "certain recent events" with his Pakistani counterpart in Colombo on Thursday, amid an escalation in border skirmishes and bomb attacks on Indian cities that threaten a sluggish peace process. But Pranab Mukherjee gave no details of his meeting with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on the sidelines of a South Asian leaders summit. Qureshi had said the prime ministers of the two countries would meet on August 2 in Colombo and issue a comprehensive statement. "We shared our perception about our bilateral relations, about composite (peace) dialogue and certain recent events," Mukherjee told reporters. Their meeting comes after a series of violations of a five-year-old ceasefire on the de facto border between the two countries dividing the disputed Kashmir region. There have been three exchanges of border fire this month alone, marking the most serious violation since a 2003 ceasefire. "I can assure you our discussion today was a frank, candid, open discussion," Qureshi said. The South Asian regional summit is also being held in the shadow of a series of bomb blasts in India, and another at its embassy in Kabul this month, which India blamed on Pakistan's spy agency. The attacks together killed more than 100 people. India said after the Kabul attack that its four-year-old peace process with Pakistan was "under stress" because its nuclear-armed foe was "inciting terror" inside India and trying to hit its interests abroad. But Pakistan has rejected the charge and said peace talks were "on track", and India was pointing an accusing finger without any evidence. The two countries' security issues are likely to yet again cloud the summit agenda of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation or SAARC, which was formed in 1985 to boost the region's economic growth but has remained a talking shop. SAARC groups the countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan
