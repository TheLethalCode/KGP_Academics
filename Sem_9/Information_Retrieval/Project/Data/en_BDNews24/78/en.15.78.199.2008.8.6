<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Bar Association on Wednesday condemned the recent incidents of rearresting people at jail gates on charges of 'violation of emergency rules' shortly after they had been released on bail. SCBA president Barrister Shafiq Ahmed at a press conference said the arrest at the gates of jails on such charges opposed human rights and the rule of law. Such incidents also raised questions about the independence of the judiciary, as judicial magistrates were involved in the events, Shafiq added. The executive is influencing the judiciary, he alleged. Barrister Shafiq called on the chief justice to take a step in this regard. Awami League leaders Kazi Jafrullah, engineer Mosharraf Hossain, Rabiul Alam and Obaidul Moktadir Chowdhury, BNP leaders Ashraf Hossain and advocate Moazzem Hossain Alal, former bureaucrat Toufique-e-Elahi and Bangladesh Chhatra League general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton have most recently been re-arrested at the gates of prisons after they were released, the SCBA boss mentioned. Barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, advocate Joynal Abedin and Enayetur Rahim were also present at the press conference. bdnew
