<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited began their Citycell Federation Cup campaign in style with an emphatic 4-0 win over Jatrabari Krira Chakra in the one-sided inaugural match Wednesday. Ugandan midfielder Andrews Mensah Pomeyie struck two goals while Mehdi Hasan Ujjal and striker Jahid Hasan Emily scored one goal apiece in front of approximately 5,000 spectators at Bangabandhu National Stadium. From the beginning, Dhaka Abahani mounted huge pressure on the minnows Jatrabari with medio Abul Hossain rattling the opponent cross-bar in the very first minute. Jatrabari goalkeeper Ujjal brought down Emily inside the danger zone in a one-on-one situation and referee Abdul Hannan Miron awarded Abahani a penalty shot, but Emily frustrated the Abahani fans sending the ball wide from the spot in the fifth minute. The sky-blue outfit, however, seemed tired after 20 minutes of the game and they finally opened the account in the 41st minute with Ujjal, being set by Arif Khan Joy, slotted the ball home from the left to give Abahani a lead. After the breather, Abahani's midfield got a little speed with Pomeyie replacing Abul, and Abahani took a 2-0 lead two minutes into the second half with a combined attack. Ibrahim cut in from the left and Emily headed home. Seven minutes later, Pomeyie with a cleaver left footer found the back of the net as Jatrabari goalkeeper stood in the near post to see Pomeyie's shot in the net. Pomeyie then made it 4-0. The midfielder playing one-to-one pass with his compatriot Ibrahim from the left headed the ball home to seal the match in the 70th minute. The lanky midfielder could have scored a hat-trick, but Jatrabari goalkeeper Ujjal frustrated Pomeyie twice while Joy failed to beat the opponent keeper despite getting him in one-on-one situation. Earlier, BFF president Kazi Salahuddin inaugurated the 16-team finals while BFF partner Citycell chief executive officer Michael Seymour was present. In the second match of the day, a last-minute strike from Shawkat helped Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club edge past Chittagong Abahani Limited 2-1 under the floodlights. Ronny put the port city team, Abahani, ahead in the 28th minute before Dowlar restored the margin for Mohammedan in the 42nd minute. When it seemed the match was going to end in a 1-1 draw, Shawkat stunned all to give Mohammedan a 2-1 lead just one minute from time to start their Federation Cup campaign with a victory. Thursday matches: Dhaka Mohammedan vs Sunrise SC (5:00pm), Arambagh KS vs Rahmatganj MFS (7:00pm)
