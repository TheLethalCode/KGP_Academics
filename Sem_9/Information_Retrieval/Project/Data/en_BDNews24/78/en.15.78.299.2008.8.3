 KABUL, Sun Aug 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb struck a US-led military convoy outside the Afghan capital on Sunday, killing one soldier and wounding another, the military said. The attack happened in Bagrami district on the eastern outskirts of Kabul, the latest in a spiraling cycle of violence blamed on a resurgent Taliban. "A coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) this morning in Kabul," the US military said in a statement without identifying the casualties. A witness said a military helicopter arrived at the scene of the blast and evacuated at least three foreign nationals from a four-wheel drive vehicle which was hit. Foreign soldiers had cordoned off the site, a Reuters witness said. Taliban militants have stepped up their campaign against the government and foreign forces in Afghanistan this year, mostly relying on suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts
