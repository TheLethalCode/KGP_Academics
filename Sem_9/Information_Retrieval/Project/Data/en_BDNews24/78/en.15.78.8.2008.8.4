 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Voting came to a formal end at 4pm, but people queuing up in the polling centres will be able to cast their votes. According to an unofficial estimate, said election commissioner Sohul Hussain, up to 60 percent of voters cast their votes in four city corporations and nine municipalities. Vote-casting started at 8:00am amid confusions among voters and election officers over voter ID cards and voter registration numbers. But the problems were solved as time went on. An overwhelming number of voters were seen in polling centres. Voters and election officers said they had not received any news of vote rigging or other irregularities. The number of candidates for mayor and councillor seats in the city corporation polls is 992. The number of candidates in nine municipalities is 608. The number of registered voters in the electoral areas is over 13 lakh. bdnews24.co
