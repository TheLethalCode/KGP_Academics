 Khulna, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  Newly elected Khulna City Corporation mayor Talukder Abdul Khaleque paid a courtesy visit Tuesday to his closest contender Moniruzzaman Moni. Moni said that he had always been ready to cooperate with any newly elected mayor, while Khaleque said that he would work together with all for the sake of Khulna. "That's why I came to visit Moni today. I sought his assistance as his experience would help me for he was the acting mayor for some time," Khaleque said. Awami League-backed Khaleque defeated local BNP leader Moni by 25,836 votes, with 77.80 percent of eligible voters going to polls, according to the Khulna Election Office. Asked whether the defeat in the KCC polls would weaken his position in his party's central committee, Moni said: "I am not a national level politician. I work for the people here." Moni told bdnews24.com the polls were 'apparently fair', but there were some discrepancies between the voter lists provided to the polling agents and the presiding officers,. The newly elected mayor echoed Moni, saying many voters could not cast votes due to complicacies of the new system. Though most candidates and voters in Khulna have called the election a fair one, there have also been some allegations of misconduct. Four councillor candidates, all of them women, demanded a re-election in four wards as they said their opponents had threatened voters and distributed leaflets containing false information. bdnews
