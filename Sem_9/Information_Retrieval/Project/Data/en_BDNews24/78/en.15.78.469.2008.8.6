The central bank chief said remittance was contributing more than the readymade garment sector did to the economy. He said a considerable amount of money earned from RMG sector is spent on buying raw material (back-to-back letters of credit).

They had sent $5.98 billion remittance in fiscal year 2006-07. The remittance inflow in July last year was $567 million. However, during Jan-June period of last fiscal year remittance inflow was more than $ 700 million on average every month. As the remittance and export earnings rose in the last week of June the central bank's reserves topped $ 6000 million. At one stage in July the reserves rose to $ 6250 million. At the time $800 million was paid in import bill to Asian Clearing Union (ACU), resulting in the drop of reserves to $5400 million. In the last few days the reserves surged back to near $6 billion. On Tuesday the central bank had a reserve of $5900 million. bdnew
