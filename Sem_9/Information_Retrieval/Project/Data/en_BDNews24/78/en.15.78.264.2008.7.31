<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Thursday asked the government to grant former home minister Mohammad Nasim parole for better medical treatment overseas. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman at a press conference at his Gulshan home criticised the government for what he said was its "laidback attitude" to Nasim's case. "Consequences of it might be very serious," he said. The AL leader asked the government to send Nasim abroad by any means. AL presidium members Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury were present at the press conference. Zillur also demanded release and 'proper' medical treatment for detained AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Obaidul Kader and Chittagong city mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. The AL leader said the government had assured the AL leaders during the dialogue that Nasim would be sent abroad, but the government apparently shelved the plan. The former minister was admitted to LabAid Specialised Hospital on June 24 after he suffered a stroke in Kashimpur jail in Gazipur. The stroke paralysed the left side of his body. Joint forces arrested Nasim on Feb 4 last year on charges of corruption. A Dhaka court has convicted the former minister of amassing illegal wealth and sentenced him to 13 years in jail. Nasim's relatives had earlier appealed to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed seeking permission to send him abroad for better medical treatment. bdnews24.
