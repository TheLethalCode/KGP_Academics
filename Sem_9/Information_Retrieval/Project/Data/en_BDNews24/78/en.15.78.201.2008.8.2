 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Wanderers Club, Victoria Sporting Club and Sunrise Sporting Club moved into the finals of the Citycell Federation Cup after winning their respective matches Saturday. Wanderers Club blanked Bangladesh Air Force 2-0 while Victoria defeated Bangladesh Navy 2-1 to book their seats for finals from Group B as champions and runners-up respectively. Sunrise registered a lone goal win over Bangladesh Customs Krira Parisad to finish Group C champions with all- win record. Jatrabari KC and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan have already confirmed their berths for finals from Group A and these five teams will join the 16-team finals where 11 B. League clubs will play directly. At Bangabandhu National Stadium, Pintu Kumar Das put Wanderers Club ahead in the very second minute with a spectacular header from a goal-mouth melee. In the 16th minute, Saidul Haq from the left suddenly took a powerful shot to rattle the Air Force side bar. Air Force, the only team in the 11-team qualifying round ,failed to get a point from their three outings but it seemed they would pull off the goal in the match as they enjoyed the superior ball possession throughout the game, but their moves mostly concentrated on the midfield. After the breather, Iqbal Hossain having a free ball on the top of the opponent's box dodged a fellow Air Force defender to place the ball to the far post with a left footer to confirm Wanderers berths for finals. Two minutes later, Wanderers also found the back of the opponent net, but referee Jasim Uddin ruled it out due to off-side. At Army Stadium in Banani, Victoria, in a must-win situation to qualify for the finals, went ahead against Navy in the 25th minute with a strike from Mamun. Navy, who needed only a point to see them in the final round, bounced back in the 45th minute with Monir restoring the parity. Senior division team Victoria, however, got relief in the 79th minute when Hasan scored the match-winner to seal the match. Away at Shaheed Barkat Stadium in Gazipur, a late strike from Jewel helped Sunrise SC see off the Bangladesh Customs and ensured their berth for finals. Sunrise, the runners-up in the senior division league, needed just only one point in their last match to qualify for the final round and they finished the first half against Bangladesh Customs with a goalless draw. However, Jewel broke the deadlock in the 74th minute to take Sunrise to the finals.
