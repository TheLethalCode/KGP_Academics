 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said Tuesday the fears of his party that the Aug 4 polls would not be fair were not borne out, after AL made a near clean sweep of mayoral seats in four city corporations and nine municipalities. At a crowded post-election press conference at the Awami league office, he also called for announcement of the Jatiya Sangsad election schedule without delay. He extolled the victories of AL-backed candidates in Monday's local polls as a "victory of the Bangla people", and urged the withdrawal of emergency and publication of the final voter list. "In the light of the August 4 election, we want to say unequivocally that there is no time for the government to waste over holding parliamentary election by December as promised by the government," he said. Zillur congratulated the people in electoral areasvoters, party leaders, supporters and officials involved in conducting the polls. "Despite a lot of obstacles, limitations and shortcomings, the elections held in four city corporations and nine municipalities are a victory of people's democratic power." The AL had expressed doubts over the fairness of the elections, just one day before they were held. Asked whether AL were still sceptical after their victories, Zillur Rahman said: "Our fears were not borne out." But, he added: " it is not possible to hold a free and fair election under emergency." "Holding any other election under emergency would be a mistake. Elections would have been held in a more joyous atmosphere were there no emergency." Zillur called upon the government and the Election Commission to make the parliamentary elections fruitful and acceptable by removing deficiencies in accordance with their constitutional responsibilities. Others present at the press conference Tuesday included Tofael Ahmed, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzaque, Suranjit Sengupta, Matia Chowdhury, Syed Ashraful Islam and Abdul Mannan. On the EC's estimate of 80 percent voter turnout, AL presidium member Tofael said:" In the past, voting has been at 94 percent in many municipal elections." bdnews
