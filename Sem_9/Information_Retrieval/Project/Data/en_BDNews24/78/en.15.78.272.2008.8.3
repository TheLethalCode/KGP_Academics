 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)Another 50 Bangladeshi workers have been sent back home from Kuwait, an immigration official said Sunday. At least 50 more Bangladeshi workers returned from Kuwait Sunday morning by a Qatar Airways flight, landing at Zia International Airport at 8.30am, immigration desk in charge Nazir Hossain told bdnews24.com. However, Hossain added: "Immigration here cannot ascertain the exact number of such deportees arriving with regular passports, unless they notify us expressly about their situation." So far, at least 363 workers have been deported from Kuwait up to Sunday, according to immigration counts. The Kuwait government started deporting Bangladeshi workers back last week alleging that they had been involved in assaults on police and vandalising vehicles during a workers' strike for better pay and allowances. The Kuwaiti authorities announced that they would examine video footage and photographs of protesting workers to find out those responsible for violence during the strike, and deport them. Police arrested at least 800 Bangladeshi workers during the demonstrations, of whom 300 were later released later as no charges could be substantiated against them. The government assured Bangladesh mission officials that all "innocent" workers would be spared after investigations, but deportees allege that Kuwaiti law enforcers have been detaining Bangladeshi workers and persecuting them before deportation. One deportee from Kuwait told reporters at ZIA Sunday: "The Kuwaiti government is hardly checking now whether any of us was involved with the recent strike." "They are simply taking any Bangladeshi worker to the repatriation centre, where the Kuwaiti police and army personnel deployed there are persecuting them, and finally packing the detained onto Dhaka-bound flights," said the man whose is originally from Nangolkote in Comilla. The deportee said he did not have any money to travel to Nangolkote. Bulu, another worker arriving from Kuwait, who hails from Rangpur described similar treatment. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has also continued to deport Bangladeshi workers on charges of violating local laws. The kingdom has deported 257 Bangladeshis since last week on charges of violating Saudi laws by overstaying, or not having passports or work permits. bdnews24.c
