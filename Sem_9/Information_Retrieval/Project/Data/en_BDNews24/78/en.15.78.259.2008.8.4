 Barisal, August 4 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion detained 12 people Monday morning from different polling centres in Barisal on charges of violating the election code of conduct, a RAB officer said. The violations included setting up temporary polling camps in front of polling centres and "influencing the voters", RAB deputy director AKM Mamunur Rashid told bdnews24.com. "It is known to everyone that no election camp can be set up in front of the polling centres. Still, associates of candidates tried to do so to influence the voters arriving to cast votes," he said. "There are allegations that they even threatened the voters and misbehaved with RAB personnel too," Rashid added. In view of such allegations, RAB detained 12 people from the 'election camps' set up in front of Alekanda Orphanage School, Government School for the Blind, Baptist Mission High School and Udayan Secondary School polling centres. Six RAB contingents under command of AKM Mamunur Rashid were patrolling different polling centres in the city since morning. bdnews
