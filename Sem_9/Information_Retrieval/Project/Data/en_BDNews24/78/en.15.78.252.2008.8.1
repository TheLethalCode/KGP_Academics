 ISTANBUL,Fri Aug 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A girls' school dormitory collapsed in southern Turkey on Friday due to a gas explosion, killing at least 15 students and injuring at least 25, broadcaster NTV said. "There may still be 10-15 students under the rubble," Konya Governor Osman Aydin told state Anatolian news agency. The building, flattened like a house of cards, in the province of Konya was being used as a dormitory for students taking part in a course on the Koran. At the scene, dozens of men wielding pick axes and hammers dug at the rubble. Television footage also showed injured girls being carried from a minibus into a hospital in a nearby town. Medical rescue teams were at the scene and were trying to pull out two students still alive under the debris. Two of the injured were in a serious condition. "We think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building, given the burns on the injured," Konya health service official Galip Sef said, according to Anatolian. Anatolian said the three-storey building belonged to a religious foundation. Aydin said the collapse had occurred around 5 a.m. (10 p.m. EDT on Thursday) in the village of Balcilar in a mountainous district of Taskent, at the southern tip of Turkey's central province of Konya
