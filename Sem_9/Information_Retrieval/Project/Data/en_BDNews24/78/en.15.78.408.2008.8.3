 SAVAR, Bangladesh, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nazmunnahar Beauty's journey to the Olympics is typical of her many fellow Bangladeshi athletes at the Beijing Games. Orphaned as a child, Bangladesh's fastest woman was taken in by her next door neighbours and later encouraged into athletics by a coach who spotted her potential. "I never thought of (the) Olympics.

"I knew if I join the peacekeeping mission, I may be out of athletics forever," said Abdullah, who will also run the 100 metres. "Still I had no choice as financially it was a huge reward." Abdullah returned home in late 2007 in an effort to regain his fitness before Beijing and, like Beauty and Akhtar, was granted an International Olympic Council (IOC) wild card to ensure all member countries were represented at Beijing. The South Asian country, whose only high-profile presence in world sports is through their cricket team, has competed at the Olympics since 1984, but not won a medal in world competition. Bangladesh, which attained independence after a guerrilla war against Pakistani troops in Dec. 1971, have had success at the regional South Asian Games and Bangladeshi athletes won Commonwealth gold medals in 1990 and 2002. The real reward for the six athletes and seven officials, however, will come from marching behind their team's flag at Beijing's National Stadium on Friday. "To become a sportsman in a country like Bangladesh is never easy," said athletics coach Nazrul Islam. "You have no money and no other benefit, but only some honour. Becoming an Olympian is their highest honour
