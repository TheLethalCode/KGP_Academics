<TEXT>
 Khulna, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)Confusion among voters and officials over voter identification and the new polling system led to a sluggish start for the voting process in Khulna Monday, said voters, election officials and observers. Reports came in from several polling centers that casting had been slower compared to polls held under the old procedure. Mirza Khadem, a polling officer at the Government BL College polling centre said that casting has been slower this time mainly due to confusions over the new process. "Many voters arrived expectantly with their National ID Cards but without the required voter slips with registration numbers. We asked them to go back and bring that," he said. "It just takes longer to cast votes without their slips," he said. Dulari Biswas, came out of the polling centre at Alia Madrasah with a gloomy face. "I couldn't cast my vote; they say this is not enough," she told bdnews24.com, holding up her National ID Card. Dulari said she was asked to collect her serial number. "Before, the campaigners would come to our home and give us the serials but nothing like that happened this time." Mayoral candidate, Moniruzzaman Moni said in this regard: "Candidates thought that the ID card was enough to cast their votes." "No one really bothered with this matter but I see it created a mess," he told bdnews24.com by phone. Election observers also said that the voter slips issue was a major problem. "The only problem is voters are not coming to the booths with the required registration numbers thus they had to leave and come again," said advocate Mujibur Rahman, an election observer with FEMA (Fair Election Monitoring Association). He said casting was slow compared to previous polls. Meanwhile, agents of candidates started to set up stalls outside polling centres in the Khulna City Corporation area Monday, violating the electoral code of conduct. Agents of one mayoral candidate were seen camping outside the casting centre at the Khulna City College, providing citizens with their registration numbers. "We are not doing anything wrong. We started this after seeing that a lot of voters have forgot to bring their voter slips, Julhas, a supporter of a councillor candidate, told bdnews24.com. Assistant returning officer for Khulna Mojibur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they were looking into the matter. bdn
