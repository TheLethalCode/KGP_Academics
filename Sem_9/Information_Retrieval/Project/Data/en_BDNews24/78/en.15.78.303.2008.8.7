 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Wednesday approved the Representation of the People (amendment) Ordinance 2008, which bans political parties from running front organisations, said a government spokesman. The interim cabinet at a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office gave the final go-ahead, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters, adding the ordinance would be published in a gazette once the president approved it. The cabinet had approved the ordinance (amendment) in principle on July 13. According to the ordinance, unregistered political parties would be allowed to forge coalition with registered parties and contest the national polls. However, candidates will have to use the symbol of the coalition during the polls and elected people would be considered as a member of the main party. Provisions were added to the Representation of the People Ordinance to maintain transparency in candidacy, nomination and funding of political parties, Munaim said. The ordinance says that a person sentenced to a minimum of two years in jail in criminal cases cannot run the next national polls. Besides, those who have already served their sentences would have to wait for five years from the day his jail term expired to join the race. Those sacked from government offices on charges of corruption or forced to go on leave would have to wait five years to contest the polls, Munaim said. Those who has gone into voluntary retirement will be able to contest the polls three years after retirement. However, the door to polls is shut on people having defaulted on loan repayments or bill payments. Any person declared war criminal by a local or international court will not be eligible to run for elections, either. The ordinance allows a candidate to run from a maximum of three constituencies and provides for 'no' vote for the undecided voters. The cabinet on July 13 approved in principle a new Representation of People Ordinance 2008 to replace the Representation of the People Order 1972, but the move was strongly opposed by political parties. Just four days later, the government, taking note of the opposition, said it would take into account suggestions from any quarter on the new ordinance. The Election Commission started election-reform work in February last year and held formal talks with civil society members and political parties. The Representation of People Ordinance 2008 was designed in line with the reform talks. Asked why a new ordinance was being formulated instead of amending the 1972 RPO, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff had said the Election Commission recommended the formulation of the new ordinance. But the Election Commission itself, on July 24, recommended that the provisions on electoral reforms contained in the proposed Representation of People Ordinance 2008 be included in the RPO 1972 through an amendment. On moves to replace the 1972 Order, political parties had objected by saying the 1972 RPO was enacted through the first parliament of an independent Bangladesh, and the present caretaker government had no business "dumping a new RPO on the people." They felt an unelected government does not have any jurisdiction to amend such laws, and the EC should refrain from meddling in such affairs and concentrate on holding parliamentary elections. They also said no law passed by parliament can be scrapped through an ordinance. bdnew
