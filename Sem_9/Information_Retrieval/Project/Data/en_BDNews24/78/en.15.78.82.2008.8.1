 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP lawmaker Moazzem Hossain Alal was released on bail from Dhaka Central Jail Friday morning. A High Court bench granted bail last week to the former general secretary of Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal. "I express my gratitude to the people of Bangladesh and my party," Alal said to bdnews24.com on his release from jail shortly before 11.30am. Police initially arrested Alal on Feb 8 this year under Emergency Powers Rules. Despite being granted bail twice previously by the High Court, Alal was re-arrested at the Rangpur jail gate on April 23, and again on July 13 at Dhaka Central Jail gate. The BNP leader was also released on parole for six hours after his mother died while Alal was behind bars. Alal won a seat in the Jatiya Sangsad elections in 2001, representing Barisal-2 constituency. bdnews24.com/sm
