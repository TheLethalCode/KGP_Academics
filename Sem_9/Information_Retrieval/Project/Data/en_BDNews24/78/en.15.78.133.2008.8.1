 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)Kuwait sent 27 more Bangladeshi workers back home early Friday, Zia International Airport immigration desk told bdnews24.com. "A Kuwait Airlines fight brought 27 Bangladeshi workers back to Dhaka this morning at 5am," said Mahfuza Begum, immigration officer at ZIA. "Of the deportees, 13 held Bangladesh passports and the rest were issued out-passes and put on a homebound plane." The total number of Bangladeshis sent back home following the workers' strike in Kuwait now stands at 228, she said. The Kuwait government sent back 78 Bangladeshis on Wednesday night and 123 on Thursday morning, after it announced that it would deport Bangladeshis who were involved in violence during recent unrest over low pay. The Kuwaiti authorities had announced Wednesday that they would examine video footage and photographs of protesting workers to find out those responsible for damaging vehicles and attacking police, and deport them. Kuwait police arrested at least 800 Bangladeshi workers during the demonstrations, of whom 300 were later released as no charges could be substantiated against them. The Kuwaiti government has assured Bangladesh mission officials that all "innocent" workers will be spared after investigations. South Asian workers in Kuwait, including hundreds of Bangladeshis, staged demonstrations and strikes in the Gulf kingdom on July 26, demanding better working standards and pay. Newspapers in the Gulf kingdom reported that some workers are paid as little as 8 Kuwaiti Dinars ($30 or Tk 2000) a month. Since the incidents of unrest, the Kuwait government has said it will increase the minimum wage of foreign workers to 40 Dinars ($151 or Tk 10,300). bdnews24.c
