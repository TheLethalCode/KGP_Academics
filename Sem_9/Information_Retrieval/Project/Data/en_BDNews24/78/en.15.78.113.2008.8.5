<TITLE> Olmert, Abbas to meet in Jerusalem on Wednesday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will meet in Jerusalem on Wednesday, a week after Olmert threw US-sponsored peace talks into turmoil by announcing that he would step down. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the meeting would take place at Olmert's official residence in Jerusalem. "The president will raise a number of issues, such as the permanent-status issues, checkpoints and prisoners," he said. Olmert's spokesman, Mark Regev, confirmed that the meeting would take place on Wednesday. Faced with a widening corruption probe, Olmert announced last Wednesday that he would stand down as premier after a September 17 leadership contest within his centrist Kadima party. It could take months for a new Kadima leader to form a new government, possibly giving Olmert some time to press ahead with the negotiations.
