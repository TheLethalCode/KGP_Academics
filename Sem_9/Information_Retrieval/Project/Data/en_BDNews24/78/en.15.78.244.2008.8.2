A total of 224 Bangladeshis139 from Saudi Arabia and 85 from Kuwaitwere sent back Saturday, according to an estimate by the immigration at Zia International Airport. "Saudi Arabia has sent the Bangladeshis back without passes," Mahfuza Begum, an officer-in-charge of the immigration wing of ZIA, told bdnews24.com. According to deportation practice, people without passport are given passes to leave Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia deported 118 Bangladeshis on charges of violating Saudi laws by overstaying, or not having passports or work permits. The Saudi government has deported 257 Bangladeshis since Tuesday. "A Kuwaiti flight has carried 85 Bangladeshis to Dhaka today," said Mahfuza. Saturday's figure took the number of Bangladeshis deported from Kuwait on charges of violating local laws to 313. The deportation from Kuwait started after Asian workers, mostly Bangladeshis, went on strike and damaged property in the Gulf country, demanding pay hikes and better working conditions. The Kuwaiti authorities arrested some 800 Bangladeshis for allegedly damaging vehicles and attacking the Kuwaiti police. The law enforcers released some 300 Bangladeshis as they were proved innocent, according to the foreign affairs ministry. The Kuwaiti police and military have been examining photos of the workers through video images and detecting the persons responsible for attacking law enforcers or damaging property. The Kuwaiti authorities have told the officials of Bangladesh mission in Kuwait that the innocent people would be released, but the wrongdoers must go back. Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait alleged that the police and military had made wholesale arrests of Bangladeshis. They have alleged that the police and the military personnel tortured the Bangladeshis in custody. bdn
