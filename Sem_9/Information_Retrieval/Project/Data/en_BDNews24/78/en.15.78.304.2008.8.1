 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman demanded Friday that the caretaker government announce the date for national elections immediately, urging its policymakers not to delay. "Accept reality and hold national elections immediately," Zillur said as Awami League and its front organisations launched a month-long programme to mourn the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. At a discussion at the party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, Zillur demanded Aug 15 be announced as national mourning day and a public holiday. Claiming that Ziaur Rahman was involved in Mujib's killing, the AL acting president said: "Zia passed an indemnity ordinance and saved the killers of Bangabandhu. He rewarded the killers with important positions." Zillur urged AL leaders and supporters to remain united as far as possible even under the state of emergency. "The government wants that Sheikh Hasina does not participate in politics and the election. But we will go to election with Sheikh Hasina among us and leading us." "People will not accept an election under a state of emergency." AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu demanded immediate implementation of the recent High Court ruling that declared illegal the cancellation of August 15 as national mourning day and a public holiday. "If the High Court ruling is not implemented, the people will think that the government does not believe in the rule of law." Fellow presidium member Tofail Ahmed also urged the government to implement the ruling, saying: "Do not stand against the will of the people. None can make way standing against the will of the people." AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "Except Awami League, all governments have failed the country. The government of Sheikh Hasina is necessary for safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh." bdnew
