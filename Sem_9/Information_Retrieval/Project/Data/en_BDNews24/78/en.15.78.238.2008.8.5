<TITLE> Power-sharing deal close in Zimbabwe: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's ruling party and opposition are close to a power-sharing deal to end a political crisis, a South African newspaper reported on Tuesday. Zimbabwean government officials and opposition members were not immediately available for comment on the report in The Star newspaper. It cited unnamed sources close to the negotiations as saying the agreement would make opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai prime minister and President Robert Mugabe ceremonial president. "They are down to detail now," said one source. "Although how long that will take is still unclear. But a deal is not far off. Not at all." Mugabe's ZANU-PF began power-sharing talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change two weeks ago in South Africa to try to resolve the crisis after Mugabe's unopposed re-election in a poll boycotted by the opposition. Talks between ZANU-PF and the opposition resumed on Sunday after adjourning early last week, South Africa's presidency said. South African President Thabo Mbeki has been mediating.
