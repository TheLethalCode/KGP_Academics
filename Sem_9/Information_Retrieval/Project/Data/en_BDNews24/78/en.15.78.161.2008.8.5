 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  Kuwait has deported more Bangladeshi workers in an apparent breach of its commitment that it will not send back any Bangladeshi workers unless they create further trouble in the Gulf sheikhdom. According to immigration officials at Zia International Airport, at least 164 workers were packed back to Bangladesh on Monday and Tuesday, after Kuwaiti authorities made the commitment to Bangladesh embassy officials on August 3. "At least 74 Bangladeshis returned from Kuwait on Tuesday on a Kuwaiti airlines flight," Nazir Hossain, officer-in-charge of airport immigration, told bdnews24.com. On Monday, 90 Bangladeshis were deported from Kuwait, according to the immigration desk of the Zia International Airport. With the Monday and Tuesday figures, Kuwaiti authorities have deported no fewer than 527 Bangladeshis on charge of violating Kuwaiti laws. Bangladesh embassy officials met Sunday with officials of Kuwait's social welfare, labour and finance ministries in trying to settle the workers' unpaid wages and other benefits. The Kuwaiti government would not deport any Bangladeshi unless they create further trouble there, a Bangladesh foreign ministry press statement said Monday. The statement added, "The Bangladeshi workers have returned to their workplaces as the situation has become normal". Around 86,000 Bangladeshi workers had returned to their workplaces in Kuwait until Sunday, the ministry said. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 850 Bangladeshis who took part in the four-day strike and released 400 of them, the statement said. Some 150,000 Bangladeshis work in Kuwait. The migrant workers, mainly Bangladeshis, took to the street demanding pay hikes, regular payment of wages and better working conditions. They continued their strike for three consecutive days. The Kuwaiti police and the military crushed the demonstration Wednesday last and made indiscriminate arrests of Bangladeshis before deporting them with the cloth they were on. Kuwaiti laws strictly prohibit strikes and demonstrations. The workers said they had striked as the employers in cases paid only Tk 2000 per month. Again, most of the employers did not pay the wages regularly but Kuwaiti authorities took action against the errant companies. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in a letter Tuesday asked deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Kuwait Sheikh Mohammed Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah for his "personal initiative" to resolve all issues, said a foreign ministry press statement. He also thanked the Kuwaiti deputy prime minister for the measures taken so far to address the issue by the Kuwaiti government. The letter also said "all Bangladeshis consider Kuwait a brotherly country close to their hearts" and invited him to visit Bangladesh, according to the statement. bd
