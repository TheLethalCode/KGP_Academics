 Dhaka University, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Pro-Awami League student activists freed the Dhaka University's vice chancellor Tuesday evening from a three-hour confinement inside his office, but called a strike on the campus for Wednesday to demand release of a BCL central leader from jail. The activists of the AL's student wing eventually released Prof SMA Faiz at around 7pm. After his release, Faiz told reporters: "I have been making contacts in the appropriate places for the release of (BCL leader and DU student) Roton." "The atmosphere at the university has so far been proper. We want every conscious student and all involved with the university to remain alert in maintaining a conducive atmosphere for academic activities. I hope for positive results." BCL central president Mahmud Hasan Ripon said four DU teachers led by the VC would go to meet the education adviser at 10pm Tuesday. "We will continue our vigil in front of the university's administrative building peacefully until the return of the teachers' delegation," said Ripon. However, the VC did not say anything about a meeting with the education adviser later that evening. About 100 to 150 leaders and supporters surrounded the VC's office in the administrative building at around 4pm, demanding release of BCL central committee general secretary and Dhaka University student Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton from Mymensingh jail. BCL activist Shamsul Kabir Rahat said Roton was freed from Mymensingh jail at about 10.30am Tuesday, and was kept sitting in the visiting room of the jail. Police later rearrested him from the visiting room at around 2.30 pm, Rahat said. After receiving the news, the BCL leaders and supporters marched on to the VC's office, under the banner of "Human Rights Conscious Students", saying they would continue their protest until action was taken about Roton. BCL's DU president, Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu said: "Chhatra League supports the strike called for Wednesday by the Human Rights Conscious Students." The activists had earlier damaged teachers' vehicles parked outside of the administrative building, and locked the main gates with the vice chancellor and other university officials held inside. Police took up posts on campus after BCL surrounded the building, but later withdrew from the campus. They then took up places outside the campus grounds across the road from the Teacher-Student Centre and Nilkhet gate. Joint forces arrested Roton on Jan 18, 2007, on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. Chhatra League observed a 24-hour token hunger strike demanding his release on Sunday. bdnews24
