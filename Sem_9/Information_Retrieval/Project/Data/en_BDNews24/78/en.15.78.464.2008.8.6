<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steve Harmison and Stuart Broad have been recalled to the England team for the final test against South Africa starting on Thursday at The Oval. Ryan Sidebottom, England's leading wicket-taker over the last 12 months, and batsman Ravi Bopara lost their places in the team named on Wednesday by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). New captain Kevin Pietersen said that Harmison, with 212 wickets from 58 tests, was keen to play test cricket again after a five-month absence. "He had a bounce in his step, and the way he bowled this morning to (Andrew) Flintoff in the nets it can only work for us," the 28-year-old Pietersen told a news conference. The inclusion of Harmison and Broad means England will have a five-man bowling attack for the first time in the series. "I feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers and I've given a lot more responsibility to the batters to score some runs," added Pietersen, who was also pleased with the selection of Broad. "He's a positive player who learns quickly," the captain said of the 22-year-old, who, despite being renowned for his bowling, has an average of more than 40 with the bat after 11 test innings. Team: Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen (captain), Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Tim Ambrose, Stuart Broad, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Monty Panesar
