 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh may get back warm-up opportunities in Australia during their one-day international series as Cricket Australia responded positively to a request by the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Bangladesh were scheduled to play a four-dayer and three ODIs against Australia from Aug 31 to September 6, but Bangladesh shortened the Australian tour by curtailing the four-dayer because of a Twenty20 tournament in Canada. The four-nation Twenty20 event, involving Bangladesh, Pakistan, West Indies and hosts Canada, was scheduled for Aug 14-17, but was postponed till October after organisers failed to convince West Indies to participate. Following the postponement, the BCB had requested Australia to revive the four-dayer and the hosts have agreed in principle, Nazimuddin Chowdhury, BCB's acting chief executive officer, told bdnews24.com Sunday. Chowdhury added that instead of the four-day match Australia may arrange two additional one-day matches. The final decision would be taken on Monday, he said. The BCB official said that once Australia made its decision, Bangladesh could fly to Australia as early as Aug 15, five days before the original schedule. b
