 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)Authorities have put all measures in place to create a congenial atmosphere in four city corporations and nine municipalities for people to vote without fear, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said Saturday. Speaking to reporters in his office, Sakhawat said the Election Commission had taken all preparation to hold the polls set for August 4. The election commissioner said a three-tier security cover will be in play in the polling areas. Additional forces will fan out across the areas on the day of voting. In a statement, the home ministry said a control room would be opened at 6.00am Sunday and would remain open until 8.00pm Tuesday to watch and control the law and order situation of the polling areas. The ministry has asked the people to call 9571686 or fax messages to 9571682 to submit their allegations relating to law and order. "Necessary materials for voting have already reached the polling areas. Ballot papers and ballot boxes will reach by Sunday," he added. Sakhawat hoped more people would come to vote for their candidates than in the previous polls. On violations of election rules by candidates, Sakhawat said: "We have no reports that any candidate has violated election rules." "Voters are very much conscious this time. I hope they will opt for efficient people for their own interest," he added. He hoped the August 4 polls would be a model for future polls. The election commissioner asked candidates and officials working for the polls to abide by the rules properly. Mobile courts will be on duty in the polling areas on the day of polling. A magistrate will lead a court. bdnews
