 Chittagong, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on Sunday against former Awami League minister Engineer Mosharraf Hossain and two others in a corruption case. ACC assistant director for Chittagong Jahangir Alam submitted the chargesheet to the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate Asaduzzaman. ACC official Md Obaidullah told bdnews24.com that the judge received the chargesheet and transferred the case to the court of metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah. Assistant director Alam filed the case, involving the allotment of land from Chittagong Development Authority through misuse of power, on Nov 22 last year. According to the charges, Mosharraf Hossain misused his power when he was heading the housing and public works ministry, by allotting 1.44 bighas of land, in Agrabad commercial area, to former MP Rafiqul Anwar and his brother, chairman of Hotel Golden Inn, Fakhrul Anwar in return for Tk 1.69 crore in October 2000. The latter two later violated the government conditions and sold the land to the owners of Sanmar Hotel Ltd, for Tk 4.61 core making a profit of Tk 2.92 lakh. Engineer Mosharraf, president of the Chittagong district Awami League (north unit), and Rafiqul Anwar are currently behind bars. Police re-arrested Mosharraf from the gate of Kashimpur jail in Gazipur on Friday, immediately after he was released on bail. They took him to Joydevpur police station, and then to Gazipur court on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. Gazipur chief judicial magistrate rejected a bail plea by Mosharraf and ordered him back to Kashimpur jail. bdnew
