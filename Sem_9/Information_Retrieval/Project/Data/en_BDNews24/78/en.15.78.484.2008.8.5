 Dhaka University, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Pro-Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists confined Dhaka University's vice chancellor inside his office Tuesday, demanding release of a BCL central leader from jail. About 100 to 150 BCL leaders and supporters surrounded the VC's office in the administrative building at around 4pm and demanded release of BCL central committee general secretary and Dhaka University student Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Ratan from Mymensingh jail. The activists of the AL's student wing damaged teachers' vehicles parked outside and windowpanes of the building and locked the main gates with the VC and other university officials held inside the building. Police took position on campus after BCL surrounded the building, but later withdrew. They then took up places outside the campus ground across the road from the Teacher-Student Centre and Nilkhet gate. BCL activist Shamsul Kabir Rahat said Ratan was freed from Mymensingh jail at about 10:30am Tuesday and was kept at the visiting room of the jail. Police later rearrested him from the visiting room at around 2:30pm, Rahat said. The news prompted the BCL activists to march on to the VC's officeand they said they would continue their protest until action was taken about Ratan. Joint forces arrested Ratan on Jan 18, 2007 on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. The BCL observed a 24-hour token hunger strike demanding his release on Sunday. bdnews24
