<TITLE> Bespoke Gemballa Porsches tempt Asia's car-mad elite </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If you thought it would be difficult to improve on a Porsche, think again. German firm Gemballa is reaching out to Southeast Asia's wealthy elite with upgraded Porsche models that aim to take the marque to a new level of luxury and performance -- if you're willing to pay a premium of about 400,000 euros ($624,000) on top of your car's already hefty price tag. At a glitzy launch in Singapore on Thursday, scores of the island's multitude of millionaires flocked to see two of Gemballa's Porsche models, the 650-horsepower Avalanche GTR-650 EVO and the GT 380. The bright-orange GTR, with aggressive front and rear spoilers and menacing black wheels, costs about S$1 million ($730,000) in Singapore, one of the most expensive places on the planet to buy exotic cars. It is based on the 996 turbo. The GT 380, based on a 911 Carrera S coupe, costs about half this amount but both had potential customers clambering for a closer look as they sipped champagne. Asked if his company was making better Porsches, company founder Uwe Gemballa told Reuters: "You can't say so. Porsche is already a good car. They could do what we do. But we are more flexible, we concentrate on a small niche group of customers." "I won't say we make it better, we make it different," he said during the launch at Singapore's National Museum where dozens of Ferraris, Porsches and Lamborghinis were parked out front in an impromptu auto-show for passersby. Local company Exquisite Marques is handling the Gemballa brand in Singapore and customers can arrange to have their Porsches kitted out to various Gemballa specs locally or order a bespoke Gemballa from Germany. Exquisite Marques said it has set a target to sell a dozen Gemballas in Singapore over the next year, despite the tiny city state's high automobile taxes and limited driving space. Gemballa said South Korea was Asia's top market for the brand at the moment, selling about a dozen cars, but he expects the brand to do well in China, home to a growing class of newly rich, after just starting business there. He said the key to the Gemballa brand was customers being able to make each car individual. "You can do a 100,000 euro modification up to 400,000 euro modification," he said, explaining changes can range from total engine rebuilds, new interiors, to suspension and body kits. "We have always tried to convince customers to have a round package -- front spoilers, rear spoilers, side-skirts, bonnet, wheels, exhaust, so the car is really a Gemballa car, not a mixture of accessories," he added
