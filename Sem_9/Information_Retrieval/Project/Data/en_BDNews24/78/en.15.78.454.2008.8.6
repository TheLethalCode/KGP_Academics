 BEIJING, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In a land where eight is a lucky number, the Beijing Olympics and Michael Phelps may be a match made in heaven. The greatest show on earth, opening on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008, provides a perfect platform for the U.S. swimmer to become the first athlete to win eight gold medals at a single Games. The men's 100 metres, the showcase event repeatedly ruptured by doping scandals, could further push the boundaries of human endeavour when world champion Tyson Gay of the United States lines up against world record holder Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell, both Jamaicans. The winner could become the fastest man on earth. Against a backdrop of fierce national pride and stunning architecture, it would be no surprise if hosts China oust the United States from the top of the medals table in a significant break with the post-war order. Spain's Rafael Nadal, winner of the French Open and Wimbledon and already assured of displacing Roger Federer as world number one, could also end his Swiss rival's Olympic dream. SEVEN GOLDS The opening week in the 'Water Cube' pool, where finals are held in the morning for prime time television in the United States, will be dominated by Phelps's quest to smash fellow American Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven golds in a single Games. With an arm span exceeding his height, the 23-year-old bagged six golds in an eight-medal haul in Athens four years ago and the hype has been mounting ever since. If he can match the seven golds he took at last year's world championships in Melbourne, Phelps will land a $1 million jackpot from sponsor Speedo whose revolutionary new LZR Racer suit has caused waves in the sport. Even if he wins just half of his eight events, Phelps will still be the most prolific gold medallist the Olympics have ever witnessed. Despite the absence of disgraced 2004 winner Justin Gatlin, one of track and field's many doping casualties in the four years since Athens, the men's 100 metres promises to light up the Bird's Nest stadium. Given the right conditions on Aug. 16, Bolt's recent world record of 9.72 seconds could be tested. However, the high humidity and chronic Beijing smog are already casting a cloud of concern over the closing men's Marathon event on Aug. 24. Jamaica's Bolt has also entered his preferred 200 metres, attempting an Olympic sprint double last accomplished by nine times gold medallist Carl Lewis in 1984. His will be a tough task but nothing in comparison to the burden felt by Olympic and world champion Liu Xiang, carrying the hopes of 1.3 billion compatriots in his 110 metres hurdles duel against Cuba's world record holder Dayron Robles. Only Yao Ming, the towering Houston Rockets center who leads China's basketball challenge, can match the slender runner for popular affection. Yang Wei can lead China's men to gymnastics glory as favourite for the all-round gold while the women will be challenging the Americans for the team title. China can also expect to claim the first golds of the Games with strong contenders in both air rifle shooting and weightlifting. Russian world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva looks a racing certainty for the women's pole vault title while Kenyan teenager Pamela Jelimo appears unstoppable in the 800 metres. In the men's 400 metres, Olympic and world champion Jeremy Wariner will be pushed hard by fellow American LaShawn Merritt while Ethiopia's Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele has an intriguing 10,000 metres battle with compatriot Haile Gebrselassie. Cuba, for decades the boxing superpower, have raised American hopes of a U.S. resurgence in the ring by sending an inexperienced squad weakened by defections. Doping tests will be more widespread than ever, with 25 percent more scheduled than at Athens and dozens of weightlifters suspended already. BMX cycling will become the newest sport, while swimming returns to its Olympic origins with men's and women's 10km open water races. South African swimmer Natalie du Toit, who lost a leg in a road accident in 2001, will swim that distance to become the first athlete to compete in both the Paralympics and Olympics
