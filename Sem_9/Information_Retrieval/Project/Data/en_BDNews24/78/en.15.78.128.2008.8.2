 LONDON, August 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kent have been excluded from the inaugural Champions Twenty20 League for fielding two players who took part in the unofficial Indian Cricket League, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Friday. The Indian board, one of the event's organisers, said in June that English county teams containing ICL players would be barred from the multi-million dollar Champions Twenty20 League. The ECB said Cricket Australia, which is in charge of setting the rules for the tournament, had told it that domestic Twenty20 runners-up Kent would not be invited because the team contained ICL participants Justin Kemp and Azhar Mahmood. The competition will feature the top two teams from the domestic competitions of Australia and South Africa, the Indian Premier League as well as Pakistan champions Sialkot. The ECB expect English Twenty20 champions Middlesex to take part once the ruling body has agreed to the tournament terms. "The England and Wales Cricket Board have been informed by Cricket Australia that Kent ... will not receive an invitation to the proposed Champions League event in 2008," the ECB said in a statement. It added that the Champions League organisers had rejected a proposal from Kent to play without its ICL players as well as an alternative suggestion to send Essex, the team Kent defeated in their Twenty20 semi-final. "Both the ECB and Kent are bitterly disappointed at this stance as Kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers," the ECB said. The decision to establish the Champions League tournament, which will take place from Sept. 29 to Oct. 8, followed the success of the new Indian Premier League. The venue has yet to be chosen
