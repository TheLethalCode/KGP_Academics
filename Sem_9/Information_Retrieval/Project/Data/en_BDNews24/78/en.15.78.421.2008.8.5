 Anisur Rahman bdnews24.com sports correspondent Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  The business end of the Citycell Federation Cup, the season's curtain-raising tournament, begins on Wednesday after the qualifiers came to a close last week, with 16 finalists fighting it out. B-League champions Abahani take on qualifiers Jatrabari KC on one of two inaugural matches at 5:00pm at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Chittagong Abahani lock horns against Chittagong Mohammedan in next match at 7:00pm. Considering the strength on papers, Abahani Limited, National League champions Mohammedan SC and holders Brothers Union go into the championships as favourites and yet the title race is wide open. The new powerhouse, Sheikh Russel KC, with their Moroccan recruits may also try to take a shot at the title, though their only success in the top-flight football came when they finished runners-up in the premier football league. Muktijoddha Sangsad, depleted after the row over the central command council that runs football, and who completed the players' registration on the day transfer window closed, still have it in them to go all the way. Counting them out so early can be embarrassing for the pundits. The freedom fighters-focused team proved their prowess by running away with Federation Cup, Premier League, National League, Independence Cup, DAMFA Cup. But, in the end, it may all boil down to the two old foes -- Abahani and Mohammedan. Abahani's long-serving coach Amolesh Sen told bdnews24.com, "We must go there for the title and if we achieve the target, it will help us a lot in the upcoming B. League." The sky-blues has almost retained the same squad that won the inaugural B. League, a fact Sen believes would give his side an edge over others. The former national footballer does not want to pick a single team as clear favourites. He, however, has injury problems with playmaker Abul Hossain and Jahed Parvez Chowdhury. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq also looks to the tournament to fine-tune his squad for B-League. "We will certainly give it our all, but this tournament is a stage where I would love to see how my footballers play in line with my strategy before the start of the B-League." Haq said his side going on the right direction. He, however, rated all three giants  Mohammedan, Abahani and Brothers  top favourites. Brother coach Wasim keeps Mohammedan ahead of others on paper, but he has taken the Federation Cup with all seriousness. "What I hear from others is that Mohammedan are favourites on the paper, but Abahani and Brothers are no less," said the former national footballer, who played for the Gopibagh-based club for long. "But, the day the big teams clash presents the real moment to justify them. Fortune will play a big hand in these big matches as most of the teams have had little time to prepare," said Wasim, adding he would love to see his charges in the final. The former playmaker also considers the Federation Cup a good platform for his team to hone their skills for the B. League. Abahani have been pitted in a hard Group B along with two more B. League teams like Group A, which also includes three B. League teams including Muktijoddha. Being drawn in the same group also comprising two weaker teams, Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel are almost all but certain to move to the last eight while Mohammedan SC and Arambagh from Group D are expected to make the quarterfinals. Besides, it would doubtless be a pleasant surprise if giant-killers such Arambagh KS and Farshganj put up a real hard battle for the title, since all teams have players who are short on match practice, having not played since Aug 1, 2007, the last day of the inaugural B-League. Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin will declare the finals open while sponsor Citycell chief executive officer Michael Seymour will also be present. b
