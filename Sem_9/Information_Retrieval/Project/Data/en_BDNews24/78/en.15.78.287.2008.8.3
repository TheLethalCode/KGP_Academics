 Rajshahi, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami has thrown its weight behind BNP leader Mosadddek Hossain Bulbul in Rajshahi city mayoral race, drawing cries of foul play by his main contender. A meeting of the party Sunday made the decision to side with Bulbul, a move many see is likely to dent chances of acting Rajshahi city mayor Rezaun Nabi Dudu in the race. Dudu has been a strong contender until the Islamist party endorsed Bulbul. Awami League leader Khairuzzaman Liton, a mayoral hopeful, has protested the Jamaat-e-Islami's move, terming it a blatant violation of the electoral code of conduct. "The (electoral) code of conduct clearly states that all kinds of campaign will remain off after midnight Saturday. But the four-party alliance declared their decision Sunday," Liton said. He said he would file a complaint to the Election Commission. Liton did not think Jamaat's endorsement would raise Bulbul's chances. "Jamaat's support cannot be termed an absolute support as metropolitan Jamaat-e-Islami chief Ataur Rahman was not present at the meeting." "Jamaat split over the support to Bulbul as metropolitan Jamaat chief Ataur Rahman and secretary Abul Kalam Azad were at loggerheads over the decision." "It is a support of a portion of the BNP and a portion of the Jamaat-e-Islami. So it will not play a vital role in the race," he said. Metropolitan Jamaat publication secretary Imajuddin Mandal ruled out having any disagreement within the party over the decision to support Bulbul. "Jamaat is not divided. The decision was made in the meeting. The metropolitan chief was present in the meeting," he said. "We have endorsed Bulbul in line with the decision of Shura committee today," he added. Mayoral hopeful Bulbul told bdnews24.com: "The position of BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami has been consolidated for a long time in Rajshahi." "Earlier the local BNP has given its endorsement. Now I have got support from the local four-party alliance. There is no split in the BNP right now," he added. Rajshahi metropolitan Jubo Dal secretary Nazrul Islam Jewel told bdnews24.com: "The Jamaat-e-Islami has at least 20,000-25,000 voters in Rajshahi. Most of them will vote for the four-party alliance candidate." "It is almost certain that Bulbul will win the election," Jewel said. Another BNP leader and acting RCC mayor Dudu told bdnews24.com: "I am still very much in the race. It is really difficult to say how much the support will work." On whether he had sought support from Jamaat, Dudu said: "I did not seek support from Jamaat. I seek support from the almighty God." bdnews24
