<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnew24.com)-A clear split opened in the newly formed Progressive Democratic Party, a day after a 251-member national committee was announced. In a statement released Saturday, two members of the party's standing committee, HMA Gaffar and vice president Dewan Nurun Nabi and founder member and former minister Tajul Islam Chowdhury relieved party chairman Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi from all responsibilities. "We cannot leave a prospective party like PDP in the hands of failed leader, grabber and extortionist. We relieve Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi from all responsibility of the party," they said in the statement. The statement also announced formation of a committee comprising the three leaders. Quarishi could not be reached immediately by phone for comment. However, PDP secretary general Noor Mohammad Khan told bdnews24.com, "The three leaders do not have jurisdiction to relieve (Quarishi). It is against the party constitution. Mr Quarishi has been elected chairman of the party through the vote of delegates from across the country." He said the leaders including Tajul Islam did not want to stay in the party and that they would join the grand alliance. He said the three leaders distanced themselves from "the spirit of 1/11". Chowdhury told bdnews24.com, "Mr Quarishi lacks the charisma that is required of a leader of a mass organisation to achieve success in politics. Questions have been asked about his leadership. He has failed to discharge his responsibilities." The handwritten statement signed by HMA Gaffar, Tajul Islam Chowdhury and Dewan Nurun Nabi, faxed to the media, accused Quarishi of extortion and grabbing the Segunbagicha office. Quarishi launched PDP after the state of emergency was declared in Jan 2007. He announced a 251-strong national committee on Saturday. The 11-member national standing committee includes HMA Gaffar. The other two were with the party from the beginning but expressed their inability to stay in the committee due to differences of opinion with Quarishi. bdne
