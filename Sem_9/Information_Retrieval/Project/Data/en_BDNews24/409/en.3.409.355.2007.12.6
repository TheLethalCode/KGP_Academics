 SYDNEY, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Australia named fast bowler Shaun Tait on Thursday in their squad for the Chappell-Hadlee one-day series against New Zealand. Tait, fully recovered from injury problems, was preferred to the more experienced Stuart Clark and there were also places for all-rounder James Hopes and batsman-wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. "James Hopes retains his place after impressive performances in the series in India, while Brad Haddin has also been rewarded for his amazingly strong start to the interstate season," chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a Cricket Australia statement. "After making a huge impact at the World Cup earlier this year, Shaun Tait has been brought back into the squad after having fully recovered from injury." Hilditch said there was no reason to make changes following the team's recent success. "The side recognises the performances of the team during the ICC World Cup earlier this year and their continued success in October's one-day series in India," he said. "The team produced very consistent performances during these two tournaments and played fantastic cricket." Ricky Ponting will captain the world champions after being left out of the squad for the one-off Twenty20 match against New Zealand in Perth on Tuesday. The three-game Chappell-Hadlee series starts on Dec. 14 in Adelaide with the other matches on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20 in Sydney and Hobart. Australia squad: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Nathan Bracken, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, James Hopes, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait
