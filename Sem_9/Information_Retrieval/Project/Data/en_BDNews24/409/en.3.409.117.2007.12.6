 BERLIN, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany on Thursday extradited a man suspected of involvement in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy, a senior prosecutor said. The man, 20-year-old Rudy Hermann Guede, from Ivory Coast, was being sent to Italy where police have said they found fingerprints matching his on Kercher's pillow. "He has been extradited today," said Karl-Rudolf Winkler, senior prosecutor in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Guede, arrested on Nov. 20 in Germany, has made no public comment on the case. Kercher, a 21-year-old exchange student from Leeds University, was found dead on Nov. 2 in the town of Perugia, semi-naked, with a deep cut to her throat. Prosecutors believe she was killed because she refused to have sex with one or more attackers.
