<TEXT>
 MADRID, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla earned their first point in four matches when they came from behind to draw 1-1 away to Osasuna in a rearranged Primera Liga match on Wednesday. The game was originally scheduled to be played in early September, but was postponed following the death of Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta after his collapse in the opening game of the season. Sevilla, who have shone in the Champions League but struggled in domestic competition this season, fell behind midway through the first half when Czech striker Jaroslav Plasil nipped in front of two defenders to clip home from close range. The Andalucians looked to be in further trouble when Osasuna were awarded a penalty after Patxi Punal fell in the area, but Andres Palop produced a brilliant diving save to turn the midfielder's penalty around the post. Sevilla recovered their nerve in the second half, equalising with less than two minutes on the clock when Jesus Navas volleyed in off the post after Portuguese winger Duda had swept in a great cross from the left. Both sides had chances to snatch the win in the remainder of the half, Osasuna striker smashing a thundering free kick against the bar from 25 metres out and Duda hitting the woodwork from another set piece in the final minute. The result left Sevilla in 12th place in the table level on 16 points with Osasuna, Almeria and Valladolid, just three points above the relegation zone and eight off the European places
