 LONDON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcastle United defender Stephen Taylor equalised on the hour to earn a 1-1 draw at home to Premier League leaders Arsenal at St James' Park on Wednesday. The result put the unbeaten north London side four points clear of second-placed Manchester United with 37 points from 15 matches. Arsenal took the lead after four minutes when midfielder Emmanuel Eboue crossed from the right and striker Emmanuel Adebayor controlled the ball with his chest before volleying superbly into the roof of the net for his ninth league goal. Taylor equalised with a low shot that went in off the base of the post after Newcastle right back Habib Beye's cross was nodded on by Alan Smith.

"After what the last few results have brought, I'm relieved...it does take the pressure off. We'd lost our last two home games poorly," Allardyce told Sky Sports. "We can only go forward now with that commitment...playing with passion and that crowd behind us," said man-of-the-match Smith. A minute after Adebayor's goal, Newcastle captain Geremi skimmed the post at the other end with a header from James Milner's left cross. Adebayor raced clear on the left in an Arsenal break in the 17th minute but goalkeeper Shay Given blocked his effort at the near post. Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia had to make a couple of good saves to keep his team ahead at the interval, first when a Geremi free kick came through a gap in the wall then from Taylor's header at a corner. With 10 minutes to go, Given saved from Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky who ghosted through unmarked on the left for a shot aimed at the far post. Adebayor broke away in injury time with right back Habib Beye chasing on his left shoulder. Both went down in the box but the referee waved play on
