 COLOMBO, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka vowed to destroy Tamil Tiger rebel strongholds on Thursday and warned of more rebel attacks on civilians, a day after a roadside blast killed 16 people on a civilian bus in the island's north. Cabinet spokesman Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said the rebel attack in the north central district of Anuradhapura on Tuesday night showed the Tigers must be desperate. "Why are they aiming at civilians? What are they gaining by that? That means they are weak and desperate. We are trying our level best to destroy these terrorists in their own places," Yapa said. "We took back full control of the east, and we are now engaging (them) on various other fronts, so we are trying to weaken them further, and we want to make sure that terrorism is wiped out from this country." Fighting has been intense in recent months, with almost daily land and sea battles, bombings and air raids. Tamil Tiger rebels said at least 10 soldiers were killed in army attacks on a rebel held area in the northwestern district of Mannar on Wednesday and Thursday. "The Sri Lanka Armed Forces (SLAF) teams ... retreated with heavy casualties. At least 10 of the SLAF men were killed and several others were wounded, front line sources confirm," said Tamil Tiger rebel military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan in an email statement. Ilanthiraiyan added that the rebels suffered no casualties in the fighting in Mannar. The military denied the clashes had taken place. "There is no such advance by the army and no such casualties to the army in that area," said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened and analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. More than 5,000 people have been killed in clashes between the military and the rebels since early 2006. Wednesday's blasts came a week after a suicide bomber blew herself up in Colombo, killing a minister's aide. A parcel bomb killed 19 in a suburban Colombo shopping centre hours later. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were blamed for both attacks. A day before last week's bomb attacks in Colombo, Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran accused the international community of pandering to the government. In an annual address, he said he had no hope of a political settlement to end the nearly 25-year civil war and vowed that the guerrillas would fight on for an independent state. A government offensive has pushed the Tigers from strongholds in the east, and its troops are trying to wipe out the rebels entirely despite international calls for peace talks. The death toll since the war erupted in 1983 is around 70,000, and analysts say the conflict is likely to grind on for yea
