<TITLE> Ukraine president backs liberal Tymoshenko as PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Thu Dec 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Viktor Yushchenko on Thursday backed Yulia Tymoshenko to become Ukraine's prime minister for the second time despite a record of awkward differences between the two "Orange Revolution" allies. The president submitted a letter to parliament with the nomination and suggested that deputies proceed quickly with a vote to put her back in office. Tymoshenko, a former gas magnate who rouses crowds with calls for social justice, heads one of two "orange" groups making up a shaky post-election coalition in parliament. The "orange" coalition is made up of 227 deputies from Tymoshenko's bloc and the pro-presidential Our Ukraine party -- one more than the number of votes needed to secure election. "I will do everything so that the Ukrainian parliament and a full-fledged government can begin work as quickly as possible," Yushchenko told reporters after submitting his letter. Speaking alongside Poland's president, he said it made little difference whether parliament first endorsed the prime minister or examined what "orange" coalition members see as key pieces of legislation. "The main thing is that in votes the coalition not be subject to friction on issues that could cause cracks in its attempts to consolidate," he said. "Every vote should count." Tymoshenko, with her trademark peasant braid and designer outfits, issued fiery calls to action at Yushchenko's side during the 2004 protests. She became prime minister immediately after he won a re-run of a rigged presidential election. SNIPING WITH THE PRESIDENT But while in office, Tymoshenko sniped constantly with the president and her government was split into two hostile camps. Relations worsened with Russia and she spooked investors with calls for a sweeping review of "dubious" privatizations. Tymoshenko's dismissal sowed disillusion among "orange" supporters and her disagreements with the president were the hallmark of the revolution's aftermath. She and Yushchenko reconciled in the runup to a September parliamentary election. The poll was called after the president dissolved parliament to stop what he said was an illegal grab for power by Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, his rival from the bruising 2004 presidential election. Speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk acknowledged the president's letter in the chamber and said the vote to endorse the prime minister had to take place within five days. He was due to meet the president later in the day to work out a possible timetable. Yatsenyuk is an ally of the president and his election on Tuesday gave heart to the two "orange" parties -- linked to the mass 2004 street protests that their coalition was viable. That vote dampened down speculation that some Our Ukraine members, reluctant to see Tymoshenko return to office, could splinter off to form a "broad coalition" with the Regions Party led by Yanukovich -- acting as caretaker prime minister. Presidential chief of staff Viktor Baloga had earlier on Thursday set down what "orange" members considered key legislation to be considered quickly. These included changes to a law passed last year, after Yanukovich took over as prime minister, curtailing the president's powers and proposals to strip deputies of immuni
