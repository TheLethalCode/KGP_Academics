 BUJUMBURA, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burundian civil servants said on Thursday they would extend a strike begun on Monday indefinitely until arrested union representatives were freed. The country's confederation of trade unions, known by its French acronym COSYBU, had originally planned to stay off work for three days starting on Monday, in protest at low wages. The government has called the strike illegal and said the employees should come back to work before they are punished, citing a 34 percent wage hike is due to start in January. "There are at least four representatives of trade unions in the countryside who have been arrested, others continue to be intimidated by local authorities," Tharcisse Gahungu, chairman of COSYBU, told reporters. "This is unacceptable. We will suspend the strike once those people are released." Burundian civil servants earn between $35 and $60 per month. Eighty-five percent of Burundi's public employees including teachers have taken part, with only essential workers staying on the job. Nurses, who had said they would not take part because the government had met some of their demands in earlier strikes, said they would join the strike on Friday. Burundi's government, struggling to boost its moribund economy after a 12-year civil war that killed 300,000, first said it would increase wages in July. Under International Monetary Fund pressure to raise revenues first, the government withheld the pay rise and said it would not have the money until January. A ministerial decree detailing the rise was released this week, but the confederation of trade unions said the decree was unclear on the allowances and other benefits to be given to the civil servants. A Burundian public advocacy group, the Organisation Against Corruption and Embezzlement, urged the two sides to agree, saying the strike was causing taxpayers a loss of 170 million Burundi francs ($150,600) a day.
