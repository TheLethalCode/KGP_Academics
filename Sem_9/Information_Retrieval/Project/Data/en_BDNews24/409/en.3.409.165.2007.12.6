 Beijing, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gas blast ripped through a coal mine in north China on Thursday, killing 46 and leaving scores trapped underground, an official government Web site and Xinhua news agency said of the latest tragedy to hit the industry. The explosion happened at a mine in Hongtong county in the northern province of Shanxi, China's largest coal-producing province. Rescue teams rushed to the site, where they managed to pull 5 to safety, Xinhua said. Li Yizhong, the head of China's work safety watchdog, led a work team to the site, which was investigating "hidden dangers" in the mining industry, it added. The country has been trying to tighten safety regulations but its coal industry is still the world's deadliest, claiming close to 5,000 lives last year. Last month, China warned coal mines to pay special attention to safety as the cold weather hits and they ramp up production to meet winter heating and power demand. In a separate report, Xinhua said 11 miners had been trapped since Monday after a tunnel collapsed at an illegal iron and gold mine in the northern province of Hebei
