 SEOUL, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea said on Thursday its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, had received a personal letter from US President George W Bush, who once publicly likened Kim to a spoiled child.

Since then, relations between Pyongyang and Washington have seen a noticeable thaw. The two countries became battlefield adversaries in 1950, after US troops were rushed to the peninsula to counter North Korea's invasion of the South.
