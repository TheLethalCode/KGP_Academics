 SYDNEY, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutchman Pim Verbeek has been named as Australia's new head coach, Football Federation Australia (FFA) said on Thursday. The 51-year-old Verbeek has agreed a contract to lead the Socceroos through to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa. Verbeek quit as South Korea coach after taking the team to third place at this year's Asian Cup. He previously worked with the Korean team as assistant to former Australia coach Guus Hiddink and has managed club sides in the Netherlands and Japan. The FFA turned to Verbeek after fellow Dutchman Dick Advocaat last month reneged on a contract to replace Graham Arnold as Socceroos coach. Arnold has been coaching the team since Hiddink quit after leading Australia to the second round of last year's World Cup
