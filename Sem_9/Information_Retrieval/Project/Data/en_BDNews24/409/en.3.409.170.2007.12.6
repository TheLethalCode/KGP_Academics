 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Thursday said no individual citizen can file a sedition case against another. "No individual can file a sedition case. The incident belittles Bangladesh," the adviser told reporters at the law ministry. Mainul's comments came a day after freedom fighter Md Fazlur filed a sedition case against Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid, its assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Mollah and former chairman of Islami Bank Shah Md Abdul Hannan for anti-liberation activities. "Leave the matter to us. This is a complicated issue. Ask yourselves why could it not be addressed in the last 36 years." "We haven't come here to do politics; we will perform our own job. Our target has been stipulated. We will do whatever is needed for democracy. It is not possible on our part to solve all problems of the country," Mainul said. The case filed Wednesday under the Criminal Procedure Code with Dhaka CMM's Court is the first such case of treason or sedition in recent times. Metropolitan magistrate Imran Hossain Chowdhury heard the plaintiff's statement in the case. The case accuses the three of obstructing the emergence of an independent Bangladesh in 1971, and creating and ordering the Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams forces to kill pro-liberation civilians including intellectuals, women and children. The plaintiff said the accused committed crimes of treason by killing about 30 lakh people, raping about two lakh women and other ill activities. He also said that 36 years after independence, the accused did not yet recognise Bangladesh's victory, flag, constitution or Independence Day. Asked whether the elections would be held in time, Mainul said: "We are not worried about the election roadmap. There is no fear in people's minds about the election." "We are not detached from the public. The election will take place on time. The government's duty is not only to hold an election, but also to establish democracy through the election. We want to establish a transparent democratic government." On the introduction of the Right to Information Act the information adviser said, "We will pass the act. The next parliament will be responsible for sustaining the act." "This act is not only for good governance, it is also essential for dedicated journalism," said the information adviser. "All people concerned must support it so that the act can be passed in the next parliament. But only passing the act is not sufficient. Effective implementation is also necessary." bdnews24.com/mk
