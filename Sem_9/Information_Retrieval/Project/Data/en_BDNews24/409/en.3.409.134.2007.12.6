 Islamabad, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition parties are trying to reach agreement on their stand on the restoration of judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf as they finalise conditions for participation in January elections. Former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have said they will present Musharraf with a "charter of demands" to ensure a fair general election on Jan. 8 or else they would "move towards" a boycott. A boycott by the two main opposition parties and smaller allies would rob the vote of credibility and prolong instability in the nuclear-armed country that is crucial to US efforts to fight al Qaeda and bring peace to neighbouring Afghanistan. "Most of the issues have been decided with consensus. The remaining issues will be decided today. Today is the final sitting, we're going to finalise our list," said Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for Sharif's party, involved in drafting the demands. "We have agreed that we will rise above our petty differences and work for ensuring a free and fair election," said Iqbal, though he declined to give details. Another participant in the talks said the two sides were trying to patch up their differences over the issue of the restoration of 37 judges dismissed by Musharraf after he imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3. "I'm confident we will find an amicable solution to this issue," said the party official, who declined to be identified. Bhutto has said her party would reluctantly take part in the vote, while reserving the right to withdraw or to protest against an unfair result. She has already issued a manifesto and effectively began her campaign last weekend. Sharif, who has been visiting parts of the north of the country and meeting supporters this week, has called for a boycott unless the judges are reinstated. Despite his doubts about the election, Sharif registered to run but his nomination was rejected on Monday because of criminal convictions after his 1999 ouster by Musharraf that Sharif says were politically motivated. Bhutto returned from eight years of self-exile in October. Sharif, ousted by Musharraf in 1999 and sent into exile the next year, returned on Nov. 25. "MAXIMUM PRESSURE" Musharraf stepped down as army chief last week and was sworn in as a civilian president. He also promised that emergency rule would be lifted on Dec. 16, fulfilling two main demands of his rivals and his Western backers. But Musharraf has ruled out letting the judges back, some of whom remain under house arrest. Musharraf has been at odds with judiciary since he tried to sack the then chief justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry, in March. Critics say Musharraf's main motive for imposing emergency rule was to purge the judiciary of hostile judges, including Chaudhry, amid fears they were about to rule unconstitutional his Oct. 6 re-election by legislators. Sharif and lawyers opposed to the government planned to try to meet Chaudhry at his Islamabad home on Thursday although police put up barricades to stop them. Bhutto says the new parliament should decide on the fate of the judges. She has accused the government of planning to rig the election in favour of pro-Musharraf candidates and called for the reconstitution of the Election Commission. She has also questioned the neutrality of a caretaker government, made up of mostly of Musharraf supporters and installed last month to oversee the election. Analysts expect both of the main opposition parties will eventually take part after extracting maximum concessions. "They are trying to exert maximum pressure on the government to get an even playing field," said Talat Masood, a former general turned analyst
