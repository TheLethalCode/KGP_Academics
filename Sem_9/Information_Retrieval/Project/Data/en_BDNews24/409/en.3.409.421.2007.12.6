<TITLE> Kala Azar and other diseases making a lethal comeback? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Kala Azar (leishmaniasis), once eradicated in the Indian sub-continent, has made a threatening comeback recently in Bangladesh putting about 40 million people at risk. Epidemiologists say it is not Kala Azar alone, but that climate change may trigger the incidence of malaria, dengue and encephalitis too. With agriculture blighted, food production is likely to dwindle, undermining national food security. Food crises will lead to large-scale malnutrition, aggravating the incidence of many other diseases too. Dr Ainun Nishat, Bangladesh country representative of The World Conservation Union (IUCN), told bdnews24.com that climate change will increase the incidence of malaria, dengue and encephalitis. Dr Pradeep Kumar Bardhan, a researcher at ICDDR,Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com that frequent floods will increase the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases. Global temperature rises will lead to warmer water temperatures, promoting the propagation of cholera germs, he added. Shortfall in food production will certainly result in widespread malnutrition, Bardhan said, adding that all these disease-spreading factors will be linked to the phenomenal changes induced by climate change. The World Health Organisation has already begun researching the links between climate change and disease. The World Health Day 2008 theme will be 'Climate change and its impact on human health', highlighting the UN body's concerns over this newly arising issue. Dr Iqbal Kabir, technical officer at WHO's Dhaka office, told bdnews24.com that natural disasters such as cyclones impact people's health in the short-term, but can have a longer term impact on their well-being in significant ways. Diseases affecting communities in the wake of a natural calamity can be treated, Kabir pointed out, but the psycho-social impact and trauma of disasters can be long-lasting. Other medical experts say that public health facilities will be under terrible pressure as global temperatures rise due to pathogenic and viral epidemics, whose impact may be so severe as to put death tolls in the millions. Dr Ahsanuddin Ahmed, executive director of Centre for Global Change, told bdnews24.com that public health will certainly be threatened due to climate change, with scarcity of safe drinking water and malnutrition caused by food shortages further aggravating predicted epidemics. Rising temperatures during the hottest months will increase the frequency of dehydration and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases, he said. "Cholera will break out with renewed killing power, dengue will spread like wildfire and Kala Azar, the deadly disease once wiped out by our own forefathers, has already made a comebackall these are the curses of the current climate change we are witnessing," Ahmed said. bdnews2
