 GENEVA, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) appealed on Thursday for a record 1.09 billion Swiss francs ($973.2 million)to help save lives next year in Iraq, Sudan and other hotspots. The humanitarian agency also said worsening violence in many of the 80 countries where it works -- including Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Sri Lanka -- had driven large numbers of people from their homes. Many displaced persons live without basic services such as clean water. The ICRC, which distributes emergency aid and helps victims of conflict and violence, is seeking about 10 percent more from its donors for its 2008 field operations compared to its 2007 annual budget. "This record amount is mainly due to the ICRC's independent and neutral humanitarian approach, which has enabled it to gain access to certain conflict zones where the need for humanitarian aid is increasing," said ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger. Iraq will be the ICRC's largest operation in 2008 with a budget of more than 107 million Swiss francs -- nearly double the organisation's initial budget for the country this year. "This amount reflects the organisation's renewed commitment to meet acute medical needs in Iraq and to aid large numbers of Iraqis displaced within their own country," the ICRC said. Some 43 percent of the Geneva-headquartered agency's 2008 budget is earmarked for Africa. Sudan, where the ICRC is running a huge camp for displaced people in Gereida, South Darfur, is the second-largest operation, just behind Iraq at 106.4 million Swiss francs. The ICRC's field work in the Darfur region made Sudan its biggest programme in 2007. Israel and the Palestinian territories were next in line, with an ICRC appeal for 68.2 million Swiss francs for 2008, followed by Afghanistan at 60.3 million Swiss francs. The Afghan budget was 25 percent higher than in 2007 due to increased humanitarian needs in that count
