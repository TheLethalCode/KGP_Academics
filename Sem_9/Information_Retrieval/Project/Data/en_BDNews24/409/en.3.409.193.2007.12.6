 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Senior Dhaka University teachers Thursday observed a silent sit-in for the release of colleagues and students detained in connection with the August campus unrest The teachers also demanded freedom of thought in educational institutions. About 40 DU teachers held the half-hour sit-in in front of Aparajeyo Bangla from 11:30am carrying placards with slogans 'Free All Detained DU Teachers and Students Immediately', 'Uphold the Right to Justice and Conscientious Conduct', 'Keep the Educational Institutions Alive and Active'. Professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury, who joined the demonstration, told bdnews24.com: "The way the DU teachers had been treated was quite unexpected and sad in an autonomous organisation such as ours." "We certainly didn't expect university teachers to be sent to jail. I hope the higher court will ensure proper justice." Replying to a question, Chowdhury said: "The conscientious teachers stood by their students when they needed them most. There was nothing wrong with that." Dr Anisuzzaman said it was time to resort to action demanding the freedom of the teachers and students. "It's only expected that we should protest unjust practices as we are considered the nation's conscience," Professor Geeti Ara Nasreen said. When teachers, she said, get punished only because they protested injustice, then the university was no longer the promoter of freethinking. Professor MM Akash told bdnews24.com: "We are enforcing the sit-in demanding that all our detained colleagues and students be freed." The Dhaka University Teachers Association will hold an emergency meeting Friday, when a decision will be taken, he said. bdnews24
