<TITLE> Taiwan's Acer to become Olympic sponsor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Acer Inc, the world's third-largest PC vendor, said on Thursday it will become an Olympic sponsor to increase brand recognition as it seeks to boost its global presence. Acer declined to say how much it paid for the rights, but said the sponsorship would run from January 2009 to 2012 and would cover the Vancouver Winter games in 2010 and the London Summer games in 2012. It said that under the agreement, Acer would be listed among the worldwide top partners for both games. "The universality of the Olympic Games has a strong influence on us, as it brings people together, overcomes prejudice and gives full respect to diversity," Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said in a statement. "This principal is the basis of our winning formula to building Acer into a successful global company," he said. The announcement came a day after Acer's archrival, Lenovo, said it would end its sponsorship of the Olympic Games after the Beijing Games next year. Competing head-to-head with Lenovo -- behind US heavyweights Dell and Hewlett-Packard -- Acer, valued at about $5.2 billion, has seen its sales grow rapidly in European and Asian markets. "Acer has really been able to spread out its growth, and if they spend a limited amount of money to create a different kind of brand image (with the Olympics), then it's worthwhile," said Goldman Sachs analyst Henry King, who rates the firm at "buy". In October, Acer bought US computer brand Gateway for $710 million, making it the world's third-largest PC maker, posing a threat to market leaders like HP and Dell, analysts said. TOP PROGRAMME Global Olympic sponsorships offer companies exclusive rights to market their brand, but come at considerable cost. In the 2001-2004 period, covering one Winter Games and one Summer Games, the International Olympic Committee received more than $4 billion in revenues, a third of which came from corporate sponsors. The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme includes 10 or 11 companies who pay for worldwide marketing rights for a Winter or Summer Games within an exclusive product or service category, in this case computing equipment. German sports-apparel manufacturer Adidas recently signed a $200 million deal to become a partner of the 2012 London Games, a figure the company said was on a par with what they paid for a similar relationship with the Beijing Olympics. The TOP scheme was launched in 1985 after the success of the previous year's Los Angeles Olympics, which produced a profit of $223 million on the back of the first major sponsorship programme at the Games. In Taipei, Acer shares closed 1.2 percent higher at T$67.40 on Thursday, outperforming the benchmark TAIEX index, which gained 0.20 percent.
