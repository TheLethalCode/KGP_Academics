 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  A group of noted citizens Thursday protested law adviser Mainul Hosein's comment on the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace agreement. In a joint statement, they expressed concern at what they said was "the violation of neutrality by the law adviser" and demanded immediate withdrawal of the controversial statement. At a programmme organised by Samo Adhikar Andolon at the National Press Club on Dec 2 on the 10th anniversary of the peace agreement, Mainul said the peace agreement should be reviewed. According to allegations in the statement, Samo Adhikar Andolon, an extremist outfit, is patronised by "CHT godfather" Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan. Mainul said: "According to the constitution the Bangalees and the hills people will enjoy equal rights." The signatories to the statement include Justice KM Sobhan, Prof Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, novelist Selina Hossain, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, journalist Sohrab Hossain, rights leader Rokeya Kabir and advocate ZI Khan Panna. They alleged that the adviser compromised neutrality by joining the programme of "ultra-communalists". bdnew
