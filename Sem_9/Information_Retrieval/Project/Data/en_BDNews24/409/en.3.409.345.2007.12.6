 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) - BRAC has decided to waive micro-finance loans totalling Tk 100 crore that had been previously disbursed in cyclone-hit areas, the NGO said in a statement Thursday. The decision was taken after an initial assessment of the Sidr-affected areas, the statement said.

The organisation will also undertake extensive rehabilitation programmes in agricultural, fisheries and livestock sectors of those areas worst hit by Cyclone Sidr, the statement added. bd
