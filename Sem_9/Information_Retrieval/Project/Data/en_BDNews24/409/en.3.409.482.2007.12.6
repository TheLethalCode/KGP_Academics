 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court placed Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman on one day's remand in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani gave the order after ACC assistant director Md Toufiqul Alam had appealed to the court to place Tarique on remand for questioning in connection with his submitted wealth statement. Alam, the investigating officer in the case, had earlier produced the accused at the Dhaka CMM court on Dec 2 requesting one week's remand. As the case files could not be presented in the court on that date, the magistrate deferred the remand hearing. Tarique has so far been remanded for a total 10 days in four separate extortion cases filed against him, but he has not been taken in for interrogation on any of the cases to date. Thursday's remand petition said the accused was required to be questioned in connection with the information submitted in his wealth statement. Specifically he is to be questioned about deposits of Tk 35 lakh with Prime Bank and Tk 20 lakh with Dhaka Bank, and the sources of these funds; ownership of three plots of land; and ownership of the Bangla-language 'The Daily Dinkaal' newspaper. ACC deputy director Md Zahirul Huda filed the case against Tarique Rahmanin which his wife Dr Zobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu were named as co-accusedwith Kafrul Police Station on Sept 26. bdnews24.
