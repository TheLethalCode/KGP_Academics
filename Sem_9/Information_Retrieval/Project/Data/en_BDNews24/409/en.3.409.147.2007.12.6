 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)Tejgaon police Thursday refused to accept a sedition case against Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid, as they did not have the government's permission to do so. The police sent the case back to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. When freedom fighter Md Fazlur Rahman filed the case Wednesday with the CMM's court, the court directed Tejgaon Police Station to investigate the case after hearing the plaintiff's charges. Rahman sought permission to file the sedition case against Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid, assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Molla and former Islami Bank chairman Shah Md Abdul Hannan, a well-known Jamaat sympathiser. When the case was produced before the court of chief metropolitan magistrate AKM Enamul Huq Thursday, he mentioned "seen" on the case docket. Answering a question from reporters, law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein said that no individual citizen can file a sedition case. bdnews24.
