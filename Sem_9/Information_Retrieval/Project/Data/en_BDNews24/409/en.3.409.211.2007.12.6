 Hong Kong, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks hit three-week highs on Thursday as fears of a US recession receded on the back of upbeat US data, but expectations of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England weighed on the euro and sterling. Hopes of lower borrowing costs in Britain and a steady European central bank were expected to buoy stocks in Europe, where financial bookmakers predicted modest opening gains of up to 0.5 percent. But worries that slower US growth would dampen demand saw oil slip below $87 a barrel to levels last seen in late October, even after OPEC shrugged off calls to boost output. Gold weighed by lower oil prices and a firmer dollar, wallowed below $800 an ounce. Reports on Wednesday showed US companies added staff in November at the fastest pace in a year and worker productivity rose at the strongest rate in four years in the third quarter, helping lift some of the gloom surrounding the US economy and sending Wall Street higher. "Investors were encouraged by the Wall Street rally, a sign that the US economy would not slide into recession as the Fed is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rates next Tuesday," said Andrew Wang, who manages $310 million for Prudential Financial in Taipei. Growing expectations of a US interest rate cut at the next Federal Reserve policy meeting on Dec. 11 have helped lift markets from last month's trough. Investors were also waiting for President George W Bush to unveil details of a plan later on Thursday to help struggling US homeowners avoid foreclosure and address a mortgage crisis that has threatened to slam the brakes on US growth and rattled investors worldwide. Tokyo's Nikkei average ended up 1.7 percent at a four-week closing high, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks climbed 1.2 percent by 0618 GMT to levels last seen on Nov. 15. The MSCI index is now just 7 percent away from its record high set on Nov. 1 and up 38 percent this year, well ahead of an 11.4 percent rise for MSCI's main world stock index EXPORTERS, BANKS SHINE Bank stocks were among the best performers, further boosted by positive news from American International Group, the world's largest insurer, which said its risks from the subprime crisis were manageable. Mitsubishi UFJ rallied 6.6 percent, Australia's Macquarie Group gained 1.8 percent and Citigroup's Tokyo shares put on 4.7 percent. MSCI's index of financial stocks in the Asia Pacific region rose 2.1 percent, outperforming the wider market. Chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics were also in demand following reports of higher DRAM prices and hopes that a year-long fall in computer memory prices has bottomed. Investors bought some of the region's top exporters as worries about the US economy eased, driving both Sony Corp and Hyundai Motor up more than 2 percent. Exporters also benefited from a stronger greenback, as it tends to help boost the value of dollar sales. DOLLAR FIRM The dollar rose to a near one-week high above 111 yen well off Wednesday's low of about 109.70 yen, while the euro briefly plumbed a three-week low of about $1.4570 before clawing back to be little changed from late New York levels. Against the yen, the euro was slightly firmer at around 162.21 yen Sterling steadied at about $2.02 after falling from above $2.06, pressured by expectations of a rate cut by the Bank of England. "Given the speed with which financial markets distress has helped to derail UK growth prospects, investors will likely be disappointed by anything less than a cut," Citigroup currency strategists said in a note to clients. Improving appetite for riskier assets is usually bad news for the Japanese currency as investors sell the low-yielding unit to fund purchases of riskier but better yielding assets. In a sign of growing risk appetite, yield spreads between emerging market debt and US Treasury notes narrowed a further 7 basis points, following Wednesday's 5-tick contraction. Safe-haven government bonds lost ground as investors sought riskier assets, pushing yields higher. Japan's benchmark 10-year bonds rose 6.5 basis points to a one-month high of 1.555 percent
