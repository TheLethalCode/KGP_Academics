 LONDON, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Muslim woman who had written religious poetry praising attacks on "non-believers" walked free from court on Thursday with a suspended sentence after a report said she was "extremely unlikely" to offend again. Samina Malik, 23, who liked to call herself the "Lyrical Terrorist" for the poetry she had written, was sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for 18 months, at the Old Bailey. Malik last month became the first woman to be convicted on charges of terrorism in Britain. She had been found guilty of possessing terrorism-related documents. The court heard that Malik wrote and posted poems on Web sites about killing "non-believers", pursuing "martyrdom" and raising children to be "holy fighters". Malik, from Southall, west London, worked at a newspaper shop at Heathrow airport until her arrest. During the trial, the court heard one of Malik's poems "How to Behead," describing in detail how to slice off a hostage's head. The prosecution also told the court that Malik wore a bracelet with the word "Jihad" inscribed on it and had Osama bin Laden's "Declaration of War" on her computer. Other material on her computer referred to car bombs, bomb-making and of her hatred of all non-Muslims. On Thursday, Judge Peter Beaumont ordered Malik to remain under the supervision of the probation service for 18 months and perform 12 months unpaid work for the community. Malik had spent five months on remand awaiting trial before being put under effective house arrest while awaiting sentence. The judge had been told in a pre-sentence report that Malik was extremely unlikely to offend again. Police who raided Malik's home found a piece of paper on which she had written: "The desire within me increases every day to go for martyrdom, the need to go increases second by second." Malik told her trial she had changed her writing name from Lyrical Babe to Lyrical Terrorist because she thought it was "cool". Outside the court Malik's solicitor Iqbal Ahmed said the trial had been a "terrible ordeal" for her. "She is relieved that it is all over ... she now wants to get on with her life."
