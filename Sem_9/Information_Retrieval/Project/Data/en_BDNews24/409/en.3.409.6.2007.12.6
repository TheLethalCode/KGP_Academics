 MILAN, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan host Torino on Sunday (1400 GMT) hoping to extend their healthy Serie A lead despite a fresh injury setback. The champions beat Lazio 3-0 at home on Wednesday without midfielders Luis Figo, Patrick Vieira, Dejan Stankovic and Olivier Dacourt. Frenchman Dacourt had been expected to return in little more than a month after minor knee surgery but could now be missing for the season. "It seemed like he'd be out for 40 days instead now there is a risk the championship is finished for Olivier," Inter boss Roberto Mancini told reporters. Unbeaten Inter have such belief at the moment that another injury problem is unlikely to knock them off their stride, especially with Stankovic possibly returning at the weekend. Inter, on 34 points, are three ahead of second-placed AS Roma, who beat Cagliari 2-0 in their game in hand on Wednesday, and eight ahead of Juventus in third with all three having now played 14 games. Roma striker Francesco Totti managed an hour on Wednesday in his comeback from a month-and-a-half out with a foot problem. The captain wore a special boot and is expected to last longer in Sunday's trip to strugglers Livorno at 1400 GMT. The Tuscans have improved slightly of late and boast in-form ex-Roma striker Francesco Tavano. Juventus entertain Atalanta, who hammered Napoli 5-1 last weekend, with influential winger Mauro Camoranesi again a doubt, while Udinese, in fourth, welcome Sampdoria. Fifth-placed Fiorentina visit Palermo for Saturday's late game (1930 GMT) with Czech defender Tomas Ujfalusi ruled out with a knee problem. Struggling Lazio host Catania earlier in the day (1700 GMT). AC Milan's game at Reggina has been postponed because the European champions are in Japan for the Club World Cup
