<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Thursday upheld the High Court's verdict granting bail to BNP's ASM Hannan Shah in a case that accuses him of breaching emergency powers rules. A six-member Supreme Court bench of the Appellate Division headed by the Chief Justice Md Ruhul Amin issued the order after hearing a government appeal challenging the HC decision. "Hannan Shah appealed to the court asking for cancellation of the case filed against him and also for bail. But the bail petition should have been filed separately," deputy attorney general Syed Haider Ali said in court. "The High Court hasn't done quite right in granting him bail, when the accused appealed for cancellation of the case as a whole." Hannan Shah's counsel, barrister Rafique Ul Haque, in response to the government's argument, said: "Since Hannan Shah has been accused under EPR, the bail petition cannot be moved in the High Court." "That is why the bail petition had to be incorporated in the appeal for cancellation. But the High Court does have the power to grant bail too," Haque said. After hearing both sides, the Appellate Division bench said it did not condone the idea of granting bail when the bail petition formed part of the appeal for dismissal of a case. But considering the circumstances, the Supreme Court did not want to interfere with the High Court's verdict granting Hannan Shah bail. The SC bench upheld the bail order saying it would remain valid. The High Court granted Hannan Shah three weeks' bail on Nov 22. The court simultaneously asked the government to show cause why the case filed against Shah for breaching EPR should not be dismissed. On Nov 25, after he was granted bail, the government ordered Shah to be held in detention for one month under EPR. On the same day, after hearing Shah's writ petition against the detention order, the High Court issued a rule nisi on the government to explain why his detention order should not be declared illegal. Though granted bail, Shah will not be released as his detention order is still applicable. Tejgaon police filed the case against Hannan Shah and five others for breaching EPR on Nov 7, after former army chief Mahbubur Rahman was heckled during a clash occurring between the two BNP factions as they gathered at the late President Ziaur Rahman's grave to pay respects. Shah was arrested from his residence on the night of Nov 7. bdnews24.
