 Nusa Dua, Indonesia, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has invited major economies to Hawaii next month for a new round of talks about setting goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions, a senior US official said on Thursday. The White House sent invitations on Dec. 1 for the meeting of 17 major economies, which account for more than 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, said Harlan Watson, the chief US at UN climate talks in Bali, Indonesia. "The meeting will be held in Honolulu," Watson told Reuters. He said he believed the dates of the Hawaii meeting were Jan. 29 and 30. The United States held a first round of the talks in Washington in late September. -- For Reuters latest environment blogs click on: http://blogs.reuters.com/environment
