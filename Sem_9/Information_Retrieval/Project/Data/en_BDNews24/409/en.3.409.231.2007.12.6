 BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The EU's top court said on Thursday a German law requiring lower pay for overtime work than for normal hours violated EU anti-discrimination rules, in a ruling that could mean higher wages for many German women. "A lower rate of remuneration for overtime than for 'normal working hours' can constitute discrimination based on sex," the European Court of Justice said in a statement. "National legislation which leads part-time workers to be paid less than full-time workers for the same number of hours of work breaches the principle of equal pay where it affects a considerably higher percentage of women than men and is not objectively justified." Nearly 40 percent of all German women with jobs are part-timers, according to data from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working conditions. Almost 21 percent of all workers, male or female, in the euro zone's biggest economy were part-timers in 2002, the data showed. The court ruled in the case of German part-time teacher Ursula Voss, who worked enough extra hours for the total to be equal to a full-time position. She was paid less than a full-time teacher because German law states that overtime, no matter the type of contract, must be paid at a lower rate than normal working hours. The court asked the German court that referred the case to it to check whether part-time teaching was dominated by women. If so, the German court will have to rule that Voss be paid the same as a full-timer for her total hours worked.
