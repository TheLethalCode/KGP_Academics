<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Brazil and Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo said on Thursday he was quitting Santos and indicated he had received an offer from an English club. Luxemburgo, in his third stint at Pele's former club, told his Web site (http://luxemburgo.globo.com) he would not renew his contract when it ended on Dec. 31. "From this moment I will be open and ready to listen to a concrete offer from a club in England as well as other teams interested in my professional work," he said. "The reason for my departure is the fact I have not reached common ground (with Santos) over the project for the next two seasons. I respect and understand perfectly the position of the Santos board. "In these last few years we achieved important things for the club where president Marcelo Teixeira was fundamental. I'm eternally grateful to the supporters for the respect and unforgettable and outstanding moments in my professional life." Luxemburgo, who won the championship with Santos during his second spell, rejoined the club in December 2005 shortly after being fired by Real Madrid. He led Santos to fourth in the 2006 championship and the runners-up spot this year, 15 points behind winners Sao Paulo. LIBERTADORES CUP His biggest disappointment was failing to win the Libertadores Cup, a trophy which has always eluded him. Santos reached the semi-finals of South America's equivalent of the European Champions League but were knocked out by fellow Brazilians Gremio. Luxemburgo has also won the Brazilian championship with Palmeiras, Corinthians and Cruzeiro and is considered one of the finest coaches of his generation. His stint in charge of the national team was an unhappy one and ended after two years in 2000. Luxemburgo later became a central figure in a Congressional inquiry into Brazilian football and was quizzed over his business dealings and tax returns. He also admitted to police he had used a false birth certificate for much of his career. Luxemburgo said the certificate, which made him three years younger than his real age, was obtained by his father when he was an apprentice with Botafogo
