<TITLE> Credit worries hit financial stocks; yen slips </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sydney, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A credit ratings downgrade for US banking giant Citigroup sent Asian financial stocks skidding more than 2 percent on Friday, while the yen sagged after Japanese business sentiment dropped to two-year lows. European stocks, however, were expected to rebound from a bruising sell-off in the previous session with financial bookmakers expecting gains of up to 0.9 percent for the three major stock indexes. Copper fell almost 2 percent in Shanghai, and oil traded near $92.50 a barrel after Thursday's $2 fall as investors fretted that slower U.S. growth would take a toll on demand. Gold was steadier near $800 an ounce after a 2-percent fall. Developments overnight were a mixed bag for investors with solid U.S retail sales helping ease fears that the world's biggest economy was sliding into a recession. But a ratings downgrade for Citi by Moody's and warnings from Lehman Brothers about further write-downs due to the credit market crisis highlighted the ongoing threat to financial companies from the subprime mortgage meltdown. "This is nasty stuff ... and everybody who has been saying that things are fine, they were living in a dreamland. This has got truckloads to playout," said Paul Biddle, a portfolio manager with Souls Funds Management in Sydney. Investors also had to cope with the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) December tankan survey, which showed business sentiment in the world's second biggest economy falling to two-year lows, prompting investors to push back expectations of a BOJ rate hike further into 2008. Tokyo's Nikkei average ended 0.1 percent lower, extending Thursday's 2.5 percent drop, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks slid 1.3 percent to two-week lows by 0611 GMT, falling for a third session. The MSCI index is down about 11 percent from the Nov. 1 record high but still up 32.3 percent this year, outpacing a 10.2 percent gain for MSCI's key world stock index. FINANCIALS STUNG Banks dropped across the region, pushing MSCI's index for Asian financial stocks down as much as 2.6 percent to a 2- week low at one stage. The index was down 2.1 percent in afternoon trade. Moody's action on Citi deepened the gloom on a sector already hit by disappointment over the Federal Reserve's modest 25 basis point rate cut this week and doubts about a global plan to tackle the credit problem. Australia's top investment bank, Macquarie Group, slipped 1.3 percent, Japan's biggest bank Mitsubishi UFJ fell 4.8 percent and South Korea's top lender Kookmin Bank slid 3.4 percent. Resource stocks were also under pressure on concerns that slower global growth will crimp demand for their products. BHP Billiton lost 2.8 percent, while energy firm Inpex Holdings fell 3.3 percent. YEN SAGS The tankan report coupled with strong U.S. retail sales and producer prices data helped propel the dollar to a one-month high of about 112.65 yen The euro also firmed against the Japanese currency, rising to 164.65 yen from the overnight low of 163.57 yen, and climbed to $1.4641, off Thursday's low of about $1.4575 "Some have expected a possible rate hike by the Bank of Japan in February, but I don't think the BOJ can raise interest rates during the current business year after today's weak tankan results," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Despite the fall in stocks, Japanese government bonds remained under pressure, taking a breather after a strong rally earlier in the week. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose 3.5 ticks to 1.545 percent.
