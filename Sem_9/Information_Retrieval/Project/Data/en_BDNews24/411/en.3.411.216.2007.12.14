 MOGADISHU, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mortar fire forced scores of Somalis to flee their homes in escalating violence in the capital Mogadishu on Friday, doctors and residents said. At least 19 people have been killed in the past 24 hours, they said. The dead were left where they fell in the rubble-strewn streets of the coastal city, and explosions shook the ground for the second day this week as government troops and their Ethiopian allies fought Islamist insurgents.
