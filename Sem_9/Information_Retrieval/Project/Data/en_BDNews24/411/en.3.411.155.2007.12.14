 BRUSSELS, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union economy will continue to grow despite recent market turbulence because its fundamentals are strong, EU leaders said on Friday, but they stressed the need for reforms to help the bloc compete globally. EU leaders also said that because of the ongoing credit crunch it was crucial to keep monitoring markets, improve supervision and transparency for investors, markets and regulators, and review the role of credit rating agencies. "Consistent macroeconomic policies and stable financial markets are vital for sustained economic growth," the leaders said in a draft declaration after a quarterly summit. "The European Council, in view of the recent developments in the financial markets, emphasises that macroeconomic fundamentals in the EU are strong and that sustained economic growth is expected," they said. The global liquidity crunch in financial markets, triggered by the subprime mortgage market crisis in the United States, is one of the main reasons behind an expected slowdown in EU economic growth to 2.4 percent next year and in 2009 from 2.9 percent forecast by the European Commission for this year. The leaders said that to make the EU economy more resilient to external shocks and help it tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by global markets, EU members should continue to reform their economies. They said the so-called Lisbon Strategy of reforms, named after the Portuguese capital where it was initially agreed on in 2000, was working well and member states should continue to implement it. The European Commission said earlier this week that reforms aimed at boosting employment and economic growth rates since 2005 have boosted the potential growth rate of the 13 countries using the euro by 0.2 percent to 2.25 percent now. But some economists point out that while reforms may have played a role too, the recent improvement in EU public finances, record low unemployment or the millions of new jobs created since 2005 were more a result of fast economic growth. The leaders agreed they should spend more on education, innovation and research as central for the future of Europe. Focus should also be on higher employment rates, less red tape and simpler rules for companies as well as more energy efficiency, diverse energy sources and combating climate change. "This will... enhance Member States' capacity to compete in a globalised world," the joint declaration said. "The Lisbon Strategy is delivering. Further reforms at national and Community levels remain the key to long-term economic success."
