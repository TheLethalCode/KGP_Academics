<TITLE> `Too soon' to judge cbank plan, Citi in strife </TITLE>

 LONDON, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It is too early to judge whether a concerted action plan to grease the wheels of seized-up money markets will work, a top European central baker said on Friday, as US banking giant Citigroup faced fresh strife. European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch said it was unclear if Wednesday's joint initiative by the world's central banks to lower sky-high interbank lending rates would be enough to turn the corner. "We've seen some immediate results. Whether it's sufficient to restore confidence remains to be seen," he said at a news conference in Luxembourg. "In the immediate aftermath dollar spreads in term funding reduced to some extent ... but are still at high levels," he said. "We are partly facing a confidence crisis among banks." The Federal Reserve and counterparts in Europe, Canada and Britain announced joint action -- the Fed launched a temporary facility to let a wider number of banks borrow at favourable rates, and catered for affected foreign institutions via foreign exchange swap lines with the ECB and Swiss National Bank. In response, money market rates edged lower but not by much. Most experts say the credit crisis, which first bit in August when interbank lending dried up as banks realised they did not know which was dangerously exposed to a U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown, would only end once those banks trusted each other again. Subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back -- were bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe. Uncertainty about where the exposure lies remains intense. "Everybody who has been saying that things are fine, they were living in a dreamland. This has got truckloads to play out," said Paul Biddle, a portfolio manager with Souls Funds Management in Sydney. Euribor interbank interest rates edged lower on Friday for the second day in a row, but again only marginally. Three-month Euribor fixed at 4.941 percent compared to 4.948 percent on Thursday. CITI DOWNGRADED U.S. banking giant Citigroup said on Thursday it planned to rescue $49 billion of "structured investment vehicles", in a move that further strains its capital levels and may scupper a U.S. government-endorsed SIV bailout plan. Moody's Investors Service downgraded its ratings on Citigroup debt one notch to "Aa3," saying it doubted the largest U.S. bank would succeed in rebuilding its capital ratios any time soon as it wrestles with billions of dollars of assets whose market value has declined. Citi's decision to move SIV assets to its balance sheet further ties up its capital in assets likely to produce low returns, potentially hampering the bank's profitability and highlighting the balance sheet constraints hobbling some big institutions at the year-end. Questions are being posed about a planned "superfund" to bail out investment vehicles tied to the subprime mortgage market, with reports circulating that some banks which were expected to help out were losing interest as they doubted its ability to provide a solution to the credit crunch. Wreckage on financial balance sheets continues to mount. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said on Thursday that quarterly earnings fell 11 percent, hurt by write-downs in bond trading, although results beat analysts' average expectations. And on Wednesday, Bank of America and Wachovia Corp warned of further write-downs for the fourth quarter. The chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers said on Friday the turmoil would last well into 2008 and cause slower European growth. "I think the financial crisis will occupy us for a good while in 2008. We will have to say in what way and in to what degree the financial turmoil will impact the real economies," Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker told France Inter rad
