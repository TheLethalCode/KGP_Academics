<TITLE> EU insists in Bali on 2020 climate goals for rich </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nusa Dua, Indonesia, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union stuck on Friday to its insistence that UN talks in Bali should set stiff 2020 guidelines for rich nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, despite US opposition. "We continue to insist on including a reference to an indiciative emissions reduction range for developed countries for 2020," European Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said in a statement on the last day of the Dec. 3-14 meeting. He did not restate, however, an EU demand for a reference to cuts of 25 to 40 percent cuts below 1990 levels by 2020. A compromise draft text, meant to launch two years of negotiations for a global pact to fight climate change, dropped a key ambition of tough 2020 greenhouse emissions cuts for rich countries but retained a 2050 goal of at least halving world emissions.
