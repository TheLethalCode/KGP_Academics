 LONDON, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has agreed to release three British residents held at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp and send them back to Britain, Foreign Secretary David Miliband confirmed on Thursday. Washington refused a request from London to release a fourth British resident and talks were still under way about a fifth man, Miliband said in a statement. The United States had agreed that Jamil el-Banna, a Jordanian; Omar Deghayes, a Libyan; and Abdennour Sameur, an Algerian, would be returned to Britain "as soon as the practical arrangements can be made", Miliband said. Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer for the three men, said last Friday that they would be released. Miliband said Britain was making no commitment to allow the three to remain permanently in Britain. "Their immigration status will be reviewed ... and the same security considerations will apply to them as would apply to any other foreign national in this country," he said. "As always, all appropriate steps will be taken to protect national security," he added. Miliband asked US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in August to release the three men as well as Shaker Aamer, a Saudi national, and Binyam Mohamed, from Ethiopia. The five men were legally resident in Britain before their detention but are not British nationals. Miliband said the US government had "expressed significant additional security concerns" over Aamer and Mohammed. Washington had refused to release Aamer, it said. Both sides were still discussing Mohammed's case, although the US government was "not inclined to agree to his release and return", he said. The decision by Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government to ask for the men's release marks a shift from the previous government of Tony Blair, which secured the release of all nine British citizens held at the US prison camp in Cuba but maintained this was not responsible for detainees of other nationalities who had simply lived in Britain. Miliband said Britain would continue to discuss with the U.S. government how best to work with Washington to bring about the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison. The United States has faced fierce criticism worldwide for the detention without charge -- often for years -- of suspected al Qaeda and Taliban members at Guantanamo Bay as part of President George W. Bush's war on terrorism. About 305 inmates are still held at the prison, including about 70 whom US military panels have cleared for release or transfer.
