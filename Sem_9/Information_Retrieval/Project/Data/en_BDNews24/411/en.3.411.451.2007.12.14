 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com) - Thirteen police officers have received special training on anti-terrorism assistance (ATA) in the United States, according to a US embassy press release. The US government-sponsored training programme was designed to advance security awareness and enable VIP protection capabilities. The 13 course graduates are the latest to join more than 700 Bangladeshi police officers who have already graduated from the ATA programme in the US. The programme offers a series of courses designed to help Bangladeshi police deal with crisis situations, provide protection to the VIPs and prevent and respond effectively to terrorism and other forms of violence. Police officers who took part in the ATA programme were those who played a critical role in the immediate aftermath of cyclone Sidr by maintaining order and helping international efforts to reach cyclone victims, the press release added. bdne
