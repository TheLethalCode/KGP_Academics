<TITLE> China public speaks out against chemical plant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nearly all the speakers on the first day of an unusual public forum in China voted against a planned chemical plant months after mass demonstrations against the project, state media said on Friday. Fifty-two of 57 speakers opposed the development of the plant in the city of Xiamen in the eastern province of Fujian. China has been struggling to control environmental pollution, a consequence of decades of unchecked economic growth, not only to curb degradation and reduce resource waste, but also because pollution has become a trigger for social unrest. The plant, if built, would make paraxylene, a petrochemical used in polyester and fabrics. In June, protesters, numbering 20,000 at their peak, demanded the government in Xiamen scrap, not just put off, its plans for the plant, saying it threatened the residents' health. Provincial authorities had invited residents to share their views and give suggestions on the proposed development in the Haicang district of the city. A further 42 people will voice their views on Friday. "Some of those who opposed the scheme are believed to either own or have plans to buy an apartment in Haicang," the China Daily said. "They argued that Xiamen has long been known for its beautiful scenery and for being one of the most livable cities in China." Participants in the forum were chosen by lottery on Tuesday, under the supervision of the Xiamen notary office, from 624 people who registered online or called a hotline number.
