<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's new batting hero Misbah-ul-Haq has backed his embattled captain Shoaib Malik and called on the cricket authorities and players to be patient with the 25-year-old successor to Inzamam-ul-Haq. Misbah, 33, scored 464 runs with two big hundreds in the recent series in India while Malik has been criticised for his form and captaincy after one-day and test series defeats to South Africa and India. The Pakistan Cricket Board will meet on Friday to review the performances in India. Malik has been appointed captain until the end of next year. "Malik is a young captain and he will take some time to learn the ropes. Like everyone else he will learn from his mistakes but needs time to prove himself," Misbah told reporters after the team's arrival from India to a lukewarm reception in Lahore on Thursday evening. "I would back Malik and say he must be given time to settle down. He needs the support of everyone at this stage." Some former players have called on the PCB to replace Malik as the test captain. Malik did not play the last two tests in India because of an ankle injury and a reluctant Younis Khan led the side in the drawn matches. Misbah said that his success in India has not come as a surprise to him. "I was ready for the pressure tour and playing in the tense Twenty20 World Cup matches helped me prepare for the Indian tour," he said. "I now just want to carry on playing in the same way and also score runs against Australia in the coming series.
