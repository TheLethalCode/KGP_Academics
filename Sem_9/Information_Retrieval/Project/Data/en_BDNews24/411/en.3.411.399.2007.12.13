 Bali, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka Thursday proposed the establishment of an International Adaptation Centre in Bangladesh, delegates to the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali said. Bangladesh asked the states parties to UNFCCC to back the offer made by Bangladesh delegation leader Ismat Jahan. Jahan, ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the UN, spoke at the Bali conference. "This institution will spearhead the sharing of know-how and practice to build necessary capacities among the vulnerable nations, pooling, sharing and building on each other's capacities," one of the delegates quoted Jahan as telling the conference. Jahan said global climate faced a set of unprecedented challenges that threatened the existence of mankind. She sounded an alarm that the damage would be "irreversible", if the "global community failed to take urgent and collective actions". Referring to climate change threats, Jahan said Bangladesh was vulnerable to cyclones, floods and droughts. "This climate related extreme weather events might hit Bangladesh with even higher intensity and greater frequency in the future," she said. Jahan asked the international community to undertake necessary measures with renewed urgency to prevent further climatic disasters in Bangladesh. She urged major emitters, bearing in mind the Rio-principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" to join together in setting and implementing a legally binding global emission reduction target.
