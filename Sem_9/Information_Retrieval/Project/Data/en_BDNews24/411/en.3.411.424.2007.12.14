 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Zahid Reza, the 5-year-old, had been asleep through that fateful night of Dec 10, 1971. He woke up the following morning to find a house mourning its mentor, Zahid's father Sirajuddin Hossain who went missing since. The child grew up and with the passing of every year, he came to know bit by bit about his greatest losswhatever the elders could gather that night long time back. How does he feel about the media asking them about their mourning? Zahid said, "I would've felt bad if I weren't a journalist myself. I feel solaced too at the fact that at least once a year, people spare time to show up with their curious queries, talk about punishing the offenders who designed and carried out those killings. "It's all right with me that people remember those who made their ultimate sacrifices in 1971, especially in this month." "Initially, I'd hardly understood what I lost that night. I remember everybody at home was weeping. Growing up, I appreciated that my father's demise was not our family bereavement only, it was much more than that," said Zahid, when asked about his realisation of the hard fact. Zahid sounded sanguine about the possibility of the long-awaited trials of the 1971 war criminals. "The Cambodians are holding trials of the Pol Pot marauders after all these years, you see. War crimes keep the sufferers awake through their lives, you know. It's never too late to start the trials of the 1971 war criminals," he said. "They held trials of the Nazis. Rwanda, Kosovo and Bosnia haven't stopped short in initiating such processes. Any patriotic government in Bangladesh must initiate the process." He said there would be no dearth of data and information if any government embarked upon the essential gesture. "There exists enough evidence on the atrocities committed by the Al Badr, Al Shams and other collaborators of the Pakistanis. What is lacking now is the positive intention of doing the job." Bangladesh should try the war criminals at least to establish its image as a civilised nation on the global scene, he said with conviction. Asked if his sense of loss persists at a greater level beyond the personal, Zahid said, "The killers wanted to render Bangladesh a wasteland, devoid of all merits. Well, we all realise to this day that that vacuum hasn't been refurbished." "For me, the loss of my father was losing our guardian through crushing, denying human rights. But systematically liquidating the best merits amounted to irreparable loss to the nation." bdne
