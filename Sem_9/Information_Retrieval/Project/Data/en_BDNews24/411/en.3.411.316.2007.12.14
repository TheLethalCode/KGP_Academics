 TEHRAN, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A coalition of Iranian reformists on Friday criticised President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his hardline policies and said they were worsening a crisis with the international community. Iranian reformists and some senior clerics, including former president Mohammad Khatami, have challenged Ahmadinejad's nuclear policy, blaming him for the imposition of tougher UN and US sanctions in response to Tehran's atomic work. The Coalition of Reformist Groups said reformists planned to field candidates in the Islamic state's parliamentary elections in 2008, after winning seats in local council elections last year in a turnout that has boosted their confidence. "People in the country are witnessing the country's (isolated) position in the international arena and the two (U.N. Security Council) resolutions that has been imposed on Iran," former education minister Morteza Haji told a news conference at the coalition's building in Tehran. Haji, who also heads the coalition in the capital Tehran, called Ahmadinejad's government "the most unstable government" the country has ever had since the 1979 Islamic revolution. "We (reformists) believe the only way out of these threats and sanctions is with people's votes," Abdollah Naseri, the coalition's spokesman said. Domestic criticism of the handling of Iran's nuclear policy is unusual and sensitive because it is seen as a matter of national security. Iran is at a standoff with the West over its disputed nuclear programme. Tehran says its atomic work is peaceful and aimed at generating electricity, but Western countries fear it is a cover to build bombs. The U.N. Security Council has imposed two rounds of limited sanctions on Iran since last December over Tehran's failure to heed a UN demand to halt uranium enrichment. Reformists believe Iran should temporarily suspend enrichment, as it did under Khatami. Ahmadinejad has remained defiant, calling the two sanction resolutions "a piece of torn paper" and denouncing as "traitors" Iranian politicians who want the country to suspend its nuclear work. Iran's reformists, who want political and social change, were swept out of power when they lost control of parliament and then the presidency in 2005. Asked whether reformists were concerned that the conservative-controlled Guardian Council, which vets assembly candidates, would bar many of their candidates, Naseri said: "What we think about is a healthy, competitive and fair elections. We will continue our activities." Haji said the coalition will "continue to criticise and evaluate the government".
