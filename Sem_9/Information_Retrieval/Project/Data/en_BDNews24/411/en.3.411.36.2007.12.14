 BANGKOK, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's beleaguered soccer federation is yet to respond to demands by the sport's top bodies to halt political interference in its domestic game, 10 days after promising to find a solution. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said that following a high-level meeting with an Iranian sports delegation in Kuala Lumpur, nothing had been resolved.

The dispute surrounds the candidacy of Mohammad Aliabadi, one of Iran's vice-presidents, head of the PEO, and prime candidate to win an election that was initially scheduled for Dec. 6. That poll was postponed after FIFA said it would not recognise the result. Iran were temporarily suspended from international matches in November last year because of political meddling in domestic soccer, mainly by the PEO. A number of officials and high-profile coaches have been removed since president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a soccer fan, took office in 2005. The standoff has prevented Iran from hiring a new national team coach ahead of 2010 World Cup qualifiers starting in February. German Winfried Schaefer and former French national team coach Jacques Santini are reported to be candidates for the post
