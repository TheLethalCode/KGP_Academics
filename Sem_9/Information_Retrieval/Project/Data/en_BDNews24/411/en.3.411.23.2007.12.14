<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  The construction of the Swadinata Stombho, or independence tower, has not completed almost 10 years after the project took off. The Awami League government in 1998 took up the project to erect a 100-foot tower in the Suhrawardy Udyan near Dhaka University. The Ministry of Cultural Affairs was initially in charge of the project. The governments in tandem reviewed the projects, putting brakes on the work. The BNP, after sweeping to power in partnership with Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh in 2001, initially scrapped the project work. The coalition government later ordered a review of the project. It formed the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs and transferred the project to it for implementation. Officials now are not sure when the tower would be raised. Initially, some works on the project were complete but work on the main tower never took off. Abul Kashem Mahbubul Alam, secretary to the liberation war affairs ministry, has said they hope the work on the stalled project would start in the next fiscal year, starting in July. He said the public works ministry was working to approve a draft of the project proposal to construct the monument. "We hope to get the draft by the end of this month from the public works ministry. Then it will go to the Planning Commission in January. It will be placed before ECNEC for approval then," the secretary told bdnews24.com. According to the project details, the first phase covers construction of the basement, fountain and mural, and the main tower in the second phase. Originally, the cost of the project was set at about Tk 81.28 crore. The cost of the 100-foot tower was fixed Tk1.75 crore. Later in 1999, a delegation led by the then public works secretary visited some countries to see similar monuments. After their visit, they proposed to construct a 150-foot glass tower instead. The cost of the tower was re-fixed at Tk 67.70 crore. The new proposals got approval on July 10, 2001 from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council and the total cost was refixed at 171.28 crore. By this time, the BNP-led coalition stepped in and formed a committee headed by engineer MR Osmani. The committee later proposed to construct a 100-foot tower instead of the 150-foot glass tower. The tower's cost was refixed at Tk 1.75 crore. But the coalition government did not complete the project before its tenure expired in 2006 in political chaos. The current interim government, meanwhile, formed another committee headed by Jamilur Reza Choudhury. The committee proposed to scrap the plan by the Osmani-led committee and suggested construction of the 150-foot glass tower. Secretary Mahbubul Alam said they would invite design for the tower to select a final one. bdnews24.com/ahd/ehb/
