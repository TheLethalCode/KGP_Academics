 PARIS, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libya's foreign minister lambasted his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner on Friday for disparaging Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and dismissed criticism of his country's human rights record. Kouchner, a former humanitarian campaigner, said earlier this week he was "resigned" to the Libyan leader's visit to Paris and has not met Gaddafi during his trip. Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdel-Rahman Shalgam told a news conference that was in stark contrast to Kouchner's behaviour when he accompanied President Nicolas Sarkozy on a trip to Libya after the release of six foreign medics in July. "If he doesn't want to see us, we don't want to see him either," Shalgam said, adding Kouchner's decision to stay away from the Libyan delegation had had no impact on talks. He said Kouchner was "someone who comes to Libya, who eats with us, who talks to us and who signs (deals) with us, and then when we come to Paris he changes everything, notably the ideas he shared with us in Tripoli". Gaddafi has spent the past four days in Paris, staying at the French president's guest residence and pitching his Bedouin tent, where he receives guests, in its garden. The visit is his first to France in 34 years, marking a thaw in relations with the West. But it has angered rights groups and the opposition, who say he is guilty of regular rights abuses. They accuse Sarkozy of putting business deals before principles after he and Gaddafi oversaw the signing of a series of agreements in areas including on arms and nuclear energy. Sarkozy says Gaddafi has deserved better treatment for renouncing his weapons of mass destruction programme in 2003, abandoning support for terrorism and releasing the foreign medics in July this year, which Sarkozy takes credit for. The French president said he raised the issue of human rights with Gaddafi, and his junior minister for rights, who criticised the visit earlier in the week, said Sarkozy had obtained "guarantees" on the issue from the Libyan leader. Gaddafi criticised France's record on rights earlier this week saying European countries abused the rights of African immigrants and that if they did not win equal treatment he would help those immigrants return to Africa. That prompted an angry response from Kouchner, who said Gaddafi's remarks were "rather pitiful" and condemned them. "We were surprised by his (Kouchner's) latest statements," Shalgam told reporters. "We have seen him on several occasions make statements in the morning and take them back in the evening." France and other countries were not in a position to criticise Libya for its human rights record, he said. "Libya is not a country that receives lessons," he said, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter who translated his remarks into French. "Because human rights in France or in Europe means the marriage of homosexuals and, on the other hand, polygamy is not a human right," he said.
