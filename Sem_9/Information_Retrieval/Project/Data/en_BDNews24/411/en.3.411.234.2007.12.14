 KAMPALA, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Diplomats from Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo met in Kampala on Friday to discuss border tensions that have triggered deadly clashes on one of Africa's hottest frontiers in the search for oil. "All the ministers are here, the meeting has started. We expect them to issue a communique around five o'clock (1400 GMT)," James Mugume, a senior Foreign Ministry official, told Reuters by telephone. A string of shootouts between the two former enemies on Lake Albert has killed a number of civilians since August, including a British contractor working for Canada's Heritage Oil Corp. In the most deadly clash, six civilians died in September when Ugandan troops opened fire on a Congolese passenger boat. Uganda and Congo fought a 1998-2003 war that also involved five other African countries. DRC Foreign Minister Mbusa Nyamwisi and his Ugandan counterpart Sam Kutesa are leading the talks, which will focus on the border dispute, fishing rights on the lake and a review of a 1990 oil exploration agreement. Heritage and British-based Tullow Oil have discovered oil in the Albertine Basin, which spans the remote border. Tullow has three blocks, two in 50-50 partnership with Heritage. Between them they have drilled eight wells, all yielding crude. The two companies say exploration is at an early stage but estimate reserves which could be in excess of a billion barrels. They say they want to pump oil via a pipeline to the Kenyan coast, should they find more than 300 million barre
