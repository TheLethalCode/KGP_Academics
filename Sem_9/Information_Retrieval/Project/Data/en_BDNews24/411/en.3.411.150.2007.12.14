<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have recalled middle-order batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan for the third test against England next week. Dilshan, 31, was dropped for Sri Lanka's tour to Australia in November but returns in place of Jehan Mubarak, who struggled in the first two matches. Dilshan has played 42 tests and scored 2,152 runs at 37.10. He is also a useful part-time off spinner, who may be put into action on the spin-friendly Galle pitch. Pace bowler Dilhara Fernando will miss the test with an injured ankle and will be travelling to Australia for an operation. Uncapped pace bowler Chanaka Weladegera has been picked as his replacement. Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0. Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene (capt), Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Lasith Malinga, Malinga Bandara, Sujeewa de Silva, Muttiah Muralitharan, Chanaka Welagedera
