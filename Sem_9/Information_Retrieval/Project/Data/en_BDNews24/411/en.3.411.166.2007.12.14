 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors have made it their priority to stop Brazilian dangerman Kaka when the Argentines face AC Milan in Sunday's Club World Cup final. "Obviously we know what an incredible player Kaka is," Boca coach Miguel Angel Russo told reporters on Friday. "We must stop him. A defensive error could cost us dearly." The attacking midfielder delivered a stark warning to South American champions Boca in Yokohama on Thursday when his magic cut Japan's Urawa Reds to ribbons. The 1-0 scoreline flattered Urawa. Goalscorer Clarence Seedorf could have scored four had he taken all the chances that came his way courtesy of Kaka's brilliance. Kaka modestly deflected the praise lavished on him after Milan's semi-final win, brushing off the "fantasista" label used in Italy to describe playmakers of the very highest quality. "People call me a fantasista but my best quality is my decision-making," the European Footballer of the Year said. "I head for the goal. I've always been that sort of player." Kaka added with a smile: "I could see (Filippo) Inzaghi and Seedorf waiting for a cross and Seedorf was in a better position to score." Boca, who beat Tunisia's Etoile Sahel 1-0 on Wednesday, pledged to attack against the European champions Milan in the final at Yokohama's Nissan Stadium. "We will look to open them up," Russo said. "It's not only about Kaka. Milan will have to stop (Martin) Palermo and (Rodrigo) Palacio." Kaka was in the Milan side who were beaten on penalties by Boca in the Club World Cup's forerunner -- a one-off game between the champions of Europe and South America -- in 2003. "I don't like the word 'revenge' but this match is very important," the mercurial Brazilian added. "To win this tournament would mean a lot to me. "I've won a lot of trophies -- this is the only one I haven't got my hands on yet.
