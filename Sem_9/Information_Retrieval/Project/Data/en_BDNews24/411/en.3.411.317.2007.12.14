 KATHMANDU, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's government may agree in principle to abolish the monarchy in a deal to resolve a political deadlock with Maoist former rebels, but implement the decision only after fresh elections, a top minister said on Friday. The Maoists quit the government in September demanding an immediate end to monarchy, a move that forced an indefinite postponement of constituent assembly elections that had been set for last month.

The Maoists also want their fighters to be integrated into the national army, details of the whereabouts of hundreds of people missing in the war and compensation to the victims.
