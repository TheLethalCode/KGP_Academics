<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Fabio Capello was on the verge of becoming England's second foreign manager on Thursday after the Football Association (FA) board approved his appointment. Subject to final contractual agreement the 61-year-old will succeed Steve McClaren, who was sacked last month after England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, and become the second foreigner in the job following Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson (2001-06). Capello had talks with FA officials on Wednesday then travelled to his home in Switzerland, leaving his representatives to negotiate further on Thursday. "Discussions have continued throughout the day between the FA and Fabio Capello's advisers," director of communications Adrian Bevington said in a statement on the FA's Web site (www.thefa.com). "The FA board has also today approved Capello's appointment as England manager subject to the successful conclusion of these contract negotiations. These will continue tomorrow. "I want to stress there are no problems and we are going through the necessary process to reach a successful conclusion." SEVEN TITLES Capello, a former Italy international who collected 32 caps, won seven league titles in his native country with AC Milan, AS Roma and Juventus although Juve were stripped of the 2005 and 2006 championships won under him in the wake of an Italian match-fixing scandal. He also coached Real Madrid to the Spanish title in 1997 and again last season, after which they sacked him. Capello's finest hour was probably the 1994 Champions League final when Milan destroyed Barcelona 4-0. Local media reported that Capello planned to bring several Italian assistants to work alongside him including Franco Baldini, who worked with him previously. There is also likely to be one English coach among his backroom staff. Capello's first matches in charge will be a friendly against Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland at Wembley on Feb. 6 and a Paris friendly against France on March 26. England's first World Cup qualifier is in September. They have been drawn in a group alongside Croatia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra
