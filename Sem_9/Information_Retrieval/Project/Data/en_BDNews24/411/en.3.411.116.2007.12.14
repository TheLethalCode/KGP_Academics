<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Thabo Mbeki says the bitter contest to lead South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) could destroy the party that helped end apartheid. The ANC gathers on Dec. 16-20 to select a new leadership and set policies for the next five years. Mbeki is running for a third term as ANC president against deputy leader Jacob Zuma. "If division leads to retribution, that's what will destroy the ANC ... Part of our responsibility is to avoid such an outcome," Mbeki said in an interview with the Mail & Guardian newspaper on Friday. Zuma looks set to win the ANC leadership battle after taking a strong lead in branch nominations. A victory would virtually assure him of the South African presidency in the 20O9 election because of the party's electoral dominance. The ANC election has not been drawn along policy lines but rather has developed into a clash of personalities. The pair's rivalry stems from Mbeki's 2005 dismissal of Zuma as the country's deputy president after he was tied to a corruption scandal. The case against Zuma collapsed last year on procedural grounds but prosecutors have hinted they are likely to re-charge the controversial but popular Zulu politician. Mbeki is a shrewd strategist, more comfortable in small groups than with large crowds. Zuma is charismatic, a big draw among people who feel they have not benefited from Mbeki's leadership. "We must take this thing away from personalities -- the masses of our people are not in the least interested in who dances best," said Mbeki, who must step down as the country's leader in 2009. He is believed to want to stay on as ANC leader to retain political influence and help choose his successor. Mbeki's centrist policies have pleased the business community, which has benefited from strong economic growth and steady inflows of foreign capital. Critics say he has failed to address social and economic inequalities left by apartheid. Zuma, an anti-apartheid hero, has been vague on what policies he would pursue. He has vowed not to introduce sweeping changes or dramatically shift the country to the left despite pressure from his labour and communist supporters. Responding to accusations that he has stifled dissent, Mbeki said ANC members had not clearly pointed out his mistakes. "I've heard this, and I don't understand it. Do I look as if I've got horns? It's said that I block and inhibit open discussion -- that's puzzling to me; it's completely untrue. "Someone might present a point of view and I might contest it successfully. But I've never done it by wagging my fingers at people," Mbeki sa
