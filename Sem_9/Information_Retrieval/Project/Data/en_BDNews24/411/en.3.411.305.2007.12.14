 GAZA, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tensions between rival Palestinian factions flared in the Gaza Strip on Friday after ruling Hamas Islamists detained an adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas's government and three Fatah mourners were killed in an explosion. Hamas said its forces took Omar al-Ghoul, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, from his home in the highest-profile detention since the group seized the coastal strip in June after routing Abbas's secular Fatah faction. Abbas issued a terse statement, read out on Palestinian television, which condemned the abduction and accused Hamas of setting off an explosion that ripped through a funeral procession for three militants. They had been killed in an Israeli air strike on Thursday. Medical officials said at least three Fatah mourners were killed and 35 wounded in Friday's funeral blast.

Fayyad's information minister, Riyad al-Malki, called for Ghoul's immediate release. "Hamas and all of its parties are responsible for his life," Malki said, calling the abduction a message to Fatah leaders that "Gaza is closed to them". Ghoul is a well-known columnist for local newspapers and a frequent critic of Hamas. Abbas responded to the takeover of Gaza in June by dismissing a Hamas-led government and appointing Fayyad to run a Western-backed administration in the occupied West Bank. Hamas leaders have offered a long-term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
