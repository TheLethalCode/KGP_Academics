<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's policymaking presidium member Abdur Razzak Friday said recurrent governments run or backed by the military facilitated the rehabilitation of war criminals in Bangladesh. "It's a sad reality that the Al Badr, Al Shams and their accomplices are doing politics in this country in a bid to make it another Pakistan," he said after laying floral wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals' Memorial at Mirpur. Razzak, an organiser of the War of Independence, demanded that the state tried the war criminals. "After killing Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ziaur Rahman returned the war criminals their right to engage in politics, who dare say it in public today that the 1971 war was a civil war, as many Pakistanis would say in those days." Paying homage to the martyred intellectuals, the AL presidium member said," The friends of the Pakistani occupation forces massacred the Bangalee intellectuals on the eve of the Victory Day when they realised that their end was imminent." "People of Bangladesh shed blood to earn freedom. The nation is determined to uphold its freedom at any cost. The future citizens must be aware of everything that's happening around us." AL presidium members Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Mannan and Subid Ali Bhuiyan were also present at the time. bdnews24
