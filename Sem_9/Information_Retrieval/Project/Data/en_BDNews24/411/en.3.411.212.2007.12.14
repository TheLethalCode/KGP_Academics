 MALE, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Maldivian men have been sentenced to 15 years in jail for carrying out a bombing that wounded 12 tourists, the first recorded attack by Islamic militants in the Indian Ocean island chain. Moosa Inas, Ahmed Naseer and Mohamed Sobah were found guilty under the Maldives Terrorism Act of "causing bodily harm with the intention of creating fear or terror", after they confessed to planting and detonating the bomb in the capital Male's Sultan Park.

"They confessed to their crime requesting the court to finish the case as soon as possible by issuing a justified verdict." The Maldives remains on high alert, with the Government aware a further militant attack could be fatal to the reputation of the Maldives as a tourist idyll. Celebrities and honeymooners pay up to $1,000 a night to stay in villas standing on stilts in the island chain's 60 resorts. In November, police uncovered a plot to detonate a second device simultaneously with the Sultan Park bomb. The explosion has led to speculation about links between international Islamist militant organisations and the Maldives. The Indian newspaper the Hindu alleged links between the Sultan Park bombers and Kashmiri group Lashkar-e-Taiba, while a propaganda video shot inside a radical Maldives mosque was posted on an Internet forum associated with al Qaeda in Novemb
