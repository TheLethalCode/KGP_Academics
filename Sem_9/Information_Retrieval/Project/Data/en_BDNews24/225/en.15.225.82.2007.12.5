<TITLE> Japan education angst grows after OECD rank slips </TITLE>

 Tokyo, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese angst about what ails the nation's schools, often criticised for stifling the creativity needed to compete globally, has been fanned by a report showing a dip in students' ranking in science, maths and reading. The OECD survey showed Japanese 15-year-olds fell to sixth place from second among 57 countries in science, to 10th place from sixth in maths and to 15th from 14th in reading. The report comes as Japanese experts are finalising proposals to boost class hours for core subjects, reversing reforms meant to help teach kids think for themselves. Newspapers on Wednesday were full of editorials bemoaning the declines, urging authorities to take action and warning that simply increasing classroom time was not enough. "Considering this situation, all of society ought to share a sense of crisis," said the Nikkei business daily. "If things go on like this, it will probably be linked to a decline in Japan's global status." The academic slippage comes three years after Japan tumbled from top place to sixth in maths in a similar OECD survey. That prompted a rethink of curriculum changes introduced in 2000 to create a more "relaxed" environment and reduce rote learning. "It is very unfortunate that 'relaxed' was taken to mean 'slack'," said top government spokesman Nobutaka Machimura, who was education minister when the reforms were introduced. The OECD report lauded Japan for giving both rich and poor students access to education, but it hit a nerve by exposing an apparent weakness in students' ability to think for themselves. "They have difficulties to apply their knowledge to novel situations," OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said in Tokyo on Tuesday when the report was released. Education was a top priority for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who last year achieved a long-held goal of conservatives when parliament revised a 1947 law on the basic aims of education to put more emphasis on patriotism and discipline in the schools. Abe resigned suddenly in September after a year of scandals among his cabinet ministers and an election drubbing. Since then, talk of the need for patriotism and traditional values has faded. An advisory panel to the education minister, however, has proposed increasing class hours for major subjects by more than 10 percent while reducing time for classes that give schools more discretion on what to teach and how. Media, though, warned against mistaking quantity for quality. "Simply increasing class hours is not a quick fix," the Mainichi newspaper said. The survey by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is conducted every three years.
