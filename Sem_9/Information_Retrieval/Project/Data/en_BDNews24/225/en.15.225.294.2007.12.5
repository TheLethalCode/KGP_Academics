 Islamabad, Dec 5 (bdnews24.,com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities have ordered two US human rights activists out of the country after they held a vigil to protest against the detention of an opposition lawyer, one of the activists said on Wednesday. Security officials picked up the two, Medea Benjamin and Tighe Barry, in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday and held them for several hours before ordering them to leave the country and releasing them. "They are revoking our visas and instructed us to leave the country today," Benjamin, an activist from the Code Pink anti-war group, told Reuters by telephone from Lahore. The two had been holding a vigil outside the house of Aitzaz Ahsan, an opposition politician and lawyer who has been held in detention, at first in prison and later at his Lahore home, since President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3. Police stopped US Ambassador Anne Patterson from meeting Ahsan on Monday. Benjamin said authorities had given no reason for deporting them: "They said in an emergency, they did not need to give a reason for their actions." "If they can do this to a US citizen who has all kind of liberties and rights, imagine what they can do to their own people," she said. "This action shows there is no democracy. There is dictatorship. They wanted to terrorise us." The government says it has released more than 5,000 detainees picked up under the emergency, but a small number of judges and lawyers, whose interpretation of the law posed the most serious challenge to Musharraf's authority, remain under house arrest. Musharraf, an important US ally in the campaign against Islamist militancy, stepped down as army chief last week and said the state of emergency would be lifted on Dec. 16. A general election is scheduled for Jan. 8 although opposition parties are considering a boycott unless steps are taken to ensure a fair vote. "In such a situation, you cannot expect a free and fair election," said Benjamin. She said she and Barry planned to catch a flight out of Pakistan later on Wednesday. She would stage protests outside the Pakistani embassy in Washington, she said. A police official in Lahore said he had no information about the case and the Interior Ministry was handling it. Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. A US embassy spokeswoman said consular officers in Lahore had been in contact with the pair while they were detained on Tuesday.
