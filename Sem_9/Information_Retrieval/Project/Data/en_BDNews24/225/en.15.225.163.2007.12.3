 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)The Rapid Action Battalion Monday arrested nine alleged muggers, including their 'boss' Aziz, in Mohammadpur area. Those arrested were engaged allegedly in cheating and mugging people whom they first rendered unconscious, RAB-2 commander Md Akbar Ali said at a press conference in his office. Akbar said that the arrestees had long been mugging people in different areas of the city by sedating unsuspecting victims. "They used drugs in snacks or tea for the victims and robbed them of their possessions after they fell unconscious," he said. Aziz boasted having more than 50 "disciples" in the city and most of them however had left his cartel, with only five or six still active in Dhaka, he said. RAB officials said Aziz had disclosed details about his gang in interrogation which led to the arrest of the remaining eight. The eight arrestees are Azahar Ali, Zahir Akand, Abul Hossain, Ripon Sardar, Nasir Uddin, Md Alam nicknamed Reaz, Yusuf Ali and Liton. bdnew
