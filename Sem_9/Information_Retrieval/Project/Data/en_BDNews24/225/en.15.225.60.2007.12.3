 BELGRADE, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo's political limbo is unsustainable and its future must be decided, EU mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said ahead of a final visit to the region on Monday before reporting to the United Nations. As he headed to Kosovo and Serbia with US and Russian mediators, he said next week's report on the breakaway province would not recommend a solution but would make clear one is long overdue. The mediators will give Serb and Kosovo Albanian leaders a draft version of their report, due to be submitted to the United Nations by Dec. 10. Kosovo's Albanian majority plans to declare independence after that, probably in early 2008. "This report will offer a detailed review of the 120 days of negotiations with both sides," Ischinger told Belgrade's B92 radio. He said it would contain no proposals. "It's not the job of the troika (the EU, the United States and Russia) to tell members of the Security Council or the Secretary General what should happen after the end of the troika mandate on Dec 10." The envoy said he personally felt that all avenues for compromise had been exhausted. There was no common ground between Serbia's offer of broad autonomy and the Albanian demand for independence after eight years of U.N. rule. In comments to daily Blic, Ischinger said a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo was one possible scenario. "I believe this will be coordinated as much as possible with the EU, US and other countries," he said. "One thing is certain: the status quo is unsustainable and a decision is necessary". MEDIATION ENDS Kosovo has been under UN rule since 1999, when NATO bombs expelled Serb forces accused of the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanian civilians while battling separatist rebels. Almost 18 months of negotiations, led first by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, have failed to produce any hint of compromise. Russia blocked Ahtisaari's plan for EU-supervised independence at the UN Security Council, and says talks must continue. The United States and European Union say mediation ends with the mediators' report. There are signs of increasing unity in the 27-member EU to support a declaration of independence. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Monday that in recent weeks the EU had "worked a lot and there has been some progress towards agreement". "I insist on the need not to take hasty decisions because this process ... requires a little bit more time," he said during a visit to Albania. "This big operation will be irreparably ruined if there were hasty gestures on December 10." Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country assumes the EU presidency on Jan. 1, said Kosovo's path to independence should be "coordinated internationally". "We need a little more time for that," Rupel told German business daily Handelsblatt, but added: "The Kosovars must definitely not wait another year for independence." Serbia has warned of violent unrest in the Balkans if Kosovo becomes independent, raising the possibility that minority Serbs in Bosnia and Albanians in Macedonia could in turn demand to secede from their stat
