<TITLE> Milan bid to snap European 'jinx' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan have the weight of history against them as they bid to end an unhappy run for European teams at the Club World Cup in Japan. But if the omens are against them, the memory of defeat by Boca Juniors in the tournament's forerunner in 2003 could bring out the best in the European champions. Both Barcelona and Liverpool were ambushed by Brazilian opponents despite dominating the past two finals of the revamped FIFA competition. South American champions Boca Juniors join Milan at the semi-final stage with added incentive of their own after having recently missed out on the Argentine title. "I haven't forgotten our defeat to Boca Juniors," said Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka. "In Europe the priority is the Champions League but we want this Club World Cup." New Zealand's Waitakere United face Iran's Sepahan in Friday's opening game under a new seven-team format, the winners to play Japan's Urawa Reds in the quarter-finals. Urawa beat Sepahan in last month's Asian Champions League final and a rematch -- with a crack at Milan the prize -- could provide an explosive subplot. "There are plenty of rabbits in the forest," Sepahan coach Luka Bonacic in a cryptic warning to Urawa not underestimate his players. "We would love the chance to play Urawa again." Tunisia's Etoile Sahel and Pachuca of Mexico meet in tournament's first quarter-final on Dec. 10, a match unlikely to get the pulses racing among Japanese fans. EMPTY SEATS The quality on offer before the showcase final during the first two Club World Cups has been poor, with swathes of empty seats in the stadiums. FIFA President Sepp Blatter admitted last year that New Zealand amateurs Auckland City, albeit through no fault of their own, did little to boost the competition's credibility. The last two finals have been absorbing contests, however, with Internacional stunning Barcelona 1-0 last year and Sao Paulo pulling off a similar smash-and-grab win over Liverpool in 2005. FIFA staged a first world club championship in 2000 when Brazil's Corinthians won, but pulled the plug on the competition in 2001 after the collapse of marketing partner ISMM/ISL. Ballon d'Or winner Kaka insisted Milan had a score to settle after losing to Boca on penalties four years ago. "I have a burning desire to lift the Club World Cup," he said. "I only need to think of the courage of (Gennaro) Gattuso or the desire of (Paolo) Maldini to know we'll win it." Boca do not play their semi-final, against either Etoile Sahel or Pachuca, until Dec. 12 while AC Milan join the fray a day later. FIFA will test a new micro-chipped "smart ball" in Japan that should end any arguments about whether a ball crossed the goal-line with a view to using the technology at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa
