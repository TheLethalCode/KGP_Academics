 COPENHAGEN, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Danish government review has found that Denmark does not need a referendum to ratify the new European Union reform treaty as it does not transfer sovereignty from Copenhagen to Brussels. The Justice Ministry said on Tuesday in its legal review that the treaty could be ratified by parliament rather than in a referendum, sparking immediate protests from political parties and grassroots groups opposed to the European Union. "It is the opinion of the Justice Ministry that for Denmark the Lisbon Treaty does not transfer new powers of the country's authorities to the Union," the report said. "The ministry also finds that Danish ratification of the Lisbon Treaty does not raise additional questions in relation to the constitution." Despite the review, the government -- which is positive towards the EU -- may still opt for a referendum or be forced to hold one by a significant minority in parliament. The reform treaty, backed by EU leaders in October, replaces a planned constitution which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, triggering institutional crisis in the 27-nation bloc. Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who won a third term in elections last month, said the government would announce on Dec. 11 whether it would give Danes a vote on the charter. He told a news conference there were significant differences between the new treaty and the one French and Dutch voters rejected, such as the omission of mention of an EU constitution. "In the end it's always a political decision where many elements -- judicial as well as political -- are included," Rasmussen said. Last month he told Reuters he was confident he could steer Denmark to a "yes" if there was a referendum. On Dec. 13, EU leaders will sign the new charter in Lisbon. If the review had found that the treaty did transfer power, a referendum would be required by the Danish constitution. Danes have had a love-hate relationship with the EU since joining its predecessor, the European Economic Community, in 1973. They turned down the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 in a rebuff to the European Community that shocked financial markets. Voters approved the charter a year later, but with several opt-out clauses attached. Danes also rejected the euro in a 2000 vote. Last month, Rasmussen said Danes should have the chance to vote in the next four years on their current exemptions from EU cooperation, which include the euro, defence, justice and home affairs policies. Polls show nearly 80 percent support for Denmark's EU membership, but public backing is typically much lower on specific issues such as the reform trea
