 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Five applicants have pre-qualified for the Bibiyana 450 MW independent power plant (IPP). Mohammad Abdul Jalil, director general of the Power Cell, told bdnews24.com three proposals have fully pre-qualified and two others conditionally. If they fulfil the conditions, they would get the opportunity to bid in the final round, Jalil said. The government announced the bidders for the Bibiyana plant Tuesday after the power and mineral resources ministry evaluated six applicants. Korea Electric Power Corporation of South Korea and AES Corporation and Chevron Corporation of the USA have fully pre-qualified. The consortium of Powertek (Malaysia) and Siemens Projects Ventures (Germany), Summit Industrial and Mercantile Corporation (Bangladesh) and GE Energy (US) have conditionally pre-qualified pending their submission within 45 days of revised financial statements compliant with international accounting standards. The government required submission of IAS financial statements from bidders to verify their financial strength. YTL Power International (Malaysia) did not make it as it failed to meet the pre-qualification criteria. The 450MW Bibiyana IPP project will be implemented in line with a 22-year power purchase agreement. Bidding for the project is expected in the first quarter of 2008. bd
