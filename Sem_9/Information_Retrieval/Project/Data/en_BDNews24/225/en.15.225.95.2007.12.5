 KARACHI, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani paceman Rao Iftikhar has flown out to India to join up with the touring test side after the country's board turned down the touring selection committee's recommendation on a replacement for Sarfraz Ahmed. "Iftikhar has left for New Delhi and will join the team in Bangalore before the third and final test from Saturday," chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Shafqat Naghmi told reporters on Wednesday. Iftikhar, who has played one test and 39 one-day internationals, was not retained for the test series against India despite bowling well in the one-day series won by the hosts. Another board official said the touring committee had recommended uncapped paceman Abdul Rauf, but the board decided to send Iftikhar as he was more experienced and had done well in India. Iftikhar will replace reserve wicketkeeper Ahmed in the touring squad a week after Pakistan sent all rounder Yasir Arafat to India as a replacement for fast bowler Umar Gul, who has returned home because of a back problem
