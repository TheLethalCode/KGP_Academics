 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday asked knitwear manufacturers to diversify products in an effort to clinch broader access to the global market. As the manufacturers are expecting stiff competition from China in coming days, Fakhruddin asked the manufacturers to equip themselves with new products. He made the comment as he opened a knitwear exposition at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, organised by Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. "Bangladesh exports a limited number of goods. But the international market is now oriented to globalisation. Overseas business is now more competitive and based on knowledge and policy than ever before. We have to turn this challenge into a chance," he said. As China, which produces cheaper garment products, is set to see the withdrawal of the quota system imposed by Europe and the United States soon, producers like Bangladesh may run into tougher competition on the global market. The quota was imposed on Chinese products to protect local manufacturers in Europe and the US. On the other hand, he said, factory owners need to meet the demand of minimum wages of the workers in the wake of soaring prices of everyday essentials on the local market. "Negotiations are on with Russia, ASEAN member countries and neighbours for duty-free access of our products," Fakhruddin said. He said the economy would benefit to a great deal if the negotiations are successful. Currently Bangladeshi goods have duty-free access to the European Union, Canada, Australia and Norway, he said. There is also a possibility of more trade among the South Asian nations once SAFTA gets implemented fully, Fakhruddin said. He referred to a bill already placed in the US Congress and said if the bill was passed it would ensure duty-free access for Bangladeshi products to the US market. "There is tension among businessmen over the upcoming situation," Fakhruddin said. "So, to keep up export growth, productivity of export-oriented companies has to be increased and the quality of goods has to be improved," he said. The knitwear sector grew 35.38 percent in fiscal 2005-06 and 19.30 percent in fiscal 2006-07, which Fakhruddin said was encouragingcompared to other export sectors. He assured the manufacturers of continuous support so that they can expand the market globally. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam and disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury also attended the programme while BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque chaired the session. Azizul also asked the manufacturers to keep their efforts up in mitigating possible challenges the sector may face. Fazlul Hoque said exports in the knitwear sector overrode the woven sector in the first quarter of the current fiscal year and it would continue to grow. He said the sector, which employs over one million people, needed further support from the government. Bank loans with low-interest rate and a solution to the power crisis could help the sector grow further, Hoque said. bdnews24.com/
