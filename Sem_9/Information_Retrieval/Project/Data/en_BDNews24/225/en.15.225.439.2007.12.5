 Manila, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippines police captured a soldier who took part in last week's botched coup attempt and removed 29 of their own officers, including a deputy police chief, from their posts in a probe into the mutiny. Police hunting for soldiers involved in the coup attempt nabbed a private in the marines at around 4 am (2000 GMT) on Wednesday trying to board a flight to Detroit at Manila's international airport. Alvin Celestino, who had a working visa for the United States, was on a wanted list. Separately, the national police chief criticised his forces for failing to stop the leaders of the failed mutiny from leaving a Manila courthouse where they were already on trial for a previous coup. They walked several kilometres to a luxury hotel, where they held out for six hours. "These officers were assigned to city hall at that time and they did nothing to stop the soldiers," Avelino Razon told Reuters. The government also wants the mayor of Manila's financial district, Jejomar Binay to explain why security was so lax. Binay, a fierce foe of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, has said he had nothing to do with the events. The desperate attempt at sedition ended when SWAT police stormed the lobby using an armoured personnel carrier, tear gas and bullets. There were no casualties. Senator Antonio Trillanes, already on trial for a previous coup attempt in 2003, a former vice-president and 34 other people have been charged over last week's standoff.
