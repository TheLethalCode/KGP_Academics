<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina has said she is innocent and all charges against her are aimed at preventing her from contesting polls, her lawyers said Monday. "I don't think of myself. I wish the people stay fine. I am innocent. The case against me is designed to prevent me from contesting the polls," Hasina was quoted as saying by acting party chief Zillur Rahman. Zillur made the comment after Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Azizul Hoque Monday set Dec 9 to continue trial proceedings of a case involving charges of extortion against Hasina. The judge gave the decision after the first day of proceedings that took place on the Sangsad Bhaban premises in the presence of Hasina. Earlier in the morning the judge began hearing the case amid tight security. Zillur attended the trial proceedings as a member of a defence panel. Hasina was taken to court at 9:35am from the nearby special jail, where she has been detained since July 16, bdnews24.com correspondents reported from the scene. As Hasina entered the courtroom she was "very normal and often smiling" in the courtroom, bdnews24.com Correspondent Pradip Kumar Chowdhury said. Hundreds of AL supporters were gathered outside the court as Hasina arrived. The court was transferred to the Sangsad Bhaban area for security reasons, an official notification had earlier said. The case involves charges of extorting Tk 2.99 crore from a businessman during Hasina's term in 1996-2001. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case filed by Azam J Chowdhury. Initially Rehana's name was not included in the case but police said they had later found that Rehana was also involved in the extortion. Chowdhury has accused them of receiving the amount in return for allowing him to set up a power plant. He alleges that they threatened to cancel the project if he did not pay. Hasina and Awami League have denied the charges, saying they were fabricated and aimed at tarnishing the image of the former prime minister. Rehana, who lives in London, expressed her surprise over her implication in the case. Sheikh Selim, a former minister in Hasina's cabinet, was present in the court Monday when the judge started the day's proceedings.Rehana was shown a fugitive in the case. Selim made a statement on June 21 to Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court, confessing his involvement in the incident. The court began hearing arguments by lawyers at 9:40 am Monday to decide if it would frame charges against the accused. Selim's counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman appealed to the court for withdrawal of the June 21 statement, saying that Selim was coerced into making his statement. "Sheikh Selim was blindfolded after his arrest. He was repeatedly tortured, physically and mentally , in an undisclosed place. He was threatened with death under 'crossfire'," Rezaur told the court in his petition. "Sheikh Selim was tortured repeatedly when he was on remand. At one stage he could not bear the pressure and agreed to give the confessional statement." "That was when he made the statement on June 21 in the court. Since Selim was not taken to any court after that he could not appeal for the withdrawal of the statement. Today we appeal to you to scrap that statement," Rezaur told the court. Nov 28 was the original date for starting the trial. But the date was reset to Monday since defence lawyers said they did not receive the government notification in time on the transfer of the court to the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Hasina was arrested at her Dhanmondi home and sent to jail hours later on July 16, pending trial. Police formally charged Hasina with extortion on July 24. bdnews24.
