<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Tuesday said that there was scope for mercy for convicted Rajshahi University teachers even after the pronouncement of the verdict. "The teachers still have chances to challenge the verdict at the High Court. Apart from that, the government can be sympathetic to them as well," Mainul told reporters after launching "Legislative Deskbook of Bangladesh" at Hotel Sonargaon. The remarks came shortly after a court sentenced four RU teachersMalay Kumar Bhowmik, Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamunto two years in prison for inciting campus unrest in August. The adviser said it was unfortunate that teachers had to face trial. "But it should also be established in Bangladesh that nobody is beyond the reach of law." "There are some unthinkable things we must faceto establish the rule of law," he said. "Student-teacher relationship should be like a relationship between a father and his son. But the teachers now incite partisanship among students instead," he said. In the aftermath of the Dhaka University demonstrations, the Rajshahi University campus witnessed violent student-police clashes on Aug 22. Security forces arrested professors Saidur Rahman Khan, Abdus Sobhan and Malay Kumar Bhowmik with alleged links to campus unrest. A case was filed on Aug 26. On Sept 1, sub-inspector Nasir Uddin of Motihar Police Station pressed charges against the six teachers. Saidur Rahman and Abdus Sobhan were cleared of the charges Tuesday. bdnew
