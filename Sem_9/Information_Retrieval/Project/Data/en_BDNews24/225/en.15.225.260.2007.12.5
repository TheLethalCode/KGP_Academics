 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Wednesday approved imports of one lakh tonne of urea for fiscal 2007-08. The decision was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase, chaired by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. The urea will be imported from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates under two separate state-to-state agreements, Azizul told reporters after the meeting at the cabinet division. "The price will be equivalent to that of the urea produced by Kafco (Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company Ltd)," he said. Early, the cabinet committee on economic affairs exempted the industry ministry from the obligation of open tender system under the Public Procurement Regulations Act for urea import. Of the other proposals the meeting approved were appointment of consulting firm for design, supervision and monitoring of the rural infrastructure improvement project-II and urban primary health care project-II. bd
