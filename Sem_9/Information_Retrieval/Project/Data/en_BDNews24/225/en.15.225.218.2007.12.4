 BANGKOK, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej told Thailand's 65 million people on Tuesday to heal the nation's deep political rifts in this month's general election or risk sinking the country.

He faces corruption charges, which he denies, brought by a special investigation launched by the generals who accused him of presiding over rampant graft. Thaksin's party was dissolved and 111 of its leading officials, including him, barred from politics for five years for election fraud.
