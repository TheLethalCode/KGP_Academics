 WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush said on Tuesday that Iran remains a danger to the world despite a US intelligence report it halted its atomic weapons program four years ago, and vowed to keep up pressure on Tehran. Bush also said "all options" are on the table for dealing with Iran but insisted that the United States is stressing diplomacy to resolve the nuclear standoff.

Bush vowed to continue efforts to rally the international community to press Tehran over its nuclear program. "The best diplomacy -- effective diplomacy -- is one in which all options are on the table," Bush said when asked whether military action remained an option. Iran quickly welcomed the report as a vindication of its long-standing claim that its nuclear program had only peaceful civilian aims. Britain and France said they would continue to seek further sanctions against Iran. China and Russia so far have resisted tougher measures. The NIE, a consensus of US intelligence agencies, concluded, "We do not know whether (Iran) currently intends to develop nuclear weapons." That marked a dramatic shift from a 2005 intelligence report that stated Iran was "determined to develop nuclear weapon
