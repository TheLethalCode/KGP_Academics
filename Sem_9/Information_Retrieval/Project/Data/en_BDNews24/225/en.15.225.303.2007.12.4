<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Tuesday asked banks and NGOs to waive payment of loan instalments until April in the cyclone-hit areas considering the suffering of the victims. He made the comment while talking with journalists after accepting donations from people and organisations for the army relief fund at the Army Headquarters in the morning. "Banks and NGOs should waive loan instalments at least until April next year considering the distress of the hapless cyclone-hit people," General Moeen said. "The job of the NGOs is to help the poor people, not to chase them for recovery of loan instalments. Media reports have it that they are pressing them for repayment. It is not desirable at all." "I want that the NGOs waive the instalments for the next four months. If they cannot do it, at least they should not chase the helpless people for instalments. The banks and NGOs can realise the money later through spreading the dues over later instalments." He urged the top officials of NGOS and banks to be kind toward the Sidr victims. The army supremo said nearly Tk 11 crore had been donated to the army relief fund and 31 organisations made donations Tuesday. "The money raised for cyclone relief fund will be spent on building schools, colleges, mending roads and helping the poor people". bdnews24
