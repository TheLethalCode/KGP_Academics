<TITLE> Battered banks help knock 1 pct off the FTSE </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell on Tuesday as a generally downbeat Morgan Stanley note hit already battered UK banks only days before key interest rate decisions. In a falling market, Britain's biggest retailer Tesco fell 1.7 percent even as it met forecasts with a 4.1 percent rise in underlying third-quarter UK sales and said its new US stores had been "very well received" by customers. At 1219 GMT, Britain's FTSE was 1.3 percent lower at 6,304.7 points, down for a second day in a row as investors braced for Thursday's interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. Banks were the worst performers after Morgan Stanley started Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds with an "underweight" rating and cut its price target on HSBC. Shares in these banks fell between 1.6 and 4.7 percent. Mortgage lender HBOS shed 4.3 percent and Barclays was down 5.2 percent. "There's an element of consolidation. The downbeat sentiment in the banking sector is clearly leading the way," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "Rate decisions at the moment are very difficult to judge. The Bank of England is currently balancing slowing growth with rising price pressures at a time when short-term lending rates are at their highest in almost a decade. A Reuters poll suggested the BoE would likely keep interest rates steady on Thursday but gave a roughly one in three chance the bank could cut rates. Northern Rock was the biggest percentage loser, extending the previous day's losses when sentiment for the stricken mortgage lender was dented by a spike in interbank lending rates and speculation that the proposed bid from Virgin Group could face complications. CRUNCH TIME Also boding badly for growth, U.S Federal Reserve policymakers on Monday gave a sober assessment of the U.S. economy, reinforcing the view that the U.S. central bank will again cut short-term interest rates next week. While the outlook for lower growth has been hurting stock markets, it could support stocks in the medium-term if it results in more monetary easing from major central banks. With sterling interbank lending rates at nine-year highs even Tesco chimed in, calling for a UK interest rate cut "sooner rather than later". "There is the prospect that we are building momentum with regard to a rate cut even as early as this Thursday from the UK," said Neil Parker, market strategist at RBS. "Although that is not our central view, I think if there were further pressures from the financial markets generally, particularly the credit markets, then that could be enough to tip the MPC over the edge and (for) them (to) cut interest rates." Key to all markets will be whether the U.S. jobs data on Friday will reinforce the case for an expected interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. A weak number would suggest the trouble in the housing and credit markets are spreading to a driver of the world's largest economy. Among losers, Mitchells & Butlers fell to its lowest point since July 2006, down 4.8 percent after Citigroup cut the stock's price target. Traders also said the stock was being hit by talk that activist shareholder Robert Tchenguiz is to reduce his stake in the British pub and restaurant group. Among rare gainers, BP and Royal Dutch Shell were up 0.3 and 1.3 respectively even as oil prices slipped. Heavyweight Vodafone was up 0.2 percent after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock. Vodafone shares have fallen by almost 8 percent from this year's high of 197.50 pence struck in mid-Novemb
