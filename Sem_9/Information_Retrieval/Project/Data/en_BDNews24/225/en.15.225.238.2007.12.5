<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's new coach Gary Kirsten will run the rule over his new team during the third test against Pakistan in Bangalore on Saturday. However, he will have to wait until March to formally take charge. The Indian board said in a statement on Wednesday Kirsten would act as a consultant during the tour of Australia starting later this month. The 40-year-old Kirsten, who was appointed on a two-year term, will formally take up his role as India's third foreign coach ahead of the proposed home series against South Africa after the team return from Australia. India, 1-0 up in the test series against Pakistan, go into the first test in Australia on Dec. 26. Kirsten had raised some concerns over whether senior players were behind his appointment but said on Tuesday he had signed the contract. Kirsten succeeds Greg Chappell, who quit after the team's shock first round exit from the one-day World Cup in March. The Indian board struggled to find a successor to Chappell and suffered the embarrassment of South African Graham Ford declining the offer after being named as coach
