 CAPE TOWN, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mathew Sinclair survived a chance to top-score for New Zealand in the third and deciding one-day international against South Africa on Sunday. Sinclair scored 73 in New Zealand's total of 238 for eight, which they posted after winning the toss and choosing to bat. Number six batsman Sinclair came to the crease after New Zealand had slipped to 79 for four in the 22nd over and was dropped by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher off Shaun Pollock when he was on 26. Fast bowler Dale Steyn, who is playing his first match of the series, removed openers Brendon McCullum (0) and Lou Vincent (18) to reduce the visitors to 27-2 two in the eighth over. Fast bowler Charl Langeveldt trapped Jamie How (15) in front before paceman Andre Nel bowled Ross Taylor (3) off the edge of his bat. Sinclair helped Scott Styris (60) steady the innings with a stand of 49 for the fifth wicket before he shared partnerships of 56 and 43 with Jacob Oram (34) and Kyle Mills (11). Sinclair was dismissed with the penultimate ball of the innings when Daniel Vettori (9 not out) played a limp drive to a delivery from Steyn, who fielded and broke the stumps at his end with Sinclair out of his ground. South Africa won the first game by two wickets in Durban last Sunday and New Zealand levelled the series with a seven-wicket win in Port Elizabeth on Friday
