 CANBERRA, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States held its first talks with Australia's new government on Wednesday, with a top US official declaring that differences over Iraq and climate change would not hurt strong ties between the two countries. New Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has promised to pull about 500 Australian combat troops out of Iraq by the middle of 2008, and has ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, further isolating Washington on both issues. US Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns met senior members of Rudd's government on Wednesday, including Foreign Minister Stephen Smith and Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and said Washington would work well with the new administration. "We may have tactical differences on a number of issues, Iraq, we certainly have a tactical difference on the issue of Kyoto, but it doesn't mean we cannot work well together," Burns told reporters. He said Washington and Canberra would look at other ways in which Australia could support building stability in Iraq if troops were withdrawn. Rudd's centre-left Labor Party won power on Nov. 24, ending almost 12 years of conservative rule by John Howard, a close personal and political ally of U.S. President George W. Bush. Rudd's decision to ratify Kyoto means the United States is now the only developed nation not to back the agreement's binding curbs on the greenhouse emissions blamed for global warming. Rudd, who will lead the Australian delegation to the United Nations climate summit in Bali next week, urged the United States on Wednesday to change its stance and ratify the Kyoto pact. "All developed and developing countries need to be part of the global solution (to global warming)," Rudd told Australian radio. "And therefore we do need to see the United States as a full ratification state when it comes to Kyoto." Smith, sworn in as foreign minister only on Monday, has also reassured Washington that Australia's military alliance with the United States will remain the cornerstone of Canberra's strategic and foreign policy. "It remains a key pillar of our foreign policy approach," Smith told foreign diplomats on Monday. "Our friendship with the United States is deep and valued by both sides." Australia has about 1,500 troops deployed in and around Iraq, including naval and air support and forces protecting diplomats. About 500 frontline forces and trainers are based in Iraq's more peaceful south. Rudd has raised the possibility that Australia's military could continue to train Iraqi forces, but in a neighbouring count
