<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) - Mohammedan Sporting Club Monday defeated archrival Abahani Limited 5-4 in a tiebreaker in the first of the Teletalk best of three football match series to raise funds for the Sidr survivors. The eventful match rolled into a tiebreaker directly after the 90-minute regulation time ended in a goalless draw at Bangabandhu National Stadium where some 10,000 spectators turned up to extend their hands to the Sidr victims. Though the match was one of three fund-raising affairs, there were the usual clashes and red cards coupled with the excitement the two archrivals normally experience in their matches. Referee Taiyeb Hasan sent off Abahani captain Arif Khan Joy and Mohammedan guest Hasan Al Mamun in the dying minutes as the match was delayed for 20 minutes. However, the match resumed after the intervention of the organisers. Mohammedan enjoyed comparatively superior ball possession, though both clubs hired some booters including foreign recruits for their sides. After the tiebreaker locked at 4-4, the match rolled into sudden death and Mohammedan came out successful. Arman Aziz, Rezaul Kabir Biplob, Ripon Khan, Sharif and Mohammad Ronny converted the penalty shots for Mohammedan while Nazrul Islam, Jahangir Alam Mintu, Jahid Hasan Amily and Abul Hossain found the back of the net for Abahani. Abahani guest player Sunny and Abdullah Parvel missed the target while Mohammedan's Ariful Islam squandered the spot shot.
