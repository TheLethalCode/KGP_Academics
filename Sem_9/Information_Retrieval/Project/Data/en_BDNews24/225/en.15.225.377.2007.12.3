 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Monday joined a group of lawyers to fight a legal battle for party chief Sheikh Hasina. The veteran AL leader, 78, arrived at 8:45am at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court now sited on Sangsad Bhaban premises. "I have grown old. My health is failing. I am here only to defend the leader (Hasina) in court. I took part in a legal battle for the last time in 1978," he told the reporters who gathered there in the morning to cover the trial of the former prime minister in a graft case. The police had briefly barred him on the way to Sangsad Bhaban. An inspector said: "You aren't allowed. You need permission from higher authorities." The inspector finally let him in after speaking to the "higher authorities" himself. bdnews24.com Correspondent Prodip Chowdhury said Hasina was apparently happy to see Zillur as he picked his way into the courtroom. Hasina asked him to take a seat. Zillur sat in a chair in the first row meant for the defence side. The lawyers for Hasina Sunday requested him to join the lawyers' panel and he accepted the offer. Advocate Syed Rezaur Rahman, member of the panel, told bdnews24.com: "Zillur Rahman was a good lawyer. He was also a general secretary for the Bar Council." "He handled cases regularly until 1978." "I appreciate him for coming and joining us as a lawyer." Zillur did his master's in history and, later, an LLB degree from Dhaka University. bdnews4
