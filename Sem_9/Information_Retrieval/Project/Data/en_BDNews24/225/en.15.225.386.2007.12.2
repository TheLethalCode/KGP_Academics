 LAHORE, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - He ran Pakistan's most populous and politically important province for five years under Pervez Musharraf, and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi vows if he is elected prime minister the president's influence will live on. That promise by Elahi, a wealthy businessman and former chief minister of Punjab province, Pakistan's political epicentre, is in stark contrast to main opposition leaders and rivals Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif. They head Pakistan's other main political clans and seek to isolate the president. Musharraf brings contentious baggage with him. He outraged the international community and many ordinary Pakistanis by imposing emergency rule on Nov. 3 and purging the Supreme Court to safeguard his re-election from legal challenges. He also detained thousands of lawyers and opposition activists and slapped curbs on the media. Elahi says Musharraf had no choice, and that if elected, the pair will rule together. "Pervez Musharraf has a strong influence in Pakistan, and it will remain for another 5-10 years," Elahi said in an interview on Sunday at his upmarket residence in the eastern city of Lahore, a fleet of brand new Range Rovers in the driveway. "We have worked together more than 5 years, and he has been so helpful in guiding me in many areas for the development of Punjab, and we have a very close relationship," Elahi added. He envisages a troika running Pakistan. President Musharraf, the general who succeeded him as army chief, and the next prime minister. "Pervez Musharraf having the backing of the army, and himself and a Muslim League prime minister ... only with close coordination they can deliver," he said. "If one is not thinking at the same level, then there's a problem." While Musharraf is increasingly isolated, having finally stepped down as army chief in the face of stiff pressure from the United States, his policies will live on if Elahi is elected. "If you see the last 5 years, President Musharraf fighting against terrorism, having the army support -- who was providing the political support? We were," he said. "In five years we have been working jointly in the war against terrorism, so we have already delivered. So we will continue our policy." POLITICAL FEUDING Elahi has ruled out reconciliation with his former party leader Sharif ahead of a Jan. 8 general election, which the two-time former prime minister says he plans to boycott. Elahi and his influential cousin, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, broke away from Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League after Sharif was toppled in a 1999 coup and later forced into exile. They now head a rival faction of the party called PML (Q). Elahi is also a bitter rival of Bhutto, who recently returned from years of self-exile and has accused him of plotting against her. There is bad blood between them, stemming from the feud of a previous generation. Bhutto's father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's first popularly elected leader, and Elahi's uncle were enemies. Elahi's uncle was a close ally of military dictator Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, who executed Bhutto's father. The uncle was later murdered, and his family blamed an organisation with links to Bhutto's brother. Was Musharraf, who the United States had hoped would end up forging a power-sharing deal with Bhutto, right to give her immunity from past corruption charges and let her return? "I don't think so ... There was a move of reconciliation and we opposed," Elahi said. "A corrupt lady having (legal) cases in Spain and having cases in Switzerland and having cases all over of corruption -- why should we have this lady here?" "The price is very high that we have paid for this corrupt lady," he said. "Now let the people decide. If the people want to have the corrupt lady in power, it's up to the peopl
