<TEXT>
 HARARE, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brisk batting by captain Dwayne Bravo helped West Indies to a comfortable win over Zimbabwe in the third one-day international on Tuesday. Zimbabwe were put in to bat and were dismissed for 139 in 37.5 overs. West Indies replied with 142-4 in 27.5 overs to win by six wickets with 133 balls to spare and to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Bravo smashed his unbeaten 45, the highest score of the match, off 24 balls with six fours and three sixes. Zimbabwe's batsmen struggled to score fluently against all of the West Indian bowlers, and particularly when they faced fast bowler Jerome Taylor, who took 3-18 from 9.5 overs. Fast bowler Daren Powell was the other main wicket-taker with a haul of 3-32. Tatenda Taibu's 32 was the best effort of a tentative Zimbabwean batting performance. Stuart Matsikenyeri (16) and Keith Dabengwa (26 not out) were the only other Zimbabweans to reach double figures but the home side were boosted by the 22 wides that the visitors bowled. Medium pacer Elton Chigumbura dismissed Devon Smith (1) and debutant Brenton Parchment (15) in the first 15 overs of West Indies' reply. Off-spinner Prosper Utseya reduced the visitors to 82-4 in the 20th over by removing Runako Morton (38) and Marlon Samuels (4). Zimbabwean hopes were dashed when Bravo joined Shivnarine Chanderpaul (27 not out) to make short work of the 58 runs that West Indies still needed to win. With Bravo batting aggressively, 60 runs flowed in 8.3 overs for the unbroken fifth wicket. Parchment made his debut in place of Chris Gayle, who was ruled out of the rest of the series when he injured a hamstring while batting in the second match of the series on Sunday
