"The best available strategy is to control it at the level of the animal," he said. "Investments in public health will be unproductive without ensuring the health of our livestock." He said an Indian laboratory had developed a poultry vaccine using the Indian strain, and other research efforts continued. For now, humans usually contract the virus only after close contact with infected birds, with the virus killing nearly two-thirds of the people it infects. But experts worry it may mutate into a form easily transmitted from person to person, leading to a pandemic. Around a fifth of humanity could fall ill should there be another flu pandemic, according to estimates cited by the World Health Organisation, with catastrophic effects on the global economy. There have been roughly three flu pandemics each century since the 16th century, the WHO sa
