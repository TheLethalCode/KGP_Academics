 PORT LOUIS, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian woman has received a 28-year sentence for smuggling heroin worth $1.3 million into Mauritius, which has one of the world's highest rates of heroin and other opiate use, court papers said. Arrested on arrival from Nairobi in November 2005 with almost 4 kg (9 lbs) of heroin in her luggage, Susan Dalziel told police she was carrying the packages on behalf of someone else. She had pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking. "Having regard to the huge amount of heroin, the manner in which it was hidden and its street value of 40 million Mauritius rupees ($1.36 million), I find that she is a trafficker," Judge Paul Lam Shang Leen wrote in his case report. "I sentence accused to undergo 28 years penal servitude," he wrote, noting that she had been on remand for some two years since the arrest and had no previous criminal record. A court official told Reuters by phone that Dalziel was a 52-year-old teacher. Official estimates put the number of addicts at 20,000 among the Indian Ocean nation's 1.3 million population, but many people who work with users think the real number is higher.
