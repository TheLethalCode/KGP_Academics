 Caracas, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Monday conceded defeat in a referendum on allowing him to run indefinitely for re-election, saying the move was meant to avoid political tension in the country. Chavez sought a raft of constitutional changes to expand presidential powers, allow him to advance his self-styled revolution and consolidate a socialist state for the OPEC nation.
