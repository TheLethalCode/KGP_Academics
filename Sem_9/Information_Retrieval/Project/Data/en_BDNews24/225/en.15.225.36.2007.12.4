 KABUL, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber rammed a car into a convoy of NATO forces close to the airport in the Afghan capital on Tuesday, wounding eight Afghan civilians, a police official said. A spokesman for the Taliban said the militant Islamic group carried out the attack to "welcome" US Defense Secretary Robert Gates who arrived in Kabul on Monday evening. There were no casualties among NATO troops in the blast which happened during the morning rush hour on a road just outside Kabul's international airport, an alliance spokesman said.

About half are involved in NATO operations and half on other missions. Gates is to gauge the needs of military commanders as they face a resurgent Taliban and signs that al Qaeda is regrouping in the country. More than six years after a US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power, Gates said on Monday he was concerned about the increasing violence but he did not think Afghanistan was moving backwards. "I'm not worried about a back slide as much as I am how we continue the momentum going forward," the Pentagon chief told reporters. "I think that one of the clear concerns that we all have is that (in) the last two or three years there has been a continuing increase in the overall level of violence." The Pentagon also is worried about signs that al Qaeda is resurfacing in Afghanistan after defeats in parts of Ir
