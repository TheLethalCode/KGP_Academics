 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Tuesday said retail banks should attach importance to disbursing farm loans without delay in cyclone-ravaged areas. Loan disbursement must be complete by January, he said. "If there is any neglect of duty or irregularity in loan disbursement, we have to take tough action," Salehuddin said at a meeting with the officials of state-owned and private banks at Bangladesh Bank's Khulna office. The central banker said agriculture is the driver of the economy. "If we don't help this sector by providing loans, the economy will suffer." Salehuddin said: "There is no alternative to making agriculture self-sufficient to prevent the price hike of essentials." "The affected people should be given loans, no matter who is a defaulter and who is not." State-owned banks earmarked Tk 1,300 crore in loans to disburse in the cyclone-affected areas and Tk 300 crore had already been disbursed, he said. The governor expressed dissatisfaction as private banks did not start loan distribution in the affected areas yet. Salehuddin asked bankers to work sincerely to keep up GDP growth. bdnews2
