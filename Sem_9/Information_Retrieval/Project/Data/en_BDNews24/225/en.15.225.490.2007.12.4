 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and commerce adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday asked donors to simplify their funding procedures. "It is believed that donors often put tough conditions for funds, but now I am giving conditions to them. Just make your funding procedures more simple and reasonable," he said at a workshop at Dhaka Hotel Sheraton. UNDP, European Commission, World Bank, DFID UK, CIDA and IFC co-organised the workshop on Creating a National Strategy for Trade and Enhanced Integrated Framework. Azizul also asked the donors not to mix aid with market access and said: "Assistance must not be tagged with market access. The two are different." He stressed increased aid from developed nations to accelerate development process in the developing countries. The adviser sought assistance from the donors in exploring new products and diversifying export markets for Bangladeshi goods. He also asked the donors to assist the country in trade-related infrastructure improvement. Ambassador and head of delegation of the European Commission Stefan Frowein and UNDP country director Manoj Basnyat attended the inaugural session of the workshop as special guests.
