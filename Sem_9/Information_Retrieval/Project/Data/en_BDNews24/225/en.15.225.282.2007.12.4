 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government is firmly committed to combating trafficking in women and children, an adviser said Tuesday. "In view of this, the government has established an anti-trafficking monitoring cell at the police headquarters and district anti-trafficking monitoring cells in all districts," local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said in his address to a workshop at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Bangladesh Police and Australian Federal Police Tuesday co-organised the workshop on human smuggling. The three-day programme, Multi-Jurisdictional People Smuggling Targeting Workshop, was aimed at sharing experiences of different countries in human trafficking, illegal migration and involvement of law enforcement agencies in protection and security. Iqbal, a former inspector-general of police, said the main causes of trafficking were poverty and unemployment. "Irregular migration is a significant problem around the world," he said. To combat the problem "the government has taken initiatives for effective border control", he said. The government had implemented a project, Enhancing Capability of Immigration Officials to Combat Irregular Migration, Iqbal said. The adviser said the government would take follow-up actions following findings and recommendations of the workshop. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad said that some 487 cases had been filed on women and children trafficking since 2004. Of them, 298 had been resolved with 183 people having been sentenced, he said. bdnews24.c
