 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday ordered Rejina Naser, wife of detained BNP leader Naser Rahman, to jail pending trial in a corruption case after she turned herself in to the court. Naser is the son of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, and the caretaker government put Naser behind bars after it came to power in mid-January. Rejina is facing charges of concealing wealth information and acquiring wealth from unknown income sources. Judge Md Azizul Hoque of the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court rejected a prayer for bail and transferred the case to the Special Judge's Court-1 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises to deal with high-profile graft charges. The judge set Dec 5 for hearing on the charge-framing against her. ACC official Md Moniruzzaman filed a graft case against Naser and Rejina on May 27. According to case details, the couple allegedly concealed wealth of Tk 2.63 crore in their asset statement submitted to the Anticorruption Commission. The commission also accused them of earning wealth of Tk 6.23 crore from undeclared sources. A Sylhet court had sentenced Naser to nine years in jail on Sept 18 in a case involving extortion of Tk 2 crore. He was arrested on Feb 3. bdnews24.com/p
