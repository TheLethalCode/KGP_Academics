 MADRID, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek wants to leave Real Madrid in the January transfer window in search of regular first team action for the rest of the season so he can win a place in the Polish national team for Euro 2008. "I've got a three-year contract with Real Madrid but I want to look at the possibility of leaving," the 34-year-old told Spanish sports daily Marca on Wednesday. "Poland have qualified for the European championship for the first time and I have received an important call from the coach Leo Beenhakker who told me that if I played regularly I would be his keeper at Euro 2008. "I want to play at the European championship because it will be a historic moment for our country and I haven't played at all in Madrid. I think the best thing now is that we sit down and talk." Dudek joined Real as a free agent from Liverpool in the close season to provide cover for first-choice keeper Iker Casillas but he has yet to play for the club in either the Primera Liga or the Champions League. "I would like to leave," Dudek added. "If I were 26 I would never leave Real Madrid even if I was second choice, but things have changed with the call from Poland. I'm 34 and they have given me hope of playing in an important tournament. "I know I will only have a chance if I play regularly in the next few months. Real have the final word... but I want to be totally honest with them about this." Poland have been drawn alongside Germany, Croatia and joint hosts Austria in Group B of Euro 2008
