<TITLE> Stocks, dollar firm as US jitters ease </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to three-week highs on Thursday while the dollar held firm as fears of a US recession eased after a batch of upbeat US data helped lift some of the gloom surrounding the world's biggest economy. But worries that slower US growth would dampen demand saw oil slip below $87 a barrel, even after OPEC shrugged off calls to boost output. Gold weighed by lower oil prices and a firmer dollar, wallowed below $800 an ounce. Helping soothe US recession fears, reports on Wednesday showed US companies added staff in November at the fastest pace in a year and worker productivity rose at the strongest rate in four years in the third quarter. Investors were now awaiting details of President George W Bush's plan to help struggling US homeowners avoid foreclosure and address a mortgage crisis that risks tipping the US economy into recession later on Thursday. "The focus now will be on the announcement on US housing measures," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, equity strategist at Shinko Securities. "The content may be already priced in, but if investors anticipate a further rise in US stocks as a result, the Tokyo market will extend gains in the afternoon." Tokyo's Nikkei average climbed 1.5 percent to four-week highs by the mid-session break, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 1.5 percent at levels last seen on Nov. 15 by 0214 GMT. The MSCI index is now just 7 percent away from its record high set on Nov. 1 and up 38 percent this year, well ahead of an 11.3 percent rise for MSCI's main world stock index. Growing expectations of a US interest rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting had helped lift markets from last month's trough. EXPORTERS, BANKS SHINE Bank stocks were among the gainers, further boosted by positive news from American International Group, the world's largest insurer, which said its risks from the subprime crisis were manageable. Mitsubishi UFJ rallied 4.3 percent, while Australia's Macquarie Group and Citigroup's Tokyo shares both put on more than 1.5 percent. MSCI's index of financial stocks in the region rose 1.9 percent, outperforming the wider market. Investors also bought some of the region's top exporters as worries about the US economy eased, driving Canon Inc, Sony Corp and Hyundai Motor all up between 1.5 and 2.5 percent. Exporters also benefited from a stronger greenback, as it tends to help boost the value of dollar sales. DOLLAR FIRM The dollar rose to 111.10 yen well off Wednesday's low of about 109.70 yen, while the euro dipped below $1.4600 down from a high of about $1.4770 in the previous session. Against the yen, the euro was slightly firmer at around 162.20 yen. Improving appetite for riskier assets is usually bad news for the Japanese currency as investors sell the low-yielding unit to fund purchases of riskier but better yielding assets. In a sign of growing risk appetite, yield spreads between emerging market debt and US Treasury notes narrowed a further 7 basis points, following Wednesday's 5-tick contraction. Forex investors are also waiting for the outcome of central bank meetings in Europe and Britain, with expectations for a rate cut by the Bank of England after weak housing and service sector data this week. "Given the speed with which financial markets distress has helped to derail UK growth prospects, investors will likely be disappointed by anything less than a cut," Citigroup currency strategists said in a note to clients. Safe-haven government bonds lost ground as investors sought riskier assets, pushing yields higher. Japan's benchmark 10-year bonds rose 4.5 basis points to a one-month high of 1.535 percent
