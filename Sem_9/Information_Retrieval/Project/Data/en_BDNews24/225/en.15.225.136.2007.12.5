<TITLE> EU may pool consular aid for citizens abroad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Travellers from the European Union who run into problems abroad should be able to use the consular services of any of the EU's 27 members, the EU executive proposed on Wednesday. The plan could also lead to some EU countries pooling consular offices and the introduction of common rules for repatriating corpses from abroad. Under an EU treaty, any of its 490 million citizens can use another EU state's consulate if their country is not represented in a foreign nation. But few people are aware of that, consular rules differ and cooperation is at times patchy. The European Commission said it wanted to activate the provision by recommending what the EU's 27 members can do to aid travellers who lose their passport or get arrested, or if a family member dies outside the bloc. "We need to step up cooperation at EU level and work with member states to protect our citizens," EU Foreign Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said. Under the proposals, EU states would launch an information campaign about joint consular services, while defining, reinforcing and possibly standardising protection offered. "When a family member dies abroad, it is a nightmare. I could imagine a common stance for the repatriation of corpses," said a Commission official who helped draft the proposal. Consulates could pool resources by, for example, allowing a small EU country to use a consular building belonging to a big member of the bloc. The Commission estimates EU citizens make 80 million trips a year outside Europe and between 30 million and 50 million EU citizens live outside Europe. There are only three countries outside the EU where all 27 members are represented -- China, Russia and the United States.
