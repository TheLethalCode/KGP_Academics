 Hamilton, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British territory of Bermuda will hold general elections on Dec. 18. Here are some key facts about Bermuda. GEOGRAPHY - Bermuda consists of a group of 138 coral islands and islets situated in the western Atlantic about 650 miles (1,050 km) east of North Carolina. The area is 20 sq miles (53 sq km). CAPITAL - Hamilton. POPULATION - About 66,000 people. (2007) ETHNICITY - Black 54.8 percent, white 34 percent, mixed and other 11.1 percent. RELIGION - Anglican 23 percent, Roman Catholic 15 percent, African Methodist Episcopal 11 percent, 7th Day Adventist 7 percent, Methodist 4 percent, others 40 percent (none or not stated). LANGUAGE - English. ECONOMY - Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Its economy is primarily based on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists. -- More than 500,000 tourists visit Bermuda each year, most come from the United States. SOME HISTORY: -- In 1511 an island named "Bermudas" was depicted on a map in Spain. The Spanish navigator Fernandez de Oviedo sailed close to the islands in 1515 and attributed their discovery to his countryman Juan Bermudez, possibly as early as 1503. -- Britain's oldest colony was settled after a ship full of settlers led by Sir George Somers, heading for America, foundered on its reefs in 1609. They initially named Bermuda the Somers Isles. -- In 1684 the colony became administered by the British crown. The colonial capital was transferred from St. George to Hamilton on the Main Island in 1815. -- The U.S. government acquired a 99-year lease for military bases in 1941, but closed them in 1995. The British army garrison, which dated from 1797, was withdrawn in 1957, a Canadian base closed in 1993 and a small remaining Royal Navy base ceased operating in 1995. -- The establishment of a formal constitution in 1968 bolstered internal self-government and a debate about independence ensued. However a 1995 independence referendum was defeated by a heavy margin. Sources: Reuters/Statesman's Yearbook (2007)/ www.state.gov/Britannica.com
