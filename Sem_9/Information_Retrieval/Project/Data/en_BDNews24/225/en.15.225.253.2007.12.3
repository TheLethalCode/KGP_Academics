<TITLE> British Muslims in push to release teacher in Sudan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Khartoum, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two leading British Muslims meet with Sudan's president on Monday in an attempt to secure the early release of a British teacher jailed for allowing her students to name a teddy bear Mohammad. Gillian Gibbons was sentenced on Thursday to 15 days in jail for insulting Islam to be followed by deportation. Britain's ambassador to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, said she was optimistic the meeting with President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, expected to take place at 10:30 a.m. (0730 GMT), could lead to the early release of Gibbons. "We very much hope that following the meeting with the president tomorrow morning the decision will be taken to release Mrs. Gibbons as soon as possible," Marsden told reporters late on Sunday night. "I'm not 100 percent confident but I'm certainly more optimistic than I was now that we know that the peers have been given the opportunity of a meeting with President Bashir tomorrow," she said. Marsden said the private initiative by Lord Ahmed and Baroness Sayeeda Warsi offered the best hope for Gibbons' early release. The peers delayed their departure after Bashir confirmed a last-minute meeting following a two-day wait. Gibbons let her pupils at Khartoum's private Unity High School pick their favourite name for a teddy bear as part of a project on animals in September. Twenty out of 23 of them chose Mohammad -- a popular boy's name in Sudan, as well as the name of Islam's Prophet. Marsden described the incident which has spurred huge international interest and worsened Britain's relations with Sudan, as a "cultural misunderstanding." Sudan's influential Council of Muslim Scholars on Sunday warned the government not to pardon Gibbons, saying that would damage Khartoum's reputation with Muslims around the world. SWORDS AND FLAGS Hundreds took to the streets of the capital on Friday, many waving swords and Islamic flags, calling for her death. "Retracting this light sentence ... would wound the sensibilities of the Muslims in Sudan," Council Spokesman al-Sheikh Mohammad Abdel Karim told Reuters. "This is not a matter to be settled politically. This is a matter which goes to the very core of Muslims and their sensibilities." Islam has often been used to mobilise young men to fight in Sudan's multiple civil wars and Bashir, commander-in-chief of the Sudanese army, would be reluctant to alienate powerful hard-line Islamic clerics. The British embassy has heightened security, especially following Friday's protests. But many ordinary Sudanese said they thought it was an innocent mistake which could be forgiven after an apology. Marsden, who saw Gibbons on Sunday, said she was in high spirits. Her lawyer said Gibbons was being held in a private and clean environment at an undisclosed secure location. Lawyers had initially said they expected her to be taken to Omdurman women's prison, a run-down and overcrowded place. "It is clean, well-guarded ... and she came to me smiling if a little bit sad," Kamal al-Jazouli said. "She said she was sad because she never imagined her stay in Sudan would end up like this." "She loved her pupils very much and they loved her. She said she would miss them when she goes outside Sudan.
