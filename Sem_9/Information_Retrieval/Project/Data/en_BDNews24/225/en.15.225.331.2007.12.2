<TITLE> Cuba's Fidel Castro named assembly candidate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, Cuba, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro was nominated on Sunday for a seat in the National Assembly, a sign he may not be planning to step down as head of state despite struggling to recover from a long illness. Castro, 81, handed over power temporarily to his brother Raul 16 months ago after life-threatening stomach surgery and he has not been seen in public since. To formally remain president he must be a deputy in the assembly. The municipal council of Santiago, Cuba's second city, included Castro's name on a slate of candidates for national elections on Jan 20 to Cuba's parliament, as it has done every five years since 1976.
