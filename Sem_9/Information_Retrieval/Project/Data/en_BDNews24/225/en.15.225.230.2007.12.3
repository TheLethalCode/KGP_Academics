<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division Monday stayed a High Court rule that a notice by the ACC asking for the wealth statement of Sheikh Hasina was illegal. A full bench of the Supreme Court chaired by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin passed the stay order that will remain valid until Jan 2. The court also asked the Anticorruption Commission to file an interim petition seeking approval to make a regular appeal by this time. On July 17, the commission served a notice on Hasina asking her to submit the wealth statement. She was arrested and sent to jail a day earlier. On Nov 21, the High Court said the notice was illegal after the former prime minister filed a writ petition. bdnews24.co
