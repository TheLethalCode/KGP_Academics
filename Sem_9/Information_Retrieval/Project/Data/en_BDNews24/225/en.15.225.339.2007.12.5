 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) - National Sports Council (NSC) Chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed directed the concerned authority to increase training fund to 10 percent from the existing three for the 2007-08 fiscal. The instruction came at the budget meeting of the NSC executive committee with the NSC chairman presiding Wednesday. The meeting approved Tk 48.31 crore for the 2007-08 fiscal, less than half the amount of the Bangladesh Cricket Board's annual budget. The NSC chairman asked the committee concerned to raise the training fund as only three percent of the budget has been kept for the training purpose. Now, it would be raised to 8.9 crore from Tk 2.6 crore. "I have asked them to revise the training fund to increase it to 10 percent as there is no alternative to developing players without training," General Moeen U Ahmed told reporters emerging from the meeting. "We are going to allocate funds at the Upazila level for the first time and it would be increased in future," said Ahmed adding that he also plans to help the Dhaka clubs. Each of 472 Upazila sports association will get Tk 10,000 along with the sports-gear though there was no fund for Upazila in the proposed budget. The NSC, county's supreme sports body, has to spend the major part of the budgeted amount (62.6 percent) after its employees, services, welfare, pension, renovation and maintenance of the sports establishments across the country. A smaller part (37.4 percent) of the budget will go to different sports federations, associations and district and divisional sports associations to run sports throughout the year. Football has been kept out of the allocation while some 31 national sports federations together will get above Tk seven crore while nearly Tk four crore would be distributed to district sports associations across the country. NSC director (administration) Mohammad Akbar Hossain, however, said the figure of allocations might change after reviewing the training funds in line with the chairman's instruction. Of the total budget, the government will allocate Tk 25.51 crore while the NSC will provide Tk 22.80 crore from its own resources. The last budget meeting, chaired by the then NSC chairman M Fazlur Rahman, who was also state minister for youth and sports, in October, 2006, approved a total of Tk 86.99 crore for the 2006-07 fiscal, and later, it increased to Tk 25.92 crore. bdn
