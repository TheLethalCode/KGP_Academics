 Ottawa, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has expelled the Canadian ambassador to Tehran because Ottawa refused to accept Iran's proposed envoys to Canada, Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said late on Monday. Relations between Iran and Canada have been icy since 2003, when Iranian-Canadian photographer Zahra Kazemi died in a military hospital of a brain hemorrhage after receiving a blow to the head at Tehran's Evin prison. "Canada regrets the decision of the government of Iran to order our ambassador to leave Tehran, which is entirely unjustifiable," Bernier said in a statement, adding that the two nations had been trying for some time to agree an exchange of ambassadors. "Unfortunately we have as yet been unable to accept the candidates Tehran has submitted. We believe that the expulsion of our ambassador is an unfortunate and unjustified consequence of this situation," he said. The expulsion was not mentioned on the Web sites of the Iranian foreign ministry or Iran's IRNA news agency. Last week Iran's supreme court ordered a new trial over Kazemi's death in custody. It upheld the original court's decision to acquit an intelligence agent of Kazemi's manslaughter, but sent the case back for further investigation on the grounds that others might be involved. Last month, a United Nations panel approved a Canadian-sponsored motion rebuking Iran for human rights abuses. bd
