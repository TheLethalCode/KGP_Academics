 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet has sent a draft of the Independent Election Commission Secretariat Ordinance 2007 to the law ministry for a further revision, a spokesman for the government said Sunday. After a cabinet meeting, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said the government examined recommendations from different groups of people to make the EC "completely independent". The law ministry will present the draft at a cabinet meeting after incorporating the recommendations into it. The ministry will also examine the issues such as attaching the EC secretariat with a ministry and ensuring its complete financial freedom. Munaim said the cabinet approved in principle two ordinances on food of fish and livestock. The ordinance will ban the use of growth hormone, a protein hormone, to stimulate the growth of fish and livestock. The proposed law says food packets must have production and expiry dates and the marketing of foods without laboratory test will not be allowed. Munaim said there was a proposal to amend the Artha Rin Adalat Ordinance 2003. The advisers also discussed the fallout from Cyclone Sidr at the meeting, he said. On the microcredit organisations allegedly putting pressure on clients for loan repayments in cyclone-hit areas, Munaim said the government discussed the issue. bdnews24.c
