 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday asked the government to explain why the detention of BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah would not be declared illegal. An HC bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Md Abu Tarique issued a rule nisi after Hannan Shah, adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, filed a writ petition. Hannan was arrested for his alleged links to violence at the grave of former president Ziaur Rahman on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. He was put in one-month detention on Nov 25. Hannan filed the writ petition with the HC, challenging the legality of the detention order. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq took part in the hearing on behalf of the BNP leader. bdnew
