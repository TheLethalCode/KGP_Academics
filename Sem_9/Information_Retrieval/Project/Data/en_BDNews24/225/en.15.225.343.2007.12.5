<TITLE> Injured Khan to miss final Pakistan test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, India, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India pacemen Zaheer Khan will miss the third test against Pakistan starting on Saturday due to an ankle injury, a senior cricket official said on Wednesday. Left-armer Khan is one of several new-ball bowlers carrying injuries, forcing the national selectors to pick a depleted pace attack on Wednesday for the Pakistan game and postpone the announcement of the side for the upcoming test tour of Australia, naming 24 probables instead. "Because of injuries to several players, the final selection of the squad for Australia will be done only on Dec. 12," board secretary Niranjan Shah told reporters after the selection meeting. Munaf Patel has been sidelined due to injury after sharing the new ball with Khan in the first two tests as injury replacement for Shanthakumaran Sreesanth (shoulder) and left-arm Rudra Pratap Singh (abdomen). The selectors recalled 23-year-old left-arm swing bowler Irfan Pathan for the Bangalore test. The Baroda bowler looks certain to play his first test since June 2006, having made a one-day comeback last month after prolonged poor form. The inexperienced Vikram Rajvir Singh and 19-year-old Ishant Sharma were also chosen. The selectors hope Khan will be fit to tour Australia and included him among nine pacemen in the probables. Anil Kumble was retained as captain for the four Australia tests, which start on Dec. 26. India lead the current series 1-0
