<TITLE> Egypt frees prominent Shia from detention </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Egyptian government has set free a prominent Shia Muslim activist after holding him for two months on charges including "promoting extreme Shia beliefs", a human rights organisation said on Sunday. Mohamed el-Derini, one of the most prominent members of Egypt's tiny Shia community, came out of detention late on Saturday, more than two weeks after a court ordered his release, said the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). Derini, who runs a Shia group called the Supreme Council for the Care of the Prophet's Family, was also accused of tarnishing the reputation of Egyptian security forces by spreading reports of torture in Egyptian places of detention. Egyptian law does not criminalise Shi'ite beliefs or practices but Shias say many police treat them as heretics and suspect them of links with foreign powers, especially Iran. The treatment of the Shi'ite community has sometimes reflected the state of relations between Cairo and Tehran, which have been bad for most of the past 28 years. Another defendant in the same case as Derini, Ahmed Mohamed Sobh, was released from detention on Nov. 25, also after a court ordered he be freed, EIPR said in a statement. The rights organisation urged the Egyptian government to end the practice of detaining people for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of belief and expression. It was not immediately clear if the authorities had dropped charges against the two men. An Interior Ministry spokesman said he had no information on the case.
