<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki has said he does not rule out an early national election if he loses the race to lead the ruling ANC to Jacob Zuma. "I have not thought about that one. We haven't got there yet. I don't know. It's possible, it's possible, yes indeed," he said in an interview with the Sunday Independent. Mbeki has lost ground to Zuma in the race. The party will choose a new leader at a party conference on Dec. 16-20. If Zuma wins, he is almost certain to become South Africa's next president in 2009 elections.
