 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The New Zealand Cricket will hold two Twenty20 cricket matches in Hamilton on December 23 to raise funds for cyclone-stricken Bangladeshis. An invitational Masters XI including past international players will face the New Zealand Under-19 side before a New Zealand XI take on Bangladesh, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release Wednesday. "Cyclone Sidr caused an incredible amount of damage, suffering and death in Bangladesh, and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) is committed to raising funds with World Vision to assist in the aftermath of the cyclone," NZC chief executive officer Justin Vaughan was quoted as saying. "The Bangladesh team's tour of New Zealand provided an excellent opportunity to do something for the people of the country. All profits from the day will go to World Vision's Bangladesh relief efforts. Former Blackcap skipper Stephen Fleming, who will captain the New Zealand XI team, said it was important to players that they support the Bangladesh team and they were hoping to help raise as much money as possible for cyclone relief. Bangladesh will leave here for New Zealand on December 12 to play a three-ODI series and a two-Test series in December and January. b
