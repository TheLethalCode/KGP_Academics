 CAIRO, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police detained 25 student members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood in the Medinet Nasr district of Cairo at dawn on Wednesday, Brotherhood and police sources said. The students, who were studying at the education faculty of al-Azhar University in Cairo, will be referred to state security prosecutors on suspicion of belonging to what is formally a banned organisation, they added. The detentions bring to about 250 the number of Muslim Brotherhood members in detention as part of a crackdown which began a year ago, said an official at the Brotherhood's headquarters. The government calls the Brotherhood an illegal group and often detains its members without charge or trial. But members of the group hold a fifth of the seats in parliament and the non-violent movement operates openly within limits.
