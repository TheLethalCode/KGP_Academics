<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Clarke is to captain Australia in Tuesday's Twenty20 international against New Zealand. The 26-year-old batsman has long been touted as a future leader and, with skipper Ricky Ponting being rested for the match in Perth, the selectors have begun that process. "We have taken the opportunity to enhance the leadership skills of Michael Clarke to assure the long history of strong leadership of Australian cricket is continued into the future," chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. Clarke, vice-captain for Australia's one-day tour of New Zealand earlier this year before he was sent home to recover from a hip injury ahead of the World Cup in the Caribbean, said he was surprised by the decision. "It certainly was a shock to me. I was a little bit speechless," said Clarke. "It's any young kid's dream to captain their country. "This is a great opportunity but there is no doubt Ricky is our leader and will be for a lot longer yet. I'm certainly proud and honoured to be given this opportunity." The match at the WACA ground is a warm-up for the three-match Chappell Hadlee one-day series. New Zealand beat an understrength Australia 3-0 to win the trophy earlier this year. All-rounders Ashley Noffke and Adam Voges, batsman Brad Hodge and fast bowler Shaun Tait have been included in Australia's squad. Opening batsman Matthew Hayden has also been rested. Australia Twenty20 squad: Michael Clarke (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds, Michael Hussey, Brad Hodge, Adam Voges, Ashley Noffke, Brett Lee, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait
