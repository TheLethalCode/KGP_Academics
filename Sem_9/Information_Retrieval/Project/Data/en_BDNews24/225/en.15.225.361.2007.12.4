 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury Tuesday asked the government to hold Upazila and Union Parishad polls before national elections. "The government has to take steps to hold polls to Upazila and Union Parishad to earn the trust of people after it makes the electoral roll with photographs," Chowdhury said at a function at the party office in Segunbagicha. Over 200 people under the leadership of former pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leader Shahjahan Saju joined the party Badruddoza hoped the new voter list would enhance political consciousness among the citizens. The former president asked the government to relax the emergency rule to allow political workers freely exchange views.
