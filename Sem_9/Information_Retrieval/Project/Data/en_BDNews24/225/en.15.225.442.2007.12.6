 Manila, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Manila court sentenced 14 members of a Muslim militant group to life in prison on Thursday for the kidnapping of 20 people from a luxury beach resort in 2001 and the decapitation of three of them, including an American. Guillermo Sobero was beheaded a few weeks after he was snatched at gunpoint from the Dos Palmas resort in the western Philippines by members of the Abu Sayyaf group. Another American, Martin Burnham, was killed in an army rescue operation a year later. The judge at the regional trial court handed down 20 life sentences to each of the guilty men and ordered them to pay damages of between 50,000-300,000 pesos ($1,194-$7,162) for each of the victims. Four other people including one woman, were acquitted of the charges, a court official said. The Abu Sayyaf is the smallest but deadliest Muslim rebel group in the south of the mainly Catholic country, with a reputation for savagery. Burnham's widow Gracia, who had been celebrating her 18th wedding anniversary at the beach resort, testified against her former captors in 2004. She had been held, along with her husband and others for over a year in remote jungles in the south of the archipelago. At night they were handcuffed and chained to trees. Gracia Burnham was shot in the leg during the rescue operation. In a book about her ordeal, "In the Presence of My Enemies", Burnham alleged links between Philippine officials and her captors, saying an unidentified Filipino general had tried to keep part of the money raised for ransom, and soldiers had delivered supplies to the guerrillas. The allegations were not investigated in court. The Abu Sayyaf is also blamed for the killing of 100 people in a ferry bombing nearly Manila in 2004, the Philippines' worst terror attack. ($1 = 41.89
