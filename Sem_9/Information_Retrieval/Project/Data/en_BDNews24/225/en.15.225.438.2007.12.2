<TITLE> 'Shady force' responsible for BNP split: Gayeshwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Gayeshwar Chandra Roy has said that "a shady force" has temporarily split apart the party's senior leaders but that their souls are united. "There's no division in the party over its ideals or party posts," Gayeshwar told reporters Sunday. However, he would not explain what he meant by the term "a shady force". "It is not possible to spell out everything in words in the post-Jan 11 context, only hints may be given," said Gayeshwar, speaking at the home of BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Delwar and his followers, known as loyalists to detained party chief Khaleda Zia, have so far refused to acknowledge the new BNP committee headed by former finance minister M Saifur Rahman. Khaleda had appointed Delwar as the party's secretary general on the day she was arrested and detained, but the party's opposing faction in turn refused to recognise him. Amid the split, Gayeshwar said Sunday that he is hopeful that differences among the opposing party leaders would be resolved since Saifur had recently spoken to Delwar by phone reportedly to discuss paths to unity. Gayeshwar said the activists of the troubled party would be happy if they see these "small disputes" resolved. Referring to recent controversy over amendment of party constitutions, he said that reforms within a political party could not be enforced through any government order. "The council will decide if there is any need for reform of the party constitution once politics is free again," he said. "It will not be done through any prescription by the Election Commission or the government." The BNP leader demanded more relief supplies to the cyclone-hit southern region and asked the government to take measures so that the cyclone survivors are not harassed by micro-credit NGOs. A BNP team is conducting relief operations in Barguna while another team will join them later, he added. bdnew
