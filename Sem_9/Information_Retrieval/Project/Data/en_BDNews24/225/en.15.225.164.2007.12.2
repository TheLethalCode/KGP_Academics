 MADRID, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid stretched their lead at the top to four points on Saturday after beating Racing Santander 3-1 at home while arch-rivals Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw at Espanyol in the Catalan derby. Real skipper Raul steered his side to their seventh win in seven games at the Bernabeu when he took his tally for the season to eight goals with a classy double. Barcelona made an impressive start in a pulsating match against neighbours Espanyol, Andres Iniesta putting the visitors ahead in the sixth minute after an electrifying run by Argentina forward Lionel Messi. But a second-half strike by Espanyol substitute Ferran Corominas denied Barcelona their second away win of the season. Real lead the standings on 32 points, four clear of Barcelona and Villarreal who travel to Valladolid on Sunday, while Espanyol are in fourth spot, two points further back. An injury-hit Sevilla slumped to their third defeat in a row when they lost 1-0 at Almeria, defender Santiago Acasiete scoring the winner with a header after an 87th-minute free kick. Sevilla dominated most of the game but had to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after influential defender Daniel Alves was sent off for picking up a second booking. DEFENSIVE RECORD Racing came to the Bernabeu with the best defensive record in the league having conceded only nine goals all season, but Real took less than four minutes to score. Ruud van Nistelrooy slipped a superb diagonal pass between the Racing centre backs towards Raul who steered a low shot past Tono with his favoured left foot. Racing's defence was breached again five minutes later when defender Sergio Sanchez turned the ball into his own net trying to clear off the line after midfielder Wesley Sneijder rounded the keeper and slid an acute-angled shot in from the byline. Raul almost added a third when he dinked the ball over Tono only to see his effort headed off the line but he got his second 20 minutes from time when he curled a free kick over the wall. Despite the scoreline Racing played some neat football in midfield and were rewarded for their perseverance when former Real Madrid striker Pedro Munitis fired home from close range three minutes later. Like Real, Barca took an early lead in their match, Iniesta guiding in at the far post after Messi had scorched his way past three players on the right and cut a great pass across the area. Messi caused constant problems for the Espanyol back four with his dazzling runs into the area, while Xavi and highly-rated youngster Bojan Krkic hit the bar in a double chance shortly after the half hour. Despite their dominance Barca were unable to extend their lead and Espanyol equalised midway through the second half when Corominas angled in a clever volley after Albert Riera got the better of Carles Puyol on the left. Ronaldinho started on the Barca bench for the second game in a row and the Brazilian was unable to take advantage of several chances after he came on late in the match
