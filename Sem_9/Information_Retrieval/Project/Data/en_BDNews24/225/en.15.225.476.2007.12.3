<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The government may take a decision on the committee of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Tuesday, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. "We have yet to decide on the issue, but a decision may be taken tomorrow (Tuesday)," Azizul told reporters at Sonargaon Hotel Monday, answering questions on the FBCCI committee. General members of the apex trade body are in uncertainty over the fate of their organisation as the extended tenure of the current executive committee ends on Dec 6. Some members want the present committee to continue while others want an administrator appointed by the governor. Elections to the FBCCI's executive body were scheduled for Nov 22, but a legal hitch over the voter roll halted the election process. The possibility of appointing an administrator by the commerce ministry to run the FBCCI was discussed at various levels as the committee president Mir Nasir Hossain chose to quit. "I'm ready to quit the committee on Dec 6," Hossain told bdnews24.com Saturday. Earlier, BGMEA leaders Annisul Huq, Mohammad A Salam, Faisal Samad, ABM Shamsuddin and Ferdous Parvez Bivon were dropped from the FBCCI voter list. FBCCI dropped the five from the voter roll after businessman Mahbub Minhaz filed a petition claiming that BMGEA members had been elected to the executive committee through a flawed poll. The arbitration council of FBCCI in its verdict said the BGMEA election was held in violation of court orders. bd
