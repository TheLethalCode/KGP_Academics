<TITLE> Volvo equipment arm sees profitability rising in Q4 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Volvo said on Monday its construction equipment arm is expected to show higher profitability in the fourth quarter than in the third, barring any unforeseen disruptions in its stretched production system. Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), which accounts for nearly a fifth of revenues at the Sweden-based vehicles group, reported an operating margin of 6.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 8.9 percent in the year-ago period. "I am expecting, and hoping, the fourth quarter to be somewhat better than the third quarter," VCE Chief Tony Helsham told Reuters in a telephone interview. Third-quarter earnings at Volvo's second-biggest division, which makes heavy equipment for road-building and other projects, were stung by higher manufacturing costs and disruptions at stretched plants, along with a strike at its excavator plant in South Korea. Helsham said it was tough to make forecasts for the fourth quarter and although the wage dispute with employees in South Korea had been resolved, the cost of making up production lost due to the strike would weigh on results. "Remember that we do have additional cost in the production system now -- additional cost of overtime to be able to ship the big volumes," he said. While he expected problems with production of axles for articulated trucks and transmissions for wheel loaders at Swedish plants, reported in the third quarter, to linger to the end of the year, no new disruptions had emerged, he said. U.S. DARKEST CLOUD Volvo stood by its outlook for industry shipments of construction gear this year, Helsham said, adding market conditions so far were in line with the firm's expectations. Volvo expects North American shipments of construction equipment to fall to 50,000 units this year from 57,000 machines in 2006. Helsham said the North American market was likely to bottom out at 44,000 units in 2008. "The darkest cloud is still North America. Will it bottom out next year? We hope so but I think it is too early to give a firm direction there," he said. Predicting how the North American market will develop was especially difficult, Helsham said, citing the added uncertainty surrounding the "subprime debacle and the murkiness of the risk in the banking system". Repeating Volvo's outlook of 10 percent growth in the European construction gear market this year, Helsham said the market there was likely to remain "very stable" with "moderate growth" in 2008, while prospects in Asia remained favourable. Helsham added the unit would continue to offset high raw material costs, raising prices of its own products next year. "The orders of magnitude depend on the product and on the region, but we are talking about typically somewhere between 2 and 5 percent in the first price increase next year," he said. "There will probably be a second one by the middle of next year, but it is too early to tel
