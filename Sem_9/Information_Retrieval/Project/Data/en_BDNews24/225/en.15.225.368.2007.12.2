 CAIRO, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Orascom Construction Industries boosted Egypt's benchmark index to a fresh high after its global depositary receipts in London jumped on Friday, brokers said. The stock gained 2.5 percent to last trade at 515.10 Egyptian pounds ($93.15) after OCI's GDR shares surged 5.6 percent to close at $182 on Friday on bullish global sentiment. Global markets rose on Friday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in two weeks and news that the U.S. government is working on plans to help homeowners recover from the subprime mortgage crisis. The Case 30 index gained 1.1 percent to 9,828.02 points, while the well watched Hermes index rose 1.3 percent to 86,724.24 points, both at new record levels. "OCI has an influential weight in the indexes but the day also saw almost all big caps in the green," Mohamed Ashmawy, senior equity sales trader at CIBC Brokerage, said. Orascom Telecom shares ended 0.5 percent up at 84.50 pounds after Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co (Zain) said on Saturday it had agreed to buy OT's stake in an Iraqi mobile phone network for $1.2 billion. OT, which set up one of three mobile phone networks in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, failed at an auction this year to secure a licence to continue operations in the country before agreeing a $2.2 billion joint venture with Iraqi Kurdish operator Korek Telecom, which won a licence at the auction. "The market reacted positively because this is a good price and will serve Orascom Telecom planned expansions in Lebanon and Korea," Tarek el-Khayyat of Delta Securities said. Brokers said shares in Alexandria Mineral Oils Company AMOC were heavily traded after breaking a share price resistance level at 83 pounds. AMOC gained 3.1 percent to last trade at 83.90 pounds. "It is also normal to see AMOC moving with what is happening in international oil markets," Ashmawy said. Bucking the upward market trend was real estate Talaat Mustafa Group, which shed more than 6 percent to last trade at 12.46 pounds as profit taking continued on the stock, brokers said. "This won't last for long as the price became attractive for buying again," Khayyat said. ($1 = 5.53 Egyptian poun
