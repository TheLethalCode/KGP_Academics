 BELOVSKY, Russia, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In the snowbound villages of Siberia, Russia's economic boom has done little to improve the fortunes of local residents. That did not prevent whole families in Belovsky, a village where half the population is unemployed, flocking to vote for President Vladimir Putin in a parliamentary election on Sunday. "I voted for United Russia, because I believe that Putin can help us, simple working folk," said Sergei Ilin, 34, an unemployed resident of the village. Putin is heading the United Russia party, which pollsters forecast will win a large majority in a show of public support that the president can use as a mandate to retain influence after his second presidential term ends next year. Across Altai region, tucked between the Kazakh steppe and the mountains from which it takes its name, residents young and old turned out for celebrations to mark the election. Vodka and food sales rose, said one shopkeeper in Belovsky, where most residents buy their groceries on credit. Like much of rural Russia, the region descended into poverty after the fall of the Soviet Union. The village's pride and joy was a large pig-breeding complex that collapsed in the turbulent 1990s. While 4,000 km (2,485 miles) separates voters in Altai from Moscow's glitz and oil wealth, voting patterns tell the same story as in the capital. Under Putin, say residents, things can only get better. "I voted for United Russia because I really want to live better. I have two children and, more than anything in the world, I hope they never want for anything," said Olga Chumak. The 28-year-old had only one request for those in power. "Give us, rural people, work. I'd even agree to a wage of 3,000 roubles ($123)," she said. Russia's average monthly wage is 13,540 roubles ($556). Sergei and Lyudmila Lopatov brought their daughter and two grandchildren to vote at a community centre, where a poster advertised the weekly disco. Entry: 15 roubles, game of table-tennis included. Even those too frail to vote made their voice heard. Electoral officials brought the ballot box to the home of 94-year-old Sofiya Kolesnikova. "My legs don't move, but my head works. I'm always watching the television and follow politics closely," she said. "Today I voted for Putin and for United Russia, because our president supports the young, and the young in the village are the most important thing. "And what's more, as a man, how I like him!"
