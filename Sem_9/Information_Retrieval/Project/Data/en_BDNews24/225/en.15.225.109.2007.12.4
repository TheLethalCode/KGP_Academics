<TITLE> Japan parties would split vote in snap poll: paper </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan`s main opposition party would run neck and neck with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party if a snap election were called, a poll showed on Tuesday, a finding that could make the prime minister wary of calling an early vote. No lower house election need be held until late 2009, but some pundits and lawmakers say Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda could call one early next year if the political stalemate deepens over a bill to restart a naval mission supporting U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan. The national poll of voters, conducted on Saturday and Sunday, found 32 percent of respondents would vote for the ruling LDP if a snap election were called, while the same number would pick the opposition Democratic Party, the Asahi newspaper said. However, the overall support ratings for the two main parties moved sideways from the previous month's poll, with the LDP rating staying at 31 percent and the Democrat's rating nudging down to 23 percent from 24 percent, the Asahi reported. The bill to resume Japan's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean has become bogged down in the upper house of parliament, which is controlled by the opposition parties. An upper house panel began to discuss the bill on Tuesday after it was approved by the lower house last month. But the upper house would most likely reject the bill because the Democrats have vowed to oppose the mission. The ruling bloc may use its two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house to override upper chamber decisions. But to do that, the current parliamentary session that is due to end on Dec. 15 may have to be extended for about a month. Japanese voters were split over the refueling mission, too, with 44 percent of respondents in favour, up from 43 percent a month earlier, and another 44 percent against it, up from 41 percent, the Asahi survey showed. The poll showed that 46 percent of voters thought it "reasonable" for the ruling bloc to use its two-thirds majority in the lower chamber to enact the bill, while 37 percent said this would be "unreasonable". Voters were cautious on whether a snap election need be held, however, with 55 percent saying Fukuda need not rush, against 34 percent who wanted a poll "as soon as possible", the survey showed. Japanese politics was thrown into turmoil last month when Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa first discussed a coalition with Fukuda, then tendered his resignation when his party executives rejected the idea. He finally decided to stay on after Democratic lawmakers, fearing he might defect to the ruling camp, begged him not to quit. bd
