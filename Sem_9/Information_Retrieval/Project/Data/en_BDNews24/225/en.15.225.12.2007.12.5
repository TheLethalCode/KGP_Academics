<TITLE> Japan stocks climb on Northern Rock, yen retreats </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese shares climbed on Wednesday to their first positive close this week on a report that the British government has drafted a plan to nationalise troubled mortgage lender Northern Rock if it fails to strike a deal with private buyers. The report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper weakened the yen and set off short-covering across the board, being taken by the market as a sign that the credit crunch stemming from the US subprime mortgage problem is being properly handled. The yen's retreat helped to lift exporters such as Honda Motor Co, while buying of retailers provided additional upward momentum. Mizuho Financial Group Inc later said it would inject $1.4 billion into its money-losing brokerage unit, which has been hit by spiralling losses on subprime-related investments. Most of the day's trade was short-term, as investors sidelined themselves ahead of U.S. economic indicators such as jobs data later this week and a Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 11. Market participants said the reaction to the Northern Rock report mirrored last week's market response to news of an Abu Dhabi Investment Authority stake in Citigroup Inc, a wave of short-covering on relief that the subprime loan problem was being dealt with. "Though these are completely different things, they're similar in the market's mind, with investors rushing to cover short positions," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. The dollar's climb to around 110.30 yen also helped lift Tokyo shares, particularly exporters, on a day of relatively thin trade. Amid the late short-covering, languishing steel firms and trading houses remained weak as market attention starts to focus on the longer-term impact of the subprime problem on the wider global economy. "Concern about the subprime problem has been centred mainly on financial firms up to now, but we'll now start seeing a shift in attention to its impact on the economy as a whole, which will really pick up after next week's Fed meeting exhausts that as a factor," Miura said. The benchmark Nikkei average closed up 0.8 percent or 128.69 points at 15,608.88 in its first positive day this week. The broader TOPIX was up 0.7 percent at 1,526.63. DOMESTIC BUYING, STEEL SOFTENS Steel makers were a drag on the market for the second straight day. Steel makers fell with Nippon Steel Corp down 2.3 percent at 640 yen, while Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd lost 3 percent to 456 yen and JFE Holdings Inc declined 3.7 percent to 5,550 yen. Retailers rose led by Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd after UBS Securities said in its outlook for 2008 that one part of its strategy was to focus on domestic demand-oriented stocks. Seven & I, which rose 3.7 percent to 2,950 yen, was one of the broker's top 10 picks. Domestic demand and personal consumption may show particular recoveries on a smaller increase in pension and tax burdens than in previous years, UBS strategist Shoji Hirakawa said in a report. After the close, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it has successfully completed a $849 million bid to buy out minority shareholders in loss-making supermarket chain Seiyu Ltd., increasing its bet on the Japanese market. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, launched a tender offer for shares in Seiyu in late October, aiming to buy the roughly 49 percent it did not already own in the firm. The offer closed on Dec. 4. Banks fought off early sales on sentiment carried over from Wall Street, where financial firms fell, with several major banks finishing higher. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group jumped 2.7 percent to 1,152 yen and Mizuho Financial Group rose 1.8 percent to 614,000 yen.
