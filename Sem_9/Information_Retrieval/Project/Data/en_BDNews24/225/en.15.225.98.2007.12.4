Rauf, 28, will replace second wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed in the 15-man squad to reinforce the pace attack after Umar Gul missed both previous tests with back trouble and returned home. All-rounder Yasir Arafat was flown in as replacement for Gul. Pakistan, hit by illness, drew the second test in Kolkata on Tuesday after the hosts won the opening game in New Delhi by six wickets. The third and final test in Bangalore starts on Saturday
