 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene heaped praise on his players after beating England by 88 runs on the final day of the first test on Wednesday. The home side fought back in style after being reduced to 42 for five in their first innings on the opening day. "We are delighted with the effort," Jayawardene told reporters. "A lot of players contributed brilliantly like Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando and showed a lot of character. "The ball did not do a lot today when it got soft but we knew there were going to be tough situations and had to be patient and wait for opportunities with the second new ball. Murali came to the party with three late wickets and made the difference." Jayawardene also paid tribute to all-rounder Sanath Jayasuriya, who has brought down the curtain on his 18-year career. "Sanath's loss is going to be huge but he's made his decision and all credit to him for leaving on his own terms," said Sri Lanka's skipper. CONFIDENCE BOOST Jayawardene's counterpart Michael Vaughan was pleased with the character shown by England after they came within minutes of saving the game following a seventh-wicket stand of 109 between Ian Bell (74) and Matt Prior (63). "Six batsmen down half an hour after lunch and realistically we were looking at losing the test in mid-afternoon," said Vaughan after his side were bowled out for 261. "But that partnership is a real confidence boost we'll take to the next test in Colombo on Sunday because of the way they played Murali's spin and also the reverse swinging ball. They showed a hell of a lot of character." Vaughan said seam bowler Matthew Hoggard was an injury concern for the second test due to a stiff back. "He is not moving that well and is doubtful," said the England captain. "It will be a huge blow if he is ruled out because of what he offers with the new ball and his expertise with the old ball. But if he is ruled out it gives an opportunity for someone else to come in.
