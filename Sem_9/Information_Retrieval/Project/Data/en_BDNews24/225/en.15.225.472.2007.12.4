 Cairo, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian security forces have arrested 11 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Sohag, south of the Egyptian capital, in the latest crackdown on the opposition Islamist movement, security sources said on Monday. The sources said the men were arrested during raids on their homes on Sunday on charges of belonging to a banned group and possessing anti-government literature. They were ordered to be detained for 15 days on Monday. The Egyptian government calls the Brotherhood an illegal organisation and often detains its members without charge. But members of the group hold a fifth of the seats in parliament and the non-violent movement operates openly within limits. More than 100 Brotherhood members are currently in detention, including several dozen who are on trial in military court on terrorism and money laundering charges. bd
