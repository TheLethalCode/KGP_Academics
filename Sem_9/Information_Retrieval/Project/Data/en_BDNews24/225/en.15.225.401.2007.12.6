<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Wednesday said the issue of waiving farm loans in Sidr-ravaged areas was under scrutiny. "Bangladesh Bank's job is to advise banksnot to impose conditions on them. It is being examined that what problems the banks may face if agricultural loans are waived or collections are postponed for a period in the cyclone-hit areas," he told reporters in a press briefing after he returned from the south. "We will also assess how the central bank or government can help them make up for the losses," the governor said. He said the central bank reminded the banks several times to ensure that farmers in the region battered by the Nov 15 cyclone receive fast loans. Narrating the experience he had in the cyclone-ruined south, Salehuddin said private banks in the Sidr-hit areas do not give loans. He said the banks operate the bulk of the loans in Dhaka although the areas were "highly potential" for the growth of small and medium enterprises. bdnews
