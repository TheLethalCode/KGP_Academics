 LONDON, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil bounced off early lows to stand near $89 a barrel on Tuesday with the market awaiting a clear signal from OPEC as a chorus of opinion within the exporting group spoke against an output increase. US crude eased 28 cents a barrel to $89.03 by 1215 GMT, off lows of $88.35. It had hit a five-week low of $87.14 in the previous session. London Brent crude was up 23 cents at $90.03, off lows of $89.18. U.S. weekly petroleum inventory figures, to be released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday, were also expected to shape prices. "The market is idling at the moment waiting for a clear signal from OPEC and of course looking ahead to tomorrow's EIA data," said Simon Wardell, oil analyst with Global Insight in London. OPEC's big Gulf producers have left open the option of a supply increase at Wednesday's meeting in Abu Dhabi, while insisting that supplies are sufficient to meet winter fuel demand and that high oil prices are driven by factors outside OPEC's control. OPEC's decision could influence whether crude prices head back towards $100 a barrel or not. Ministers and officials from Qatar, Venezuela, Iran and Libya have spoken against the need to pump more oil, while OPEC's core Gulf producers, led by Saudi Arabia, have avoided comment on whether the group might still opt for an output increase to rein in prices. "All options are open," Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister for OPEC's biggest producer Saudi Arabia and one of OPEC's most influential oil ministers told reporters on Tuesday. Edward Meir, at MF Global, said: "The decision will come down to the wire, and much will ride on where prices are on Wednesday and how strongly the Saudis will push for an increase." Oil is down around 10 percent from its Nov. 21 peak of $99.29 a barrel as worries that the weakening U.S. economy could cut into world energy demand have halted crude's rally. The slump in prices and the dimming demand outlook has also made OPEC more reluctant to raise output. Consuming nations have called on OPEC to put more oil on the market, to stem the decline in inventories ahead of the northern hemisphere winter and to temper prices. NO HIKE A Reuters poll of 23 banks, traders and funds on Monday showed 12 participants did not expect OPEC to raise output. Late last week, a similar poll had 18 out of 24 participants expecting an increase of around 500,000 barrels per day. Adding to support for prices, OPEC's November production levels, excluding Iran and Angola, failed to reach the target set in September, when the cartel agreed to increase supplies by 500,000 bpd, a Reuters survey found. A poll of analysts by Reuters ahead of Wednesday's US inventory data showed crude stockpiles probably fell 800,000 barrels in the week to Nov. 30. Distillate stocks were seen down 300,000 barrels and gasoline inventories up 1.3 million barre
