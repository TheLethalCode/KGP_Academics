<TITLE> Govt warns NGOs against loan recovery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government Tuesday took a tough line on the allegations that NGOs continued to press for repayments of micro-loans from their clients in Sidr-ravaged areas. Adviser MA Matin, chief coordinator of disaster management, rehabilitation and relief work, warned that actions would be taken against the NGOs in line with emergency rules if they did not stop collecting loan repayments. The same day, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed spoke on the issue, although their tones were a bit softer. Fakhruddin asked NGOs to be sympathetic to microcredit clients, while the army chief told banks and NGOs to waive payments of loan instalments until April in the cyclone-hit areas, considering the sufferings of people. The Nov 15 cyclone that killed over 3,200 people pushed survivors into a serious cash crisis. Thousands of people are homeless and without adequate food or clean water. Well-off families have lost infrastructure and cash crops. In a press conference in Barisal, Matin, communications adviser, said NGOs had assured the government that they stopped collections of loan repayments in the Sidr-hit areas. He however did not mention any timeframe. "Complaints are there. Some NGOs still engage in recovering their repayments. We've asked district and upazila level administrations to probe the matter," he told journalists. "If guilty, actions will be taken against them," he said. "If nothing else, please be sympathetic at least to those without means of income," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim quoted Fakhruddin as saying. Fakhruddin held a meeting with NGO representatives in his office Tuesday. General Moeen asked the banks and NGOs to waive loan instalments at least until April 2008 considering the distress of the cyclone-hit people. "The job of the NGOs is to help the poor, not to chase them for recovery of loan instalments. Media reports have it that they are pressing them for repayment. It is not desirable at all," he told journalists after accepting donations from people and organisations for the army relief fund at the Army Headquarters. bdnews2
