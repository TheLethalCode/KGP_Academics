 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Real Madrid and Brazil coach Vandelei Luxemburgo has called on the Brazilian government to take action to slow the exodus of young players to foreign clubs. Luxemburgo, whose Santos side finished second in this year's Brazilian championship, complained that the competition had stopped unveiling new talents. He said Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni had been voted the competition's top player for the last two years and that Argentina's Carlos Tevez won the award the year before that. "Three years ago, the best player in the Brazilian championship was Tevez, and for the last two years it has been a goalkeeper," he told delegates at an international soccer forum. "We don't have the players we did before and the last three years have been a clear indication that we are short of quality in Brazilian football. "The last generation was (in 2002) at Santos with Diego, Robinho, Renato. Since then, we haven't seen a great new talent." Luxemburgo said he wanted the government to introduce legislation that would tie players to their clubs until they reached the age of 23. He complained that many players were leaving at such a young age that they were effectively being raised by European clubs. Alexandro Pato, seen as Brazil's current outstanding prospect, has already joined AC Milan at the age of 18. "It's important to raise the players in Brazilian football," he said. "The exodus is constant. Players are being formed by other professionals who don't have our knowledge.
