 MILAN, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- AC Milan have still to win at home in the league this season after being held to a lively 0-0 draw by Juventus on Saturday. Second-placed Juve had the better chances with David Trezeguet, the league's top scorer on 11 goals, striking the near post on 12 minutes after Cristiano Zanetti's superb lob over Milan's defence. Stuttering Milan, who went close when Kaka was denied by Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon, are seventh having drawn five and lost two of their home Serie A games this term. Leaders Inter Milan, two points ahead of Juve, face a difficult trip to Fiorentina on Sunday when AS Roma host high-flying Udinese. Juve, back in the top flight after spending last season in Serie B after a demotion for match-fixing, have now drawn with the three other sides making up Italy's "big four". They drew 1-1 at home to Inter last month and 2-2 at AS Roma in September. "We are a Juve that must be respected and...with this mentality we can achieve some great results," Buffon told Sky Sport before adding a note of caution about the title. "The Scudetto is not something for us." SMART SAVE As well as Trezeguet's effort, Claudio Ranieri's side almost broke the deadlock when Milan keeper Dida produced a smart save early in the second period from Hasan Salihamidzic's drive. Kaka, expected to be given the Ballon d'Or on Sunday, was then denied by Buffon from close range with Alberto Gilardino correctly flagged offside when he netted the rebound. Milan striker Gilardino also had a penalty appeal turned down when he tumbled with defender Nicola Legrottaglie in a game where several players slipped on the skiddy surface. Substitute and former Juve frontman Filippo Inzaghi shot straight at Buffon from the edge of the area midway through second half. Ronaldo, who made his first appearance of the season only last weekend, was again missing through injury. The two club captains, Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Del Piero, started on the bench with age catching up on them but both entered the fray in the second half. Groups of Juventus fans were banned from travelling because of fears of trouble but the San Siro was still almost full, in stark contrast to recent poor attendances at European games. Sampdoria earlier moved up to sixth after a 3-0 home win over fourth-bottom Reggina. Antonio Cassano controlled the ball on the edge of the box before threading a pass for strike partner Claudio Bellucci to slot home on five minutes. Paolo Sammarco shot through a crowded area to extend the lead on 56 before Bellucci netted his seventh of the campaign moments after Reggina defender Maurizio Lanzaro was dismissed for a second yellow. Bellucci hit a post in the first half while hapless Reggina had coach Renzo Ulivieri sent off in the second period for a spat with Cassano, who was substituted to avoid a red
