 LAHORE, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police stopped US Ambassador Anne Patterson on Monday from meeting Aitzaz Ahsan, a leading Pakistani opposition figure being held under house arrest, a US embassy spokeswoman said. Ahsan, a lawyer and former member of the National Assembly for Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, was detained under emergency powers invoked by President Pervez Musharraf on Nov. 3. The former cabinet minister was held at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for nearly three weeks before being transferred to house arrest in the eastern city of Lahore and allowed to file nomination papers for a parliamentary election set for Jan. 8. Patterson had requested permission days earlier to meet Ahsan, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association. When the envoy arrived at Ahsan's home she was barred from seeing him, but was allowed to meet his wife, Bushra, along with several lawyers in another part of the house. "The ambassador met Bushra Aitzaz to express concern and repeated U.S. calls for all detainees to be released, including Aitzaz Ahsan," Elizabeth Colton, the embassy spokeswoman said. The government says it has released more than 5,000 detainees in the last two weeks. A small number of judges and lawyers, whose interpretation of the law posed the most serious challenge to Musharraf's authority, remain either under house arrest or in prison. Earlier on Monday in Lahore, Patterson met Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf deposed in 1999. Patterson has also urged Pakistan to end a clampdown on sections of the media. "The U.S. government has said it is strongly supportive of lifting of any remaining curbs on the media and freeing all remaining detainees," Patterson told journalists. The United States wants Musharraf to revoke emergency rule, which he has said he will do on Dec. 16, restore the constitution, release prisoners held under the emergency, and to hold free and fair elections. It has not called on Musharraf to restore the judiciary. Some 60 judges were dismissed after they refused to go along with Musharraf taking emergency powers and suspending the constitution. Prior to declaring the emergency, Musharraf had feared that Supreme Court judges were going to annul his re-election by parliament on Oct. 6 because he contested while still army chief. Musharraf last week gave up his dual role to be sworn in as a civilian president, having received the go-ahead from a court filled with government-friendly judges. Ahsan shot to prominence earlier this year when he acted as chief counsel for Iftikhar Chaudhry, the Supreme Court chief justice Musharraf tried to sack in March, setting off a train of events that culminated in the emergency. Chaudhry and several other judges remain under house arrest at their official residences in Islamabad, although the authorities say they are free to go back to their home tow
