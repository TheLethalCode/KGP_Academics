<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday said the present caretaker government is committed to implementing recommendations made by the Regulatory Reforms Commission to ensure a better business environment. "The commission has been formed at the chief adviser's initiation. The government is fully committed to implementing the commission's recommendations," Azizul told a discussion on business regulation reforms at the Sonargaon Hotel. "Initially, I was sceptical as many committees have made many recommendations in the past, but those remained unimplemented," the adviser said at the meeting organised by Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, a non-profit think tank. Quoting the chief adviser, he said the commission would not have been formed unless the government was committed to regulatory reform. On the basis of past experience, public and private sector representatives who attended the discussion expressed doubt whether the recommendations of the RRC would be realised. RRC chairman Akbar Ali Khan, who spoke as special guest, also expressed his apprehension on the implementation of the recommendations made by the RRC. "Past experience worries me. I'm in doubt how many of the recommendations will be implemented," Khan, also a former finance adviser, told the discussion participants. The RRC chairman added, however, that the chief adviser had assured him of the government's commitment to the commission's recommendations. Khan remarked that Bangladesh is an "ir-regulated" country. "It is neither over-regulated nor under-regulated," he said. Azizul asked the commission to hold discussions with all stakeholders, including government, businesses, media and civil societyto attain the RRC's objective of ensuring a 'better business environment'. He also stressed that the private sector itself should incur the compliance cost of any reforms and should not take advantage of any loopholes in the absence of a strong monitoring system. Azizul highlighted the importance of continuity in the reform process in line with global changes, saying: "Reforms cannot be a one-shot exercise." The adviser said there is a mindset problem, not only in the government but also in the private sector. "We'll have to address the issue," he added. The RRC chairman said he along with other commission members would meet the chief adviser at Tuesday morning to submit their first reform proposal. The RRC was supposed to submit its proposal Monday, but deferred submission by a day, he said. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute president Farooq Sobhan chaired the discussion. Managing partner of SENSE Consulting of Croatia Vendran Antoljak and chairman of the Working Committee on Regulatory Reforms in Kenya Ben Musau shared their experiences on regulatory reforms in developing economies. bdn
