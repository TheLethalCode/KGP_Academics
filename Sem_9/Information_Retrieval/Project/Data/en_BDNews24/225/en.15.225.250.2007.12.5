 Summer Said and Tom Ashby ABU DHABI, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- OPEC agreed on Wednesday to keep exports unchanged, Nigerian Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia said, rebuffing consumer country calls for more crude to rein in $90-a-barrel oil. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries also agreed to meet again on Feb. 1 to review its decision. Ministers justified their decision on the grounds they were believed they were already pumping enough crude to meet winer fuel demand after a September decision to lift output. "Our position is that demand and supply are balanced and there is no need to increase oil to the market," said Iranian Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari. "Prices had been falling, many members thought that not enough attrition in OECD inventories had occurred yet, the last increase has not filtered through yet and so there was an increase already in progress," said analyst Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital. The 13-member cartel came under pressure from big consumers like the United States to raise output to help contain an a price rally that saw crude hit a record above $99 a barrel on Nov. 21. Expectations for an increase were one of the factors behind an $11 reversal in prices in the two weeks before OPEC met. Immediately after Wednesday's decision, prices rose $1.70 to $90.01 a barrel. Some in OPEC share consumer country concerns about the impact of high energy costs on economic growth as a U.S. slowdown threatens to spill over into the global economy. But ministers argue that they cannot control prices because speculators have divorced prices from market fundamentals. "A widespread perception of market tightness and the fear of future shortages have fuelled increasing market speculation," said OPEC President Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli. "Increased speculation has detached prices from fundamentals." OPEC also set output targets for its new members Angola and Ecuador at 1.9 million barrels a day and 520,000 bpd respectively.
