 Barisal, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com)The central bank Sunday asked commercial banks in the Sidr-ravaged areas of Barisal to fast-track soft loans to cyclone survivors. The nationalised and specialised commercial banks have a target to disburse Tk 1,300 crore in soft loans in the cyclone-affected areas, said Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, who made a trip to the battered south to drum up farm loans. The governor had separate meetings Sunday with officials of Bangladesh Bank's Barisal office, bankers and businessmen. Ahmed said that Tk 8,000 crore was meant for soft farm loans to be disbursed for the current fiscal year and Tk 1,300 crore out of the total allocation was earmarked for the cyclone-ravaged region. "We asked banks to release 80 percent of the loans by December so that the cyclone-affected people could regain their livelihoods as soon as possible," Salehuddin said. At the meeting with representatives of the business community, the central banker stressed the importance of economic vibrancy in the area to allow Sidr survivors to return to their normal lives quickly. "Profits should not be made from the sufferings of the distressed people. These tendencies should be avoided," he told the businessmen. In a separate meeting, Salehuddin asked bank officials to disburse necessary housing loans and warned against harassing those in need of loans. "Bank loans will be an important means for them (cyclone survivors) in this regard. Loans must be given to small farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs disregarding their arrears," he said. Salehuddin added that banks in the cyclone-hit areas have been asked to disburse loans on easy terms and conditions to professionals as well. bdnews24.com
