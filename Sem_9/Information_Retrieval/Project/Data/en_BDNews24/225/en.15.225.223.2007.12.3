 TBISILI, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia plans to lift a ban on opposition television station Imedi, acting President Nino Burjanadze said on Monday, a major demand of the former Soviet state's Western allies ahead of a Jan. 5 presidential election. Police raided Imedi's office on Nov. 7 and smashed equipment after forcing anti-government protesters off the streets of Tbilisi with tear gas and plastic bullets.

Western critics say the vote could not be considered fair if Imedi, the largest opposition broadcaster, was banned. Saakashvili came to power in a peaceful 2003 revolution. He wants Georgia to join both NATO and the European Union and is feted in the West for his market reforms, but Georgia's opposition says he has mishandled the economy and presides over a corrupt government. He denies the accusatio
