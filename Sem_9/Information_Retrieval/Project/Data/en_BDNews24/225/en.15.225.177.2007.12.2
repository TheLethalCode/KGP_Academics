 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court hears extortion charges against Sheikh Hasina Monday, setting off the trial of the former prime minister, a lawyer said. Judge Md Azizul Hoque of Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judges' Court, now sited on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, will hear the case. In a decision on Nov 28, the judge set Monday for the hearing. The court was transferred to the Sangsad Bhaban area for security reasons, an official notification had earlier said. Nov 28 was the early date for starting the trial. But the date was reset to Monday since defence lawyers said they did not get the government notification in time on the transfer of the court. Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman will join the team of lawyers to defend his party chief in court, said defence counsel Kamrul Islam. Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case that involves alleged extortion of Tk 2.99 crore from a businessman during her term in 1996-2001. Rehana, who lives in London, was shown a fugitive in the case while Selim is in jail. Hasina was arrested at her Dhanmondi home and sent to jail hours later on July 16, pending trial. Police formally charged Hasina with extortion on July 24. On June 13, businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the case with Gulshan Police Station against Hasina and Selim, accusing them of taking the amount in return for allowing him to build a power plant. Rehana was implicated in the case later by the police. Hasina and other Awami League leaders denied the charges which they said were aimed at tarnishing the image of the former prime minister. Rehana also expressed her surprise over her implication in the case. bdnews24
