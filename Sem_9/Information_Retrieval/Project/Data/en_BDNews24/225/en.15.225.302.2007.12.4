 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Regulatory Reforms Commission Tuesday submitted twin recommendations to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, its chairman Akbar Ali Khan said. The recommendations are: to post all gazette notifications on the government website, and to take account of public opinion before changing or introducing new rules or regulations (statutory regulatory orders). "We are submitting interim reports on various issues and will submit complete reports in one year," Khan told bdnews24.com by telephone. FBCCI director and RRC member MA Rouf Chowdhury said: "We've suggested the government keep gazette notifications and pre-publications of new rules and regulations on the website for four weeks." "We're hopeful that the government will implement the suggestions to make the rules and regulations people-friendly," he told bdnews24.com at the commerce ministry. The commission has also requested approval from the chief adviser for creation of three separate committees under the chairmanship of the Bangladesh Bank governor, the National Board of Revenue chairman and the Board of Investment executive chairman respectively. The committees would promote a business and investment friendly environment in the country, Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. He said the chief adviser has assured the RRC of executing its suggestions. The interim administration in a major policy decision formed the 17-member commission on Oct 30 to revise outdated rules and regulations and thereby infuse dynamism into the country's economy, governance and administration. Former finance adviser Akbar Ali Khan was appointed chairman of the RRC. The tenure of the commission is one year. The commission held its first board meeting on Nov 18. bdn
