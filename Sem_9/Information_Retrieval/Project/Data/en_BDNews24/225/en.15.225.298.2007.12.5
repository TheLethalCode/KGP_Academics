<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The government will seek emergency funds from the World Heritage Centre to restore the ecosystem and biodiversity of the Sundarbans, badly mauled by the Nov 15 cyclone, officials said Wednesday. Cyclone Sidr killed more than 3,200 people, made millions homeless and destroyed a large part of the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site and home to the Royal Bengal Tiger. Forest officials said they had found two dead tigers and several deer following the cyclone, the worst to hit Bangladesh since 1991, when a storm killed around 143,000 people. Officials said better preparedness and an advance warning system had helped save many people this time, but the vast mangrove forest had also largely offset the impact of the cyclone, which triggered a 5-metre water surge from the Bay of Bengal. According to the forest department's preliminary estimate, the financial loss caused by Sidr to the mangroves would top Tk 10 billion ($145 million), and experts say it might be more. "Bangladesh is preparing a letter asking emergency funding from the World Heritage Centre for immediate rehabilitation of infrastructure in the Sundarbans," said Shafayat Hossain, a senior official at the Environment and Forest Ministry. "After final assessment of total damage to the Sundarbans, we will formally seek assistance from the WHC," he said. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed told donors that Dhaka would need around $150 million to restore the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. "In the backdrop of Sidr, we need to mobilise resources not only for a major forestation programme in the coastal belts, but also to restore the flora and fauna of the Sundarbans," Fakhruddin said. Denmark Wednesday backed Bangladesh's recent appeal to the international community for $1 billion assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction following the cyclone. "I am pleased to see that the people of Bangladesh have already started reconstruction," Ulla Tornaes, Denmark's minister for Development Cooperation, told a news conference in Dhaka after visiting cyclone affected areas in Bangladesh. Denmark has pledged $4 million aid for emergency relief, long-term reconstruction and climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, she said.
