<TEXT>
 Four Rajshahi University teachers Tuesday were convicted for inciting campus unrest in August and sentenced each to two years in prison while two others were cleared. Additional chief judicial magistrate Ruhul Amin handed down the verdict on management teacher Malay Kumar Bhowmik and mass communication teachers Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun. They each were fined Tk 1,000 or face another month in jail should they fail to pay the money. The court acquitted former vice chancellor of the university Saidur Rahman Khan and applied physics teacher Abdus Sobhan of the charges. The court verdict said the four teachers were jailed for breaching emergency powers rules. The accused were in the dock when the judgement was delivered at 11:15am. Since morning, students, teachers and people in general began pouring into Rajshahi judicial magistrate's court complex to hear the judgment, prompting reinforcement of security measures. This is the first verdict delivered in the cases filed in connection with the agitation and excesses committed countrywide for days in the wake of demonstrations the students of Dhaka University staged in late August. The lawyers for the convicts said they would appeal the verdict in the higher court. Reacting to the jail sentences, teachers across the nation said they were deeply concerned at this 'unprecedented and unheard of' court decision. Writer Hasan Azizul Haque, Islamic history and culture professor Sayequzzaman, psychology teacher Shamsuddin Ilyas, mass communication teacher Mashihur Rahman, and others consoled the convicts in the court. "I expected that all our teachers would be acquitted. I know the convicted teachers ver well personally, they have earned a name for themselves as teachers and intellectuals. I never found them involved in anti-state activities," Azizul Haque said after the verdict. Lawyer for the teachers Golam Arif Tipu told reporters that the judgment was based on a contradictory deposition and that the verdict was unlikely to be upheld by the higher court. In the aftermath of the Dhaka University demonstrations, the Rajshahi University campus witnessed widespread student-police clashes on Aug 22. A couple of days later, security forces arrested professors Saidur Rahman, Abdus Sobhan and Malay Kumar Bhowmik. On Aug 26, the local police chief filed a case against the arrestees charging them with instigating the students. On Sept 1, sub-inspector Nasir Uddin of Motihar Police Station pressed charges in the court against the six teachers. Dulal Chandra Biswas, Selim Reza Newton and Abdullah Al Mamun surrendered before the court and the court sent them to prison. Charges were framed in the case on Sept 17 and 20 witnesses testified until Nov 14. An arson case filed over setting afire a car of the DGFI, the intelligence wing of the armed forces, during the demonstrations in Rajshahi, charged 14 persons including geology and mining teachers Sarwar Jahan Sajal and Sabbir Sattar Tapu. The court set Dec 6 for verdict on the case. bdnews24.com/corr/m
