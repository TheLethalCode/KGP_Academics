<TITLE> Lebanon's Berri sure army chief to be president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's army chief will be elected its next president, the parliament speaker said, raising hopes of an end to a year-long standoff between the government and the opposition that had paralysed the country. Parliament Speaker and opposition leader Nabih Berri said rival leaders had agreed on General Michel Suleiman as the consensus candidate to fill the presidency, empty since Nov. 23 when the pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud left office. "The story is over. General Michel Suleiman has become president of the republic," Berri told An-Nahar newspaper. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora also predicted an imminent end to the political crisis. "I am confident that we are on the verge of a solution," he said. Parliament is due to convene on Friday to elect a president. But the vote will only go ahead if the rivals first agree on a broad power-sharing deal, including the shape of a new cabinet. The vote will be delayed a few days if there is no deal. The presidency is the latest stage in a power struggle between the anti-Syrian governing coalition and the opposition led by the pro-Damascus Hezbollah. Suleiman emerged in the last week as a candidate acceptable to both sides. Agreement on a president would defuse a political crisis that has paralysed the country for more than a year and sparked its worst internal strife since the 1975-1990 civil war. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, in Beirut to try to seal a deal between the feuding parties, chaired a three-hour meeting grouping Berri and majority leader Saad al-Hariri. Kouchner described the meeting as "productive and useful". He did not elaborate but indicated more talks will be held on Thursday. Suleiman, 59, had been the consensus candidate favoured by the opposition. He has good ties with Hezbollah and was appointed army chief in 1998 when Syria controlled Lebanon. The governing coalition declared its support for him on Sunday, dropping its opposition to a constitutional amendment needed to allow a senior public servant to become president. Berri said Friday's session was still on schedule. "The process of amendment, the election of the president and the start of consultations (on the formation of a new government) do not require more than two hours," he said. One of the new president's first tasks will be to assign a new prime minister to form the new cabinet, which is now a subject of dispute. Christian leader Michel Aoun, part of the opposition, is demanding guarantees that his share of seats in the new cabinet will reflect the size of his parliamentary bloc -- the biggest of any Christian faction. Maronite Christian bishops warned that more bargaining could hold up the election, prolonging the vacuum in a post reserved for a Maronite. The bishops said in a statement that imposing conditions could "obstruct this election endlessly," reflecting Christian fears that the post could lay empty for some time if there is no deal soon.
