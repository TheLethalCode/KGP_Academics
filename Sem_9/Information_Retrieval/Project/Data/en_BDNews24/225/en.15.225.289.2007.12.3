<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said that former prime minister Sheikh Hasina appeared before the court in acceptance of the rule of law. "If she proves herself innocent, she will be released. If she fails, she will be tried. Nobody is above the law. Everybody is the same in the eyes of the law. The court is doing its work independently," Mainul said. The adviser briefed reporters after a meeting at the housing and public works ministry. On the hearing of charge-framing in a case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against the AL chief and two others, the adviser said: "The government has no interference in the trial of the case. Everybody, whether in the country or abroad, will agree on it." "They have the freedom to appoint lawyers to defend themselves," he said. bdnew
