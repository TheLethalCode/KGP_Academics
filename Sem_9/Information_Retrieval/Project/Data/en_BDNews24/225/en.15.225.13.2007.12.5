 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnew24.com) - Abahani Limited beat Mohammedan SC 2-1 in the second match to level the Teletalk best of three football matches series to raise funds for the Sidr survivors at Bangabandhu National Stadium Wednesday. Abul Hossain and guest booter Motiur Munna struck for Abahani while Jumraul Islam Mithu netted for Mohammedan, who defeated Abahani 5-4 in a sudden- death tiebreaker in the first match. Capitalising on free kick from Munna, Abul headed home in the 33rd minute before the some 8,000-strong crowd while Munna made it 2-0 two minutes into the second half after dodging past Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Islam. Mithu reduced the margin for Mohammedan in the 73rd minute converting a penalty shot after Abahani defender Dominic brought Mohammedan Rony down in the danger zone. The series decider third and final match will be held on Friday at the same venue.
