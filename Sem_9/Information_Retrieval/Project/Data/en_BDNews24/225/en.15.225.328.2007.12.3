 Dhaka, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended lower Monday as investors protested an earlier regulatory move by the Securities and Exchange Commission to stop brokerage houses extending loans to clients. The market regulator rescinded the decision on brokerage house loans Monday after a meeting with Dhaka Stock Exchange officials. Trading was halted for an hour during the protest by investors, though the DSE cited technical reasons for the suspension in a notification. The market opened with a sharp fall in the general index continuing the previous day's trend. However, it recovered significantly in midday trade following the one-hour closure, before declining again towards the close of trade. "One day the SEC executes a decision effective from the next morning and withdraws it in a couple of days. This really creates panic among investors, especially small ones," said Yawer Sayeed, a market analyst. "The drastic rise and fall in the market was due to the collective panic of investors that the SEC might take strict measures such as stop selling shares and seizing investor accounts," he said. "The market was full of such rumours which created massive panic among the investors," said Sayeed, managing director and CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh. He also said the regulatory body's unpredictable moves was partially to blame for overheating of the market. "This really creates panic among investors, especially small onesthough the SEC says their actions are in the interests of small investors. No one other than the small investors are affected by such measures," said Sayeed. The DGEN or general index slumped 5.44 points or 0.18 percent to close at 2873.29. The DSI or all share price index closed at 2428.91, down 5 points or 0.2 percent. The DSE-20 blue chip index also edged down 0.79 points or 0.03 percent to finish at 2262.72.
