 SYDNEY, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia leg spinner Stuart MacGill is to undergo hand surgery and will be sidelined for up to six weeks, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Tuesday. The 35-year-old experienced problems during the second test against Sri Lanka in Hobart last month. "Stuart MacGill will undergo surgery in Sydney on Thursday for carpal tunnel syndrome in the right hand, a common problem that causes hand numbness," CA doctor Trefor James said in a statement. "Although Stuart has had mild symptoms for several months it only began to affect his bowling during the second test against Sri Lanka. After consultation with me in Melbourne today a decision has been taken to proceed with surgery as soon as possible." MacGill is unlikely to be available for selection for the first and second tests of the home series against India, which starts in Melbourne on Dec. 26. MacGill was hoping to secure a regular place in Australia's test team after years of being second choice to Shane Warne, who retired in January. MacGill has taken 203 wickets in 42 tests since making his debut in 1998. His injury could open the door for 36-year-old left-arm spinner Brad Hogg, who was named in the squad for the Sri Lanka series but missed out on selection to MacGill
