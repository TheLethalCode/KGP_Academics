<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) A freedom fighter Wednesday filed a sedition case against Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid and two others for anti-Liberation activities. The other two accused in the case, filed by Md Fazlur Rahman of Companyganj, are Jamaat's assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Molla and former chairman of Islami Bank Shah Md Abdul Hannan. This first such case of treason or sedition in recent times was filed under the Criminal Procedure Code with Dhaka CMM's Court. Metropolitan magistrate Imran Hossain Chowdhury heard the plaintiff's statement in the case. The case accuses the three of obstructing the emergence of an independent Bangladesh in 1971, and creating and ordering the Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams forces to kill pro-liberation civilians including intellectuals. The plaintiff said the accused persons committed crimes of treason by killing about 30 lakh people, raping about two lakh women and other ill activities. It also said that 36 years after liberation, the accused did not yet recognise Bangladesh's victory, flag, constitution or Independence Day. The plaintiff Fazlur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "I could not file a case in the past due to the various adverse political situations in the country." His counsel advocate Abu Mohammad Abdur Razzak said: "War crimes and murder cases can be filed any time." The investigation officer of the case has the authority to approve it, he added. bdn
