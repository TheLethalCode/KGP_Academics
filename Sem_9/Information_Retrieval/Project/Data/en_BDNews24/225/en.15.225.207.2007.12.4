<TITLE> Bermuda gears up for general election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hamilton, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rich, North Atlantic island of Bermuda votes this month in an election being fought over the tenure of Premier Ewart Brown, but the issue of independence from Britain looms in the background. Politicians are campaigning door-to-door in Britain's oldest and most populous remaining colony, where the 36 constituencies are so small, at around 1,100 voters each, that every vote weighs heavily and many sitting members of parliament defend razor-thin majorities. The ruling Progressive Labour Party, or PLP, dubs Brown "the man who gets things done" and credits him with reviving tourism on an island famous for its beaches, status as a tax haven and booming reinsurance industry. Brown has also improved transport by introducing fast ferries to link Bermuda's main island with numerous smaller ones and pushing legislation to revamp taxi services since he took power last year in an internal party vote, the PLP says. But opposition leader Michael Dunkley of the United Bermuda Party calls Brown a polarizing figure who does not tolerate dissent within the PLP, and senior ruling party figures say he could be replaced even if the party wins on Dec. 18. "He operates in a style in which you are either for him or against him, you either go along with what he says or you are part of the opposition," said Stuart Hayward, a political analyst and former independent MP. Brown denies that the election, in which his party hopes to increase its 22-14 majority, is a referendum on his leadership style and says he is a victim of a smear campaign. "I'm not the demon that certain people are determined to make me out to be," he told a campaign rally recently. INDEPENDENCE? The British territory of around 66,000 enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world, a buoyant economy with no unemployment, low inflation and low crime. Its problems lie in providing education and affordable housing. Independence remains a political battleground, even though an opinion poll this year showed that two-thirds of Bermudans oppose cutting links with Britain. The ruling party says independence remains a long-term goal, but it will only push for it once there is popular support. "This election is not about independence, and the Progressive Labour Party will not be using the election results as a basis for launching a campaign," Brown said. The opposition says it will hold a referendum on the subject should it form the next government and argues that the ruling party could use any election victory to push through a bill on independence. "A big part of this election is going to be whether people are prepared to trust Ewart Brown. That's the big question," said Don Grearson, a spokesman for the opposition, which has also questioned Brown's integrity over a police investigation into possible corruption in Bermuda's housing authority. Independence is potentially divisive in a country that is 65 percent black, but where whites, who make up 35 percent of the population, dominated business and politics before a new constitution in 1968 allowed internal self-government. Memories of race riots 30 years ago remain fresh and in the last election the ruling party used its status as the main vehicle for black voters to attempt to scare voters away from the opposition, analysts said.
