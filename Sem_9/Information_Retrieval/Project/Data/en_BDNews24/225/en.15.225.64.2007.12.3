<TITLE> Gulf tries to close ranks over tumbling dollar spat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DOHA, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gulf oil producers tried to close ranks over exchange-rate policy on Monday at talks overshadowed by disagreement between the two largest Arab economies over whether to ride out the dollar's decline or sever currency pegs. States producing a fifth of the world's oil are divided over whether to unshackle currencies from the tumbling dollar, Oman said. The United Arab Emirates said it could consider revaluing after talks with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members. "We will do that after consulting with GCC, our colleagues," UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahayan told reporters. Sheikh Abdullah is the half-brother of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, who promised to seek common ground with five neighbours at a summit in the Qatari capital Doha. The UAE, the second-largest Arab economy after Saudi Arabia, had nourished market expectations of a policy shift at Doha when its central bank called last month for Gulf states to drop their pegs and start tracking a currency basket as Kuwait did in May. The Saudis dismissed the idea on Sunday, other states said reform was not on the agenda and a GCC official told Reuters a draft summit statement simply dodged the main bone of contention. "The statement makes no reference whatsoever to the decline of the dollar," said the official, who had seen the draft prepared for the rulers to discuss. He asked not to be named. Oman said ministers were, however, discussing how to respond to the dollar's tumble to record lows against the euro and a basket of currencies last month, fuelling inflation by driving up the cost of Gulf imports. "There are those who think the dollar crisis is a temporary one that would end in a few months...," Oman's foreign affairs minister said in an interview with Qatar's al-Sharq newspaper. "However there are those who see it necessary to de-link Gulf currencies from the dollar and replace it with a basket of currencies as Kuwait has done," Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah said. "And the ministers are studying this." MOUNTING PRESSURE Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf's largest population, ran budget deficits in the 1990s and fears a revaluation would cut the local currency value of dollar-denominated oil revenue. Its smaller, wealthier neighbours are more concerned the tumbling dollar is stirring trouble among expatriates, who dominate their workforce, and hampering their central banks in the fight against inflation, at decade-highs across the Gulf. After migrant construction workers rioted in Dubai over savings lost to the dollar's slide, UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser al-Suweidi said he was under mounting social and economic pressure to drop the peg. Suweidi complained the pegs forced central banks to shadow U.S. monetary policy to prevent currency appreciation when the Federal Reserve is cutting rates and inflation is running at a 19-year high of 9.3 percent in the UAE. Both sides raised the temperature of the debate on Sunday. State-controlled UAE news agency WAM said official banking sources expected rulers to change currency policy at the summit in Qatar, but later retracted the report. By then ministers from other states had said reform was not even on the agenda. Bids on the Saudi riyal slipped on Monday off 21-year highs to as low as 3.7182 per dollar after Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf ruled out dropping the peg. "We will not drop it. That's it," Assaf told reporters on Sunday in Doha. The riyal hit 3.6800 on Nov. 28, its strongest since 1986 when the central bank fixed the peg at 3.75 per dollar. Bids on the UAE dirham also eased to as low as 3.6715 per dollar. The currency, which the central bank has kept stable at 3.6725 against the dollar since 1997, hit a 17-year high of 3.6561 per dollar on Friday. "The decisions we will make and the joint views we will reach, will boost the march toward integration between our countries...," UAE President Sheikh Khalifa said as he arrived for the meeting in a statement carried by WAM. UAE policymakers, from the finance minister to the head of the federal advisory council, have backed Suweidi's call for currency reform, saying they would only act in concert with neighbours preparing for monetary union as early as 2010. The draft statement will say the rulers are committed to meeting the 2010 deadline for monetary union, although it will recommend a review of the timetable, the GCC official sa
