 ATHENS, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece and Macedonia will hold talks under UN supervision in January to try to resolve a long-standing dispute between the neighbours and hopefully boost stability in the Balkans, a UN envoy said on Wednesday. Greece rejects the chosen name of its northern neighbour, Macedonia, under which the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, because Macedonia is also the name of a northern Greek province and birthplace of Alexander the Great. Greece has threatened to block Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union if it refuses to accept a new name. UN envoy Matthew Nimetz said if the meeting in the Macedonian capital Skopje in January was successful, a second meeting would be held in Athens at a later date.

Macedonian hopes for an invitation next year to join NATO. Nimetz said a deal should be ideally clinched before the NATO summit in the spring next year.

So many good things can happen if this issue is resolved," he said. Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said Skopje was "prepared to host our Greek colleagues at the highest political level," the MIA state news agency reported. A foreign ministry spokesman confirmed he meant foreign minister level. At the United Nations, Macedonia is officially called "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." NATO and the EU also use the acronym FYROM, though the United States, Canada, Russia, China, and several EU states use the name "Macedonia". The Serbian province of Kosovo, with an ethnic Albanian majority, is expected to unilaterally announce independence on Dec. 10. The move could unsettle the wider region, including Macedonia which has a large ethnic Albanian minori
