The survey drew responses from some 1,800 nursing home employees around the country, the Yomiuri said, adding this suggested that many more abuse cases were probably going unreported. A government report in September recorded 53 cases of abuse against elderly people in nursing homes in the year to March -- around one-tenth of the figure that the new survey revealed for part of that period.
