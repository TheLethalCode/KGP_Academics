 KOLKATA, India, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wasim Jaffer struck a half-century to help India stay in control of the second test after Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq had frustrated the hosts with a career-defining 161 not out on Monday. In-form opener Jaffer, who scored a double hundred in the first innings, hit 56 off 75 balls as India reached the close on 141-2 in their second innings on the fourth day, extending their overall lead to 301. Saurav Ganguly and Mahendra Dhoni were unbeaten on 24 and 28 respectively. Pakistan were bowled out for 456 in their first innings in reply to India's 616-5 declared. Misbah, who completed his maiden test century on Sunday, batted for just over nine hours to steer the visitors past the follow-on mark with a defiant 91-run stand with Mohammad Sami (38). "The morning session was crucial because anything could have happened if they had got the follow-on," Misbah told reporters. "We could have batted again, so those two-three hours that we batted was crucial." Pakistan's overnight seventh-wicket pair of Misbah and Sami resumed with the score on 358-6 and batted with control on a deteriorating pitch for over three hours before part-time spinner Vangipurappu Laxman broke the stand in his only over. Sami gave Laxman the charge to be caught at mid-off, triggering a collapse as the last three wickets fell for the addition of just eight runs. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh cleaned up the tail to return his 20th five-wicket haul while skipper Anil Kumble took three. CAUTIOUS APPROACH A fluent Misbah and a gusty Sami saw off the first hour with a cautious approach before getting on top of the attack. They combined to add 60 runs in the morning session after beginning the day needing 59 to avoid the follow-on. The pair also put on 87 in a ninth-wicket stand in the first test. Misbah, 33, was rock solid in approach, striking 13 fours and a six in his 351-ball stay, while Sami was let off early when Rahul Dravid at slip failed to pouch the offering when the batsman drove wildly at leg spinner Kumble. The last three men were all dismissed without troubling the scorers, Kumble had Sohail Tanvir caught by Dravid at slip while Harbhajan removed Shoaib Akhtar and Danish Kaneria. Jaffer put on 75 for the first wicket with Dinesh Karthik (28) before leg-spinner Kaneria dismissed them in succession. But Dhoni, promoted to look for quick runs, and Ganguly took control of the situation sharing a 46-run stand for the undefeated third wicket before poor light cut short play. "We'll bat a bit more tomorrow," Dhoni told reporters. "Can't say exactly how many runs we need. It's not just a matter of runs. It depends on time as well. "The wicket is responding a bit to spin. On the fourth and fifth days the game changes very quickly in India," he said of his team's chances of victory. The hosts lead the three-match series 1-0 after winning the opening test by six wickets in New Delhi
