 NEW YORK, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks gained sharply on Wednesday, with three major indexes topping 1 percent, after economic reports reassured investors that the economy is sound with inflation coming under control. Industrial stocks such as United Technologies and Honeywell rose on signs of economic growth. Big financial stocks such as Citigroup and Bank of America, which would benefit from a Federal Reserve rate cut, also advanced. "Unit labor costs were a little bit lower than expected in the productivity report. (The market) seems to have liked that," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. "Anything at this point that's anti-inflationary it will grasp onto." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 104.21 points, or 0.79 percent, at 13,352.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 12.78 points, or 0.87 percent, at 1,475.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 28.07 points, or 1.07 percent, at 2,647.90. American International Group gave a big boost to the Dow after the chief executive of the blue-chip insurer said on Wednesday that business exposure levels throughout its businesses, including consumer finance and mortgage insurance, were "manageable."

Bank of America stock was up 1 percent to $44.53 and Citigroup added 1 percent to $32.87. The ADP National Employment Report showed the private sector jobs added more than three times the number of jobs economists had forecast. The report is seen as a harbinger of the government's November payrolls data due on Friday. The Labor Department said revised third-quarter non-farm output rose at its fastest pace in four years, while unit labor costs, a measure of inflation, showed the largest decline in four years. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index, which measures activity among services companies, showed expansion in the sprawling sector. The Federal Reserve is likely to consider the latest economic reports when it meets next Tuesday to act on interest rates. The market expects the Fed to cut short-term rates by at least a quarter-percentage point. What size of a cut may be a difficult decision for the US central bankers, according to Greg Ip, the the Wall Street Journal's Fed watcher, on Wednesday. Among decliners, Comcast shares fell 8.8 percent to $18.90 after the largest US cable television operator lowered its forecast for 2007 cable revenue grow
