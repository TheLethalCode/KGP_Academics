 Kabul, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber rammed a car into a convoy of NATO forces close to the airport in the Afghan capital on Tuesday, wounding several Afghan civilians. There was no immediate word on whether NATO troops suffered casualties in the attack which happened during the morning rush hour on a road just outside Kabul's international airport, a senior city police official said. A spokesman for NATO, which runs a force separate to the U.S. military in Afghanistan, confirmed that the target was an alliance convoy, but gave no more details. Foreign and Afghan troops sealed off the site of the blast and smoke could be seen rising from the area. A spokesman for the Taliban said the militant Islamic group carried out the attack to "welcome" US Defense Secretary Robert Gates who arrived in Kabul on Monday evening. Tuesday's attack reflected a rising level of violence in the past two years in Afghanistan, the bloodiest period since Taliban's removal from power in 2001. Gates is to gauge the needs of military commanders as they face a resurgent Taliban and signs that al Qaeda is regrouping in the country. More than six years after a US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power, Gates said on Monday he was concerned about the increasing violence but he did not think Afghanistan was moving backwards. "I'm not worried about a back slide as much as I am how we continue the momentum going forward," the Pentagon chief told reporters. "I think that one of the clear concerns that we all have is that (in) the last two or three years there has been a continuing increase in the overall level of violence." The Pentagon also is worried about signs that al Qaeda is resurfacing in Afghanistan after defeats in parts of Iraq. "We're seeing real early indicators that there may be some stepped-up activity by al Qaeda," said a senior U.S. defense official traveling with Gates. "Certainly that's something that we're concerned with." American military officers in Iraq have speculated that al Qaeda would try to return to Afghanistan after losing ground in Iraq, where violence has declined following a security crackdown that added thousands of US troops to the streets. But the senior official's comments marked the first time the Pentagon has acknowledged seeing evidence that al Qaeda fighters were moving back into Afghanistan. The official stressed, however, that the evidence was still not conclusive. "The tell-tale signs would be stepped up activities by foreign fighters, finding foreign fighters inside Afghanistan as a result of battle casualties and things like that. We're not seeing enough yet to draw conclusions," said the US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. bd
