 Dhaka, Dec 03 (bdnews24.com)--The Securities and Exchange Commission Monday withdrew its earlier directive that stopped brokerage houses from providing margin loans and credit facilities for clients. In a press briefing, Farhad Ahmed, executive director of the SEC, said the decision came after a meeting between top officials of the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the SEC. "The decision was taken following suggestions from the DSE officials at the meeting. The SEC found the suggestion justified and executed it," he said. The SEC in a Nov 19 directive asked brokerage houses to stop credit facilities to their clients. DSE vice president Ahmed Rashid Lali told bdnews24.com that he hoped the move would normalise the recent unusual behaviour of the market. Meanwhile, investors Monday staged a one-hour demonstration in the financial district of Motijheel, protesting an earlier SEC move to stop brokerage houses disbursing loans. Investors clashed with the police. But no arrest was made, said Asaduzzaman, assistant sub-inspector of Motijheel Police Station. Trading at the DSE was halted for an hour. However, the DSE said the suspension was for technical reasons. bdn
