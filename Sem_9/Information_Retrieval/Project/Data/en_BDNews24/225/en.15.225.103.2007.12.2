 BAGHDAD, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kurdish officials insisted on Sunday that there had been no Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq, describing as baseless Ankara's claims that significant losses had been inflicted on Kurdish rebels. The Turkish military said on Saturday it had launched an "intensive intervention" to hit the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Iraq's mountainous north.

Analysts say a major incursion does not appear imminent, arguing that many Kurdish rebels have moved into Iran and that weather conditions in northern Iraq are rapidly worsening, making a large-scale military strike difficult. Washington fears such an attack would create chaos in Iraq's most stable region and possibly further afield. About 3,000 PKK rebels, seeking a separate Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, operate in northern Iraq. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began its armed struggle in 19
