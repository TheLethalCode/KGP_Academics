 LONDON, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares were up by midday on Wednesday as banks bounced and commodities rose on continued consolidation talk and rising oil prices, lifting the market out of a two-session dip. At 1144 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,511.04 points, following a 1.7 percent drop over the first two days of the week. Oil and gas producers were bolstered after OPEC decided not to increase the supply of crude oil. Total, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BG were among the top weighted gainers, up between 1 percent and 2 percent, as oil futures were pushed up more than a dollar a barrel by the OPEC decision. Shares in Xstrata were up 2.1 percent after the company bid $842 million for Australia's Resource Pacific and said it aimed to double production at a Canadian nickel mine by 2013. The company also said BHP Billiton's bid for Rio Tinto had "created a new dynamic for consolidation in the mining sector". On Tuesday the chief executive of China's top steelmaker Baosteel was quoted by a Chinese newspaper as saying the company may bid at least $200 billion for Rio Tinto. Rio was up 1.7 percent, BHP rose 1.8 percent and Anglo American gained 2.3 percent. Antofagasta ANTO.L regained ground to be up 2.9 percent. "It's quite a strong rally, led by the usual cyclical stories, and financials have recovered a lot. You're going to see a lot of this towards the end of the year," said Robert Quinn, European strategist at Standard & Poor's equity research arm. But he added that he did not expect the rally to persist. "The next two quarters are going to be very choppy for the market and it could be down by the summer," he said. Banks were broadly positive with HSBC advancing 2.1 percent, RBS gaining 1.8 percent and HBOS 1.2 percent. TELECOMS SWITCH Vodafone was the top weighted gainer as investors switched to the British group and out of France Telecom after the top French carrier disappointed markets with targets that were broadly in line with current forecasts. France Telecom fell 2.5 percent. Shares in Northern Rock retreated 2.7 percent after the Daily Telegraph reported the British government had taken measures to nationalise the stricken bank if no private buyer emerges. Investor focus is likely to shift towards central bank action as the day wears on, with two key rate decisions expected on Thursday. The European Central Bank is expected to keep rates constant, but the Bank of England's decision is seen as a much closer call. A Reuters poll forecast a median 35 percent chance of a 25-basis point cut, and the proportion of economists forecasting a cut has risen in the past few weeks. Cuts in US interest rates have contributed to a recovery in European shares after a credit crisis sent them to the year's low in August. The FTSEurofirst 300 has risen 2 percent so far this year, underperforming the US S&P 500 index, which has put on 3.1 perce
