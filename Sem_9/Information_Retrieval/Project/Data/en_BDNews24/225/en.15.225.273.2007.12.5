<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Georgian court lifted a ban on opposition television station Imedi on Wednesday, following a request from the government, Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said. "The court has now lifted its injunction and the communications commission has reinstated the broadcasting license of TV (station) Imedi," Gurgenidze said. "The channel will be back on air in the next few days -- certainly by the weekend." Western allies have said a Jan. 5 presidential election could not be considered fair if Imedi, the largest opposition broadcaster, was banned.
