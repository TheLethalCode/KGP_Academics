 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government considers enshrining citizens' right to information in law as a national priority, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Wednesday. "Free flow of information acts as a driving force in democracy and good governance," Fakhruddin said at a conference on 'Right to information in Bangladesh's journey towards establishing a corruption-free democracy'. "The theme of right to information has been touched in Article 39 of our Constitution. But the need for a specific law has been felt for a long time," said the chief adviser. "A right to information law has already been made effective in our neighbouring India. recently, Nepal has also passed a law on right to information." "Bangladesh is also in need of such a law," Fakhruddin said. A draft right to information law has been prepared on the basis of a working paper by the Law Commission. Opinion gathered from civil society bodies has been incorporated into the draft law, which has been sent to the law and information ministries, Fakhruddin said. "I am optimistic that we shall be able to present a right to information law to the nation in the near future." "The present caretaker government is working relentlessly to establish good governance in the country," the interim government head said in his address to the conference organised by the Manusher Jonnyo Foundation at Hotel Sheraton. The right to information is a necessary precondition to be fulfilled in the process of building a corruption-free and democratic society, said Fakhruddin. Among those present at the conference were law and information adviser Mainul Hosein, former adviser to the caretaker government Sultana Kamal and Manusher Jonnyo Foundation executive director Shaheen Anam. bdnews24.com/
