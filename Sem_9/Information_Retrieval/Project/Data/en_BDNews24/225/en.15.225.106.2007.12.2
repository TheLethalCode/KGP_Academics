 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka are back in the match against England after Muttiah Muralitharan reduced the touring side to 186 for six at stumps on the second day of the first test on Sunday, coach Trevor Bayliss said. "We obviously didn't have a great day yesterday, but I thought we fought hard and got ourselves back into the game today," Bayliss told reporters after rain washed out the final session. "On his (Muralitharan's) home pitch, a pitch that suits spin bowling, we knew we could keep England down to a reasonable total even if they passed us," he added. England bowled Sri Lanka out for 188 on Saturday. "Hopefully we can match them in our second innings as chasing 180 to 200 in the final innings will be tough. "The game is very much 50-50 now with two days gone." Ian Bell, who top scored for England with 83, admitted that Muralitharan, who with a tally of four for 30 equalled Shane Warne's world record of 708 test wickets, was proving a major handful on a spin-friendly surface. "Every time you play Murali in Sri Lanka it's going to be a big challenge -- he's proven that he is a great bowler here and he always takes wickets," Bell told reporters. "He is the best bowler in the world because he makes things happen," he added. "The important thing is that when you do get in you cash in, which makes it disappointing that I did not go on." "We've just got to make sure he spends a lot of time bowling a lot of overs getting those wickets.
