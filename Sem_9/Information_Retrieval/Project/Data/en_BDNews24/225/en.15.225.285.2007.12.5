The clashes, in the northwestern district of Mannar, northern district of Vavuniya and northern Jaffna peninsula, were the latest engagements in a renewed civil war that has seen near daily air raids, bombings and land and sea battles in recent months. "Two confrontations in Mannar killed 13 terrorists and another two different attacks in Vavuniya and Jaffna killed 16 more terrorists," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security. The military said a Tamil Tiger rebel attack on a military patrol killed three soldiers, while a mine explosion killed four service personnel and wounded two in Vavuniya. The separatist Tigers, who are seeking to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment on the fighting. There were no independent accounts of how many people were killed or what had happened. Analysts say both sides tend to overstate enemy losses and play down their own. The military has vowed to wipe out the Tigers militarily, and is seeking to drive the rebels out of Mannar after evicting them from vast swathes of jungle terrain they controlled in the east earlier this year. More than 5,000 people have been killed in fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighters since early 2006 alone, taking the death toll since the war erupted in 1983 to around 70,000.
