 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)The housing and public works ministry has cancelled the allocation of 108 NAM apartments occupied by former lawmakers, the ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Housing and public works adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein, approved the cancellation Tuesday, which was followed by a ministry circular issued in the evening for necessary action by the parliament secretariat. The circular says, outside the 108 cancelled allocations, former MP-occupants of the remaining NAM apartments wishing to stay in those accommodations must pay Tk 20,000 to 25,000 per month per apartment. All former lawmakers occupying the flats to date will have to pay monthly rent at the above rates, backdated with effect from March 2007, which includes those whose allotments have been just cancelled. The new rent has been fixed at Tk 25,000 for an 1,800 sq ft apartment and Tk 20,000 for 1,260 sq ft. Anyone failing to pay this rent as mentioned will be sued by the concerned ministry, the circular said. The ministry has announced that government officers will also be entitled to occupy the apartments paying the new monthly rent. In total, 324 MPs of the Eighth Parliament received allotments to reside in the 13 multistoried NAM apartment blocks, fully furnished and equipped with air-conditioners, and TVs supplied by the government. The cancellation include the allocations of 20 currently convicted lawmakers, 48 accused who are on trial, and 40 ex-MPs who are either on the run or have failed to provide information as they were required. bdnews24.com/m
