 BRUSSELS, Dec 5 (vdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union executive urged EU countries on Wednesday to work harder at opening markets to neighbours outside the bloc and making it easier for citizens of those countries to obtain visas. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner also called for greater efforts to help neighbours tackle conflicts lingering from the Cold War and more support for reforms in sectors from energy to social policy. "The EU needs to show increased political commitment to foster economic integration and improve market access," she said in outlining her European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) for 2008. Ferrero-Waldner said opportunities for the EU's 27 states to strike bilateral deals making it easier for citizens of neighbouring countries to visit were not being fully exploited. She said the Commission was moving towards pilot "mobility partnership agreements" that would offer citizens of states like Moldova and Morocco improved opportunities for legal migration to EU countries while also targeting illegal migration. "In the future, the EU will need an increasing number of migrant workers to fill the gaps in the labour market," Ferrero-Waldner said. The European Union and its neighbours held their first high-level meeting in September and called for closer ties, but EU countries differed on how to advance a relationship key to energy, trade and security cooperation. Some wanted to stress ties with eastern neighbours from the former Soviet bloc and others those of the Middle East and North Africa. They also differed on whether closer cooperation should be seen as a route to possible membership of the EU. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who opposes Turkey's EU bid by arguing it is not geographically in Europe, has proposed a "Mediterranean Union" that would focus on curbing illegal migration and terrorism and promoting economic development. Such talk has heightened complaints from EU newcomers in Central Europe and their neighbours who see the EU as too focused on the Mediterranean at their expense.
