<TITLE> Election success won't solve Putin's biggest headache </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vladimir Putin's resounding endorsement in a parliamentary election will do little to solve his biggest headache - how to manage a difficult handover of power in the Kremlin without triggering open clan warfare. Official results gave Putin's United Russia party 64 percent of the vote and more than enough seats in parliament to change the constitution. But until Putin resolves the succession issue, government jubilation at the victory -- one official joked that "this was the result we were promised last Friday" -- is likely to be short-lived. Competing power groups in the Kremlin, some made up of security service officials, others of a more pro-market bent, are already jockeying for position in the post-Putin era. Using their control over Russia's huge state-owned corporations, they are eager to claim a share of the country's vast oil and mineral wealth. Putin now has to attempt an orderly handover of power without disrupting the delicate balance of Kremlin interests. "This result makes it easier for Putin to go for a third term if he wants to do that," one senior Western diplomat said. But Putin, in opinion polls Russia's most popular politician, has repeatedly ruled out standing for another consecutive presidential term, citing a constitutional ban which he has promised on numerous occasions not to overturn. Instead he says he wants to retain influence over the government in some form after leaving the presidency -- a difficult feat to pull off in a country long accustomed to a single powerful master in the Kremlin. "Putin himself doesn't know what to do with his victory and how to use it," independent political commentator Georgy Bovt said. "Some say Putin can head the United Russia faction in the Duma. I don't think so because after the presidency, any post would be too small for him". Investors, already worried about political stability in Russia, are hoping for clarity about the succession in December. Presidential candidates must register by Dec. 23, meaning Putin has to indicate soon whom he will pick as his successor. But even that announcement still won't solve the riddle of how Putin will keep a grip on the levers of power from beyond the Kremlin -- and whether he will be successful. "The strange thing about this result is that it doesn't really change anything," one senior European diplomat said. "Putin already controlled parliament. We already knew voters liked him. But he still has his work cut out to solve the succession issue." HARDLINERS In the absence of clarity about the future, signs of unrest have multiplied among the powerful groups jockeying for position inside the Kremlin. Police arrested Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak, a close ally of powerful Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, on fraud charges last month. Analysts said at the time that the move was an attack by Kremlin hardliners on Kudrin, who is well regarded by Western investors, because he had grown too powerful. Despite Kudrin's repeated public protests, Storchak has not been released. Rumours of a major board reshuffle at state oil giant Rosneft -- chaired by Kremlin hardliner Igor Sechin -- are sweeping Russian markets. Rosneft has declined comment. A turf battle between top law enforcement officials in October prompted Putin himself to scold the head of the anti-drugs service for washing his dirty linen in public. An article appeared last Friday in Kommersant newspaper, quoting a previously unknown fund manager, Oleg Shvartsman, as saying he was conducting corporate raids on private companies to force them into state ownership on behalf of a certain group of top Kremlin officials. There was no official response. Discussion of such topics is normally taboo in Russian media, leading Kremlin-watchers to conclude that the article was placed in the newspaper for a deliberate reason. "It's impossible to know Shvartsman's personal motives, but whatever they are, the appearance of that interview is evidence of the final stages of a very serious power struggle," Christopher Granville, a Russia expert at London policy research firm Trusted Sources, told Reuters. The sparring may continue for some time to come. Chris Weafer, chief analyst at Moscow investment bank Uralsib, said Putin may not outline his own plans "until after the March (presidential) election or even after next summer -- and a big reason for that is because the next role has probably not yet been decided". Other Kremlin-watchers agree. "There is a sense that to a certain extent Putin is making this up as he goes along," one senior diplomat said. "I am not sure he is clear in his own mind how this will en
