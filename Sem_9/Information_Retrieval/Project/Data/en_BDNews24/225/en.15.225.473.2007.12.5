 PARIS, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Eritrean journalist who has been jailed for six years without a single family or lawyer visit has been named "Journalist of the Year 2007" by Reporters without Borders, the media rights watchdog said on Wednesday. Seyoum Tsehaye, 54, was arrested in September 2001, as part of a roundup of reformers, well-known journalists and those who opposed the head of state. RSF said there were concerns about his health, it was not known where he was being held and he had never been visited by a lawyer, charged or appeared in court. "The panel of judges sought to highlight not only the case of this brave journalist held in Eritrea's appalling jails ... but also the catastrophic state of press freedom in this small Horn of Africa country," RSF said in a statement. "At least four journalists have died in prison in Eritrea over the last few years. The blame lies chiefly at the door of Isaias Afewerki, the highly authoritarian and obdurate president of the country since its independence in 1993." Tsehaye began his journalism career in the mountains alongside the separatist guerrillas of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). After independence, he became head of national television and then of the radio, before resigning in protest over the authoritarian direction taken by the president, RSF said, adding Tsehaye chose to work for the privately owned press. The prize in the media category went to the Democratic Voice of Burma TV and radio, which RSF said was one of the most reliable sources of news during the country's crisis this year. The Journalistic Freedom Observatory in Iraq was awarded the prize of Press Freedom Defender for its "vital role in exposing violence and murder against journalists". Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer, who was sentenced to four years in jail for criticising President Hosni Mubarak and the Islamic grip on the country's universities on his blog, won the "cyber dissident category". RSF also awarded a special "China" prize to Hu Jia and Zeng Jinyan, a husband and wife human rights team who are under house arrest but "nevertheless continue to do their best to keep the entire world up to date with damaging effects on the Chinese people of the preparations for the Olympic Games"
