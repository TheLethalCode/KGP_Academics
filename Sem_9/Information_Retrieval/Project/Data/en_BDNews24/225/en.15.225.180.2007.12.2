 SYDNEY, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket Australia (CA) boss James Sutherland has hosed down speculation about a major row with the country's leading players about whether they can take part in next year's Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 tournament. At least 11 of Australia's top players, including captain Ricky Ponting and vice skipper Adam Gilchrist, have signed a memorandum of understanding to play in the lucrative tournament next April and May. The players could earn up to $1 million each for competing in the month-long series, well in excess of their normal annual earnings, but Sutherland is unhappy that the players signed without consulting CA. Sutherland said he had written to the players saying he would not grant them consent to play unless his organisation was involved in the negotiations. He dismissed suggestions, published in an Australian newspaper, that a major split was looming. "There's no issue between Cricket Australia and the players," Sutherland told a news conference in Melbourne on Sunday. "The letter that was published in the paper today is really just a letter of procedural nature just reminding players of responsibilities as this issue continues to develop with opportunities into the Indian Premier League. CA's manager of public affairs, Peter Young, had earlier told reporters that the main issue was that players were obliged to inform CA about their plans because they were their main employers. "I think it is over-egging the pudding a little bit to talk about this being the biggest showdown since World Series Cricket," he said. "It is more an issue of saying it is a bit rude to sign up without talking to your employer. It would be a breach of contract to play without our permission." Gilchrist was quick to dismissed any suggestions of a player revolt, telling Australian Associated Press there was no way the players would play in the series without the consent of CA. "We're not trying to be rebels here. It's a new opportunity for cricketers and it's a very exciting one that I know Cricket Australia are endorsing and encouraging," Gilchrist said. "We're not looking for a moment to bend the rules or our contracts with Cricket Australia. They are our employer, as simple as that. "We'll abide by their rules at all times and we're not trying to bend those rules whatsoever. "If the opportunity comes up to play IPL, which a lot of us have signed a MOU to allow us to do, (we will play) but that will always be secondary to international cricket and playing for our country.
