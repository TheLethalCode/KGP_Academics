The government has received TK 739.11 crore in taxes in fiscal 2007-08, up from Tk 252.11 crore in fiscal 2006-07, according to statistics released by the NBR. The central tax administration launched a drive to boost tax collections from dodgers. In a press briefing, Majid said he was not complacent about the revenue collections, but added more people paid taxes this fiscal year despite twin floods and cyclone that ravaged Bangladesh. Of the 22 lakh tax identification number holder taxpayerseligible to pay income tax by the deadline, only 6.45 lakh paid taxes although the deadline for submitting income tax returns was extended several times to Dec 2. "I am not fully happy with the revenue earnings. An increase in self-assessed income taxpayers is a positive trend though," Majid said. He said the trend of spontaneity among people was increasing. The top taxman said NBR officials started a drive Monday against those who had not paid taxes by the deadline.
