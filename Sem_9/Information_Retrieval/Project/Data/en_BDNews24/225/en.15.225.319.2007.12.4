 KOLKATA, India, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan can push the test world record for wickets to the 1,000-mark, says India skipper Anil Kumble. The 35-year-old Sri Lankan off-spinner took his 709th wicket during the first test against England on Monday to topple retired Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne and regain his position at the top of the list. Warne overtook Muralitharan at the top of the all-time list in 2004 and surged ahead of the Sri Lankan before his retirement in January. "I spoke to him yesterday and told him he'll get to 1,000," India captain Kumble told a news conference on Tuesday. "I'm not sure I can cross 1,000," said Kumble, 37, who is third in the all-time list with 578 wickets from 120 tests. "It's a fantastic effort to get to 710 in the number of matches he has played," Kumble said of Muralitharan's record tally that came in his 116th test compared to Warne, who played in 145 matches. "He's just picked up his 61st five-wicket haul and I told him I thought he'd get to a 100.
