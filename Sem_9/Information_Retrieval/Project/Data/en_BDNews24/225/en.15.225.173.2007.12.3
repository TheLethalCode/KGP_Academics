 LONDON, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors took a breather from last week's intensive market action on Monday with stocks flat to lower and the dollar edging lower, keeping the focus on an expected US rate cut later in the month. Wall Street looked set to open flat. Oil was around $88 a barrel following last week's near $10 slide. Concerns about the credit crisis remained. Some analysts have forecast that Royal Bank of Scotland will announce up to around 2 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) of credit-related losses this week. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is widely seen cutting rates on Dec. 11 by at least 25 basis points from the current 4.5 percent to prop up an economy that has been battered by the subprime crisis, a poor housing sector and tighter credit. A Reuters poll of 17 U.S. primary dealers -- banking firms that trade directly with the Fed -- found all of them are counting on a cut. The European Central Bank and Bank of England, meanwhile, are to decide on rates this Thursday. The ECB is seen leaving rates on hold at 4.0 percent and the BoE at 5.75 percent but with a 35 percent chance of a cut. All this left investors somewhat sidelined on Monday, especially after a week of solid gains on many stock markets as November came to a close. MSCI's main global stock index was flat and its emerging market counterpart slightly lower. "Caution in the market remains high," said Masaki Fukui, senior market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in Japan. European shares were lower, despite deals in the media sector. France's Vivendi will merge its video games unit with Activision Inc while U.S. computer manufacturer Dell Inc is in an advertising deal with Britain's WPP. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.3 percent or 51.70 points to end at 15,628.97. The broader TOPIX index closed flat at 1,532.16. OIL, DOLLAR, BONDS Oil dipped below $88 a barrel after losing as much as $9.47 a barrel last week, although some traders believed the sell-off was overdone. Prices slumped amid growing expectations of an increase in OPEC production, signs of waning health in the U.S. economy and a mild draw in U.S. crude stocks. But the decline did come from a record-high closing price of $98.18 a barrel on Nov. 23. The dollar trimmed gains from last week's rally, slipping from two-week highs against the yen as investors grew cautious due to concerns about the health of financial firms. "Equity markets are flat to lower and there are expectations for weak U.S. data, which is keeping the dollar weak," said Marcus Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "We will see some more negative news in the coming weeks from banks and the economy, especially from the impact from the US housing market." The dollar was down 0.8 percent at 110.28 yen having risen on Friday to 111.23, its highest since mid-November. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4670 ahead of the ECB decision. Euro zone government bond prices rose. The yield on the two-year Schatz, the most sensitive to shifts in interest rate expectations, was down 2 basis points at 3.82 percent and benchmark 10-year yields were down 4 basis points at 4.12 perce
