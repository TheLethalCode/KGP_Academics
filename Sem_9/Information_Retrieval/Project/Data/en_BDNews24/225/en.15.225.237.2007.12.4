<TITLE> Oil firms don't fear Iraq security, await laws: US </TITLE>

 BAGHDAD, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International oil firms are not afraid of insecurity in Iraq and are ready to begin investing once Baghdad enacts key oil laws, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Iraq, Kimmitt said the absence of oil laws was now the main hurdle to a wave of international investment as violence has subsided. "What I hear from the companies talking to me, both U.S. and international oil companies, is that they come in and they want to know what the rules of the road are," he said. "A lot of times people think they are not investing because the security situation is difficult. Well, the security situation is improving, and as the oil companies will tell you, they invest in many places in the world where security is a tough factor. "What they really want to know is: what are the rules of the road? With whom should I be contracting? Is that party a qualified contracting party? If there is a dispute, what is the dispute resolution mechanism?" Iraq's central government has complained that some firms, including U.S. firms, have made oil deals with the autonomous Kurdish region in the north without waiting for a central framework in Baghdad. Kimmitt said Washington was discouraging oil firms from investing until the central laws were passed. The United States regards the laws as vital to spur investment and reduce sectarian tension by ensuring that revenues are shared between provinces that have oil and those regions -- such as mainly Sunni Arab areas -- with little. Draft oil legislation has been stalled in parliament and is part of a package of reconciliation measures that the Shi'ite-led government has failed to enact. SECURITY BETTER Violence in Iraq has fallen in past months. Government figures show 538 Iraqi civilians were killed in November, down from nearly 2,000 a month at the beginning of the year. The United States promised quick improvements in Iraq's economy when it invaded the country in 2003. But four years of sectarian conflict led to surging unemployment and deteriorating infrastructure despite billions spent on reconstruction. Kimmitt said the recent improvement in security offered a chance for Iraq to rebuild. "From a macro-economic standpoint ... we see a strong foundation has been laid by the Iraqi government. We see a strong, stable currency, inflation is dropping significantly. Oil exports are increasing," he said. Iraq's oil exports rose to more than 1.9 million barrels per day from 1.5 million over the past year, largely because of the opening of a new export pipeline in the north. With oil prices high, Iraq is likely to succeed in meeting its state revenue target of $48 billion next year, letting it increase spending on the army and police to improve security. Kimmitt acknowledged corruption was a problem but said Iraq was working on improving its record to ensure state funds for health, education and infrastructure were properly spent. "I think the military success of the surge has created the space that people can begin to focus on executing the budget and assisting their people," he sa
