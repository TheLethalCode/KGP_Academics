 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Wednesday declared the tax-dodging case against former BNP state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku illegal. Deputy tax commissioner Nurul Amin of the National Board of Revenue filed the case with a special judge's court on July 4. The bench of Justice Abdur Rashid and Miftahuddin Chowdhury delivered the verdict after Tuku filed a writ petition challenging the legality of the case procedure. NBR lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan told bdnews24.com that they would challenge the verdict in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. In the case details, the NBR alleged that Tuku had evaded tax on Tk 3.8 crore. Tuku filed the writ appeal on August 26. In the verdict, the court said the decision to press the case against Tuku was taken at a meeting chaired by former NBR chairman Badiur Rahman, which was illegal as Rahman was not a member of the approval committee. "He was not entitled to approving such an issue," the court said. bdnew
