<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam affirmed prevailing sentiments Monday, saying food security is emerging as a big challenge for Bangladesh. He said physical loss of land, rising income, growth in population and drop in food exports by producing countries have created a serious challenge to food security for the country. "We've to consider the issue seriously," Azizul told an international conference on "Development prospects of Bangladesh: Emerging challenges" at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. Bangladesh, which has over 140 million people, is increasingly becoming a food importing country. This year's twin floods and the violent Nov 15 cyclone damaged a total of 1.6 million tonnes of aman , according to government statistics, which has thrown the country into a critical situation. On the other hand, prices of food grains on the international market are also rising fast. "We are facing the challenge now," Azizul told the conference. The adviser identified the other major challenges for Bangladesh as: poor infrastructure, poor governance, lack of consensus, inadequate adaptation and diffusion of technology, insufficient human resource development and the growing impact of climate change. Azizul spoke as chief guest at the concluding session of the two-day conference, organised by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies to mark its golden jubilee celebration. Economist Prof Nurul Islam chaired the conference attended by national and international economists. Speakers said poverty reduction, unemployment, rising inequality, poor infrastructure and governance, land reform and lack of democracy are the major challenges facing Bangladesh. AR Khan, professor (emeritus) at the University of California, asked the government to undertake policies to encourage labour-intensive industries. Infrastructural development is required for overall growth of the economy, he noted. Dhaka University economist and former adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud said governance issues pose great obstacles to Bangladesh in service deliveries, including education and health. Gustav Ranis, professor (emeritus) at Yale University, said inequality is a major challenge. "Too much concentration on Bangladesh's growth rate is further accelerating inequality," he added. Prof Rehman Sobhan stressed further democratisation for balanced development. The finance adviser admitted that poor infrastructure was a critical challenge for Bangladesh's development, adding: "Cooperation between public and private sectors could be developed to improve infrastructure." But, he added, to what extent the government could improve infrastructure constraints remains a big question. Azizul echoed other speakers in saying that governance, both in the public and private sectors, is another big challenge. bdn
