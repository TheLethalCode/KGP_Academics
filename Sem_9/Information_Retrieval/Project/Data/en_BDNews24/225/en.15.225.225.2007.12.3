 Manila, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nearly 3,000 tribespeople have fled their mountain homes in the southern Philippines as the military stepped up an offensive against insurgents of the communist New People's Army (NPA), officials and church leaders said on Monday. Modesto Villasanta, a Roman Catholic priest and leader of a local human rights group, said he feared a humanitarian crisis if military operations continue to displace Manobo tribes from 11 communities in a province on Mindanao island. "We're appealing to the military to stop the offensives and allow these people to return to their homes during Christmas," Villasanta told Reuters in a phone interview. "We're also running out of food and supplies to sustain these people." The military launched the offensive against the communist rebels last month, aiming to capture their largest base on Mindanao island. The 6,000-member NPA, active in 69 of 81 provinces, has been fighting for nearly 40 years to overthrow Manila's democratic government and replace it with a Maoist system. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Villasanta said the Manobo tribesmen started leaving on Nov. 1 from their homes, walking 16-20 km (9-12 mile), to the nearest town centre, after soldiers occupied their communities, using them as a base for launching attacks on rebel positions. Vicente Pimentel, governor of the affected Surigao del Sur province, asked the military to allow safe passage for displaced people, appealing to soldiers to respect the rights of the Manobo tribesmen. "The civilians must not be threatened and their rights must be respected, otherwise, I will be the one to file charges against the military," Pimentel said over a local radio station. Colonel Jose Vizcarra, brigade commander, denied reports of rights abuses by his troops, dismissing them as part of rebel propaganda to stop the offensive against them Vizcarra said soldiers killed 5 NPA rebels in a gun battle on Saturday
