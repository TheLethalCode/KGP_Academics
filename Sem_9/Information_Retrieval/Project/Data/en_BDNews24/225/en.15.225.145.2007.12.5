 BAGHDAD, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq will put most of the mainly Sunni Arab neighbourhood patrols currently employed by US forces on the Shi'ite-led government's payroll by mid-2008, a senior security spokesman said on Wednesday. The announcement means tens of thousands of armed Sunni Arabs, some believed to have fought as insurgents until this year, will soon be working for the government in Baghdad.

Another 10,000 work as unpaid volunteers, while about 17,000 more have signed up to join the programme. Most of the patrol members are drawn from the Sunni Arab community, often in what have been some of the most violent areas of Iraq, where local sheikhs have abandoned the insurgency and agreed to cooperate with US forces against militants.

Sunni Arabs complain they are under-represented in the police and army, and recruiting regular police officers from the patrols could help address that conce
