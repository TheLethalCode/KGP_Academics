 KOLKATA, India, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's century-maker Kamran Akmal was kicking himself for having got out before helping his team avoid the follow-on against India in the second test on Sunday. Wicketkeeper-batsman Akmal struck a plucky 119 and shared in a 207-run, sixth-wicket stand with Misbah-ul-Haq to steer Pakistan to 358 for six on the third day. Pakistan need 59 more to avoid the follow-on with Misbah. whose 108 not out is his first test century, at the crease with only the tail left. "I believe I have got out at the wrong time. I should have carried on," Akmal told a news conference. "(But) whatever God wills." A double century by Wasim Jaffer and hundreds by Saurav Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman helped India post an imposing first-innings total of 616 for five declared. "Today's century came in a difficult situation and under pressure," said the 25-year-old Akram of his fifth test century and fourth against India. After resuming at 50 for one, Pakistan lost four wickets in the morning session, two of them to off-spinner Harbhajan Singh who later dismissed Akmal with an off-break. "Our plan was to take it half an hour at a time," said Akmal of his strategy with Misbah. India won the first test by six wickets and the final game will be played in Bangalore next week
