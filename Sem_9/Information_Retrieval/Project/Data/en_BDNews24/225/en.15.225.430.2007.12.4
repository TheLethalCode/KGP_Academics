<TITLE> Sarkozy visits Algeria to expand trade links </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Algiers, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived in Algeria on Monday to seal more than $7 billion in trade deals and seek to improve an uneasy relationship still overshadowed by controversy over France's former colonial rule. Recent hostile comments from Algerian officials about Sarkozy's refusal to apologise for killings during the 132-year colonial period initially stirred fears the business-focused state visit could be scrapped. But Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika told Sarkozy last week the statements did not express the Algerian position and he remained welcome to visit. The two leaders met for talks at Bouteflika's official residence in Algiers. Later, in a speech to French and Algerian business leaders, Sarkozy sought to clarify France's view of the past. "Yes, the colonial system was deeply unfair, contrary to the the three founding words of our republic: liberty, equality, fraternity," he said, adding there had been crimes and victims on both sides in Algeria's war of independence. The French president said deals worth more than 5 billion euros would be signed with Algeria on Tuesday, including tram lines, railways, dams, petrochemicals, power stations and a civil nuclear energy cooperation accord. The expected agreements include a Total contract for a petrochemical plant and an Alstom deal for a power station. Algeria's often strained political ties with France have little impact on extensive trade links that have made France the biggest investor in Algeria outside the gas and oil sector. France had two-way trade with Algeria of more than $8 billion in 2006. In 2005, Algeria provided 16 percent of France's natural gas supplies and 6 percent of its oil supplies. The colonial past is a sensitive subject for the current Algerian leadership, most of whom took part in the revolutionary struggle against France. France invaded Algeria in 1830 and a century later was host to more than 1 million French settlers. A war begun in 1954 by Algerian fighters cost hundreds of thousands of lives -- Algiers says 1.5 million -- before independence in 1962. Sarkozy has defended his refusal to apologise, saying leaders should focus on the future, but Algerian leaders are adamant that deeper ties with Paris, including a friendship agreement, depend on French efforts to address concerns over the past. The latest spat erupted when an Algerian minister said a relationship of equals was not possible with Sarkozy because he refused to apologise for the past and that the French leader had been elected thanks to a "Jewish lobby" -- an indirect reference to Sarkozy's Jewish mother and a widespread belief in Algeria that he is backed by Jewish groups in France. bd
