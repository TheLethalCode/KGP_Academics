<TITLE> UK troop cut in Iraq could hit whole mission-report </TITLE>

 LONDON, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plans to halve British troop numbers in Iraq next year could jeopardise the entire British presence there, a parliamentary report said on Monday. Britain has around 5,000 troops based in Iraq, all stationed at an airbase outside Basra, where they are involved in training Iraqi security forces and protecting themselves. The government intends to cut the number to 2,500 from spring of next year as more Iraqi soldiers and police are trained to take over responsibility for security. As of the middle of December, when Britain is expected to hand over responsibility for Basra province, all four southern Iraqi provinces that Britain oversaw after the 2003 invasion will be in the hands of Iraqi security forces. The House of Commons Defence Committee said such a reduction threatened to undermine Britain's entire role in the country, leaving too few soldiers to either train the Iraqis properly or protect themselves adequately. "Important questions remain about the sustainability of a force of this size," the bi-partisan committee said in 40-page report based on briefings and interviews with British and American military and diplomatic staff in Iraq. "If there is still a role for UK forces in Iraq, those forces must be capable of doing more than just protecting themselves at Basra Air Station. If the reduction in numbers means they cannot do more than this, the entire UK presence in southeastern Iraq will be open to question." FOCUS ON TRAINING The committee said it was particularly concerned about the ability of British troops to focus on training Iraqi soldiers and police. While the Iraqi army had made solid progress, it said corruption and criminality still riddled the police. "If Iraq is to evolve into a stable, functioning and prosperous country, the Iraqi army and police must be properly equipped and trained," the report said. "Given the scale of the problems that still need to be tackled, there would seem to be a need for an ongoing commitment by the UK to training and mentoring the Iraqi police." The Ministry of Defence announced last week that British police trainers had completed their work and were ready to hand over management of the Basra Police Academy entirely to Iraqi staff, a decision that would appear to stand in conflict with the findings of the parliamentary report. The Ministry of Defence said it would remain committed to training Iraqi forces even if British numbers were reduced. "We have always said that our obligations to the Iraqi nation will not end when all four provinces within our area of operations have been transferred to Iraqi control," Defence Minister Des Browne said in a statement. "British forces are among the best trainers in the world... Our commitment in this role is undiminished. We will continue until the Iraqis themselves are confident they no longer need our assistance."
