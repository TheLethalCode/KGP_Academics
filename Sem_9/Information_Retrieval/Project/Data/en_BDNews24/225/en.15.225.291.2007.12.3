 KOLKATA, India, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Misbah-ul-Haq struck a career-defining 161 not out on the fourth day of the second test on Monday, thwarting India's hopes of forcing a result. Misbah batted for just over nine hours for a memorable maiden test century to steer the visitors to 456 in their first innings, edging past the follow-on mark with a defiant 91-run seventh-wicket stand with Mohammad Sami (38). India were 20 without loss in their second innings at tea after gaining a 160-run first innings lead. A double-century by Wasim Jaffer and hundreds by Saurav Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman helped the hosts put up an imposing first-innings score of 616-5 declared. The overnight seventh-wicket pair resumed with the score on 358-6 and batted with control on a deteriorating pitch for over three hours before part-time spinner Laxman broke the stand in his only over. Sami gave Laxman the charge to be caught at mid-off, triggering a collapse as the last three wickets fell for the addition of just eight runs. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh cleaned up the tail to finish with a five-wicket haul while skipper Anil Kumble took three. Misbah, 108 overnight, led the fightback on Sunday putting on 207 runs for the sixth wicket with Kamran Akmal (119) after the team had lost four wickets in the morning session. A fluent Misbah and a gusty Sami saw off the first hour with a cautious approach before getting on top of the attack. They combined to add 60 runs in the morning session after beginning the day needing 59 to avoid the follow-on. The pair also put on 87 in a ninth-wicket stand in the first test. Misbah, 33, was rock solid in approach, striking 13 fours and a six in his 351-ball stay, while Sami was let off early when Rahul Dravid at slip failed to pouch the offering when the batsman drove wildly at leg spinner Anil Kumble. The last three men were all dismissed without troubling the scorers, Kumble had Sohail Tanvir caught by Dravid at slip while Harbhajan removed Shoaib Akhtar and Danish Kaneria. India won the opening test of the three-man series by six wickets in New Delhi
