 Barguna, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com) Police arrested 12 people demonstrating for relief in the coastal town of Barguna Sunday amid reports that many relief seekers were not getting aid in the battered region. Barguna police station officer-in-charge Mohammad Sohrab Ali said the 12 had been arrested "for defying the state of emergency" that bars all street protests. More than 500 people from Uttar Lakurtola, Sonar Bangla, Amtoli, Chhoto Badarkhali and Baish Stobok villages took to the streets at 9:00 am, carrying a banner demanding relief. The police intercepted the protestors as they tried to march towards the office of the deputy commissioner. At around 11:00 am police took 12 protestors into custody. The other villagers began a sit-down protest on the Khejurtola school premises to protest the arrest and demand the 12 be released. They refused the offer of relief by the local administration, saying they would accept the relief goods only after the detainees were released. They vowed to continue their demonstration until their demands were met. The villagers said the majority of them had received no relief or assistance from local authorities since Tropical Cyclone Sidr struck the impoverished region on Nov 15. A few families among them had received just three to four kilogrammes of rice since then. Earlier on Saturday, police arrested two youths when the villagers demonstrated at Char Koloni and Ukil Potti areas in the district. After days of protests by the villagers, communication adviser MA Matin distributed relief materials Friday at Gouri Chonna union in the district. Meanwhile, Saturday saw the local administration removing Barguna deputy commissioner Mohammad Altaf Hossain for his reported failure in effectively dealing with relief activities. bdnewws24.com/corr
