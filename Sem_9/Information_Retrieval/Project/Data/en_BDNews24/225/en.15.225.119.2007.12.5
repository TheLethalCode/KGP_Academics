 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi, Chittagong and Dhaka were in the commanding seats on the first day of the seventh round four-dayer of National Cricket League Wednesday. Rajshahi scored 39 for one at stumps after bundling Barisal out for a paltry 182 in the first innings, thanks to a five scalps from pacer Alamgir Kabir at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Alamgir ran through the Barisal top order to return with five for 52 and his new ball pair Mohammad Shahazada chipped in with two for 63 after Rajshahi invited Barisal to bat first winning the toss. One-down Imran Ahmed top-scored with 43 followed by Shaheen Hossain on 31 not out and Kamrul Islam on 26. Jahirul Islam and Farhad Hossain will resume the second day Thursday for Rajshahi, who lost the first wicket in the third over with scoreboard on 6. At Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, hosts Chittagong posted 322 for eight at stumps riding on fifties from Gazi Salahuddin (94), Mahbubul Karim (61), and Eshanul Haq (56 not out). The Chittagong batsmen blunted the bowlers of Khulna, whose attack became toothless after Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Syed Rasel and Abdur Razzak joined the national camp. Ziaur Rahman (2/58), Murad Khan (2/75) and Robiul Islam (2/86) shared six wickets. At Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, Sylhet recovered their initial damage to make 223 for seven at stumps after winning the toss against Dhaka. Ejaj Ahmed made stroke-filled 54 featuring five fours and two sixes as Sylhet passed the 200-mark after being reduced to 112 for five. Opener Golam Rahman (43) and Rajin Saleh (36) put on 64 runs for the third wicket to repair the initial damage after Mohammad Sharif removed Imitaz (20) and Ashiqur Rahman (1) to reduce Sylhet to 35 for two.
