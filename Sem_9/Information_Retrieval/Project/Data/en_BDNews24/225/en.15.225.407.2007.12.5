 MOSUL, Iraq, Wed Dec 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Wednesday to urge Iraqi leaders to take advantage of a lull in violence to enact measures aimed at reconciling warring communities. He touched down first in Mosul, north of Baghdad, in a region US commanders consider one of the most violent parts of Iraq after al Qaeda militants relocated to the north and northeast following crackdowns in the capital and the west. Hours before Gates arrived a car bomb near a police station killed a civilian in Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city. Car bombs in Baquba and Kirkuk, two other cities north of Baghdad, killed at least seven others. Gates met with US commanders to discuss security in the area and then left for Baghdad, where he was expected to discuss the long-term status of US forces in Iraq with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other senior Iraqi officials. "Secretary Gates is here to see for himself the considerable progress that has been made since his last visit nearly three months ago," said Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell, traveling with Gates. "He will be visiting with Iraqi leaders including Prime Minister Maliki to get their take on the situation and to see what more they can do to capitalize on the gains that have been made since the surge of US forces in Iraq." President George W Bush sent an extra 30,000 US soldiers to Iraq earlier this year to try to pull the country back from the brink of all-out sectarian civil war and to give Iraq's leaders "breathing space" to reach a political accommodation. With attacks now at their lowest levels in nearly two years, attention has focused on whether the Shia-led government can reconcile with disaffected Sunni Arabs as the United States begins to draw down troops. Maliki's government has made little headway in passing laws aimed at reassuring minority Sunni Arabs they will share in Iraq's oil wealth and political power. A senior US defence official with Gates said the Pentagon chief was concerned that political progress at the national level was lagging behind recent gains at the local level. VOLATILE NORTH As violence has reduced, US commanders have focused on the area north and northeast of Baghdad, where they say al Qaeda militants have relocated since a security crackdown began in February. Militants killed two US soldiers and wounded two others in northern Salahuddin province on Tuesday, the US military said. Colonel Raymond Thomas, an assistant commander of the US division responsible for the north, said it was asking for more troops for Diyala province, of which Baquba is the capital. "We think we can address it with a little more combat power," Thomas he told reporters traveling with Gates. Violence worsened dramatically in Iraq after suspected al Qaeda militants bombed a Shia shrine in Samarra, north of Baghdad, in February 2006. But attacks across Iraq have fallen 55 percent since the "surge" of 30,000 extra US troops became fully deployed in mid-June. US military commanders say they are confident they can maintain gains in security despite the planned withdrawal of more than 20,000 soldiers by July 2008. There are currently around 160,000 American troops in Iraq. Gates will also hold talks on planned negotiations between Washington and Baghdad over the role of US forces after their UN Security Council mandate expir
