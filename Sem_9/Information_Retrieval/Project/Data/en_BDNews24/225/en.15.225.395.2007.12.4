 Baghdad, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Iraqi government has ordered the Interior Ministry to take command of 12,000 neighbourhood guards on patrol in and around Baghdad and to begin paying their wages, a ministry official said on Monday. The order suggests the Shi'ite-led government is becoming more comfortable with an initiative backed by the US military that has put around 60,000 mainly Sunni Arab men on the streets of Iraq to guard their own communities. Iraq's government has been lukewarm about the growth of what the US military calls "concerned local citizens" units, with many Shi'ites fearing they would become unaccountable militias. The programme has been credited with helping reduce violence. "We will distribute special uniforms to them," Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Abdul-Karim Khalaf told Reuters. "These forces will be under the command of police and army forces in the area and they will be deployed depending on the needs of the area. We will pay them a permanent salary." Baghdad security spokesman Brigadier-General Qassim Moussawi put the number at 10,000, and said they would be used by Iraq's security forces once background checks had been carried out. US military spokesman Rear Admiral Gregory Smith said last week that some 60,000 Iraqis had been trained and were manning "concerned local citizens" checkpoints in their own communities. Most of the guards are paid by the US military and only operate in areas controlled by US forces. Smith said the US military would carefully manage the growth of the neighbourhood units, aiming to move many into public works roles. A small number have joined the police. The 60,000 at work are drawn from about 77,000 who have registered with the US military for the security initiative. The predominantly Sunni Arab units emerged from a model which developed in the western Anbar province last year and has since spread to Baghdad and beyond. Sunni Arab sheikhs in Anbar, tired of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda's indiscriminate killing, began forming young men into tribal police to patrol their own neighbourhoods. US commanders backed the "Awakening" movement as they tried to bring down violence which threatened to tip Iraq into sectarian civil war, training and paying the local police units. Some neighbourhood patrol members once belonged to Sunni Arab insurgent groups but US commanders say all are screened through extensive security databases and those who have attacked US or Iraqi forces or committed crimes are weeded out. bd
