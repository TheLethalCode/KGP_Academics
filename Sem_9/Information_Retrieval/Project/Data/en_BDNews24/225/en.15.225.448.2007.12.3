 LONDON, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading shares edged up on Monday after oils boosted but banks weighed with investors looking ahead to interest rate verdicts from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) later this week. At 0837 GMT the FTSE 100 was 20.1 points, or 0.3 percent higher at 6,452.6. Most investors expect at least two UK interest rate cuts over the coming year, but many economists think both the BoE and ECB will hold fire for at least one more month. "There is a remote chance of a (UK) cut (but) I venture to suggest the BoE will hold its counsel until next month," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners.

Among sectors, BP was up 1.4 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target to 730p from 670p, while BG Group added 1.2 percent after the same bank raised its price target to 1,300p from 1,175p.

Royal Bank of Scotland shed 0.2 percent as traders anticipated subprime-related write-down news ahead of its pre-close final trading update on Thursday.

"It is eagerly awaited on the basis of two things: the amount of sub-prime related (losses and) the confidence levels moving forward." "The worry is that there may be hidden effects of subprime within ABN AMRO's balance sheet. What we want is clarity. Will we get it - I have my doubts."
