 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) - The government has taken up a three-phase rehabilitation plan for those affected by Cyclone Sidr and has already begun work on the first and the second phases, the Chief Adviser's Office said Wednesday. The CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com: "Rehabilitation work has started in the affected areas. The immediate and mid-term work is being undertaken. Plans are being prepared for long-term rehabilitation." The immediate or short-term rehabilitation work began the day after Sidr struck, Munaim said, adding that the chief adviser has sought financial assistance from development partners for the mid-term phase of rehabilitation. Tropical Cyclone Sidr hit the southern districts on the night of Nov 15. The government provided Sidr survivors with food, warm clothes and other essentials, the press secretary said. "Short-term relief and rehabilitation is ongoing," he added. Under the mid-term rehabilitation programme, the government and NGOs are working hand in hand to provide farm assistance, rebuild damaged homes, repair sanitation systems and sink new tube wells for safe drinking water. The government has allotted a separate Tk 130 crore fund for house-rebuilding. The government planned to provide financial grants for the people in the worst-affected areas. Microcredit agencies, especially Grameen Bank, ASA, and PKSF, are also offering new loans for setting up shallow tube wells, restoring sanitation systems and rebuilding damaged houses. In the long-term rehabilitation phase, the press secretary said, stronger embankments will be constructed, along with more cyclone shelters on high land. bdnews24.com/a
