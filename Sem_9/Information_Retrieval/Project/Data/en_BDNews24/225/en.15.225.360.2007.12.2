 Yekaterinburg, Russia, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russians voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election widely viewed as a referendum on President Vladimir Putin and overshadowed by opposition accusations that pro-Kremlin forces enjoy unfair advantage. Pollsters say Putin's United Russia party will win an overwhelming victory and secure more than 60 percent of seats. More than 100 million Russians are eligible to vote in the election, which is being held sub-zero winter temperatures. "I voted for Putin," 68-year-old pensioner Valentin Nenashev said after casting the first ballot at polling station No. 130 in Vladivostok, Russia's gateway to the Pacific and a naval base. "I voted for a better life, for stability." Putin, 55, is by far Russia's most popular politician after presiding over eight years of an economic boom. He aims to retain influence after stepping down as president in early 2008 and says a strong mandate from voters will give him that right. The first of about 96,000 polling stations across the sprawling nation opened in the northeastern province of Chukotka facing Alaska. Nine hours later, at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT), the first voters began turning out in the capital Moscow. In the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals, election organisers created a holiday atmosphere redolent of Soviet-era polls and sought to maximise turnout by relaxing a requirement that voters have a registered address. "For the first time tramps are going to vote here," said a cashier at the city centre bus station as announcements over the tannoy urged travellers to cast their ballots. Increasingly marginalised opposition parties have said numerous election rule changes, heavily skewed media coverage, repeated instances of government pressure on voters and Putin's own campaigning have made the contest unfair. COMMUNISTS Publication of opinion polls is banned in the days before the vote but pollsters say the Communists are the only party other than United Russia assured of exceeding the 7 percent threshold to qualify for seats in the new Duma. Putin has said the elections will be completely democratic. He has attacked foreigners for "poking their snotty noses" into Russia's internal affairs and accused opposition politicians of being stooges for Western powers. The West's main election watchdog, the ODIHR, will not be monitoring the vote. It pulled out after a row with Moscow over delays in issuing visas. Only about 300 foreign observers, roughly half of them from former Soviet republics, have been accredited for the election. The Kremlin says checks by foreign monitors are unnecessary because Russia has high standards of democracy. The predictable result of Sunday's vote and a dull campaign lacking debate on key issues have generated apathy among voters. This has sparked an official push to get the turnout up to at least the 56 percent figure in the last Duma election in 2003. Last-minute efforts to boost participation were being made across the country, with mobile phone companies sending text messages to subscribers telling them to vote and some state companies ordering staff to cast ballots between work on Sunday. The small liberal party Yabloko made a complaint to the Central Electoral Commission that a television broadcast by Putin on Thursday telling Russians to vote for United Russia had broken election rules. Commission chairman Vladimir Churov has said Putin has a right to campaign publicly for his party because he is a registered candidate. The right-wing SPS party said riot police had attempted to break into its offices in the southern city of Krasnodar. Police declined to comment
