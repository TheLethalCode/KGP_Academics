 BETHLEHEM, West Bank, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed a Palestinian policeman in the West Bank on Wednesday, witnesses said, a rare incident given Israel's bid to bolster Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's security forces. Witnesses said that undercover Israeli commandos drove to the main administrative compound in Bethlehem in a civilian car and shot a 37-year-old Palestinian National Security Forces member dead. Another policeman was wounded. General Ahmed al-Hadar, chief of security forces in the town, said the slain policeman had not been armed. The Israeli army said troops on a mission to arrest Palestinian militants in Bethlehem came under fire and shot back. "Our unit hit the shooters, and only later did it become clear that they were Palestinian policemen," an army spokesman said. He declined to give further details on the incident but said Israel's top brass had ordered an investigation. Israel Radio reported that the Palestinian policemen had tried to pull the commandos' car over at a checkpoint, and fired in the air when it failed to stop. Fighting between Israeli troops and Abbas's security forces has been rare since the Palestinian president broke with Hamas Islamists over their seizure of the Gaza Strip in June. Palestinian police have begun cracking down on militant groups in some areas of the West Bank in a security drive that Israel and Western mediators demand as a peacemaking condition. Though Israeli troops and settlers quit Gaza in 2005 after 38 years of occupation, they remain in much of the West Bank, where Abbas's administration has limited sway. Palestinians seek statehood in both territories. Al-Hadar said he met with an Israeli general responsible for West Bank military operations earlier this week and received assurances that Israel would suspend its missions in Bethlehem. Israel Radio quoted Palestinian officials as saying they were not informed of the undercover commandos' operation in Bethlehem on Wednesday. After the shooting, regular Israeli troops entered Bethlehem to conduct house-to-house searches. Witnesses said hundreds of local youths threw rocks at the soldiers, who fired to disperse the crowd. There was no immediate word of casualties.
