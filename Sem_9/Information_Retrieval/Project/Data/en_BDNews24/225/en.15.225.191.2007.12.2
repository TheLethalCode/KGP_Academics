 Dhaka, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com)Demanding more relief supplies in cyclone-ravaged areas, Awami League leaders have said that the release of Sheikh Hasina would create "national unity" in relief and rehabilitation efforts. Party representatives at a press conference Sunday also spoke of the activities of the ten relief teams, formed by the party's central leaders, after their return from the southern districts. "Dependence on the government or the state hampers the public initiative." acting AL president Zillur Rahman said at the AL president's office in Dhanmondi. "It is easy to tackle any national calamity if national unity and adequate work force are ensured." "If Hasina were among the people at this time of disaster, it would create a national unity that would greatly expedite relief and rehabilitation efforts," Zillur said. The party leaders put forward an 18-point recommendation including food, warm clothing, housing and cash for relief. AL presidium member and chairman of the relief committee Abdur Razzak said the party had collected Tk 50 lakh for relief distribution from AL leaders and activists. "We have already disbursed Tk 30 lakh and given out relief goods. In the next phase we will distribute the rest of the money." Asked whether the emergency was creating any problem in distribution of relief, Razzak said: "The emergency did not hamper our relief operations. But we could operate a more coordinated work if the emergency was lifted." Tofail Ahmed, another policy-making wing member, said: "The lack of fertiliser is acute. If the proper initiative is not taken another crisis will take place." "The local leaders and workers are helping with their best efforts," he added. bdnews2
