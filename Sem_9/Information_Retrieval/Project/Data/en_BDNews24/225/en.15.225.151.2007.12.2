<TITLE> New French centrist party rises from UDF's ashes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French centrists on Sunday buried the UDF party that had been their home for almost 30 years, founding a new party christened the "MoDem" with a long-term mission to change the face of French politics. Francois Bayrou, who came third in May's presidential election, was elected unopposed to lead the Democratic Movement. He told 6,000 members in Paris that the sharp attacks on the infant party showed that rivals were worried. "I don't doubt for one second that this movement will succeed," said Bayrou, a former Latin teacher and education minister. "The conditions are met, if we are up to it, for millions of French to join the fight we are leading." Bayrou used his enhanced stature after getting 18 percent of the vote in the presidential election to create a new party for June parliamentary elections at the cost of a bitter split with a host of other centrist allies. Bayrou and supporters won only three seats in parliament while his former allies who rallied to the ruling conservatives of new President Nicolas Sarkozy took around 20 seats. The founding of MoDem marked the demise of the Union For French Democracy just shy of its 30th birthday. Created in 1978, the UDF was to serve as a vehicle for the then centre-right President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and strengthen his hand against the dominant Gaullist party loyal to the memory of postwar leader Charles de Gaulle. The UDF provided a rallying point for centrists, Christian democrats and economic liberals uncomfortable with the Gaullists and the Socialists. And some mourned its passing. "'Bayrou killed me', the UDF could say after its death certificate was signed this weekend," Andre Santini, a former UDF minister who split with Bayrou during the presidential elections, wrote in the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper. He said the party had been sacrificed on the altar of Bayrou's ambitions to run for president in 2012. Bayrou used his address, broadcast live on television, to repeat attacks on Sarkozy's close ties with media barons. His comments appeared to be a reference to the purchase of the Les Echos business daily by Bernard Arnault, owner of luxury group LVMH, who is a close friend of Sarkozy. Staff at the paper opposed the move. During the elections, Bayrou accused Sarkozy of putting pressure on broadcasters to scrap a TV debate between himself and Socialist challenger Segolene Royal, a charge the Sarkozy team said was slander.
