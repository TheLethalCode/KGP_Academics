<TEXT>
 DONETSK, Ukraine, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oscar Cardozo scored twice for Benfica who claimed a place in the UEFA Cup after a 2-1 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in their final Champions League Group D tie on Tuesday. Shakhtar had entertained hopes of still qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time but needed a victory, coupled with a Celtic defeat at already-qualified Milan to go through. Paraguay striker Cardozo pounced on a poor backpass to smash in the first after six minutes and powerfully headed in a second midway through the first half. Shakhtar got a lifeline when David Luiz conceded a penalty on 30 minutes for a push on Cristiano Lucarelli and the Italian striker drilled a low spot-kick past keeper Quim. Benfica finish third in the group on seven points and drop into the UEFA Cup as one of the eight third-placed Champions League teams. Shakhtar finish bottom with six points while Celtic, who lost 1-0 at Milan in their final game, join the Italians in the last 16. Shakhtar, who almost made an early breakthrough when Fernandinho's curling shot was superbly saved by Quim, gifted the Portuguese an early goal with a defensive blunder. Mariusz Lewanowski's backpass to his keeper Andriy Pyatov fell woefully short and Cardozo anticipated well to smash the ball home. Cardozo produced another powerful finish to double Benfica's lead midway through the opening half. The Lisbon side, who had withstood a period of Shakhtar pressure, broke out smartly down the left flank. Maxi Pereira swung over a cross into the middle and Cardozo rose between two defenders and headed into the roof of the net. Lucarelli's penalty eight minutes later gave Shakhtar hope and the home side pressed relentlessly forward in search of an equaliser. Jadson's strike was blocked by Quim before the break and fellow Brazilian Ilsinho blasted over from a good position before the Ukrainians ran out of steam
