 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan took his world record 709th test wicket in helping the home side dismiss England for 281 on the third day of the first test on Monday. England resumed on 186 for six, trailing Sri Lanka's first innings total by two runs, but repelled Muralitharan and the host's bowlers during the first hour as Paul Collingwood (45) and Ryan Sidebottom (31) added 57 runs for the seventh wicket. The partnership ensured that the tourists were able to take a precious 93-run lead into the second innings as England's tail added to the total while Muralitharan chased his 709th test wicket. Sri Lanka's openers faced a tricky two overs before reaching lunch on 2-0. Tied with Australia's Shane Warne overnight, Muralitharan was forced to wait until his second spell of the morning before moving off the 708-wicket mark, bowling Collingwood with a delivery from around the wicket that nipped straight on. The landmark was greeted with loud firecrackers all around Asgiriya International Stadium and wild celebrations from a full house that included hundreds of children from his old school, his family and closest friends. The 35-year-old added to his tally in the next over with the wicket of Matthew Hoggard (15), who was brilliantly stumped down the leg-side by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene. Chaminda Vaas finished off the innings when he trapped James Anderson lbw for nine. Earlier, Lasith Malinga broke the dangerous seventh-wicket stand when Sidebottom edged a low catch to Jayawardene behind the stumps. Muralitharan finished with figures of 6-55
