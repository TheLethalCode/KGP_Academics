 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard has suffered a recurrence of a back problem and is a fitness concern for the second test against Sri Lanka starting in Colombo on Sunday. Hoggard, who took four wickets for 29 runs during Sri Lanka's first innings of the current test in Kandy, was unable to bowl on Tuesday. "It's a facet joint that's stiff and it's an injury he's had before," coach Peter Moores told the media. "It's got progressively worse as the game went on.

"How this sets him up for the following test match we don't know yet, but it's something we'll have to monitor carefully.

Moores said Pietersen would bat on the final day with the aid of painkillers
