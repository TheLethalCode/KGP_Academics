 Dhaka, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com) - Visiting Danish minister for development cooperation Ulla Tornaes said the government should lift the state of emergency to restore democracy to Bangladesh. She urged the government to hold fair elections in line with the election roadmap although the country witnessed a devastating cyclone. "The state of emergency should be lifted. We also respect the critical political situation prevailing in Bangladesh," Tornaes said in a press briefing at the Royal Danish Embassy Wednesday. In response to a question, Tornaes said: "We urged the government to hold a free and fair election as per the polls roadmap. I hope the cyclone Sidr will have no impact on the electoral process and Bangladesh will come back to democracy." The minister also assured that the Danish assistance for the rehabilitation of the Sidr affected people and adaptation for climate change would continue. Denmark pledged $4 million: $1 million for emergency relief operations, $2 million for long-term reconstruction and $1 million for climate change adaptation. She said Denmark appealed to donor groups to accelerate the reconstruction and rehabilitation in the cyclone-ravaged areas. Tornaes arrived Sunday and visited the cyclone-affected areas. She also met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. bdnews
