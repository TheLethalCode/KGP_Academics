 Dhaka, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com)  The number of mobile phone subscribers will exceed five crore by the end of 2008, a mobile phone company official said Tuesday. The number of subscribers presently stands at nearly three crore in Bangladesh. "The market is expected to grow to over five crore by the end of 2008," said Rashid Khan, chief executive officer of Banglalink at a press conference at Gulshan. Rashid expected that 20 percent of mobile phone users would subscribe to Banglalink by the end of 2008. Banglalink's holding company, Orascom Telecom Holding, recently announced that the mobile company's subscriber base and revenue had more than doubled in the last one year. Its third quarterly financial results for 2007 show that Banglalink added over 27 lakh subscribers until September, increasing its overall market share to 18.9 percent. The mobile company reached over 60 lakh subscribers up to September and posted a year-to-date revenue of Tk 926 crore ($133 million), up from Tk 440 crore ($62.6 million) for the same period a year ago. "The fact that we have been consistently getting the second highest share of customers proves that our strategy has been effective," Khan said. Banglalink spent Tk 1,607 crore from January to September on infrastructure investment, he added. bdnews2
