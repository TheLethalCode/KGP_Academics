Putin signed a law last week suspending Russia's participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty in a move which could allow it to deploy more forces close to western Europe. The move comes into force on Dec. 12-13. The Kremlin chief has repeatedly called on NATO members to ratify an updated version of the treaty. "If our partners eventually ratify these agreements and start complying with it, then we could re-establish our participation," Putin told workers outside Moscow at the Lavochkin spacecraft design bureau. But Putin added: "I would like to emphasize that we cannot wait forever." The CFE treaty, signed in 1990 and updated in 1999, limits the number of battle tanks, heavy artillery, combat aircraft and attack helicopters deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia's Ural mountains. The United States, the European Union and NATO had urged Putin not to suspend the treaty, seen as a cornerstone of European security. Moscow argues it has been used by an enlarged NATO to limit Russian military movements while NATO builds up forces close to Russia in contravention of earlier agreements. Western partners have refused to ratify an amended version of the pact until Russia pulls its forces out of Georgia and Moldova as it promised in 1999 when the treaty was review
