 LONDON, Dec 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday after OPEC agreed to keep output levels unchanged at its meeting in Abu Dhabi, despite consumer country demands for more oil to dampen prices now near $90 a barrel. Nigerian oil minister Odein Ajumogobia said OPEC had agreed to keep supplies unchanged and would review this again in February. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries stuck by its view that the group is already producing enough oil to cope with winter fuel demand after an agreement in September to boost output. "Our position is that demand and supply are balanced and there is no need to increase oil to the market," said Iranian Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari. U.S. crude was up $1.53 to $89.85 a barrel at 1200 GMT. London Brent crude rose $1.66 to $91.19 a barrel. Brent has moved to a premium to U.S. crude this week for the first time since August. Barclays Capital analysts said the outcome could set the stage for oil prices to shoot up to new peaks. "Barring extremely negative economic outcomes, we see plenty of scope for prices to move back up and new highs to be tested." Oil prices have risen about 40 percent since August, boosted by the weak dollar, concerns over falling oil inventories and speculative inflows. Prices came close to $100 a barrel but have fallen about 10 percent since peaking at $99.29 on Nov. 21, pressured by concerns that top oil consumer the United States could slide into recession. "I think (the agreement) shows that OPEC are worried about what's happening to demand so they don't want to flood the market with oil," said Helen Henton, head of commodity research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Because the dollar has weakened so much over the past few months I think OPEC's price aspirations have probably shifted higher." Tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran's nuclear programme had also supported the advance in oil prices. But a report released on Tuesday that grouped the findings of various U.S. intelligence agencies contradicted the Bush administration's earlier assertion that Tehran was intent on developing an atomic bomb. Analysts said this could help reduce the so-called Iran risk premium in the oil price. US government data on oil inventories due later on Wednesday will give the latest snapshot of supplies in the United States. A poll of analysts by Reuters showed crude stockpiles are forecast to have fallen for the third week in a row. Crude supplies are predicted to have dropped by 800,000 barrels in the week to Nov. 30. Distillate stocks were seen down 300,000 barre
