 Barguna, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com) The 12 villagers arrested in Barguna earlier in the week, during protests by Sidr victims for relief, were granted bail by the court Tuesday. Barguna's chief judicial magistrate ATM Ali Azam granted the bail petitions in the morning releasing the 12 villagers who had taken part in demonstrations for relief on Sunday. The court granted the 12 arrested villagers bail when Barguna district bar association moved the bail pleas as a body. Bar association president advocate Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com: "The court considered the fact that there were teachers and students among the arrestees, and that some of the students have to take their examinations soon." "The magistrate granted the bail petitions on this special ground." Azad said, the arrestees had no criminal records or previous cases filed against them, and that too helped them to get bail. bdnews24.com/c
