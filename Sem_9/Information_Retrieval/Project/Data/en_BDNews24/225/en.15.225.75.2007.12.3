<TITLE> Venezuela locked in tight vote on Chavez's powers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Caracas, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was in a tight vote on Sunday in a referendum on giving him new powers and scrapping term limits on his rule with both the government and opposition saying early returns showed they were ahead. Vice President Jorge Rodriguez said the vote was "close", but opposition leaders questioned government data that put Chavez slightly ahead and one called on the anti-US leftist leader to accept an unprecedented defeat if he loses. Preliminary data collected by the opposition showed the "No" vote ahead by 8 percentage points, Alejandro Grisanti of the Justice First party told reporters. The contradictory claims raised the possibility of a contested result. After a campaign marred by violence, many Venezuelans and foreign investors have worried over political turbulence if one side calls supporters on to the streets to protest the result. If approved, the referendum vote on a raft of reforms would allow Chavez to run for reelection indefinitely, control Venezuela's foreign currency reserves, appoint loyalists over regional elected officials and censor the media if he declares an emergency. But defeat would put him under intense pressure to slow or halt his self-declared socialist revolution and step down when his term ends in 2013. Official partial results were expected later on Sunday. Manuel Rosales, the loser of last year's presidential vote when Chavez easily won reelection, seemed confident that his adversary may now have lost a national vote for the first time since he first swept to power in a 1998 election. STRIKING OUT "Just like last December, when I announced the results with a democratic spirit, I hope the government will do the same tonight," Rosales said. "This is a like a baseball game, when one team wins or loses. There are two proposals and one of them has struck out. The one that has struck out needs to recognize that they've struck out," he said. Three government ministers earlier said that exit polls and early counts by party members showed Chavez winning by between 6 and 8 percentage points, but senior government officials later said the lead had narrowed. Opposition leaders said the government's numbers were wrong. "They are trying to create rumors to present themselves as winners, as victors," said Andres Velasquez, one opposition leader. "We want to deny it categorically, emphatically." Small groups from both sides celebrated on Sunday evening but the government and opposition leaders called for calm. Chavez has said he wants to rule for life and turn Venezuela, a major oil exporter, into a socialist state. Most pre-vote opinion surveys predicted a tight vote on the package of constitutional changes that the opposition and even some former longtime allies say is authoritarian. A fierce critic of the United States and close ally of communist Cuba, Chavez has never lost a national vote and had predicted he would win by at least 10 points on Sunday.
