<TITLE> Somalia needs more help: UN aid chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 EL ASHA, Somalia, Dec 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN's top aid official called on Monday for more help for Somalia, where almost 6,000 civilians have been killed in fighting this year. John Holmes, on a visit to the Horn of Africa country, was expected to press President Abdullahi Yusuf and new Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein for help in getting aid to thousands of Somalis uprooted by clashes between government troops backed by Ethiopian military and Islamist insurgents. United Nations officials say Somalia's humanitarian crisis is Africa's worst with 1 million people displaced. Efforts to supply food to the needy are impeded by rampant piracy and closed borders. "There has been a response but we need to do more. It is very hard for aid agencies to operate in Somalia because of the general security situation," said Holmes, who is on his second visit to Somalia this year. "There are checkpoints everywhere and aid agencies are stopped at these points and at times charged a lot of money. This is what I intend to discuss with the president and the prime minister." He later met with Yusuf and Hussein in the south-central trading town of Baidoa, where the government maintains offices. The interim government, struggling to assert its authority in a nation mired in lawlessness since 1991, promised in April to deliver more aid after Holmes complained of restrictions. The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said on Monday it started providing daily meals to at least 21,000 people in Mogadishu last month, and wants to target 50,000. "The depth and scale of the crisis in Somalia is extremely alarming to us all -- in some parts acute malnutrition levels surpass emergency threshold levels," WFP Somalia Country Director Peter Goossens said in a statement. "RAMPANT ABUSES" Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. Security Council on Monday to press Ethiopia and Somalia to stop "grave human rights abuses that are fuelling the worsening humanitarian crisis" in Somalia and in Ethiopia's ethnically Somali Ogaden region. The group said clashes intensified in November and were marked by increasing brutality towards civilians, including "summary executions and enforced disappearances of individuals by Ethiopian forces". Addis Ababa denies such allegations. "Key governments are ignoring the rampant human rights abuses in Somalia at their own peril," HRW said. A contingent of African Union soldiers has failed to stem the violence from a government-led offensive to hunt insurgents behind almost-daily roadside bombings and grenade attacks. U.N. Security Council members said last month it was vital to keep planning for a possible U.N. peacekeeping mission in Somalia, despite Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's view that such a force is unrealistic at this time. "What we can do now is plan for a possible mission to Somalia and help the African Union forces in Somalia ... but at the moment it is very hard to even send a fact-finding mission to Mogadishu," Holmes said. His visit comes a day after Prime Minister Hussein named an "all-inclusive cabinet" and called for talks with Eritrea-based opponents to end an Islamist-led insurgency. Hussein's appointment last month was seen by many as an opportunity for reconciliation in Somalia, plunged into chaos when clan warlords toppled dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 19
