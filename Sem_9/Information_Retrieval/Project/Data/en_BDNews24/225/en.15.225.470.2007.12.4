 NEW DELHI, Dec 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's Gary Kirsten is expected to take over as Indian coach despite his concerns over any possible opposition from senior players, the country's cricket board said on Tuesday. The board president Sharad Pawar said the former opening batsman sent an email on Tuesday seeking clarifications on his contract that made no mention of his concerns. "What we've received today show that he wants to join," Pawar told a news conference. "But along with that he wants certain facilities. It is basically about his family members... that we will resolve." Kirsten's appointment had looked a formality since he was interviewed last week by the Indian board's coach committee and then both sides said they were happy with the outcome. However, Kirsten said in Cape Town on Monday that he was postponing a final decision until he received assurances from the players. "I have heard rumours about some senior players expressing their concern about my possible appointment and I would prefer to have clarity on that before I commit myself," he told Reuters. "If there are concerns then I would like to find out whether they are about me as an individual or the process by which I was interviewed and then offered the job." Pawar said he did not expect any such problems. The board is struggling to to fill the post since former Australia skipper Greg Chappell quit in April in the wake of the team's shock first-round World Cup exit. Their previous attempt to secure a new coach ended in fiasco after Kirsten's compatriot Graham Ford declined the job after the cash-rich board announced his appointment. India are eager to have a coach in place before the team leaves on the tough Australia tour later this month
