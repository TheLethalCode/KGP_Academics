 JAKARTA, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Flights from Polonia airport in Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city, have not been affected by a fire that destroyed the domestic passenger terminal there, airline and local government officials said on Sunday. No one was injured in the fire, which swept through the domestic terminal at Medan, the capital of North Sumatra and one of Indonesia's busiest air hubs, late on Saturday.
