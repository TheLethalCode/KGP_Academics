 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, prior to leaving for the US for medical treatment Thursday morning, asked her party to remain united, said AL acting president Zillur Rahman. The former prime minister left Dhaka on a British Airways flight at 8.27am, a day after she was temporarily released from jail. Hasina's special aide Hasan Mahmud and chief security officer Tareq Siddiqui were seen with her as she left her Sudha Sadan home; security was tight en route to the airport. AL leaders gathered at Zia International Airport to see off their leader. Zillur Rahman, seeing the party chief off, told reporters Hasina asked him to maintain unity in the party. No discussion took place on elections, he added. AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Hasina expressed gratefulness to all for her release and asked the countrymen to pray for her. "Hasina asked all leaders and activists to be united. She also directed them to run the party activities in her absence as before," he said. Ashraful said she would return home within the time the government had given her. The party leaders requested the party chief to concentrate on her treatment rather than the situation of the country. "Hasina was not released under any attached conditions. We have the necessary papers to prove it," Ashraful said. Replying to a question, he said: "We did not make any deal with anybody." "We want a favourable atmosphere for the election. The national polls should be held prior to all other polls. The AL will participate in the elections if the proper environment is created." Ashraful said he was reporting the stated beliefs of the party chief. Hasan Mahmud said the former prime minister was not released on parole. "It was an unconditional release," he said, pointing to apparent misreporting in the media. Hasina is scheduled to meet with her sister Sheikh Rehana and daughter Saima Wazed Putul during a stopover at Heathrow Airport en route to America. She will stay at her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy's house in the US. The government released the AL president for eight weeks. Hasina had spent 11 months behind bars following her arrest and detention on July 16 last year. bdnews24.c
