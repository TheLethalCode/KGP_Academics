 Natore, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Nine people died in clashes between villagers and a suspected gang of criminals, with RAB officers being involved in the scene, at Bias village in Singra upazila, Natore, early Thursday. RAB officers and Natore acting police super Ashik Sayeed said the dead were members of a 'dacoit' gang who were attacked by villagers. RAB-5 captain Lt Col Ishrak Hossain told bdnews24.com they acted on the tip off from locals that members of a criminal gang were in the village. The villagers had chased down the suspects who had jumped into a pond in panic, though some members of the gang escaped, said witnesses. A mob had surrounded the pond, as the RAB officers turned up, said captain Ishrak. The suspected gang members aimed fire and the RAB officers returned fire, said the captain. One suspect died on the spot. On hearing the gunfire, the crowd dispersed and some suspected dacoits managed to flee the scene. The villagers chased them down and set about lynching them. Another six suspects were killed on the spot, while two who were badly injured died later in hospital. Dahiya Union Parishad chairman Bulbul Hossain alleged that the gang of dacoits gathered at the local primary school in the early hours of the morning, possibly to plan a robbery or other crime. The local people came to know of their whereabouts and gave chase, he said. Finding no way out, the dacoits jumped into the nearby pond. Being informed by the villagers, the RAB-5 squad came to the spot and faced the suspects along with the villagers, said Bulbul. As RAB and the gang members ceased their gunfire, the villagers lynched seven or eight people, he said. RAB detained two injured suspects and recovered three firearms. The injured were admitted to Singra hospital where they later succumbed to their injuries. The deputy commissioner, RAB and senior police officials visited the scene. bdnews24.co
