 Deepa Babington ROME, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Archaeologists have discovered a nearly 2,000-year-old, intact necropolis on the outskirts of Rome that gives a rare insight into the lives of poor laborers in the Roman era. The simple burial complex, dating to the 1st and 2nd century A.D. when the Roman empire was at its height, held about 320 tombs bearing well-preserved skeletal remains and artifacts like lamps and jewelry to accompany the dead into the after-life. Archaeologists on Monday hailed the discovery as significant for offering a rare glimpse into the beliefs and traits of one of the poorest sections of Roman society -- laborers or slaves who probably carried merchandise at a nearby port. "The predominant aspect here is not the recovery of artifacts but the possibility of learning about the daily life of a small sample of citizens from the lowest levels of society during the Roman empire," said Angelo Bottini, Rome's archaeology chief. "It gives a very concrete look into how these people lived and their religious beliefs," Bottini told a news conference to announce the find. BACK-BREAKING WORK The human remains unearthed were predominantly male and displayed the effects of back-breaking work in humid conditions, suggesting they were likely workers at port facilities. Some tombs also held remains of children who wore or grasped necklaces in their hand, presumably to ward off evil spirits. Bronze rings, gold earrings and a striking necklace made of tiny figurines and pieces of amber were among other ornaments discovered in children's tombs, archaeologists said. Among the more intriguing finds were the remains of a full-grown man with a rare congenital disorder that would have made it impossible for him to open his mouth -- meaning he could not have fed himself without the help of others. "Ancient peoples did not have a positive attitude towards anomalies, and tended to view them very negatively," said Bottini. "But here we have a situation that's totally contrary to such behavior -- of a person who is severely disabled but has been helped by others to allow him to survive." Archaeologists began digging in the area near Rome's Fiumicino airport more than a year ago after being tipped off by police to illegal excavations in the area that had suggested a necropolis could be buried underneath.
