<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) - The Tigers are looking to improve all three areas of their game, along with individual performance, when the hosts face Pakistan in the opener of the tri-nation one-day international series on Sunday. The match, starting at 3.00pm, will be broadcast by satellite channel Neo live from the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "We are looking forward to improving each of the three departments, along with individual performance, in the series," the Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful told a press conference at the stadium Saturday. "We did not play well in the last three or four series, and it is not possible to change everything overnight," Ashraful admitted. "But I can assure you that we will be able to offer something better this time." The team's Australian coach Jamie Siddons said the players had played two competitive warm-up matches, and thought the boys showed improved performances in each practice session. The team could not expect a win until they put up better performances in all three areas of the game, batting, fielding and bowling, said Siddons. The team have to bring these together if they want to win the match, he stressed. Ashraful said that the absence of pacers Shoaib Akhter and Mohammad Asif would not affect their game, as the Pakistani pace duo had not previously bowled against Bangladesh during their five-match series in Pakistan. The Bangladesh captain thought that 250 plus would be a fighting total in the day-night affair, that they were well capable of posting such a total and they could beat any team on a good day. Ashraful expressed some worry over his own performance, however, as he had failed to stretch his innings in his last few matches though he batted well. "But I am confident of contributing something in the series," he said. Bangladesh announced a 12-member squad for Sunday's match, keeping opener Nazimuddin and middle order batsman Mehrab Hossain Junior out of the 12. A selector hinted to bdnews24.com that 19-year-old pacer Dollar Mahmud might make his one-day international debut playing against Pakistan. Pakistani skipper Shoaib Malik said Friday that his team were looking forward to extending their unbeaten 11-match streak and winning all three matches in the series. Pakistan remain unbeaten over their last 11 games, five each against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and one against India. But Pakistani pacer Sohail Tanvir thought that the hosts, taking the home advantage, might give their opponents a hard time in the series. "We are very confident of doing well here and want to continue the momentum that we showed against Bangladesh at home," Tanvir told reporters Saturday during a practice session in Mirpur. Bangladesh 12: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful, Alok Kapali, Farhad Reza, Roqibul Hassan, Mahmudullah Riad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Dollar Mahmud and Shahdat Hossain. b
