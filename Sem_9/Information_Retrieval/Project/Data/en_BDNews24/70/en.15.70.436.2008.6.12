 NEUSTIFT, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Luis Aragones said he had sympathy for Fernando Torres's angry reaction when the striker was substituted during Spain's 4-1 win over Russia. Aragones went to shake Torres's hand but the player refused as he was replaced by Cesc Fabregas early in the second half of the Euro 2008 Group D game in Innsbruck on Tuesday. "I sympathise and understand Torres being angry but it is important to correct these things," the coach told a news conference on Wednesday. "Players that don't play should be angry, first with themselves and then with whoever they want. "These are the sort of things that are dealt with in the dressing room but we don't let them pass," added Aragones without elaborating. The coach said he took Torres off in order to strengthen the midfield. "Torres made the first goal for (hat-trick hero David) Villa and did very well but because of the way the game developed we needed another player in midfield so that's why he came off," said Aragones. "The atmosphere in the team is extraordinary and we have tried to get everyone to understand that those who don't play are just as important as those that do." Torres, who hit 33 goals for Liverpool last season, has scored 15 in 50 games for Spain but has not found the net for his country since last September
