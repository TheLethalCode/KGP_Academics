 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)US envoy James F Moriarty said Tuesday he observed some "encouraging" developments in politics but there were still scope for further compromise. "I do think that there are signs that appear encouraging, but will have to see how they play out," Moriarty told reporters after a meeting with the chief adviser's special assistant Mahbub Jamil at the youth and sports ministry. "I do think it is important that people continue to compromise and take steps that are necessary for the country." The US ambassador to Bangladesh said all players including the political parties need to compromise for domestic interests. "Everybody has to compromise a little bit and keep the country's interest at the front of the issue." The US top diplomat's comment came after the reporters asked him about the political affairs in the run-up to the national polls. The US envoy had separate meetings with commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and the chief adviser's special assistant on Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs Devasish Roy in their offices at the Secretariat. The issue of the so-called engagement of children as labourers in the shrimp industry came up at the meeting. "With respect to the shrimp industry, we talked mostly about the issue of child labour and little bitquality issue. I was encouraged to see the government is very serious about addressing both the issues," Moriarty told bdnews24.com. He hoped that the shrimp industry would continue to expand its exports to the United States. Readymade garments and shrimp are the two leading items in Bangladesh's export basket. Moriarty said more US businesses were interested in investing in Bangladesh next year. bdn
