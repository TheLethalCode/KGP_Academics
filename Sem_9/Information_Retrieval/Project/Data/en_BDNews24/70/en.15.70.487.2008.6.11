<TITLE> Even a Buffon goal would do, says Italy's Toni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BADEN, Austria, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's Euro 2008 campaign has started so badly that even beating Romania with a goal from keeper Gianluigi Buffon would be welcome, main striker Luca Toni said on Wednesday. A 3-0 defeat by Netherlands in their Group C opener on Monday means the world champions would be eliminated if they lost Friday's game against the Romanians in Zurich. "Even if Buffon scores against Romania, we need three points and that's that," Toni told a news conference at Italy's base south of Vienna. The tall forward's desperation follows a frustrating game against the Dutch where he had a couple of half chances but was often isolated from the other attackers. "After the game there was a lot of anger in the dressing room. After Romania I want to see a much happier dressing room," he added. "We have lost the first battle but the war isn't over yet. We have got to try to return to the Italy of before. I think there are many Italians who still have faith in us." Many pundits have said the Azzurri were outmuscled by a more dynamic Dutch side but Toni rejected accusations Italy were not in the best condition. "I repeat there is no physical problem. On the field I didn't see that the Dutch were so superior. Personally I felt better than in many games I've played," he said. Coach Roberto Donadoni is expected to make changes for the Romania game with forward Alessandro Del Piero, midfielder Daniele De Rossi and defenders Fabio Grosso and Giorgio Chiellini most likely to come in to the starting lineup. A change of formation from 4-3-3 to 4-3-2-1 is also possible. Italy play France, who drew 0-0 with Romania on Monday, in their final group game on Tuesday
