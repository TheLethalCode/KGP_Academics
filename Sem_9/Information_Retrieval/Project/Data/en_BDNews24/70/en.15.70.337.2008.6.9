 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)Dhanmondi police have returned the passports of detained prime minister Sheikh Hasina, that were seized when she was arrested last year, handing them back to her lawyer Monday. Officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi Police Station Syed Mohsinul Huq handed over three attached passports to Hasina's lawyer Kamrul Islam and her nephew Fazle Noor Taposh. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Abdullah Al Mamun ordered the police to restore Hasina's passports earlier Monday, as the former prime minister's lawyers sought to clear a legal path for her treatment overseas. Special public prosecutor Sarder Shahidul Islam told the court the state did not object to returning Hasina's three passports. Taposh and Kamrul went to Dhanmondi police station at around 3.30 pm to receive the passports, which the police handed over in front of reporters. "We have got the three passports back," Kamrul told bdnews24.com. He said of the three, two were diplomatic passports and one was current. The Awami League president, and immediate-past opposition leader, used the two diplomatic passports D0007883 and D009151 until the expiry of the eighth parliament on Oct 28, 2006. Thereafter, she began using passport W0526627, attached with the two diplomatic passports, the lawyer said. Police confiscated the passports when Hasina was arrested from her Dhanmondi home on July 16, last year. The government is expected to allow the detained former prime minister to leave Dhaka in the nxt day or two for medical treatment abroad. bdnews24.com/
