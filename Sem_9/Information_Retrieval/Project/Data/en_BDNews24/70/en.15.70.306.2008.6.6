<TITLE> Nepal needs someone to appoint living goddess </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu,June 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's religious authorities picked the country's next "living goddess" or Kumari in a centuries-old tradition on Friday, priests and officials said, but the question now is who will appoint her as a deity. Traditionally, the head priest of the now-deposed King Gyanendra appointed the "living goddess" but with the abolition of Nepal's monarchy on May 29, that position no longer exists. "We have requested the government for directives as to who should appoint Kumari now," said Semanta Raj Chapagain, chief of the state-run Trust Corporation overseeing cultural affairs. "It cannot remain empty for long," he said. The Himalyan nation ended its 239-year-old monarchy and became a republic last month, following elections in April which saw the country's former Maoist rebels score a surprise win to emerge as the biggest political party in the 601-member constituent assembly. The new republic's key political parties are now grappling with the formation of a new government and the election of a new president. Religious authorities in the ancient temple town of Bhaktapur, on Friday selected a six-year-old child, Shreeya, to replace her predecessor Sajani Shakya, who retired earlier this year, after being worshipped by devout Hindus and Buddhists for nine years as the Kumari of Bhaktapur, which is near Kathmandu. Sajani, the previous Kumari of Bhaktapur, made international headlines last year after she visited the United States to promote a film by a British company about the ancient practice. Some religious authorities criticised the trip, saying it was against tradition. She retired at the request of her family. Religious authorities said they were happy with the new choice. "We have selected Shreeya in accordance with a traditional process from among ten aspirants," said Narendra Joshi, the chief of a religious panel that made the selection. He did not explain how she was selected. Under the Kumari tradition, a girl selected from a Buddhist Newar family goes through a rigorous cultural process and becomes the "living goddess". She is considered by many as an incarnation of the powerful deity Kali and is revered by many until she menstruates, after which she must return to the family and a new one is chosen. Some human rights activists have petitioned the Supreme Court to end the practice saying it denies the child her normal life. The apex court is expected to deliver a judgement on the petition in July
