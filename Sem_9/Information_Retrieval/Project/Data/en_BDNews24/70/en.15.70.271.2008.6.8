 HARARE, Sun Jun 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's High Court on Sunday ordered police to release an opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) member of parliament, who was arrested on Saturday for the second time in a week. Eric Matinenga was initially arrested on June 1 on charges of inciting public violence in his constituency, but was released on Thursday after a magistrate dropped the charges and said he had been wrongly charged. He was detained for a second time on Saturday morning. Matinenga's arrests come amid accusations by the opposition that President Robert Mugabe's government is trying to sabotage MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai's campaign ahead of a June 27 run-off presidential election. The second round vote follows a disputed March poll which showed Tsvangirai beat Mugabe, but not by enough votes to avoid a run-off. "The MDC welcomes the judgment as the only logical thing to do as Advocate Matinenga is a fine son of Zimbabwe, whose quest for the freedom of the people of Zimbabwe is unquestionable," the party said in a statement. Six MDC lawmakers have been arrested for various offences since the March 29 poll. The opposition, rights groups and opposition members accuse veteran leader Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party of trying to rig the election by intimidating voters, undermining the MDC and thwarting its campaign efforts
