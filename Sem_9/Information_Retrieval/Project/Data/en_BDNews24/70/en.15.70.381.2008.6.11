 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina was released Wednesday after 11 months behind bars. Joint forces arrested the former prime minister at her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi on July 16 last year. Several cases were filed against her before and after the arrest. Here is a chronology of events that unfolded in the build-up to her release. On April 9, 2007 Westmont Power Plant chairman Tajul Islam Faruque filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against Hasina with Tejgaon Police Station. On April 11, 2007 A chargesheet against Hasina and 45 others was submitted to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka, in a case involving the killing of a Shibir worker in the October 28 clash in 2006 between Awami League and Jamaat supporters at Paltan. Paltan Jamaat president ATM Sirajul Haque filed the case on Oct 29. On April 18, 2007 The government issued a press note imposing a restriction on Hasina to return home. Hasina was abroad at that time. The press note said Hasina's return might spark violence in the country. On April 22, 2007 An arrest warrant was issued against Hasina in the Shibir worker killing case. On May 7, 2007 Hasina returned home after she won a legal battle in the High Court over the government's restrictions on her homecoming. On June 13, 2007 Two extortion cases were filed against Hasina with Tejgaon and Gulshan police stations accusing her of taking a total of Tk 8.99 crore from private firms in return for awarding contracts to set up power plants. On July 16, 2007 Joint forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. A Dhaka court sent her to jail extortion charges. A building on Jatiya Sangsad complex was fashioned into a sub-jail for Hasina. On July 30, 2007 The High Court set a date to hear Hasina's appeal seeking cancellation of a graft case relating to appointment of foreign consultant to Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. Now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case against her on Dec 11, 2001. On Sept 2, 2007 The Anticorruption Commission filed a case against Hasina and six others on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe in return for some advantages to set up three barge-mounted power plants. On Dec 9, 2007 The ACC filed two cases against Hasina, Khaleda Zia and others for handing three gasfields to Canadian company Niko Resources. On May 7, 2008 ACC deputy director MM Sabbir Hasan submitted a chargesheet to a court in the Niko case involving Hasina. On June 9, 2008 Separate courts issued rulings exempting Hasina from appearing in court in four cases. The trial court also ordered authorities to return Hasina's passport seized by police. The court orders came in line with the recommendations of a medical board for rapid ear treatment of Hasina. bdnew
