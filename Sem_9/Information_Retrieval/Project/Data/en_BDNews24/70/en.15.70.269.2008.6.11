 BASEL, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey captain Emre Belozoglu has been ruled out of Wednesday's Euro 2008 Group A match against Switzerland after tearing a hamstring muscle, Turkey coach Fatih Terim said on Tuesday. Terim, who said losing Emre was a major blow, told a news conference: "He has a 3-4cms tear in his muscle and was sent for an MRI in Basel today and the news was not good.

Both team coaches refused to be drawn on how they would replace their captains.

"Well, mothers, of course, we are always respectful to mothers," Terim said after sharing a momentary fit of giggles with forward Tuncay Sanli. "Football has become something that everyone can express their views on regardless of how much they know about it, so there's not much I can say except to express my respect to the mothers
