<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court Thursday granted three months bail to Sigma Huda, the wife of former communications minister Nazmul Huda. The ruling follows the sentencing of the former communications minister on August 27 last year to seven years imprisonment for corruption, while his wife received three years behind bars, also on corruption charges. Mir Helal, the son of former state minister for aviation Mir Nasiruddin, also received three months bail. The move follows the sentencing of Helal on July 4 last year to three years imprisonment, while his father received 13 years behind bars, both on charges of hiding wealth information and amassing illegal wealth. A High Court bench comprising justices Md Abdul Quddus and Syed Md Ziaul Karim gave the order after receiving bail prayers from Sigma and Helal. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Nazmul Huda and his wife with Dhanmondi Police Station on March 22 last year. According to the case details, Meer Zahir, a contractor, deposited Tk 2.4 crore in bribes in an account belonging to Khaborer Antarale following a demand from Nazmul Huda. According to the emergency powers rules, no one convicted on charges of corruption can appeal to the court over the verdict. However, on December 13 last year appeals by Sigma Huda and Helal resulted in the High Court declaring it has the power to grant bail to individuals convicted of corruption. The same verdict saw the HC grant bail to Sigma Huda and Helal. Then, on March 6, the Supreme Court cancelled the bail orders after an appeal by the government and the ACC. In its opinion, the Supreme Court said, the HC does not have the power to grant bail to those convicted under the emergency powers rules. The SC, however, added that the HC can consider bail applications in cases where smaller sentences were involved and where the accused is seriously ill and has a medical board certificate. In addition, if the appeal could not be disposed off within 90 days the HC may consider bail applications. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq represented Sigma Huda. Senior Advocate Khandker Mahbub Uddin stood for Mir Helal. bdnew
