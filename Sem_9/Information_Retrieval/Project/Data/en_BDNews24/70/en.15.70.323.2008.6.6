 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  A medical board advised the government to take rapid steps towards ear treatment for detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, but did not specify where the treatment should be sought, the chief of the board said Friday. Professor Syed Maruf Ali, director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology, told bdnews24.com: "We did not make any direct recommendation to send her abroad but asked to take her to a hospital where necessary treatments are available." The medical board in its report recommended the hearing aid of Hasina be replaced as soon as possible. The board examined Hasina's health Thursday. Maruf Ali, who led the four-member medical team, said the report was submitted to the government Thursday night. "Sheikh Hasina mainly suffers from ear problems. The device she now wears was programmed abroad. Besides, its date has expired. I don't know if the device is available at home," Ali told bdnews24.com. Two separate medical boards examined Hasina and Arafat Rahman Coco, the younger son of detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, on Thursday. Another board examined Khaleda Friday afternoon. Copies of the reports on Hasina and Coco have been sent to the Directorate General of Health Services, director general Md Abul Faiz confirmed to bdnews24.com Friday. "Reports of the medical boards examining Hasina and Coco's health were submitted to the health ministry and home ministry. I received copies of the reports too," he said. He did not mention anything about the recommendations contained in the reports, but added that he had not yet received the report on Khaleda's health. The chief of the medical board for Khaleda, Prof Saleh Ahmed, told bdnews24.com late Friday: "We submitted our report to the Directorate General of Health Services at around 7 pm this evening." "Now it is up to the government to decide how to proceed," he added, saying he was not permitted to say anything further on the confidential recommendations in the report. bdnews24.co
