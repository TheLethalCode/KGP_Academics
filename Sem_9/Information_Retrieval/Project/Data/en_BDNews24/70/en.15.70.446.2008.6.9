 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Four Dhaka courts have exempted Sheikh Hasina from personally appearing in hearings of four separate cases against her, while police returned the former prime minister's passports Monday, as her lawyers sought to clear a legal path for her treatment overseas. Two special judge's courts, sited on the Sangsad Bhaban complex, exempted the detained Awami League president from a legal binding to appear in person in the barge-mounted power plant case and the Niko case proceedings against her. A divisional judge and a Dhaka magistrate also excused Hasina from appearing in the MiG-29 and Noor Ali case hearings, respectively. Following separate pleas by Hasina's lawyers, the courts ruled that the trial proceedings would continue during her absence, in line with the criminal procedures code, in the event that Hasina went overseas for treatment. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court separately ordered the government to return the AL president's passports, which were seized after her arrest and detention a year ago. Special public prosecutor Sarder Shahidul Islam told the court the state did not object to returning Hasina's passports. Officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi police station Syed Mohsinul Huq later handed over the three attached passports to Hasina's lawyer Kamrul Islam and her nephew Fazle Noor Taposh, at around 3.30 pm. "We have got the three passports back," Kamrul told bdnews24.com. He said of the three, two were diplomatic passports and one was current. Dhanmondi police confiscated the passports when Hasina was arrested from her home on July 16, last year. The government is expected to allow the detained former prime minister to leave Dhaka in the nxt day or two for medical treatment abroad. bdnews24.com/pc/s
