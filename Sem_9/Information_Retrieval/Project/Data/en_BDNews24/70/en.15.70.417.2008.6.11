<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Wednesday granted permanent bail to former army chief Mustafizur Rahman in the MiG-29 graft case. Judge Golam Mortuza Mojumdar of Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, also deferred the charge-framing proceedings until June 19. The veteran general, who is now enjoying interim bail, has been suffering from various illnesses. Sheikh Hasina, the main accused in the case, wasn't produced in court Wednesday, as she was expected to be released later in the day and had recently been exempted from personally appearing in court. Other accused in the case were produced before the court, while advocate Sahara Khatun appeared in the court on Hasina's behalf. Mustafiz's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman petitioned the court to grant permanent bail, saying that his client was seriously ill and not able to attend the court proceedings. The lawyer also sought permission to send him abroad for treatment. The court granted the permanent bail and said the matter of overseas treatment would be settled on June 19. The now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the graft case, involving the controversial purchase of eight MiG-29 war planes, with Tejgaon police on Dec 11, 2001. Seven people, including Sheikh Hasina, were accused in the case. It was alleged that during Hasina's tenure, the state incurred huge losses amounting to about Tk 700 crore because of the purchase deal. Hasina and other accused were charged on Jan 29, 2003, but the court proceedings remained halted for years as an appeal was pending with the High Court. Other accused in the case are former air force chief Jamaluddin Ahmed, former defence secretary Syed Yusuf Hossain, former defence joint secretary Mohammad Hossain Sherniabat, retired air commodore Mirza Akhtar Maruf and Unique Group proprietor businessman Noor Ali. bdnews24.com
