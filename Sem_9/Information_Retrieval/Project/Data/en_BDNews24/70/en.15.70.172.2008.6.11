 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national hockey team leave here for Singapore Thursday night to take part in the 3rd men's AHF Cup with the hope of clinching the title. "Our objective is to clinch the title as we did at the last meet at home in 2006," coach Mahbub Haroon told bdnews24.com. "If the players can play to their potential, it is not a problem to win all six matches in the meet," said Mahbub, who, however, rated hosts Singapore and Uzbekistan high in the nine-team meet. The AHF Cup, considered as the Asia Cup qualifiers, will start on June 14 with three matches on the opening day. Bangladesh will take on Brunei Darussalam, Sri Lanka will face Oman and Singapore will play against Chinese Taipei. Bangladesh were drawn in Pool A along with hosts Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Uzbekistan and Brunei while Pool B consisted of Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Oman and Thailand. Four top teams will qualify for the 10-team Asia Cup, likely to be held in Hyderabad in 2009. Mahbub believed that his squad was a balanced one comprised of six new players along with 10 experienced players. The former national player-turned-coach did not want to take any risk with fielding the newcomers in the beginning, but testing them in the latter part of the tournament. Mahbub has outlined a playing eleven with veteran Mahbub Shakil standing under the post and Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Isa Mia, Moshiur Rahman Biplob and Ferdous Golder protecting the defense. Musa Mia, Shahidullah Titu, Khandoker Hasan Ahmed and Jahidul Islam Rajon will play in the midfield while Russel Mahmud Jimmy and Maksudul Alam Habul will be on the frontline. Squad: Mahbubullah Chowdhury Shakil, Mehrab Hossain Kiron, Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Isa Mia, Asaduzzaman Chandan, Moshiur Rahman Biplob, Ferdous Goldar, Shahidullah Titu, Musa Mia, Khandoker Hasan Ahmed, Sheikh M Nannu, Maksudul Alam Habul, Russel Mahmud Jimmy, Jahidul Islam Rajon, Rimon Kumar Ghosh and Krishna Kumar. Officials: Qumrul Islam Kismot (manager), Shahidullah Dolan (asst manager), Mahbub Haroon (coach), Barkatullah Chapal (asst coach), Mirza Farid Ahmed (Judge) and Mahbubul Haq Mitu (Umpire).
