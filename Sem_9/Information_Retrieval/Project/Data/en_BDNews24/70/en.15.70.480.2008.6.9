<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has rejected the national budget proposed for fiscal 2008-09 as illegal. "The caretaker government did not have the constitutional right to place a budget. It has no right to impose out-of-parliament tax," Delwar told reporters on his NAM flat Monday, shortly after finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam announced the budget. Hafizuddin Ahmed, acting secretary general of the troubled party's other faction, said the budget was a "lesser evil". Terming the caretaker government illegal and unelected, Delwar said the budget neglected development sectors. The BNP leader said his party did not have any interest in the proposed budget. "We don't want to make any comment on the budget when the entire nation is disappointed." Hafiz said the next elected government could make the budget bigger if the election was held in December. bdnew
