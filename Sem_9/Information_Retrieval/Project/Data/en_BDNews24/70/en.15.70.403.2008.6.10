 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Awami League will take part in the year-end elections, said a senior party leader Tuesday. "Of course, Awami League will contest the polls. Hopefully, the political environment will also be amenable by the time the elections are due," said AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. "Awami League hopes to form the next democratic government by winning the polls," he said at an extended meeting of Awami Swechchhashebak League at the Diploma Engineers' Institution in the capital. "We must take the necessary decisions, which will help dispel the current political stalemate," said the AL leader. Ashraful, however, did not elaborate further on what decisions would be taken. "Our party wants that the country should prosper, as the country earned its independence under the banner of Awami League, hence our spirit of cooperation and keen sense of responsibility," he said. The meeting was also attended by the AL presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta. bdnews24.
