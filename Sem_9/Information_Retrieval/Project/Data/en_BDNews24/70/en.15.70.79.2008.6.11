 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina is now a matter of hours since jail authorities expect relevant papers to reach them soon. "I think the official documents for the release of Sheikh Hasina will reach us by midday," deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com by phone at 10:15am. It is not clear yet under which context she is being released although legal barriers have already been cleared for her to fly abroad for better treatment. Hasina is returning home after 11 months behind bars, pending trial. The Awami League chief faces various corruption charges but she and the party have rejected them, saying they are aimed at removing her from politics. Hasina is expected to go straight to Sudha Sadan after Wednesday's release from special jail to fly to North America the next day, barrister Fazle Noor Taposh said Tuesday night. Taposh said there was no possibility of the Awami League president presiding over any party meeting before her flight out of Dhaka. Mood on the party front is joyous, and it is expected that the Awami League will join the polls, expected to be held in December. Hasina is expected to leave on a British Airways flight bdnews24.com
