<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The High Court questioned the authority of the caretaker government Wednesday to float tenders for oil and gas explorations in both shallow and deep basins of the Bay of Bengal. The court, however, did not impose any embargo on the government's current negotiations on oil and gas production and distribution deals. A HC bench comprising Justices Md Iman Ali and Md Emdadul Haque ordered the energy secretary, law secretary and PetroBangla chairman to explain within two weeks why oil-gas exploration tenders floated by the caretaker government should not be considered illegal and beyond its jurisdiction. The bench said its order was based on public interest regarding the country's oil and gas reserves. The court said no embargo is being imposed on deals being negotiated at the moment, as no oil-gas production or distribution deal is expected to be sealed before October. The energy ministry invited international tenders on Feb 15 for leasing out 28 maritime blocks in both shallow and deep basins of the Bay, announcing that any oil-gas production and distribution deals would be finalised by Oct 1. Challenging the legality of the move, former secretary Shah Abdul Hannan and barrister Munshi Ahsan Kabir filed a writ petition with the High Court, seeking a court order cancelling the government's invitation for tenders. The petition also sought a freeze order on any production and distribution agreements that resulted from the tendering process. Barrister Abdur Razzaque, counsel for the petitioners, told reporters after Wednesday's hearing that the caretaker government's term is scheduled to end in December,and so it will hardly have time from October to execute any production-distribution agreements. Moreover, Razzaque pointed out, policy decisions in the oil-gas sector by the caretaker government might turn out to be violating its jurisdiction. "The court has taken our argument, that is, the petitioners' sideinto cognizance. The court also observed that no unelected government has the jurisdiction of taking such policy decisions as involve oil and gas explorations, production and distribution," he said. bdnews
