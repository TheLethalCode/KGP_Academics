 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Awami League will take part in the year-end elections to become the next democratic government, said a senior party leader Tuesday. "Of course, Awami League will contest the polls. Hopefully, the political environment will also be amenable by the time the elections are due," said AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. "Awami League hopes to form the next democratic government by winning the polls," he said at an extended meeting of Awami Swechchhashebak League at the Diploma Engineers' Institution in the capital. "We must take the necessary decisions that will help dispel the current political stalemate," said the AL leader. Ashraful, however, did not elaborate further on what decisions would be taken. "Our party wants that the country should prosper, as the country earned its independence under the banner of Awami League, hence our spirit of cooperation and keen sense of responsibility," he said. "We're passing through a very critical and unsettled time. We're awaiting a decision, some very welcome news. I wouldn't like to make any comment now that might ruin that much awaited possibility." The meeting was also attended by the AL presidium members Amir Hossain Amu and Tofail Ahmed among others. Expressing optimism over Sheikh Hasina's imminent release for overseas treatment, AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said: "We have to initiate another process now so that the party chief may participate in the election and related campaign activities." Tofail Ahmed said: "Awami League will be led and run by Sheikh Hasina's directives, wherever she may be, in whatever shape." Demanding the lifting of emergency rule, Tofail said: "People will not accept elections under emergency rule." "Politicians are being maligned and declared ineligible for participation in the election by charging them left and right." "Justice cannot be sought under emergency rule, neither can anyone be silenced by detaining him or her indefinitely." bdnews24.
