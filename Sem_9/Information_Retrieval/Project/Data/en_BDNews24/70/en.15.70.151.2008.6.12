 BASEL, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patrick Mueller was in despair after co-hosts Switzerland became the first side to be eliminated from Euro 2008 when he deflected in Turkey's stoppage-time winner on Wednesday. Turkey's 2-1 victory in Group A provided a cruel end to the finals for the 31-year-old, who fought a major battle just to make it into his country's squad. Sidelined for Olympique Lyon after tearing a cruciate knee ligament in December, Mueller walked out on the French champions without permission last month to prove his fitness at Switzerland's pre-tournament training camp. "To have waited so long to get into the squad and then to be here and be able to play and then this, I think it has to be the worst night of my football career," Mueller told reporters. "We've had two games and two defeats and that's it, we're out. Now we just have to hope we can hold our heads up for our last game against Portugal (on Sunday) because we want our last picture of this European Championship to be a positive one." Turkey midfielder Arda Turan ended the Swiss team's title dream five days into the tournament when his powerful 92nd-minute strike glanced off the defender's calf and over the head of keeper Diego Benaglio. "I felt the ball hit my leg and I think if it hadn't it would have gone straight into the hands of Benaglio," said Mueller. "Perhaps we risked too much trying to win the game but to be winning 1-0 and then lose the match on two counter-attacks is very disappointing.
