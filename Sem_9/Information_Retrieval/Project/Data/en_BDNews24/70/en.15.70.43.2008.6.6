 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh kept their hopes of qualifying for the semifinals of the 5th SAFF Championship alive when they came from behind to play a 2-2 draw against Afghanistan at Sugathadasa Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka Friday. Bangladesh, who also drew against Bhutan in the group opener, raised their points tally to two from as many matches and they now have to face hosts Sri Lanka in their last match on Sunday in a must-win-situation to qualify for the last four. Afghanistan have also two points from two outings as they held hosts Sri Lanka 2-2 in their first match last Wednesday. War-ravaged Afghanistan, who stunned Bangladesh to play a goalless draw in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan, again astonished the former SAFF champions taking a lead in the ninth minute of the game. Capitalising on defense lapse, Johib Mohammad from the left set Ata Mohammad inside the danger zone and Ata did not mistake edging past Bangladesh keeper Aminul Islam. After conceding an early goal, Bangladesh seemed disorganised in the midfield and the Afghan footballers launched a series of attacks taking those advantages and they again came out successful with Mustafa Hadid doubling the margin in the 20th minute. After the lemon break, a reorganised Bangladesh pressed hard on the Afghan backline and got dividends six minutes into the second half. Capitalising on a through pass, Jahid Hasan Emily ran down from the middle, but the striker was brought down by Afghan defender Ali Ahmed inside the box and referee did not hesitate to award Bangladesh a spot kick. Emily converted the penalty shot to reduce the margin to 2-1 in the 51st minute. Afterwards, Bangladesh enjoyed superior ball procession before the equaliser as Mamunul Islam Mamun leveled the margin in the 76th minute. Mamun went to take the right side corner kick after the Afghan goalkeeper had foiled a powerful shot from Abul Hossain outside the box and saw his left-footed shot kiss the back of the opponents' net deflecting off Afghan defender Kohisten. The result would have been different for Bangladesh had the referee not ignored a spot kick a few minutes before the final whistle seemingly overlooking the matter when Bangladesh young striker Komol was brought down in the danger zone.
