 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned home on Wednesday amid high emotions, after 11 months behind bars. Full Story Hasina was seen wiping tears from her eyes as she waved from the third-floor balcony of her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi to the welcoming crowds gathered on the road. She said simply: "I am well," in response to a shouted question from a reporter on the crowded road. Hasina was released from jail amid tight security earlier in the day, to allow her to seek medical treatment overseas. The government said Wednesday it will also take necessary steps for the treatment of detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia 'at home or abroad'. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters that a decision on the treatment of Khaleda would be made on the same humanitarian and legal grounds that had been considered for Hasina's release. Hasina left the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex at a 1.45pm Wednesday, heading for her Dhanmondi home. On the way, she stopped at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, at Road 32 of Dhanmondi, to lay a wreath at her father's portrait. Donning a cotton sari, Hasina sat for some time in her childhood bedroom; her aunt Khadiza Begum accompanied her. Cabinet members were scheduled to meet with Hasina at Sudha Sadan Wednesday night, said a senior party leader. The meeting was set for a 9pm start after a meeting of the party's central working committee, acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com. The British High Commission in Dhaka lent tacit support to the government Wednesday for its decision to Hasina to get treatment abroad. "We understand that Sheikh Hasina is being allowed to leave Bangladesh for medical treatment on the basis of a medical board decision and approval from the courts for her to be away from the country," a spokesperson for the high commission said. "We have been consistent and clear that access to an adequate medical provision is a right for anyone in detention without  discrimination," Syeda Nazneen Ferdousi, in charge of the commission's press and public affairs, told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the US embassy in Dhaka said: "The decision to grant parole to detainees falls under the authorities of the government of Bangladesh and competent judicial authorities." Joint forces arrested the former prime minister at Sudha Sadan on July 16 last year. She currently faces four separate graft cases proceeding in trial courts against, which were filed prior to and after her arrest. bdnews24.com/sum/
