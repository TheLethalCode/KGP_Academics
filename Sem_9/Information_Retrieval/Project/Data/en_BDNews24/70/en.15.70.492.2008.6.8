 ATHENS, Sun Jun 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck southern Greece on Sunday, causing panic and some damage but only minor injuries so far, Greek authorities said. The quake, which was felt as far away as Athens, struck 54 km (33 miles) southwest of the city of Patras at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), the Athens Geodynamic Institute said. "It was terrible. We had never lived through something like this before. It was very long and we felt that the town was being flattened," mayor of Pyrgos, Makis Paraskevopoulos, told state TV. Police said they had received reports of minor injuries and some abandoned buildings had collapsed. "Five old buildings have collapsed in the area so far, phone lines are down and people are out in the streets," a police official told Reuters. Greek media said some people might be trapped in rubble but police were unable to immediately confirm the reports
