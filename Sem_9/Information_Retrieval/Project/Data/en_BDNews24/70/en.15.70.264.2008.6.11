 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh are looking to improve their performance, over their opening match against Pakistan, when they face India in the group final of the Kitply one-day international series at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Thursday. "We will want to show a better performance in all three departments against India than in the first match against Pakistan," Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful told a press conference after the practice session Tuesday. The Tigers had three hours practice in the morning while only six Indian players -- Yusuf Pathan, Robin Uthapa, RP Sing, Ishant Sharma, Manpreet Gony and Pragyan Ojha -- geared up in the afternoon. Chasing 234 to win against Pakistan, Bangladesh went 70 runs down in the series opener and their bowling and batting were not up to the mark. Ashraful said that his bowlers failed to pitch the ball on target and the batsmen also let themselves down in the previous match. "If we can maintain the process of bowling and batting according to the situation, we can win the match against India," the captain said. The players are very keen to finish the last match on a high, but the Bangladesh captain was somewhat hesitant in his assurances of winning against India. "We have a target of performing well in every match, but the players are really eager to do so against India," he said. Ashraful said he believed if the Bangladesh bowlers "pitched to the right areas", it would be possible to stop in-form Indian opener Virender Sehwag, who along with Gautam Gambhir destroyed Pakistan's attack to put up 155 runs for the opening stand. Asked why the team seemed less hopeful of a victory than was usual on the eve of a one-day match, Ashraful said: "May be we are suffering from lack of confidence following our dismal performance in the recent past and we can not speak strongly about victory." Explaining his own performance against Pakistan, Ashraful said that he batted according to the demands of the match, as the top order batsmen returned to the dressing room early. The captain said they have chosen the same 12 players, who were picked for the first match, for Thursday's game. Despite a convincing triumph against Pakistan, India's South African coach Gerry Kristen does not want to take Bangladesh lightly as both teams have an equal chance of winning in any one-day match. Kristen said that they were yet to finalise the playing eleven and would decide just before the match. Bangladesh 12: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Alok Kapali, Mahmudullah Raid, Mushfiqur Rahim, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Shahadat Hossain, Dollar Mahmud and Farhad Reza. b
