 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)--Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday the allowance for poor lactating mothers would be extended to urban areas in the upcoming fiscal year. In his budget speech, the adviser said breast feeding mothers working in the garment sector would be the main beneficiaries of the extended programme. The proposed budget allocates over Tk 20 crore for the new programme, and follows up on a similar initiative for rural women introduced in the current budget. "In conjunction with the rural areas programme, there is a need to provide similar support to poor and low-income workers, and particularly to working mothers in the garment sector," said the finance adviser in his budget speech. Mirza Aziz also announced a substantive increase, amounting to 27 percent, in the existing allowance for poor breast feeding mothers in rural areas. bdn
