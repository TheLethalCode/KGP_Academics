 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  A medical board formed to examine the health of former prime minister Khaleda Zia has submitted its report to the government, the chief of the board said Friday. Prof Saleh Ahmed told bdnews24.com late Friday: "We submitted our report to the Directorate General of Health Services at around 7pm this evening." "Now it is up to the government to decide how to proceed," he said, adding that he was not permitted to say anything further on the confidential recommendations in the report. The medical board examined Khaleda Friday afternoon, at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex where she is being detained, a senior prisons official said. The five-member medical board entered the special jail at around 4.15pm and left at 5pm, deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. "Khaleda has long been suffering from arthritis. She has pain in her knee and neck," he said. Siddiqui said prison authorities would take the necessary steps for her treatment after the medical board headed by Prof Saleh Ahmed gave its report. Four other members of the board are medicine specialist Prof Razibul Alam, orthopaedic specialist Md Shahiduzzaman, Prof MA Mannan of Salimullah Medical College and Mamtaz Uddin Ahmed, assistant director of the Directorate General of Health Services. Two separate medical boards also examined former prime minster Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco on Thursday. Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Zakir Hasan had earlier told bdnews24.com: "The government has formed three separate medical boards for examining and ascertaining the latest health conditions of detainees Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia and Arafat Rahman Coco." "Sheikh Hasina and Coco have already been seen by the appointed medical board members on Thursday," he said. A four-member medical board headed by professor Syed Maruf Ali, of the National Eye Science Institute and Hospital, examined Sheikh Hasina. Professor Mustafizur Rahman, of the Institute of Diseases of the Chest & Hospital (IDCH), headed the medical board for Coco. When asked if the medical boards were formed to decide whether to send the three abroad, Zakir Hasan said: "We don't know anything about sending them abroad. That would be decided at the highest level of the government. But everything will depend on the reports of the medical boards." "As far as we know, the medical boards were formed to assess their health conditions only. We have cooperated with the doctors on the boards at work." A letter from Sheikh Hasina's family and the Awami League, requesting the government to send the ailing detained political leader abroad for treatment, was submitted to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Mar 12. Appearing in the court Wednesday, Khaleda Zia too demanded that the government should send her and younger son Coco abroad for medical treatment. bdnews24.com
