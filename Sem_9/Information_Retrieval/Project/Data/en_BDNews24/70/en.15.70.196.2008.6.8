 MEXICO CITY, Sun Jun 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful coalition of drug gangs led by Mexico's most-wanted man is collapsing, meaning the surge in bloodshed and police killings will get worse, a senior US counternarcotics official said. Internal conflicts, greed and pressure by Mexico's military are causing a split among gangs from the Pacific state of Sinaloa, with each group seeking new alliances to smuggle illegal drugs into the United States. "The Sinaloa cartel is weakened, divided ... . There are internal disputes, rivalries, betrayals," the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters in an interview. "You're going to see more violence." "It is getting worse because police are engaging, because cartels want to create fear and because of attacks between rivals. It's going to get worse before it gets better." More than 1,400 people have been killed in drug violence this year across Mexico as cartels vie for control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States. It is a faster rate than in 2007, when about 2,500 died during the year. Unlike gangs that work alone, members of the Sinaloan coalition had shared trafficking routes, transport, cocaine sources and hit men, making them a formidable force that controls much of the state. The U.S. official said the coalition's leader and Mexico's most-wanted man, Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, also has split with outside allies like the boss of the Juarez cartel in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, where some 400 people have been killed in drug violence this year. "There's friction between Guzman and Vicente Carrillo (in Juarez). Vicente is being backed by the Gulf cartel," he said, referring to a drug gang based in northeastern Mexico. Carrillo, boss of the Juarez cartel, is one of Mexico's top drug barons and listed as one of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's top 12 international fugitives. POLICE COMPLICITY Weakening the Sinaloans has been a central aim of the military-backed assault that conservative President Felipe Calderon launched on drug gangs after taking office in December 2006. Last month Calderon sent thousands of extra troops to marijuana-producing Sinaloa following a wave of police murders including Edgar Millan, one of Mexico's top federal policemen. As the military squeezes the Sinaloans in their home state, violence is escalating in the northern state of Chihuahua, home to Ciudad Juarez. Some 50 police officers have been killed in Chihuahua this year, highlighting police involvement in trafficking and cartel attempts to scare honest police out of doing their jobs, anti-drug officials and drug trade experts say. "There are a lot of cops on the payroll of the Vicente Carrillo organization and Guzman wants a stake in that smuggling corridor," said Tony Payan, a drug trade expert at the University of Texas at El Paso. "Given that their pact has broken down, the gangs are setting out to kill all the people who work for the other side." Some 500 police officers and military personnel have been killed in drug violence in the 18 months since Calderon sent out the first of some 25,000 soldiers to fight drug gangs. The official urged the US Congress to pass a $1.4 billion aid package to help Mexico buy equipment like helicopters and encrypted communication devices to hunt down drug cartels. Lawmakers have held up the so-called Merida Initiative with calls to attach conditions on how and where the aid is used. "The Merida Initiative is vital," the official said. "The hold-ups in Congress are not good. It could be seen we're letting Mexico down.
