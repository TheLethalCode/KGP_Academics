 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned home on Wednesday to a tableau of mixed emotions, after 11 months behind bars. Hasina was seen wiping tears from her eyes as she waved from the third-floor balcony of her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi to the welcoming crowds gathered on the road. Amid deafening cheers and chants, thousands of people, mostly AL adherents, waved back to the party chiefwho alternated between smiles and tears. Hasina was accompanied by her relatives and guarded by security officials, mainly from the Rapid Action Battalion. She said simply: "I am well," in response to a shouted question from a reporter on the crowded road. Many AL leaders and workers chanted slogans"Sheikh Hasina", "Sheikh Hasina" amid the flashes of rolling cameras and in the presence of about 100 journalists on the scene. Hasina was arrested at Sudha Sadan in a predawn, rain-marked operation on July 16 last year and was taken to special jail after an appearance in court. Hasina will stay at Sudha Sadan until she leaves for the US for better medical treatment, AL leaders said. bdnews24.c
