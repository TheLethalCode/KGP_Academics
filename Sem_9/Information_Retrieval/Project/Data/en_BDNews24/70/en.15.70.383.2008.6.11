 VEVEY, Switzerland, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Raymond Domenech is considering making four changes to France's team for Friday's Euro 2008 clash with Netherlands in Berne. France started with a dull 0-0 draw against Romania in their first Group C match and need to improve against the Dutch, who romped to a 3-0 win over world champions Italy. "I'm hesitating on four positions," Domenech told reporters on Wednesday. Striker Thierry Henry and captain Patrick Vieira, sidelined by thigh injuries against Romania, could return. Henry, France's top all-time scorer with 44 goals in 100 appearances, and midfield inspiration Vieira are back in training and may replace Nicolas Anelka and Jeremy Toulalan respectively. The other two players who could be omitted are full backs Willy Sagnol and Eric Abidal, who looked sluggish in Zurich on Monday. Francois Clerc is an option at right back with Patrice Evra the favourite to step in for Abidal on the left. But Domenech said he was reluctant to change a back four considered one of the most reliable in the tournament. "I believe in stability and I believe a team's strength comes from a solid defence," he said. "I don't like to turn the defence upside down.
