 KLAGENFURT, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's Euro 2008 players who are based in Germany will have extra incentive to beat the triple European champions on Thursday, said captain Niko Kovac. "I can't imagine the stick they will have to take from their team mates when they go back to their clubs so they will be additionally motivated to win," the Croatia midfielder told a news conference on Wednesday. Kovac, who plays for Salzburg, added: "If we had lost to Austria in the opening match I would have been embarrassed going back into my club's dressing room." Croatia, who have six members of their squad playing in the Bundesliga, beat Group B rivals Austria 1-0 on Sunday and Kovac said they would take heart from that display. "The win has lifted a huge amount of pressure off our shoulders and we will take on Germany in confident mood although it won't be easy to get a result," said Kovac. CONSERVATIVE STRATEGY Coach Slaven Bilic declined to say whether he would abandon his favourite 4-4-2 formation for a more conservative strategy with a lone striker and two defensive midfielders. Most Croatian media suggest Ognjen Vukojevic is likely to start alongside Kovac to mark Germany playmaker Michael Ballack, in which case Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Darijo Srna would feed Ivica Olic up front. "My only dilemma is what formation to choose but I know exactly which players will start," said Bilic. "If we beat Germany we will definitely be strong contenders to win the tournament because whoever beats the Germans can beat any other team taking part." Croatia face Poland in their final group match in Klagenfurt on Monday, the same day Germany take on Austria in Vienna
