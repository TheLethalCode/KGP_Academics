<TEXT>
 Patuakhali, June 6 (bdnews24.com) - Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain said Friday politics in the country had to be freed of the diseases of terrorism and black money through ideals based on national unity. "Our politics has become dependent on terrorism and black money: so ideals-based politics has to be introduced through national unity," said Dr Kamal. The veteran lawyer addressed his remarks to a political seminar organised by Gano Forum in Patuakhali Old Town Hall. He called for a grassroots rejection of anyone involved in corrupt practices, terrorism or black money, and urged people to elect honest and competent candidates in the next election, which he said must take place by December this year. bdnews2
