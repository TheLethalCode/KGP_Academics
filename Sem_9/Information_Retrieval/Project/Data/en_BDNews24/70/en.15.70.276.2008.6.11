"I am happy to know she has been released," Khaleda was quoted as saying by barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon. Mahbubuddin went to the special jail Wednesday with Anticorruption Commission assistant director Noor Mohammad and Major Redwan of joint forces, who had interrogated Khaleda about the funds of Zia Orphanage Trust. Khaleda demanded that her two sonsalso behind barsbe sent abroad for better medical treatment, the lawyer said. Khaleda was quoted as telling the officials that she did not know anything about the funds as "she was not a member of the Trust". Her lawyers said the Trust had been established in the memory of the late president Ziaur Rahman with Tk 2.3 crore provided by an ex-Kuwaiti ameer. The anticorruption officials also questioned Khaleda's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco at the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka gave permission to interrogate Khaleda and her two sons Monday following an appeal.
