 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  India put an end to Pakistan's 12-match unbeaten run, scoring a massive 140-run win against their archrivals in the second match of the Kitply one-day international series at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. Pacer Proveen Kumar (4/53) ripped through Pakistan top order while leg spinner Piyush Chawla (4/40) wrapped the tail as Pakistan, chasing India's imposing 330/8, saw their innings fold at 190 all out with 14.2 overs to spare. It was the biggest win for India against Pakistan in term of runs since their previous biggest win of 87 runs came in 2005 in Kotchi, Kerala, India. Pakistan had started their impressive unbeaten run11 wins against Zimbabwe and Bangladeshafter beating India last November on Indian soil and also stopped by the same opponents on Bangladesh turf. Kumar, playing in his sixth ODI, ran through Pakistan's top order to reduce them to 26 for three inside fifth over and Pakistan never recovered the damage though Kamran Akmal and Mishab-ul-Haq showed some signs of a comeback in the match. Kumar struck double in successes deliveries sending back in-form opener Salman Butt (9) and one-down Younis Khan (0) in two successive deliveries of his third over and was on hat-trick, and Mohammad Yousuf (22) denied him, but did not avert himself from being the third victim of the 21-year old pacer. Akmal and Mishah then played some stroke-filed shots to take Pakistan to 81 for four before Kumar struck again to break a quick 55-run stand between them with Akmal giving a catch to Yusuf Pathan for a 35-ball 38, featuring four fours and two sixes. Soon Misbah (24 off 28 balls) followed Akmal to be caught by Dhoni off Ishant Sharma, leaving the side at 94 for six. The defeat could have been worse if skipper Shoaib Malik had not smashed 53 off 67 balls as it was too tough for the Pakistan tail to face leg spinner Piyush Chawla, who returned four for 40 to wrap Pakistan innings. Earlier, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh struck fifties to power India to put up a magnificent total. Openers Sehwag and Gambhir justified their captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to bat first on a slow wicket putting on 155 runs for the opening stand before pacer Wahab Riaz struck a double blow to send both openers back in successive overs. But, the brisk start in the opening stand was much a credit to the Pakistani fielders, who dropped both openers thrice as Sehwag was dropped on 49 by keeper Kamran Akmal while Gambhir was dropped once on four and then on 29 by Younis Khan. Wahab drew first blood for Pakistan having Gambhir caught by Akmal in the 22nd over, and removing Sehwag in his next over to bring Pakistan back into the match. Gambir finally struck his seventh fifty to have scored a run-a-ball 62 with the help of six boundaries while Sehwag was just 11 runs short of his ninth ODI century, making 89 off 76 balls that studded 13 fours and one six. The quick dismissals made India slow and they could manage only 45 runs in the next 10 overs. Yuvraj Singh and Dhoni accelerated the run rate before Shahid Afridi dismissed debutant Yusuf Pathan (3) and Rahit Sharma (9). Dhoni played a 23-ball 24 with the help of five boundaries before Sohail Tanvir trapped the Indian captain leg before, and five balls later Yuvraj followed Dhoni to be bowled by Umal Gul, leaving the side at 271 for six in 42.5 overs. Yuvraj also departed after being bowled by pacer Umar Gul, but not before making a brisk 55 off 54 studded by three sixes and as many fours. Later, Suresh Raina (26) and Irfan Pathan (17) quick-fired to take India beyond the 300-mark as they together put on 51 runs for the seventh wicket facing just 32 balls. Both fell to pacer Umar Gul, who bagged three for 61. Afridi and Wahab took two wickets each for 52 and 86 respectively. bdn
