<TEXT>
 LJUBLJANA, June, 10 (bdnews24.com/BBC)-- The EU and the US have threatened Iran with further sanctions unless it verifiably suspends nuclear enrichment. The measures were announced after US President George W Bush held talks in Slovenia, during what is expected to be his last official tour of Europe. The "additional measures" will include "steps to ensure Iranian banks cannot... support proliferation and terrorism", said a joint statement. Mr Bush said a nuclear-armed Iran would be "incredibly dangerous" to peace. "They can either face isolation or they can have a better relationship with all of us if they verifiably suspend their nuclear enrichment programme," he said. "They've ignored the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in the past and therefore they can't be trusted with enrichment." The US president was speaking during a joint press conference with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso after the leaders' summit at Brdo Castle. Mr Bush will later travel to Germany, Italy, France, the Vatican and the UK. 'Carrot and stick' policy The 5,000-word statement urged Tehran not to continue defying a demand from the UN Security Council to stop the enrichment of uranium as part of its nuclear programme.

"We will continue to work together... to take steps to ensure Iranian banks cannot abuse the international banking system to support proliferation and terrorism." The UN Security Council has approved three rounds of sanctions against Iran. These include asset restrictions and travel bans on Iranian individuals and companies said to be involved in nuclear work. The sanctions also ban the sale to Iran of so-called dual-use items - items which can have either a military or civilian purpose. As well as Iran, his talks with EU leaders have touched on Zimbabwe, climate change, trade and energy. Mr Bush also said Turkey should be allowed to join the EU, a move which has been opposed by some EU states since Ankara started accession talks "We strongly believe Turkey should be a member of the EU, and we appreciate its democratic reforms," he said. He also said he believed a global agreement could be reached on a new fund against climate change before the end of his presidency in 2009. End business involvement Washington is now attempting to apply pressure on individual European businesses to take a harder line on Iran, the BBC's Oana Lungescu in Ljubljana says. [We] reiterate our belief that a mutually satisfactory, negotiated solution remains open to Iran Draft joint EU-US statement Barclays Bank, based in the UK, has already responded to such pressure and ended all dealings with Iran's Saderat Bank and Bank Melli, which are on the US list of Specially Designated Nationals. All US businesses trading with anyone on the SDN list must block their accounts immediately and end any business involvement. Tehran meanwhile has told Iranian banks to transfer assets and investments from European banks to Iran's central bank. Observers say the move is not only to escape economic sanctions, but also part of a wider government plan to create a huge pan-Iranian bank run on Islamic principles. The warning of sanctions is a stick Washington is keen to wield, but it is ready to give the carrot one more try, our correspondent says. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana will go to Iran on Sunday with a "refreshed" offer of economic and political incentives. "We affirm the dual track strategy on this issue which was reinforced by the incentives package and reiterate our belief that a mutually satisfactory, negotiated solution remains open to Iran," the summit draft statement adds. 'No illusions' As EU leaders prepare to bid goodbye to Mr Bush, they want to focus on what unites Europe and the US, our correspondent says. They are expected to call for an end to state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe and to urge the UN secretary general to immediately send a team to monitor human rights. But on some key challenges like climate change, no-one is predicting a breakthrough, she adds. The US ambassador to the EU, C Boyden Gray, has warned Europeans not to have any illusions that Washington's position will change "magically" with a new president. The EU has sought to lead the way by pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, while the US wants any global agreement on climate change to include commitments by fast-growing economies, such as India and China. Ahead of the summit, Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel made reference to the possible tensions, telling reporters: "As in all relationships, the EU and US sometimes have different views."
