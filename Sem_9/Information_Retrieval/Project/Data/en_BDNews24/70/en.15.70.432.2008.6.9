 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com Chittagong bureau Chittagong, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Importers of reconditioned cars were in for a shock as the new budget proposed major changes to the conditions of eligibility for reconditioned vehicles, in order to prevent imports of new vehicles in the guise of used vehicles. These new conditions, an overall increase in duty and reduction of dealer commissions, contained in the proposed budget, mean most types of vehicles will be more expensive to buy. Businessmen say there is no scope for a fall in prices at any level of the car marketthough microbuses get a good deal. The budget proposes reducing the supplementary duty on import of ordinary non-luxury microbuses, with capacities between 1500cc to 1800cc, used for transportation of industrial raw material and passengers, from 60 percent to 20 percent. Luxury vehicles, however, will be costlier: the budget has proposed readjusting the supplementary duties of 60, 100, 250 and 350 percent on vehicles having higher displacement capacity. The new budget also proposes reducing the dealer's commission from 30 percent to 20 percent alongside the readjustment of year-wise depreciation rates as 5, 10, 20 and 30 percent respectively. But the future market for reconditioned vehicles will be affected most and buyers' pockets will feel the keenest impact, say importers. The new budget has proposed massive changes to what vehicles may fall into the 'reconditioned' duty bracket. Currently, a car registered abroad for a minimum of 120 days may be imported as reconditioned. The new budget raises the time between registration and deregistration before import to a minimum of 365 days, and the vehicles must clock at least 1,000 km before shipment to be considered as 'reconditioned'. BARVIDA, an organisation of used car importers, see this as a victory for dealers of new cars. Importers of new cars will benefit most as a result of these changes, they say. Nevertheless, importers of reconditioned cars, who brought in record numbers of used vehicles in the month leading up to the budget, will reap some benefit in the short term from the increase in duty. Used car importers, anticipating an increase in duty, brought in thousands of vehicles in the two weeks leading up Monday's budget announcement. The port authorities are facing a logistical nightmare with the huge number of cars due to space constraints. According to Chittagong Customs statistics, 2,566 cars were imported in April last year and 1,736 were imported in the following month of May. This year, 4,716 cars have been imported in April and 3,736 in May. BARVIDA secretary general Abdul Hamid Sharif told bdnews24.com, following the announcement of the new budget: "Both old and new car prices will increase. However, due to new import conditions the business of reconditioned vehicles will be affected most." A leading Chittagong importer Mahbubul Haque Babar told bdnews24.com: "As the middle classes buy the most reconditioned cars, they will be the most affected as a result of the new conditions in the proposed budget." From now on the chance of getting a good reconditioned vehicle at a low price would be much slimmer, he saidadding that the prices of all types of vehicles except microbus would increase. Importer Shahidul Islam said as a result of the new budget the number of car buyers would go down. He said fixing the new timeframe for reconditioned vehicles was not a good decision for buyers. bdnews24.
