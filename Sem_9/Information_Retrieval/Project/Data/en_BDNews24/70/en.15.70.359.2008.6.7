 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League observed the historic date of June 7 on Saturday, in remembrance of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's official announcement on this day in 1966of the six-point charter for liberation from Pakistan. Awami League, the party which led the liberation war, began the day by laying floral tributes at Sheikh Mujib's portrait at the Bangabandhu Museum in Dhanmondi, after which AL presidium members stood for one minute in silent remembrance. Awami League front organisations joined them. A remembrance programme was later held at the Awami League central office. In a message marking the occasion, AL acting President Zillur Rahman expressed respect to the memory of the martyrs of 'six-point movement'. On June 7, hartal (general strike) was observed throughout the then East Pakistan to realise the six point-charter for liberation announced by Sheikh Mujib on the day. Eleven people were shot dead by the Pakistan police during the hartal. Sheikh Mujib first placed a six-point demand at a meeting of political parties in Lahore on Feb 2, 1966 for the autonomy of East Pakistan. General Ayub Khan termed the six point demands a 'conspiracy of the secessionists' against Pakistan, taking a severe stand against it. Sheikh mobilised support in favour of the 6-point demand throughout East Pakistan and later, on Mar 1 the same year, an Awami League council in Dhaka decided on the six-point demand as the charter for freedom and self-rule of the Bangalees. The six-point charter was one of the major movements ahead of the liberation war of 1971. The 1969 mass upsurge, 1970 election and 1971 liberation war and independence of Bangladesh was a culmination of the struggle that the six point charter ignited. bdnew
