 Prodip Choudhury and Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Correspondents Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  All legal barriers have been removed to clear the way for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to go abroad for better medical treatment, her lawyer Barrister Shafiq Ahmed said Sunday. "All Sheikh Hasina now needs is an order from the government," the lawyer told reporters after the special judge's court-2 on the Jatiya Sangsad complex heard an appeal. The appeal seeks to spare Hasina from a legal binding to appear in court in person in the barge-mounted power plants corruption case. The court is expected to rule on the appeal Monday. "We will get a written order from the court tomorrow," said Shafiq, also Supreme Court Bar Association president. The court received the appeal, according to Shafiq, in line with the recommendations of a medical board formed to examine Hasina's health. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the special judge's court-1 discussed the matter with the lawyers of state and defence sides in his chamber at 5.45pm. Hasina's lawyer advocate Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com, "We have appealed to the court to exempt Sheikh Hasina from personal appearance in court in the barge mounted power plants case." Hasina's another lawyer advocate Abdul Mannan Khan said: "Sheikh Hasina is seriously ill. She needs better treatment abroad." On other cases, Barrister Shafiq said the trial of the Niko scam case did not beginthe reason no appeal was necessary in the case. Hasina received bail in the MiG-29 case and an extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. Meanwhile, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Sunday deferred a hearing to June 12 on Hasina's appeal to get back her passport from the police. Magistrate Abdullah Al Mamun reset the hearing after defence lawyers sought more time as main lawyers were not present in court, sub-inspector Md Yusuf told bdnews24.com. Hasina's lawyers Sahara Khatun and Quamrul Islam said they could not attend the CMM's court because they were busy handling the Niko case in the special court on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Dhanmondi police seized Hasina's passport when she was arrested on July 16 last year. On March 6, Hasina appealed to a court seeking an order to return her valuables. Earlier, barrister Shafiq, advocate Shahara Khatun, barrister Fazle Noor Tapash went to the special jail and met with Hasina. After the meeting with Hasina, they went to the special judge's court. bdnews24.com
