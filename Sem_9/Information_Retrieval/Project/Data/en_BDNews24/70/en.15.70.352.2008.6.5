 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal and two others Thursday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging some provisions of the emergency powers rules. The appeal challenged the provisions of the emergency powers rules that "deny people the right to bail". Two other petitioners are Nurul Kabir, editor of New Age, and Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, an assistant professor of Dhaka University. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Nurul Kabir said: "Any rule to revoke the people's right to bail is against the constitution, rule of law and even the original emergency ordinance." "One is innocent until the one is proved guilty in a court," he said. Barrister Amir-ul Islam led the filing of the appeal on behalf of the petitioners with the bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Md Rezaul Haque. The petitioners sought a rule nisi asking the government to explain why some sections of Emergency Powers Ordinance and Emergency Powers Rules would not be declared unconstitutional. Law and home secretaries were made respondents. bdnew
