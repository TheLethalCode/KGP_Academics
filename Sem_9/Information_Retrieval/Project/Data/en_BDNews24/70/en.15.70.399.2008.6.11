 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina made one comment to reporters on her release from special jail Wednesday, saying: "I am well." She returned to her Sudha Sadan home from jail Wednesday, having been released from jail for medical treatment, after spending 11 months behind bars. The former prime minster has been released for an eight week period, leaving the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises amid tight security at a quarter to two and arriving at her Dhamondi home around 2.30pm. On the way to her Sudha Sadan, the Awami League president stopped at the Bangabandhu Museum, on Dhanmondi 32 to lay a floral tribute at her father's portrait. Donning a Tangail saree, she sat for some time in her childhood bedroom; her aunt Khadiza Begum accompanied her. A home ministry order was earlier issued to release Hasina for eight weeks until Aug 6, inspector general of prisons, Brig Gen Zakir Hasan, told bdnews24.com. The IG said he had received the temporary release order just before noon. When asked whether there were any conditions over Hasina's seeking treatment overseas while released on bail, he said there were no such conditions. "She may go wherever she pleases for treatment, including overseas." "But the government may cancel this order at any time, giving no reason," he added. Hasina is expected to fly to North America for treatment tomorrow on a British Airways flight. Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Noor Taposh said there was no possibility of the Awami League president presiding over any party meeting before her flight out of Dhaka. bdnews24.c
