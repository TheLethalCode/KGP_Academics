 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh observed World Environment Day Thursday, with the government urging all to take steps to increase awareness on environmental issues for curbing environmental hazards and tackling the risks of climate change. World Environment Day, conceived in 1972, is the United Nations' principal day to mark global green issues and aims to give a human face to environmental problems and solutions. The focus this year is 'Towards a Low-Carbon Economy.' The government launched a two-day programme in the capital, beginning with a colourful procession in front of the National Museum at 7am. The programme includes an environmental award ceremony, inauguration of a two-day environment fair at the Osmani Memorial premises and a prize-winning art contest for children at Shishu Academy. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed both issued messages marking the day. "Excessive dependence of humans on fossil fuels is boosting the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These emissions result in environmental degradation, exacerbation of global warming trends and climate change, which impacts overall economic development adversely," said president Iajuddin. The chief adviser, in his message, said: "Climate change is a crucial issue today at the individual, social, national and international levels." "We must take up various mitigating programmes, including curbing the use of harmful gases and fossil fuels, and address environmental pollution to protect the climate." "Everybody should be more aware and careful about protecting the environment," said Fakhruddin. Dhaka University's department of geography and environment also organised a parade and a seminar in association with Oxfam-GB, Bangladesh. Speakers at the seminar said Bangladesh has become one of the countries worst affected by climate change, and must take measures such as adopting low carbon technologies and renewable energies. They also stressed the need for raising awareness about carbon emissions and addressing the severe shortage of researchers in the field of earth sciences. The UN has earmarked World Environment Day to raise awareness of the issues worldwide and ensure enhanced global participation in environment-friendly economic development. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday that global warming was becoming the defining issue of the era and will hurt rich and poor alike. "Our world is in the grip of a dangerous carbon habit," Ban said in a statement to mark the day, which is being observed by events around the globe and hosted this year by the city of Wellington in New Zealand. "Whether you are an individual, an organisation, a business or a government, there are many steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint. It is a message we all must take to heart," he said. "Addiction is a terrible thing. It consumes and controls us, makes us deny important truths and blinds us to the consequences of our actions," he said in his speech to reinforce this year's theme of 'CO2: Kick the Habit'. bdnews24.com/mhc
