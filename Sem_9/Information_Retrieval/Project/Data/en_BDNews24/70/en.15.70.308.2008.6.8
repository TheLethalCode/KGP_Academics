 DONETSK, Ukraine, Sun Jun 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gas explosion at a colliery in Ukraine's Donbass coalfield on Sunday left 37 miners missing after it destroyed the mine shaft, making rescue attempts very difficult, officials said on Sunday. The blast occurred at about 5 a.m. local time, about 1 km underground, shattering installations at the Karl Marx pit in Donetsk region, the heart of the coalfield. Marina Nikitina, spokeswoman for the regional mine safety inspectorate, said 37 men were missing. Four miners working on the surface at the time of the explosion had been injured. "The shaft has been destroyed. It is impossible to go below," she said. "The blast was very powerful. It shattered windows in the mine's administrative office and damaged the paneling of a lift." Gas explosions are a frequent occurrence in Ukraine's outdated mines, many of which are loss-making and date from the 19th century. The Karl Marx mine in Yenakiyevo, northeast of Donetsk, has been in operation for 110 years. The mine was one of 23 where work was suspended to check on documented violations of safety procedures and only restoration and repair work was permitted. Sources close to the industry said such work was being conducted at the Karl Marx colliery on Sunday and dangerous levels of gas concentrations had been detected before the blast. Ukrainian coal miners were among the shock troops of forces seeking change in the dying days of communism, but post-Soviet authorities have repeatedly come under pressure to close the pits. Eleven miners died in the last explosion to hit the Donbass coalfield two weeks ago. Three explosions at the Zasyadko mine in Donetsk late last year killed 106 men in two weeks
