 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands coach Marco van Basten is still unsure when Arjen Robben will be fit to play at Euro 2008. The Dutch winger missed the team's opening Group C match, a 3-0 victory over world champions Italy in Berne on Monday, after injuring his groin in training. "It looks like he will need less time to recover than the seven to 10 days I said previously but I cannot say when he will play," Van Basten told reporters on Wednesday. The match against France in Berne on Friday will come too soon for Robben but he could be back for the final group game against Romania at the same venue four days later. Defender Mario Melchiot, who has been sidelined by a pelvic problem, continues to train alone while striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar missed Wednesday's session with a minor calf injury. Van Basten said he would probably adjust his tactics against Les Bleus. "When France are in possession of the ball our positional play will have to change," said the coach. "But that is only a matter of changing some minor aspects. "Our good start did not only give us a good feeling it also increased the respect for us from our upcoming opponents." The Dutch top the group with three points, two more than France and Romania
