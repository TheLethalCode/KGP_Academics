 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Centre for Policy Dialogue said the newly announced budget expenditure is not too large, but has questioned the government's revenue targets, in the think-tank's annual budget analysis broadcast live on Tuesday. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman, speaking at the Brac Inn Centre, said the government's proposed Tk 100,000 crore budget was not too large compared to the outgoing year's budget, especially taking inflation into account. But he said it could be difficult to finance given the resources detailed in the finance adviser's budget speech on Monday. Mustafizur said the budget aimed to widen the tax net, but pointed to the lack of details in the proposed budget on how this would be achieved. Direct tax was a very low percentage of total tax revenue, Mustafizur said. If direct taxes could have been increased, then tax coverage could have been decreased among low income and the poor, in line with the overall social welfare focus of the proposed budget, said the economist. Income tax and VAT could both have been increased to achieve this, said Mustafizur . bd
