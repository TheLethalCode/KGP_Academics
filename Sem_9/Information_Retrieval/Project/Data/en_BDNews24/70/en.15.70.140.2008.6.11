<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Founder and chairperson of non-governmental organisation BRAC, Fazle Hasan Abed, raised questions Wednesday over the competence of teachers at state-run primary schools. The quality of education at BRAC schools was at present better than at government-run primary schools, Abed told journalists at a press conference at Hotel Sheraton. He said BRAC had the capability to train even those who held Masters degrees to be better teachers, as "higher degrees" do not always produce good teachers. "There is no guarantee that persons holding Honours or Masters degrees will be good teachers. Training is a must to be a good teacher." Abed said previous governments had appointed large numbers of poor-quality teachers in exchange for money and had done great harm to the education system. He defended the government's decision to work with BRAC to impart training to taechers at government primary schools in 20 upazilas. Three different associations of government primary school teachers have been opposing the government's move, saying BRAC does not ensure the quality of the teachers serving at its own non-formal schools. The minimum qualification for a BRAC non-formal primary school teacher is a secondary school certificate, while no undergraduate can even apply for a teaching post at government primary schools. On opposition from the teachers, Abed said he would sit with the associations to sort out their differences. "We will invite [the associations] to hold talks next week. I think we can resolve the problem," said the BRAC chief. BRAC, considered the largest NGO in the world, operates 37,500 non-formal primary schools with 1.2 million studentsless than 7 percent of the total students enrolled at state-run primary schools. The NGO also provides four years of 'non-formal primary education', or basic education, to older children who do not go to school. "It is the responsibility of the government to ensure primary education. But we want to work as an additional factor to educate the dropped out students," said Abed. He said the government had not vested any administrative duty to BRAC to run or manage the government primary schools. "We want to ensure that BRAC will not interfere with any of the administrative affairs of the schools. The government has only vested the duty of improving the quality of the teachers," said Abed. Coming down heavily on past political governments, the BRAC chief said, "Both the BNP and the Awami League governments have appointed poor-quality teachers in exchange for money," he said. "There are some candidates who simply do not possess the qualities to be teachers. But they have been serving in the government primary schools". He added, however, that he had maintained good relations with all governments. bdn
