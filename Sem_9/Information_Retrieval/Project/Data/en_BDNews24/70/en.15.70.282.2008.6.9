<TITLE> Bangladesh exit from SAFF Championship </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Last year's runners-up Bangladesh made an early exit from the 5th SAFF Championship when they went one goal down to hosts Sri Lanka in Group B final encounter at Sugathadasa Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka Sunday. Bangladesh, three times finalists, also walked out from the group stage in the inaugural SAFF Championship in Katmandu, Nepal in 1997. With the second triumph in three matches, Sri Lanka emerged Group B champions to set their semifinal clash against co-hosts Maldives while the Group B runners, Bhutan, who beat Afghanistan 3-1 in day's first match, will play the semifinal against Group A champions India. It was the second defeat for Bangladesh to Sri Lanka in 10 matches they had played against the island nation. After the barren first half, Romi capitalising on a corner kick slammed the ball home from inside the box. His harmless grounder finally kissed the far post getting a defection of Bangladesh defender Ariful Islam. Otherwise, it would have gone to the safe hands to Bangladesh keeper Biplob Bhattacharya. Without two key players, medio Arif Khan Joy and striker Jahid Hasan Emily, the 2003 champions Bangladesh seemed helpless against the Lankans in their must-win match to see themselves in the last fours. Last year's runners-up Bangladesh could hardly put any impact on the hosts, who enjoyed the superior ball procession and controlled the midfield throughout the game. It seemed that the booters' legs were tired and they had hardly run to create any scoring chances while the defenders were totally busy to foil the Sri Lankans attacks. It would not have been surprising had Sri Lanka scored at least three goals against Bangladesh, but their strikers missed the target miserably from close ranges. Bangladesh drew against Bhutan 1-1 in their Group opener and played a 2-2 draw against Afghanistan in the second match. bd
