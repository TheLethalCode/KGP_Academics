<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) A special court dealing with the Niko graft case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina pushed back a hearing on charge framing Tuesday to June 16. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of Special Judge's Court-2, located on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises, deferred the proceedings after defence lawyers sought more time. Hasina did not appear in court Tuesday as the judge had exempted her the previous day from appearing personally in hearings, to clear the way for the former prime minister to seek medical treatment overseas, said her lawyer Fazle Noor Taposh. Also accused in the case, former energy secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury and former state minister for power Rafiqul Islam were produced in court. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year, and pressed charges on May 7, charging the accused of approving a deal with Niko Resources Ltd without following proper procedures, and thus costing the state Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses, during Hasina's premiership in 2001. The case alleged that Canadian firm Niko was "inefficient" in different aspects of its operations, including technical know-how for gas and oil exploration. bdnews24.com/pc/ff/
