 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)The finance adviser Monday proposed to allocate Tk 540 crore in cash subsidy to the farm sector in the next fiscal year to cut pressure from a increase of diesel prices. In the outgoing fiscal year, Tk 250 crore was distributed in cash subsidy among 65,93, 872 farmers having land holding of 45,63,000 acres across 484 upazilas. And in the next fiscal year, the target for disbursement of agricultural credit has been fixed at Tk 9,000 crore. "Global food production has not increased commensurate with the scale of demand. This applies to Bangladesh as well," the adviser said in his new budget speech. In the last budget speech, Mirza Aziz had created an endowment fund of Tk 350 crore to strengthen research to increase agricultural productivity. "The government is taking steps to put in place a set of policies to minimise misuse of arable lands and to bring fallow lands under cultivation," he said. "Under this policy, steps will also be taken to build compact townships to ease the pressure on agricultural land arising from the growing population," he said. "Although we have not enhanced the fuel price, we have, for the first time, provided cash subsidy to the farmers using diesel-powered irrigation pumps as an incentive," Mirza Aziz said. "Efforts are underway to formulate upazila-based action plans for increased production of all kinds of crops. To bring about increased agricultural production, there are no alternatives but to strengthen efforts to innovate and apply HYV, ensure availability of quality seeds, introduce integrated crop management and widen irrigation facilities," said Mirza Aziz. "To support this, the government will take short-term and long-term measures. Apart from the regular allocation for agricultural extension and research, I propose to allocate Tk 272.35 crore in the development and non-development budget for agricultural development assistance and rehabilitation." In the current fiscal year, there was a target to disburse agricultural credit to the tune of Tk 8,308 crore through banks and financial institutions including Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshai Krishi Unnayan Bank. Against this, Tk 6,731 crore has been disbursed until April 2008, which is 81 percent of the target and a 57 percent increase in disbursement from the previous year. bd
