 BELGRADE, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Serbian bank clerk who stole nearly 1.5 million euros from his bank left a note reading "I'm sorry," buried the loot in a park and waited at a cafe for police to arrest him. Aleksandar Spasic walked out of the Raiffeisen branch office in the central town of Kragujevac with the money stuffed in his briefcase, state news agency Tanjug reported Monday. "I am sorry, but I had to do it," said the note he left for his boss. Police found the money buried in six holes in a nearby park. Spasic was arrested Saturday at a cafe after he called police and asked: "How long do I have to wait for you?" Police said Spasic was still being questioned Monday. His motive was not immediately clear.
