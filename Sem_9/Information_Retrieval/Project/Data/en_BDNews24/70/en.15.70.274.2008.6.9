 MUMBAI, Mon Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The first monsoon rains of the year pounded Mumbai over the weekend, killing at least five people, submerging roads, toppling trees and flooding the offices of city leaders who had said Mumbai was prepared for the weather. Although Mumbai is trying to build itself into a global financial centre, parts of it tend to crumble come the monsoon. Walls and other bits of buildings collapsed and crushed two people in different parts of the city on Sunday, the Mumbai Mirror reported. Three other people were killed on Saturday, either crushed or electrocuted, the Press Trust of India said. Thirteen flights into Mumbai were diverted to distant cities, while many more were delayed by up to an hour. There were occasional powercuts. Roads became impassable rivers, and pedestrians became waders. Then, on Saturday, dreaded news came: the city's suburban railways, which ferry millions of people every day, had come to a standstill. "People start crying," Nishikant Kulkarni, an assistant engineer at the city's disaster management offices, said by telephone. "They have to go to their houses after finishing their office work and the railways stop and they start panicking." There have been steady showers since Thursday, but the city's weather department officially declared the monsoon had rolled into town on Saturday, a few days earlier than usual. Since then, around 10cm of rain has fallen on the city each day. "It's on the higher side," C.V.V. Bhadram, the head of the city's weather office, said by telephone. Some of that rain has poured through the ageing roof of the offices of the city's municipal authority, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is charged with readying the city for the monsoon. Local newspapers showed little sympathy. "Forget saving the city from floods, the BMC cannot even keep its own house in order during the monsoon," the Times of India said on its front page, alongside photographs of filing cabinets draped in tarpaulins and brimming buckets placed under leaks. Varsha Agakar, who works in the BMC press office, confirmed there had been "minor" leakages. "But still we are working," she added cheerfully. After weeks of intense heat, many Mumbaikars visibly relished the rains' arrival. Children splashed and squealed. Couples took slow strolls in the drizzle. Hundreds of people crowded onto promenades to watch a stormy Arabian Sea smash against the city. Some people even saw the bright side of flooding. "I must admit the BMC's inefficiency gives us a reason sometimes to enjoy a day at home because you just cannot commute and reach office," said Natasha Vyland, who works at an advertising firm. But memories of the 2005 monsoon, which killed more than 300 people in the city, still lend an ominous note to the rains. Many residents are following police advice to stow a hammer in their car in case they should find themselves submerged and needing to smash their way to safety
