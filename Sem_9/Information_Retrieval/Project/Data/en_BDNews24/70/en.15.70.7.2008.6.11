<TEXT>
 SEEKIRCHEN, Austria, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece players said on Wednesday they must beat Russia in their next game at Euro 2008 for the holders to have any hope of making the last eight. Though Greece would not mathematically be out of the finals if they failed to win Saturday's Group D game, their 2-0 defeat by Sweden on Tuesday has clearly put them under huge pressure. "We are with our backs against the wall and on Saturday we play our last hand for qualification," goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis told reporters. "We will not make any excuses for our performance yesterday but what we can promise is you will see a different team on Saturday against Russia." Greece failed to carve out a single chance and clearly disappointed some 10,000 Greek fans in Salzburg's Wals-Siezenheim stadium. Playing with five at the back and a lone striker, they allowed Sweden to take control of the game. "Now we must attack against Russia because they will as well," captain Angelos Basinas said. "We don't have the luxury or time to wait for them to come to us. This match is it, and we have no other option." He said the Sweden game had highlighted weaknesses in the team which coach Otto Rehhagel and the players tried to fix. "Our biggest problem was organising our game. It was not stamina or speed. We need to change that against Russia," Basinas said. "You will see a different team on Saturday." Basinas also said drawing parallels with the championship-winning team of 2004 was not fair to the players. Greek media have heavily criticised the performance, saying it was not worthy of a team that wants to defend its title. "You cannot compare 2004 with 2008. They are two different things because many things have changed," Basinas said. "Because we won it then does not mean we can do it every time. There are seven or eight players from the team still around but everyone is new to such a major tournament." Adding to the stakes versus the Russians is the fact that the Greeks' final group game will be against a very impressive Spain side, who crushed Russia 4-1
