<TITLE> Croatia are dangerous opponents, says Germany's Loew </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KLAGENFURT, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's next Euro 2008 opponents Croatia are dangerous up front and will be a strong challenge to his side, coach Joachim Loew said on Wednesday. "They're a very refined team, very strong defensively they also have dangerous players in attack," he told reporters. Germany top Group B after a 2-0 victory over Poland while Croatia also have three points from their 1-0 win over co-hosts Austria giving Thursday's game in Klagenfurt an extra edge. "Croatia had a very strong qualifying campaign which says a lot about the strength of the team," said Loew. Croatia, who have six squad members in the Bundesliga, beat England twice to reach the finals ahead of Russia. The Group B winners at Euro 2008 face the Group A runners-up in the last eight and, with Portugal topping their section with six points, Germany would likely avoid them by finishing first. However, asked if he was worried about facing any particular opponents in the quarter-finals, Loew told reporters: "I'm not thinking about whether we will win the group, we just want to qualify. Our goal is to win the next match"
