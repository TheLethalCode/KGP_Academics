 GENEVA, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Group A favourites Portugal made a winning start to Euro 2008 by beating Turkey 2-0 in an entertaining match on Saturday. A fine attacking movement begun by Cristiano Ronaldo on the left ended with defender Pepe charging forward, exchanging passes with striker Nuno Gomes and racing into the box to scuff the ball past Volkan Demirel for the opening goal on 61 minutes. The Brazilian-born defender also headed the ball into the net in the first half, only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. The Portuguese wrapped up victory three minutes into injury time when Joao Moutinho bore down on goal before feeding substitute Raul Meireles, who knocked the ball into the net with the helpless Volkan out of his goal. "I can hardly describe the emotion I felt (when I scored), especially after the disallowed effort," Pepe told reporters. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said the victory meant his side were halfway towards reaching the quarter-finals. "We are on the right path," said the Brazilian. "We won the match and are 50 percent towards qualification. "We needed six points so 50 percent after one match is excellent." Portugal had the lion's share of chances at the Stade de Geneve although Turkey regularly posed a threat to Ricardo's goal. CURLING CROSS Nuno Gomes hit the woodwork for the second time in the match when he headed on to the bar minutes after the first goal following a curling cross by Ronaldo. The dangerous Ronaldo had almost put Portugal in front in the 38th minute when his free kick from way out on the left skidded off the turf and hit the far post. The ball might have gone in if the diving Volkan had not got a slight touch. Turkey created several half-chances from fast breaks in the early stages. Tuncay Sanli went down in the Portuguese box as he chased a cross from the right but referee Herbert Fandel was quick to wave play on and admonish the forward. Early in the second half Turkey had a penalty appeal turned down when Nihat Kahveci went down under a challenge. In Portugal's next attack Simao Sabrosa was fouled by Gokhan Zan just outside the box, the ball running free for the luckless Nuno Gomes to strike the post with the net at his mercy. "It would be great if we play really well against Czech Republic (in Geneva on Wednesday) because then we will have advanced to the next phase," added Scolari. "We wanted a bit of breathing space, a bit of leeway, and that's what we got today
