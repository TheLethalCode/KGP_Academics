 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Four cabinet members sat with Sheikh Hasina and other Awami League leaders at Sudha Sadan Wednesday night, hours after the former prime minister had been released from jail. In a change of mind, the AL decided to join dialogue with the government. The caretaker government advisers who sat in talks with the AL are AF Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Quader, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Hossain Zillur Rahman. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman will lead the process of the dialogue, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a meeting of the party's central working committee at Hasina's home in Dhanmondi. Hasina presided over the meeting. "The Awami League president thinks the dialogue is a continuous process. She has been released for two months and the acting president of the party will lead the process of the dialogue in her absence," Ashraful said. Hasina will join in, after she comes back from abroad, according to the party decision. Ashraful said Hasina had expressed concern over the soaring prices of essential commodities. The former prime minister said the government cannot impose tax on people without parliament, according to details of the ALCWC meeting. "There has been deviation from this twice. I hope there won't be a repeat of it," Hasina was quoted as saying. bdn
