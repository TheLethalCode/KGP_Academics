 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami announced Sunday that it would not go to dialogue with the government, while the party's chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia remained behind bars. Jamaat's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, at a press conference at the party's Moghbazar office, stated: "We will not participate in the government dialogue without the release of ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami and alliance leader Khaleda Zia." He also spoke in favour of Sheikh Hasina's release, saying neither could the dialogue be successful without the Awami League president. Mojaheed warned: "The present government is working beyond its raech. The consequences will not be good." "We are seeing some bad omens. The Jatiya Sangsad election is becoming more uncertain due to the actions of the government and the Election Commission." Mojaheed also claimed that though the judiciary has been separated from the executive, "the door to justice is being shut at a hint from invisible powers". "The state of emergency has blocked people's fundamental rights. As a result, bail is not available in even bailable cases." Jamaat announced a five-point programme demanding freedom for Nizami and Khaleda Zia. bdnews
