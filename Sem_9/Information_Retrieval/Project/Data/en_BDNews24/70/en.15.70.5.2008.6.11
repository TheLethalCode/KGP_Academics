 HARARE, Wed Jun 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's party said on Wednesday it would deploy more war veterans to campaign in some opposition areas ahead of a presidential election run-off marred by violence. Opposition Movement for Democratic Change leader (MDC) Morgan Tsvangirai accuses ZANU-PF of widespread attacks on his supporters ahead of the June 27 vote, but says he is still confident of victory after beating Mugabe in the first round. ZANU-PF officials in the southern Masvingo province, where the ruling party lost several parliamentary seats in rural districts traditionally considered safe, told Zimbabwe state television they had stepped up their campaign against "troublesome spots where MDC structures had taken root". "We are setting up units of war veterans to go to those areas to fan out the MDC, to campaign for President Mugabe, to confront and talk to some company managers who are openly supporting these MDC structures," said retired Major Alex Mudavanhu, ZANU-PF chairman for Masvingo. "We are going to tell people that ZANU-PF is not going to lose this election," he said. Mugabe's guerrilla fighters from the 1970s independence war and ruling party youth brigades are regularly deployed as political shock troops against the opposition and have recently been threatening another bush war if Mugabe loses. ECONOMIC COLLAPSE Mugabe's support has been eroded by the economic collapse of the once prosperous country that he has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980. On Wednesday, Mugabe's government announced tax cuts for the low paid. Tsvangirai says Zimbabweans cannot afford Mugabe's rule any further. He accused ZANU-PF activists on Tuesday of killing 66 opposition supporters to try to intimidate them ahead of the run-off. Mugabe's party denies waging a war against its foes and says "MDC thugs" have killed a number of ZANU-PF activists, including war veterans. Zimbabweans hope the run-off will start recovery from economic ruin that has brought 165,000 percent inflation, 80 percent unemployment, chronic food and fuel shortages and has sent millions fleeing to neighboring countries. Mugabe, 84, says ZANU-PF cannot lose power to an opposition backed by "white imperialists." Mugabe says the MDC enjoys the backing of Western powers out to oust him over his seizure of white-owned farms to give to landless blacks. The MDC denies the charge. Mugabe's government also says the economy has been sabotaged by the West to force him from power. An EU-US summit in Slovenia on Tuesday called on the Zimbabwe government to end what it called state-sponsored violence and urged U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to send monitors to deter further violence
