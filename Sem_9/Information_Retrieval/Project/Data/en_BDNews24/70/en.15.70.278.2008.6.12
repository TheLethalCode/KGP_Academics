 VIENNA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Midfielder Mariusz Lewandowski is a doubt for Poland's next Euro 2008 game against Austria, coach Leo Beenhakker said on Wednesday. Lewandowski had been expected to recover from an ankle injury picked up in their opening 2-0 defeat by Germany in time for Thursday's Group B match in Vienna. "It's clear these matches ask for top, fit players. He's a lot better but I don't know if it's enough," Beenhakker told a news conference. "He has much more of a chance than yesterday," said the Dutchman as he prepared his men to face an Austria side who also lost their opener 1-0 to Croatia. "Austria have again shown they are a difficult opponent to beat, many times you see teams in their own country play at a much higher level because of the atmosphere. "We realise we have another tough gamein this tournament everything is very close together in terms of level," added Beenhakker. "I can guarantee my team will be ready for it. We realise the situation, it's a match to stay in the tournament, yes or no." Poland have been unlucky with injuries since arriving at Euro 2008. Two players have been ruled out of the tournament, keeper Tomasz Kuszczak and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski, while captain Maciej Zurawski will miss the rest of the group stage
