<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  The US State Department says Bangladesh is a source and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. The US released its annual report "Trafficking In Persons" on Wednesday, reviewing human trafficking laws in 170 countries covering a period from March 2007 to March 2008. The report said childrenboth girls and boysare trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation, bonded labour, and other forms of forced labour. The government continued "lack of efforts" to protect victims of forced labour, who constitute a large proportion of trafficking victims in Bangladesh, as well as adult male victims of trafficking, the report said. "Some children are sold into bondage by their parents, while others are coerced into labour or commercial sexual exploitation through fraud and physical coercion," the report said. Women and children from Bangladesh are also trafficked to India and Pakistan for sexual exploitation, it said. According to the report, many Bangladeshi women go abroad for work and find themselves in situations of forced labour when faced with restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. Some Myanmar women who are trafficked to India transit through Bangladesh, the report said. The US report said Bangladesh did not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. "However, it was making significant efforts to do so." It said the number of criminal prosecutions increased significantly but there was a notable decrease in the number of convictions achieved. The report recommended that Bangladesh increase criminal prosecutions and punishments for all forms of labour trafficking, including those that involve fraudulent recruiting and forced child labour. It also recommended that the country improve criminal law enforcement against and punishment of complicity in trafficking and provide protection services for adult male trafficking victims and victims of forced labour. "The government of Bangladesh made uneven efforts to punish trafficking offences during the reporting period," the report said. The government arrested 76 people, started 19 investigations, and initiated 34 prosecutions for recruitment fraud, the report said. "These cases are still under investigation or trial; thus, there were no related convictions during the reporting year," said the report. During the reporting period, the government opened 123 investigations, made 106 arrests, and initiated 101 prosecutions of sex trafficking offences. "Due to the length of court cases, many are resolved through illegal out-of-court settlements between victims and traffickers," the report said. bd
