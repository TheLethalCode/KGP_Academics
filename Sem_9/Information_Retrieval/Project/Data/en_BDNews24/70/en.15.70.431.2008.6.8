<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court deferred a hearing Sunday on a writ petition challenging the validity of some sections of emergency powers rules. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahmad stayed the hearing for one week after deputy attorney general Abdus Samad Kamal sought more time from the court due to the attorney general being presently out of the country. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, New Age editor Nurul Kabir and Dhaka University assistant professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman filed the petition on June 5, challenging the EPR provisions that deny the right to bail. They challenged two sections3(3) (Kha) and 3(4)of the Emergency Powers Ordinance, and three sections11 (3), 19 (Gha) and 19 (uma)of the Emergency Powers Rules. Lawyer for the petitioners, barrister Amir-Ul-Islam, told the court Sunday that the EPR provisions constrained the balance of the constitution by denying the right to bail and eroded the power of the High Court. Amir-Ul-Islam said the provisions undermined the constitution, which has given the High Court the authority to grant bail. "The main spirit of the constitution must not be changed. But this is what has been done under the emergency powers rules." Regarding separation of the judiciary from the executive, Barrister Amir said bureaucrats had been given judicial power that was also against the constitutional spirit. On Aug 9 last year, barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq questioned the legality of a number of EPR provisions during the hearing of a petition filed by a member of the public, Abdus Kuddus Mondol of Natore. The High Court issued a rule nisi on Aug 21 last year asking why a number of EPR provisions should not be declared unconstitutional. bdnews24.
