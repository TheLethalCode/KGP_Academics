<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday proposed to exempt the income generated from multi-storied buildings in rural areas from tax for the next 10 years. Multi-storied buildings in city corporations, district headquarters, cantonment board and municipal areas under Dhaka district would not be exempted from tax, according to the proposed budget for fiscal 2008-09. Mirza Aziz in his budget speech proposed to include agro-processing industries in the list of industries enjoying tax holiday. The adviser proposed to extend the current tax exemption period by another three years to 30 June of 2011 for income from farms engaged in fisheries, poultry, cattle breeding, dairy, mushroom cultivation, silk worm production, seed production, marketing of locally produced seeds sectors and income generated from cultivation of flowers and plants. The finance adviser proposed to raise tax-free income limit for persons having no income other than agricultural income to Tk 50,000 from Tk 40,000. "This will ensure that persons having only agricultural income shall not be subject to payment of taxes for an income of up to Tk 200,000.00 and this tax free income limit would be Tk 215,000.00 for female tax-payers and elderly people exceeding 70 years of age who have only agricultural income," he said. bd
