 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court turned down a bail plea for Tarique Rahman, the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, in a bribery case relating to the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Tarique was taken to the special court, located in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, shortly before 11 in the morning, but had to return to the hospital where he is currently being held after falling sick during the charge framing proceedings. The judge previously deferred the charge framing hearing in the case on June 3, when Tarique failed to appear in court due to illness. Tarique's lawyer Khandaker Delwar Hossain, BNP's Khaleda-appointed secretary general, asked the court to grant bail Monday and clear his client of all charges. Judge Shahed Nuruddin of Special Judge's Court-3 refused the bail petition and set June 15 for the charge framing proceedings to resume. The judge also ordered the authorities to make proper arrangements for Tarique's medical treatment. Also present in court Monday were detained former home minister Lutfozzaman Babar and Bashundhara Group official Abu Sufian, also accused in the bribery case. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against Tarique, the BNP senior joint secretary general, and seven others on May 6. They stand accused of receiving approximately Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan, son of Sanbeer Basundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered on July 4, 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdnews24.com
