 VIENNA, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thursday's game between Germany and Croatia in Klagenfurt is a risk match for Euro 2008 security forces, according to an Austrian police consultant. After the detention of 157 mainly German fans in Klagenfurt on Sunday when their team beat Poland 2-0, the security focus will remain on Group B. "Germany-Croatia is seen most certainly as a risk match. Poland-Austria (on Thursday) is hard to say though it could also be one," hooligan expert Harald Mathe told Reuters on Wednesday. "This is the group where we are most likely to see such clashes, it is the highest risk group." Sunday showed police were well prepared to deal with troublemakers and that cooperation between officers and hooligan experts from other competing nations had paid off. "We saw in Klagenfurt the German police officers really know their fans very well and have acted at the right time," added Mathe. About 3,000 police were on duty in Klagenfurt at the weekend including 400 German officers. Hooligan experts classify fans in three categories. EXCESS ALCOHOL So-called 'A fans', who just want to enjoy the game, make up between 80-90 percent of supporters. 'B fans', who account for around 10 percent, can turn violent after excessive alcohol consumption or when their team are losing. 'C fans', the smallest group, use soccer as an opportunity for violence, said Mathe. "Often hooligans have bad family backgrounds where they experienced violence and where they learned conflicts are tackled or solved with violence," he added. But age also played a major role, said Mathe. "Most of them are men choke full of testosterone and need to get rid of all their energy." Law-abiding fans heading to the stadiums or fan zones have little to fear from troublemakers given the security forces available and the nature of hooliganism. "Real hooligans are only interested in other hooligans," said Mathe. "The normal fan has not much to be afraid of, though in general one thing is best, keep as far away as possible from hooligans or groups which are under the heavy influence of alcohol.
