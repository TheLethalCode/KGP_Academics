 RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil face a tough trip to group leaders Paraguay as the South American World Cup qualifying competition resumes after a seven-month break at the weekend. In other matches, Argentina, second behind Paraguay in the 10-team group, host Ecuador while Venezuela follow up their shock friendly win over Brazil by visiting Uruguay. With four of the 18 rounds of matches played, Paraguay lead with 10 points, a 0-0 draw in Peru the only blemish on their record. Argentina have nine points, one more than Brazil and Colombia and three ahead of Venezuela. Brazil coach Dunga knows that defeat in Asuncion on Sunday will leave his team five points adrift of their opponents and increase the pressure for the much-anticipated visit of Argentina next Wednesday. Paraguay have won three of their last seven meetings against the five-times world champions and believe they can pull off another win at the Defensores del Chaco. "With the quality of our players, we don't expect any result other than a win," said Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz, the English Premier League's fourth highest goal scorer with Blackburn Rovers last season. "Collectively, we're very strong and it's going to be difficult for them to beat us." Brazil, missing playmaker Kaka after he underwent a knee operation last month, suffered a demoralising 2-0 friendly defeat against Venezuela in a friendly last Friday. TROUBLED PERU Venezuela, the only South American team never to have played at the World Cup, face Uruguay in Montevideo on Saturday as they attempt to build on their famous win. It will be their first competitive international under 35-year-old coach Cesar Farias, who replaced Richard Paez last year. Uruguay coach Oscar Washington Tabarez is expected to field a three-man attack with either Sebastian Abreu or Carlos Bueno partnering Luis Suarez and Diego Forlan. Argentina host Ecuador in Buenos Aires on Sunday while Bolivia, who recently won the latest round in their battle to stage matches in La Paz at 3,600 metres above sea level, host Chile the same day. FIFA last month overturned a ban on international matches being played at over 2,750 metres above sea level following a sustained Bolivian campaign led by President Evo Morales and backed by Diego Maradona. Bolivia still have problems on the pitch where they have taken only one point and lie bottom of the standings. Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa, whose team have four points, has omitted a number of leading European-based players including Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Arturo Vidal and Inter Milan striker Luis Jimenez. The weekend's other game is in Lima on Saturday where troubled Peru face goal-shy Colombia. Peru, beaten 5-1 by Ecuador in November, warmed up with another heavy defeat, going down 4-0 to Mexico on Sunday after conceding all the goals in the first 28 minutes. They were jeered at the airport after returning home on Monday. Colombia went down to 1-0 defeats to Ireland and France in a recent European tour and have managed only three goals in four games in the group, despite winning two games
