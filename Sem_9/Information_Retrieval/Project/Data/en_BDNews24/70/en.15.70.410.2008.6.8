 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh suffered a 70-run defeat to Pakistan in the opener of the Kitply tri-nation one-day international series at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur Sunday. Bangladesh never seemed to chase the target from the beginning and eventually ended up at 163 for eight in the stipulated 40 overs. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful stuck to an end to play a patient 56 off 93 balls with Abdur Razzak on 26 off 25 balls not out. They together put on 42 runs for the unbroken ninth wicket after Bangladesh were reduced to 121 for eight in 31 overs. Shahid Afridi (3/19) and Wahab Riaz (3/22) shared six wickets to rip through Tigers' top and middle orders while Umar Gul took two tail enders. Opener Tamim Iqbal and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim chipped in with 29 and 15 respectively before both fell to Afridi. Earlier, two scintillating fifties from Salman Butt and Mohammad Yousuf powered Pakistan to a challenging total of 233 all out in 39.3 overs after being put in to bat first in the rain-curtailed day-night affairs. Pakistan got off to a brisk start making 58 runs for no loss in the first 10 overs as Bangladesh pace duo Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain failed to capitalise on the wet conditions under cloudy weather. Of 58 runs, opener Butt struck eight boundaries to make 40, while Akmal's contribution was only 17 before second-change debutant pacer Dollar Mahmud drew the first blood having Akmal caught by keeper Mushfiqur Rahiman in the last delivery of his second over. Akmal (25 off 27 balls) left the side at 75 for one in 12 overs, and one-down Younus Khan also returned to the dressing room in the next ball facing no delivery for a duck as Roqibul Hasan ran him out. Pakistan, reduced to 75 for two in 12.1 overs, seemed to rein in their game a little. Opener Butt, along with Yousuf put up 65 runs for the third wicket, before he was the third batsman out leaving Pakistan at 141 in 24.6 overs. Ashraful had brought in leg spinner Alok Kapali, in the 21st over, who brought dividends in his third over having Butt caught by Roqibul at long-on. Butt struck 70 off 84 balls, scoring over 500 runs against Bangladesh in six matches. Alok, playing his first one-dayer since his last match against Zimbabwe in 2006, struck again in one over to have Shahid Afridi and Yousuf dismissed, leaving the visitors at 180 for five in 31 overs. But Yousuf quickfired 59, for his 62nd ODI fifty, facing 56 balls and hitting seven boundaries while Afridi played a 17-ball 20. Misbah-ul-Haq hammered 39 off just 22 balls, featuring two sixes and three fours, to take Pakistan beyond 200-mark before spinner Abdur Razzak and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza took the remaining five wickets to wrap the visitors innings with three balls to go. Razzak, who took two wickets in two successive deliveries to end the Pakistan innings, returned 35 for three, while Alok grabbed three for 49. Mashrafee returned two for 36. bdnews
