 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will join dialogue with the government, according to a decision taken at the party's central working committee meeting Wednesday. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman will lead the process of the dialogue, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting at Sudha Sadan. AL president Sheikh Hasina presided over the meeting, which was held hours after she had been released from prison for medical reasons. Meantime, cabinet members AF Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Quader, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Hossain Zillur Rahman arrived at Sudha Sadan to have a meeting with Hasina. "The Awami League president thinks the dialogue is a continuous process. She has been released for two months and the acting president of the party will lead the process of the dialogue in her absence," Ashraful said. Hasina will join in, after she comes back from abroad, he said. Ashraful said Hasina had expressed concern over the soaring prices of essential commodities. The former prime minister said the government cannot impose tax on people without parliament, according to details of the ALCWC meeting. "There has been deviation from this twice. I hope there won't be a repeat of it," Hasina was quoted as saying. bdn
