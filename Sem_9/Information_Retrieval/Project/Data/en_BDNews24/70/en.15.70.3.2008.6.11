 TEHRAN, Wed Jun 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday that Western threats and pressure had failed to stop Iran's nuclear program, which the United States and others suspect is aimed at making bombs. "With God's help today (the Iranian nation) have gained victory and the enemies cannot do a damned thing," Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the western city of Shahr-e Kurd broadcast live on state television. His comments came a day after the United States and the European Union told the Islamic Republic they were ready to impose more sanctions over its nuclear activities, which Tehran says are solely aimed at generating electricity. "They've tried by military threats ... and political pressure to stop you from your luminous path but today they have seen that all their planning has failed," Ahmadinejad told the crowd. "And today the Iranian nation is standing on the nuclear height," he said. A joint communique after President George W. Bush's final summit with the 27-nation EU, in Slovenia, said both sides were ready to take additional measures on top of three rounds of United Nations sanctions imposed on Iran since late 2006. European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is due to travel to Iran at the weekend to present a new offer by major powers of incentives for it to suspend the program but he has played down prospects of a breakthrough. Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, has repeatedly ruled out giving up nuclear enrichment in exchange for trade and other benefits from world powers. Washington has pressed the EU to deny some Iranian banks access to the world financial system. European External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said on Tuesday further EU steps could entail a freeze on Iranian bank assets. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel for power plants and, if refined much further, provide material for bombs
