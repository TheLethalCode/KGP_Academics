<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government is likely to take a decision Sunday afternoon on sending former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia abroad for better medical treatment, a top official said. Also, the government may send Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for treatment. "No decision has yet been taken though. A high-level meeting may decide on the matter later in the day," inspector general of prisons Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com after a meeting with home adviser MA Matin. The home adviser, however, declined to comment. Khaleda, while appearing in court in the Niko case Sunday, expressed her unwillingness to go abroad. "I am not going anywhere. There are good physicians at home," she said. A lawyer, Abdul Mannan Khan, quoted Hasina as saying that she would travel abroad for medical treatment if the doctors suggested so. Hasina appeared in court in the barge-mounted power plant case Sunday. Asked what they had discussed at the meeting, Zakir said: "We have discussed a number of issues. But we have not come to any decision on sending them abroad." The government had formed three medical boards to examine the health of Hasina, Khaleda and Coco Thursday. The boards submitted their reports to the government. bdnews2
