 Dhaka, Jun 06 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi restaurant owners from the UK have asked the government for measures to encourage the expatriate business community to invest in the country. Visiting members of the Bangladesh Caterers' Association, UK, also expressed their interest in investing in Bangladesh tourism and the local restaurant industry, at a press briefing in Dhaka. They organised the briefing at the National Press Club Thursday to speak about a project to assist survivors of last November's Cyclone Sidr. The association's Surrey chapter, which consists of 50 restaurant owners, collected around Tk 44 lakh through charity dinners in a bid to restore the livelihoods of the Sidr-affected people in Bangladesh's southern region, said president of BCA's Surrey chapter Abdul Malik. During their visit, five BCA members, with the help of local NGO Friendship, have distributed much-needed equipment to Sidr survivors of Kuakata in Patuakhali. They distributed boats, fishing nets, power tillers and irrigation pumps to 180 families of three villages in Kolapara union. They also set up two medical centers in the area. BCA Surrey chapter's former president Mahmudur Rashid told reporters that they hoped their efforts would encourage other Bangladeshi expatriates to reach out and support the needy. Abdul Malik said the five-member BCA delegation also met foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Thursday. "We expressed our interests in investing in the Bangladeshi tourism industry and in setting up a catering institute. The adviser assured us on all kinds of cooperation in these matters," he said. The BCA delegation also asked the adviser to take initiatives to attract more investments from expatriate Bangladeshis, added Malik. bdn
