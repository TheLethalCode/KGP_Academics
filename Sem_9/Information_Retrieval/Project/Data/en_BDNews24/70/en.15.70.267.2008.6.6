 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) - Historic June 7 is to be observed Saturday; on this day in 1966, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman officially announced the six-point charter for liberation from Pakistan. He first placed the six-point demands at a meeting of political parties in Lahore on Feb 5, 1966. Later, on Mar 1 the same year, an Awami League council in Dhaka decided on the six-point demand as the charter for freedom and self-rule of the Bangalees. On June 7, hartal (general strike) was observed throughout the then East Pakistan to realise the six point-charter announced by Sheikh Mujib on the day. Eleven people were shot dead by the Pakistan army during the hartal. Awami League and other organisations have drawn up a daylong programme to mark the day. National and party flags will be hoisted at AL party offices at daybreak, followed by floral tributes placed at the portrait of Bangabandhu at the Bangababandhu Museum in Dhanmondi. A discussion meeting will be held at the AL central office at Bangabandhu Avenue at 3.30 pm. Among AL's associated organisations, Jatiya Ganotantrik League and Mehediganj Awami Forum will jointly organise a discussion in Segun Bagicha. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam have issued separate statements on the eve of the occasion, urging the party's leaders and supporters, those of its front organisations and people in general to observe the with due honour. bdne
