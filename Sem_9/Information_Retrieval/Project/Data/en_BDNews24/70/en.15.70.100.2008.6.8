<TEXT>
 Kinshasa,June 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN envoys met Congo President Joseph Kabila on Saturday and backed his plans to disarm and expel Rwandan rebels behind years of strife, and to refocus the biggest UN peace force on rebuilding his shattered nation. The ambassadors reassured Kabila the peacekeepers who have backed his army's efforts to control almost daily clashes with local militias and Rwandan Hutu rebels in eastern areas since a 1998-2003 war would not simply pack their bags and leave. "It will not happen very soon," French U.N. Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, who is leading the Security Council delegation on what has become an annual trip around Africa's trouble spots, said after the meeting. "It should not happen abruptly. There should be of course a transition, in which to pass from security re-establishment to the development of the country and that the U.N. could do something else than only sending troops for security purposes." He said Kabila wanted the peacekeeping mission, known by its French acronym MONUC, to shift its priorities from security to development as Congo tries to rebuild an economy ruined by decades of kleptocracy and violence. An estimated 5.4 million people have been killed as a result of conflict since 1998, mostly through hunger and disease. Fighting has been concentrated in the east of the vast country where Rwandan Hutu rebels known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) fled after their country's 1994 genocide of some 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates. Their presence has triggered invasions in 1996, when Rwanda and Uganda helped Kabila's father Laurent march across the country to oust late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and again two years later, when those countries fell out with their protege. Joseph Kabila became president after his father was assassinated in 2001 and five years later he won the country's first free elections in more than 40 years. Kabila told the Security Council delegation he planned "to get the rebel groups to disarm, to get the rebel groups to leave the country if they don't belong in the country, and for the ... internally displaced persons to go home," Ripert said. "We are urging the FDLR to disarm, respond to the demand of the Security Council, and talk with President Kabila so there could be a peaceful solution to this very dramatic problem of eastern Congo." Aid workers estimate nearly half a million people have fled fighting in North Kivu province in the past 18 months between the FDLR, Congolese army units, Congolese Tutsi insurgents and other local militias.
