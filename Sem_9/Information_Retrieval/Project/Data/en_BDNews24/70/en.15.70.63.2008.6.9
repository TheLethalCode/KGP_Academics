 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday proposed 20 percent dearness allowance for government employees and pensioners, effective from July 2008. The adviser also proposed to constitute a Pay Commission to review and recommend a revised pay structure of the employees of government and autonomous bodies at the beginning of the next fiscal year. The first national Pay Commission was formed in 1972. Four other Pay Commissions were formed in 1976, 1984, 1989 and 1996. In his televised budget speech, the adviser said the amount of dearness allowance for pensioners would be determined on the basis of their "un-commuted pension". In the proposed budget for fiscal 2008-09, the adviser said the government also decided to provide full festival allowance to pensioners. "The existing pay structure of the low-paid government employees is not consistent with the cost of living," he said.
