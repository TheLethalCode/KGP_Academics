<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)--Krishak Sramik Janata League president Quader Siddiqui has placed the blame for the present political crisis in the country squarely on the shoulders of Awami League and BNP. Speaking to journalists Saturday at his NAM flat residence, he said: "We want an election, a fair election. We want that un-elected people not run the country any more. Elected people should run the country." Which party contested the election, and which did not, was not the major issue, he commented. Announcing a 'dialogue' for political parties being organised by KSJL for June 10, he said: "Awami League and BNP have not been invited because many people think that they are responsible for the present situation in the country." The KSJL chief said that nearly 40 like-minded parties have been invited to the dialogue, which was being organised with the aim of overcoming the present political deadlock. He added that Jamaat-e-Islami had not been invited, and that Ershad's Jatiya Party had received an invitation though Ershad as an individual had not. "We will see many changes in the country in coming days," Quader opined. bdnew
