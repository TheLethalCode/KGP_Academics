 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed spoke to Awami League president Sheikh Hasina by phone and discussed the year-end polls with her for nearly half an hour Wednesday night, the party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com. Hasina urged the CA to create a proper environment for the elections, Ashraful said. Four cabinet members held an overnight meeting with the former prime minister at her Sudha Sadan home, hours after she had been released from prison. Fakhruddin called one of the advisers at the meeting on his mobile phone to speak to Hasina, said Ashraful. In a joint press briefing with the acting AL general secretary, adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said the meeting was the beginning of "formal dialogue" between the government and AL leaders. Other caretaker government advisers who sat in talks with the AL are AF Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Quader and Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. "There will be a series of talks between the Awami League and the government," Hossain Zillur said. In a change of mind, the AL decided to join the government dialogue led by acting party president Zillur Rahman. The decision came from a meeting of its central working committee, which was held before the talks with the cabinet members. Hasina presided over the ALCWC meeting. "The Awami League president thinks the dialogue is a continuous process. She has been released for two months and the acting president of the party will lead the process of the dialogue in her absence," Ashraful said in a separate press briefing. Hasina is expected to fly to the US Thursday morning for medical treatment. She will join the dialogue, after she returns from abroad, according to the party decision. Ashraful said Hasina had expressed concern over the soaring prices of essential commodities. The former prime minister said the government cannot impose tax on people without parliament, according to details of the ALCWC meeting. "There has been deviation from this twice. I hope there won't be a repeat of it," Hasina was quoted as saying. bdn
