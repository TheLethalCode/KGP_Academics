 VIENNA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Austria coach Josef Hickersberger said he felt the expectations of the entire nation when he contemplated the Euro 2008 co-hosts' Group B match with Poland on Thursday. After their opening 1-0 defeat by Croatia, another loss in Vienna would leave Hickersberger's men on the brink of a first-stage exit. "Of course, defeat would a be a huge disappointment for me, for the team, for every single player but also for every Austrian," Hickersberger told a news conference on Wednesday. With Poland having lost their first match against Germany 2-0, the game on Thursday is decisive for them too. "We are very certain that we have a team that can not only play well, but also win against Poland," said Hickersberger. "Hopefully, we will start this game 0-0 and not 0-1." Austria conceded an early penalty against Croatia in their match on Sunday and could never recover despite a spirited fightback. Asked about the team's fitness after striker Roland Linz suffered an ankle injury, Hickersberger said that all the players were available, though declined to comment who would be in his starting line-up. Austria face Germany in their last group match in Vienna on Monday and would be huge underdogs against their neighbours
