 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - James Anderson claimed two early wickets to put a dent in New Zealand's reply to England's first innings on day two of the third and final test at Trent Bridge on Friday. New Zealand reached 57 for two at tea after Aaron Redmond (1) and Brendon McCullum (9) were bowled by Anderson out-swingers.

He survived a nervous period either side of lunch when he was stranded on 49 for 25 deliveries. Kevin Pietersen scored 115 on Thursday after England were 86 for five. England need only to avoid defeat in the match to win the series after drawing at Lord's and winning the second test at Old Trafford by six wickets.

New Zealand did have their chances as Broad was dropped on 21 at second slip by McCullum off Martin and at 46 by Redmond at gully off Jacob Oram. In the same Oram over, Anderson edged to wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins, missing the opportunity to pass his highest first-class score of 37 not ou
