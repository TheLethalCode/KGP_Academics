<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman was produced in a special court Monday for a hearing in a bribery case linked to the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Tarique was taken in an ambulance to the Special Judge's Court-3, set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises, shortly before 11am. The judge had deferred the hearing on charge framing in the case on June 3 as Tarique failed to appear in court due to illness. On May 6, the Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against eight people, including Tarique, senior joint secretary general of BNP, and former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar. The accused are charged with taking Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan, son of Sanbeer Basundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, in the murder of Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered on July 4, 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdne
