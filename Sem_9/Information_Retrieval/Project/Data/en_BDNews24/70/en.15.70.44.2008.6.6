 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)The government has formed three separate medical boards to examine the health of detained former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, and Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, the inspector general of prisons said Friday. Two separate boards examined Hasina and Coco Thursday, and one is set to examine Khaleda on Friday. Prisons chief Brig Gen Md Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com: "The government has formed three separate medical boards for examining and ascertaining the latest health conditions of detainees Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia and Arafat Rahman Coco." "Sheikh Hasina and Coco have already been seen by the appointed medical board members on Thursday. Another medical board will examine Khaleda Zia [Friday] at the special jail." When asked if the medical boards were formed to decide whether to send the three abroad, Zakir Hasan said: "We don't know anything about sending them abroad. That would be decided at the highest level of the government. But everything will depend on the reports of the medical boards." "As far as we know, the medical boards were formed to assess their health conditions only. We have cooperated with the doctors on the boards at work," said the inspector general. Awami League's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com Friday: "We are aware that our president's health has been deteriorating of late and she herself has said that she needs treatment abroad. We all want that Sheikh Hasina should go abroad, get well and come back." Deputy inspector general of prisons Maj Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "A medical board examined Sheikh Hasina's health at the special jail Thursday, spending a full hour with her. A separate medical board later examined Arafat Rahman Coco." A four-member medical board headed by professor Syed Maruf Ali, of the National Eye Science Institute and Hospital, examined Sheikh Hasina. Professor Mustafizur Rahman, of the Institute of Diseases of the Chest & Hospital (IDCH), headed the medical board for Coco. A letter from Sheikh Hasina's family and the Awami League, requesting the government to send the ailing detained political leader abroad for treatment, was submitted to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Mar 12. The metropolitan Awami League also handed a memorandum to the chief adviser for the same purpose. Appearing in the court Wednesday, Khaleda Zia too demanded that the government should send her and younger son Coco abroad for medical treatment. bdnews24.com/
