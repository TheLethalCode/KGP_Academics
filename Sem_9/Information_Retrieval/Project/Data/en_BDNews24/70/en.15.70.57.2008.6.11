 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was temporarily released from jail Wednesday, after spending 11 months behind bars. Dial 2324 on GP/AKTEL for more. A home ministry order was earlier issued to free former prime minister Sheikh Hasina for eight weeks until Aug 6, inspector general of prisons, Brig Gen Zakir Hasan, told bdnews24.com. The IG said he had received the temporary release order just before noon. Hasina left the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises at a quarter to two, amid tight security, heading for her Dhamondi home. On the way to her Sudha Sadan home, the Awami League president stopped at the Bangabandhu Museum, on Dhanmondi 32 to lay a floral tribute at her father's portrait. When asked whether there were any conditions over Hasina's seeking treatment overseas while released on bail, the prisons chief said there were no such conditions. "She may go wherever she pleases for treatment, including overseas." "But the government may cancel this order at any time, giving no reason," he added. Hasina is expected to fly to North America for treatment tomorrow on a British Airways flight. Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Noor Taposh said there was no possibility of the Awami League president presiding over any party meeting before her flight out of Dhaka. bdnews24.com/sum/
