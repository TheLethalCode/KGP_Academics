<TITLE> Booters face Sri Lanka in a must-win-situation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) - In a bid to qualify for the SAFF Championship semifinals, Bangladesh take on hosts Sri Lanka in their Group B final encounter in a must-win-situation at Sugathadasa Stadium, Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sunday. Bangladesh, the three-time finalists, have made their way tough after having drawn against lowly Bhutan and emerging Afghanistan and they have no alternative but to win against Sri Lanka with two points from as many outings if they want to play the semifinals. Hosts Sri Lanka are comparatively in well position with four points from two matches and will be thrown to the last fours if they can hold or beat the 2003 champions. Bangladesh, no doubt, are looking for inspiration from their second match against Afghanistan where they in came from behind to play a 2-2 draw against Afghanistan, which consisted of nine footballers playing in different German leagues. To inspire the footballers, Bangladesh Football Federation vice president Badal Roy is going to Colombo and is scheduled to leave here for the Sri Lankan capital Saturday night. Hosts Sri Lanka are considered the top favourites of Group B especially after their 7-1 triumph against Pakistan in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers, but the Bangladeshi footballers can take inspiration from their record. Bangladesh had beaten Sri Lanka eight times out of nine meets and the Lankans overcame Bangladesh only once in the last one in 2000. The team management could hope that the boys would put in their best Sunday as the players are getting shaper as the tournament progresses. Bangladesh, however, will feel the absence of injured Arif Khan Joy in the midfield and young striker Jahid Hasan Amili in the attack following his booking.
