<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said Friday his national team, who have remained unbeaten over their last 11 matches, looked forward to stretching their winning streak in the tri-nation one-day international series in Bangladesh. "Our goal is to maintain consistency. We have won 11 matches in a row and want to continue that. We are looking forward to playing a good series here," Malik said at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Pakistan cricketers arrived in Dhaka Friday noon for the first time in six years, since their first full tour of Bangladesh for a three-ODI and two Test series against Bangladesh in early 2002. Pakistan will start their campaign taking on hosts Bangladesh in the opener on Sunday, with neighbouring India as the third squad in the series. The three nations were last involved in a one-dayer tournament here to mark the Silver Jubilee of Bangladesh's Independence in 1998. Malik didn't want to rate either hosts Bangladesh or India too high, as his team are confident of winning "all three matches" including the final. Most of the Pakistani players were involved in the recently concluded Indian Premier League, but few of them played for their respective sides. Nevertheless, the Pakistan captain believed that this would not affect their chances. "That's history now. I think all of us were in the game, we had a one-day practice match in Karachi yesterday (Thursday) and everyone is in good form. We have confidence," said Malik. The team captain also said his players were professionals and used to playing all forms of cricket, and having recently played in the Twenty20 Indian Premier League will not impact them in the upcoming 50-over-a-side matches. Asked whether his team suffered from a crisis of image after pace duo Shoaib Akter and Mohammad Asif breaching disciplinary codes, the Pakistan captain said: "If you go a few months back, we were playing against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and everyone was playing good cricket. We are here to play cricket and our concentration is only on cricket." "We still have a good decent bowling attack comprising Sohail Tanvir, Omar Gul, Sohail Khan and Rao Iftikhar and they all are working hard," said Malik. Pakistan's Australian coach Jeoff Lawson echoed Malik's sentiments, saying that they had a good seam and spin attack. The Australian coach also said that the absence of Asif would not create any imbalance in the team. "We have played cricket without Asif ... When at his best he is a very destructive bowler. But, we also have some young players coming through." said Lawson. bdn
