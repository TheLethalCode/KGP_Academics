<TITLE> Turkish PM: court must explain headscarf ruling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Tue Jun 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the Constitutional Court must explain its decision to overturn a government-led reform allowing students to wear Muslim headscarves at university. Last week's Constitutional Court ruling was the most serious setback for the Islamist-rooted AK Party since it came to power in 2002 and analysts said it increased the chances of the party being banned for Islamist activities, in a separate case. Erdogan reiterated that the court was not authorized to examine the content of a constitutional amendment and should look only at the technical aspects of the reform. "The Constitutional Court must certainly explain why it examined the contents of the reform in the (headscarf) case," he told a parliamentary group meeting. The Constitutional Court normally gives reasons for its rulings after announcing the decision. The court's chairman said in this case that the justification would be announced, but not for the time being because of speculation surrounding the case. An analyst said Erdogan showed he did not seek escalating tensions but stood firm against the judiciary. "The prime minister did not create new tensions but he did not bow either. He pointed at the nation for solving the problems and I saw all signs of an early election in his speech," said Mehmet Ali Birand, a liberal columnist for Posta newspaper. "The government will call early elections if the AK Party is closed down," said Birand. The AK Party passed the headscarf amendment earlier this year, angering a secularist establishment of judges and generals which sees the headscarf as a symbol of political Islam. The reform was seen as a catalyst for the separate case which aims to close the party down and ban 71 members, including the prime minister, from party politics. The AK Party decided to keep parliament open until the Constitutional Court decides on the closure case, said Sadullah Ergin, a senior AK Party deputy. Normally the parliament recess is set to start on June 30. PARLIAMENT'S POWER Last week after an emergency meeting to discuss the court's ruling, the party accused the Constitutional Court of violating the constitution and the concept of the separation of powers. On Tuesday, Erdogan used a more conciliatory tone when referring to the top court and blamed the main opposition party, the staunchly secularist CHP, for the row between the government and the judiciary. "We have to be responsible and behave with common sense ... We should not forget that both the legislature and judiciary exist (to serve) this nation. We cannot allow the judiciary or the legislature to be eroded," he said. Investors, fearing months of political uncertainty, are watching the developments around the two cases and had said that an aggressive response from the AK Party could further undermine market confidence. The closure case is expected to take months. "The constitution states that the legislative power belongs only and exclusively to elected parliaments," Erdogan told cheering supporters. "Nobody can take the power given by the constitution away from our esteemed parliament." The headscarf debate goes to the heart of the officially secular but predominantly Muslim country's identity. Turkey, which has seen four governments pushed from office by the arch-secularist military since 1960, is struggling to balance the demands of an increasingly prosperous but pious part of society with those of a traditionally pro-Western sector whose values have long been represented by the secularist elite
