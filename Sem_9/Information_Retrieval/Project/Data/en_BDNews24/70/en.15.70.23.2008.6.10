<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/Hollywood Reporter) - VH1 is looking for actresses who aren't afraid to scream. The cable network has green-lighted "Scream Queens," a series that will gather 10 unknown actresses to compete for a "major" role in a horror movie from Lionsgate Films. The contestants will compete in challenges and be schooled by acting coach John Homa. Their skills and progress will be judged by an unnamed director from Lionsgate's roster. "Horror films have dominated the pop culture landscape for decades and along the way have produced some of the biggest names in Hollywood," said Jeff Olde, VH1's executive vice president original programming and production. The series, consisting of eight hour-long episodes, is set to premiere in the fall.
