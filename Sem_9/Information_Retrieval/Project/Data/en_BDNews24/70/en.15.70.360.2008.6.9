 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  The president is expected to appoint a new vice chancellor to Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology any day, the education adviser said Monday. The search committee, formed to nominate candidates for VCs, pro-VCs and treasurers of public universities, made a list of three potential candidates for the post in a meeting Monday. "A primary list of three has been made out of 26 applications for the post of DUET VC," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters at his office. "President Iajuddin Ahmed will select and appoint one of the three for the post any day," he added. The adviser said the search committee in its next meeting, slated for June 16, would select candidates for VCs of six other public universities, from applications following the countrywide advertisement for VC appointments of seven public universities. Some 325 applications for the seven VC posts have been submitted so far, Hossain Zillur said. "We have also finalised new regulations regarding recruitment -- who may be appointed and by what process," said the adviser. According to the new regulations, those barred from applying include anyone who has previously been removed from the post of VC, those who have no experience in teaching at university level and those who have applied for more than one post. The six public universities, in addition to DUET, are Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, Khulna University, National University, Jessore University of Science and Technology, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology and Dinajpur Haji Danesh Science and Technology University. "Apart from these seven universities, we will advertise for VCs of Mymensingh Agricultural University, Patuakhali University of Science and Technology and Noakhali University of Science and Technology very soon," said Hossain Zillur. bdnews24.
