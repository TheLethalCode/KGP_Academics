 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Four Dhaka courts have exempted Sheikh Hasina from personally appearing in hearings of four separate cases against her, while a Dhaka magistrate also ordered the government Monday to restore the former prime minister's passports, as her lawyers sought to clear a legal path for her treatment overseas. Two special judge's courts, sited on the Sangsad Bhaban complex, exempted the detained Awami League president from a legal binding to appear in person in the barge-mounted power plant case and the Niko case proceedings against her. A divisional judge and a Dhaka magistrate also excused Hasina from appearing in the MiG-29 and Noor Ali case hearings, respectively. Following separate pleas by Hasina's lawyers, the courts ruled that the trial proceedings would continue during her absence, in line with the criminal procedures code, in the event that Hasina went overseas for treatment. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court separately ordered the government to return the AL president's passports, which were seized after her arrest and detention a year ago. Special public prosecutor Sarder Shahidul Islam told the court the state did not object to returning Hasina's three passports. Hasina's lawyer Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com of the three, two were expired and one was current. "We will probably get the passports back today," he added. Dhanmondi police confiscated Hasina's passports when she was arrested from her home in Dhanmondi on July 16, last year. bdnews24.
