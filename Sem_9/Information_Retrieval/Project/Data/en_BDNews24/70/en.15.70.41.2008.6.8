 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - The Indian cricket team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, arrived in Dhaka Sunday morning for the tri-nation one-day international series against Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh. India will start their series campaign Tuesday, taking on archrivals Pakistan. The Indian selection committee on Saturday picked a relatively young team, of which most played superbly in the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL). The team managers sent Suresh Raina, a member of the India squad during the ICC U/19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004, instead of team captain Dhoni to speak to reporters on landing at Zia International Airport. The players' involvement in the recent IPL would help them to clinch the tri-nation trophy, said Raina, who was a member of Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. "I think our one-day cricket will also be more entertaining this time after our involvement in the IPL," said the young cricketer. Raina's comments mean spectators can expect another explosive batting display from the Indian cricketers, who gave cricket fans plenty of big hitting excitement during their IPL matches. Rating Pakistan high in the series, Raina observed that a number of the Pakistani cricketers also played in the IPL, which gave the Indians an opportunity to study the Pakistan players from close range. He felt there was some comparison to be made between the India and Bangladesh squads as both sides comprised a bunch of young cricketers. "Bangladesh are a young side, and I think they will play better this time at home." "They have also some good batsmen like (Mohammad) Ashraful," said middle-order batsman Raina. Squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan, Piyush Chawla, Pragyan Ojha, Manpreet Gony, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar. bdnew
