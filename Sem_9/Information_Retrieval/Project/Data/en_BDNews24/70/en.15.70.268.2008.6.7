 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board is preparing to operate as a public limited company from July 1, a senior telecoms official confirmed Saturday. Telecoms secretary Iqbal Mahmood told bdnews24.com that the ministry had taken all-out preparations to turn BTTB into a PLC by the end of this month. "A board of directors for the company is set to be formed, and the present resources and employees of the BTTB will be brought under the plc," Mahmood said. The interim cabinet approved the BTTB Amendment Ordinance 2008 on May 4, amending the BTTB Ordinance 1979. BTTB employees will be shifted to the new company, having an option to retire if they do not want to transfer. About 12,000 people are currently employed by the government against a total of 19,409 BTTB posts. BTTB's landing station and submarine cable will also be handed over to the plc, Mahmood said. A German firm has been assigned to take stock of the property of the state-owned entity. The Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Department had originally been created post-independence under the ministry of post and telecommunications. The T&T Department was converted into a corporate body in 1976. The department was restructured into the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board and mandated by an ordinance in 1979 to provide basic telecommunication services for the population. The BTTB Ordinance of 1979 had given BTTB the monopoly rights and powers for issuing licences for telecommunications and wireless services. In 1995, the government amended the BTTB Ordinance 1979 and transferred the regulatory authority from BTTB to the telecoms ministry. According to a telecommunications policy formulated in 1998, BTTB was later to be restructured in two phases. bdnews
