 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government will take necessary steps for the treatment of detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia 'at home or abroad' through coordination of legal procedures, the Press Information Department said in a statement Wednesday. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had earlier told reporters that a decision on the treatment of Khaleda would be made on both humanitarian and legal grounds. The government released Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina for two months to facilitate her proper medical treatment, based on a medical board's recommendations. The PID statement said: "The government has always been aware of the conditions of the two former prime ministers." "The government has also ensured the best possible medical treatment for them in the country." Relatives of Hasina appealed to the government in March, seeking permission to take her abroad for better medical treatment. The government formed a medical board on June 5 to examine Hasina's health and justify the plea of taking her abroad. Separate boards were also formed to examine the health of Khaleda and her son Coco the same day. bd
