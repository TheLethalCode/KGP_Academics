Asked, Taposh said there was no possibility of the Awami League president presiding over any party meeting before her flight out of Dhaka. One of Hasina's relatives said she would fly British Airways from Zia International Airport. But inspector general of prisons brigadier general Zakir Hasan had earlier said he did not receive any document of a government order yet for her release. "But we will act quickly on any official order," he said. Deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com shortly after Tuesday midnight that the jail authorities had not yet received any document for Hasina's release. bdn
