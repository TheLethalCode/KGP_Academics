<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League launched a countrywide mass signature campaign outside the capital Saturday to press home a charter of demands including the unconditional release of party chief Sheikh Hasina. The party's central executive council has said the campaign will continue till June 30. AL leaders, however, claimed the party would begin a non-stop movement, following the mass signature campaign, if Sheikh Hasina was not released and treatment arranged for her. They sounded the warning at a discussion at the party central office Saturday at a gathering to mark the historic six-point charter for the liberation of East Pakistan announced on June 7, 1966. AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu warned the government: "Release Sheikh Hasina immediately ... If you do not we will start a non-stop movement after the signature campaign." Aiming at BNP's calls for political unity, he said: "Awami League does not wait for anybody's advice. We don't need to borrow experience from anybody." Presidium member Tofail Ahmed claimed that the government has planned to 'kill Sheikh Hasina politically'. "Nobody will be able to keep Hasina in jail. There is no way for compromise. We must go for movement." "An election in which our leader cannot participate will not take place on the soil of Bangladesh," he said. Demanding immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency Tofail said: "The state of emergency is kept in force to punish the politicians including Sheikh Hasina." Apart from Hasina's release, AL's demands include complete withdrawal of the state of emergency, withdrawing all restrictions on indoor politics, withdrawing all cases filed against political leaders and release of political detainees. AL are also demanding that the caretaker government try war criminals and bar them from contesting in the polls, take steps to curb prices of essentials and conclude the Bangabandhu murder case. The party has sent out signature forms and other necessary items for the campaign to districts and upazilas. Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League had previously collected around 25 lakh signatures in support of Hasina's unconditional release, and submitted them to the chief adviser's office as well as foreign embassies and high commissions in Dhaka. Two of AL's front organisations, Jubo League and Jubo Mohila League, have also previously launched a mass signature campaign in Dhaka. bdnews
