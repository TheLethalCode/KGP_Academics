 Prodip Choudhury, Liton Haider and Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Correspondents Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Several hundred people gathered near the gate of special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex Sunday night after talk of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina going abroad for better medical treatment spread by word of mouth. AL leaders Amir Hossain Amu and Tofail Ahmed were among the leaders. Hasina's lawyer Barrister Shafiq Ahmed said there were no legal barriers for the former prime minister to travel abroad. "All Sheikh Hasina now needs is an order from the government," the lawyer told reporters after the special judge's court-2 on the Jatiya Sangsad complex heard an appeal. The appeal seeks to spare Hasina from a legal binding to appear in court in person in the barge-mounted power plants corruption case. The court is expected to rule on the appeal Monday. Tofail told reporters: "The government has decided to send Sheikh Hasina abroad realising the reality. We thank the government for this." Amu, another AL presidium member who arrived on the scene shortly after Tofail, said: "We welcome the government although it is a late decision. We had long demanded Sheikh Hasina's treatment abroad. Now it's going to be materialised." bdnews
