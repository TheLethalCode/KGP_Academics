 MOSCOW, Wed Jun 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday he looked with "measured optimism" at relations with the United States despite differences over European security. Moscow and Washington are at odds over NATO expansion into eastern Europe, a treaty limiting conventional arms in Europe and US plans to station elements of a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. "Even with the differences that exist today -- and I am convinced they will persist at least in part -- ... we still have to work together," Medvedev, who was sworn in as president last month, told delegates at an international congress of the Russian press. "Therefore, overall I look on our relations with measured optimism," he said. Asked by a conference delegate about the presidential election in the United States this year, he said Russia would work with the winning candidate. "There is no alternative, because the responsibility that falls on both our countries for world order and supporting peace and stability on the planet, is colossal," Medvedev said. "Whoever comes to power in the White House, the Russian Federation counts on a constructive and comradely dialogue with the new US administration, and we are prepared to do that.
