 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government is set to announce a budget of approximately Tk 100,000 crore for the coming fiscal year, with a proposal to allocate up to 15 percent of the amount in subsidising essential commodities, the finance adviser said Sunday. It will mark the first time in history that a caretaker government has proposed a complete budget for two successive fiscal years. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, who will make his second budget speech Monday, told bdnews24.com that up to Tk 15,000 crore would be proposed as allocations for fuel, food and fertiliser. This is three times greater than the outgoing fiscal year's allocation for similar subsidies. Spending on non-development sectors, including food, structural coordination and loans, will exceed Tk 70,000 crore but the overall budget deficit will not be more than five percent, the finance adviser said. Mirza Aziz said the government would not increase rates of tax in the next fiscal year but import duty on some goods might be hiked in the interests of local industry. He said the unusual fuel price hikes in the global market, the world food crisis and climate change causing natural disasters turned out to be the major challenges for Bangladesh in preparing the budget. The finance adviser said the spiralling oil prices on the international market put our economy under tremendous pressure but the government has not yet take any decision to hike fuel prices. "The price of oil has jumped to $ 139 a barrel on the global market as we are going to announce the budget; it rose by more than $ 10 in a single day. But we did not increase fuel prices in view of our overall situation," said Mirza Aziz. A barrel of fuel cost $ 62 on the global market when the government last raised fuel prices in the country in 2007, the adviser said. In the budget for fiscal 2007-08, overall deficit was projected at 4.2 percent. The finance adviser said Sunday the budget deficit was likely to increase a bit in the coming year due to higher subsidies to various sectors including fuel, fertiliser and foodstuffs. "But it will not be more than 5 percent," he added. The tax net would be widened on a large scale in efforts to increase revenue income, said the finance adviser. The projected revenue income in the next fiscal year is 17 percent. In the budget for 2008-09, Tk 43,850 crore was slated to come from NBR-controlled sources. The adviser said the tax structure in the budget would be business-friendly. "Discretionary power of tax officials will be curbed and tax realisation process will be made easier," he said. He said the target rate for gross domestic product would be 6.5 percent, and the annualised inflation rate was projected to be around 9 percent. GDP growth for the fiscal year 2007-08 was targeted to be 7 percent with an average inflation rate of 6 percent. The finance adviser said 7 percent growth in the fiscal year just ending had not been possible due to floods and cyclones. "It was earlier assumed that the growth rate in the present fiscal year would be below 6 percent. But the latest data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics shows that the growth rate is 6.21 percent," the adviser said. GDP growth in the previous fiscal year (2006-07) was 6.5 percent. Mirza Aziz said major concern for Bangladesh's economy was inflation. He reiterated that point-to-point inflation rate fell by three percentage points to 7.7 percent in April. Referring to data available at the Bureau of Statistics, he said the point-to-point inflation rate was 10.06 percent in March. Agriculture will receive the highest priority in the next budget. "The highest allocation has been made for the sector in the development budget," the adviser said. Mirza Aziz said the government had planned schemes to generate employment for poor people in the next fiscal year. Under the scheme, one person in a family will receive a fixed amount of money in return for 100 days of work. The number of beneficiaries of different government allowances under social safety net would also be increased. The adviser said the government would take an initiative to enhance the purchasing power of the people of fixed income groups. There will also be an announcement of a dearness allowance for government employees in order to cut the suffering caused by spiralling prices. The finance adviser's budget speech will be broadcast live by government and private-owned TV and radio channels at 3pm Monday. As it did last year, the government is inviting public scrutiny of the proposed budget by posting the budget speech, budget summary and the government's annual financial statement at www.mof.gov.bd. Hard copies will also be made available, from 3pm Monday.
