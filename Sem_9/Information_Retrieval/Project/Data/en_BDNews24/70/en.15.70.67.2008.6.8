 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)Turnover from Dhaka stocks crossed the Tk 5 billion mark Sunday for the first time in the history of the capital market in Bangladesh with indices finishing higher, paced by blue chips. DSE's turnover amounted to Tk 5.5 billion from 38,446,210 shares changing hands. Market experts said the hike in turnover was inspiring but doubted its sustainability. "It's good that the market has enough liquidity but there is doubt about sustainability," analyst Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com. Issues were highly overpriced and mostly speculative, he added. "The concern is, whether the price correction will be a soft-landing one or otherwise," said Sayeed, CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh. He asked investors not to carry away by the hype and trade on a cautious manner. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed also expressed concerns over the imminent price correction saying it would hit small investors hard. "If the prices make a steep fall, investors, especially the small ones, will find themselves in huge losses," he said. Ahmed advised investors to take caution. The DGEN or general index maintained an upward curve across the day with some rise and fall to end 25.35 points, or 0.80 percent up, at 3179.54.
