 FEUSISBERG, Switzerland, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland and Turkey will aim to put the ugly scenes that marred their last encounter behind them when they meet at Euro 2008 on Wednesday. Media in both countries have been focusing for weeks on the violence that followed Switzerland's World Cup qualifying playoff victory in Istanbul in November 2005. But with the teams facing the possibility of an early exit from the tournament after opening game defeats, they have insisted they are concentrating purely on the present. "Of course, it's not easy to forget what happened in Istanbul," Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta told reporters on Monday. "But we are trying not to dwell on it. "The only similarity to the situation in Istanbul is that both sides need to win so Wednesday will be like a final for all of us." Turkey have steered clear of discussing the Istanbul match at their own news conferences but coach Fatih Terim has spoken in the past of his side's desire to put the matter behind them. "I'm convinced that both sides will give good examples of fair play both on and off the pitch," he said immediately after December's Euro 2008 draw. Switzerland lost the Istanbul encounter 4-2 but denied Turkey a place at the 2006 World Cup on away goals thanks to their 2-0 victory in the first leg in Berne. HIGHER RISK The Swiss success was overshadowed by the subsequent clashes between players and coaching staff that saw Switzerland defender Stephane Grichting taken to hospital after a kick in the groin. World soccer's governing body FIFA handed out six-match bans to Turkish players Alpay and Emre and Swiss midfielder Benjamin Huggel, later reducing Emre and Huggel's to four games. Turkey were also ordered to play their first three Euro 2008 qualifiers on neutral ground behind closed doors. Police and security officials told Reuters on Monday that Wednesday's reunion was higher risk than other matches in Switzerland and more police would be deployed in Basel. However, European governing body UEFA said it was not planning increased security measures inside the stadium. Swiss captain Alex Frei will be their biggest absentee after being ruled out of the tournament with a knee ligament injury. His regular strike partner Marco Streller has suffered with a recurring groin problem but is expected to recover in time. Turkey's main concerns are in central defence with Gokhan Zan ruled out and Servet Cetin doubtful after both damaged knee ligaments in Saturday's 2-0 defeat by Portugal
