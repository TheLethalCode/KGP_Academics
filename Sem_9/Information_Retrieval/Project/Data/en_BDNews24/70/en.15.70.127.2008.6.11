<TEXT>
 ST GALLEN, Switzerland, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania captain Cristian Chivu said his team will make things very difficult for world champions Italy when they meet at Euro 2008 on Friday. "We will give them hell. They will come at us, but we will make their life very hard," Chivu told Reuters at the team's St Gallen Arena training base. Romania held 2006 World Cup runners-up France to a goalless draw in their opening Group C match on Monday, while Italy suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat at the hands of Netherlands in the toughest group at the finals. But Romania are reading nothing into Italy's collapse against the Dutch, Chivu said. "Italy are world champions and are still a great team. They were beaten, but you cannot say that they are now a bad team. Everybody can have a bad day," Chivu said. The midfielder, who plays in Serie A for Inter Milan, said he had not been asked by coach Victor Piturca for his inside knowledge on any of the Italian players he knows best. "What more can I say about Italy? Everybody knows Italy. I have not been giving any advice," Chivu said. "We have a coach who is preparing us very well and he knows enough about Italy. He will make sure we are ready." Romania defended well against the French, but did not create many chances, and Chivu said the fans can expect much of the same against Italy in Zurich. "Of course, we will try to create more opportunities. But we have a game plan and the main priority is not to lose first. We must be careful," he said. Romania play Netherlands in their final group match next Tuesda
