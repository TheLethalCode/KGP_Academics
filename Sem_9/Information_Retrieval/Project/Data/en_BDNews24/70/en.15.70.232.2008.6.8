 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Regarded by many as a key player in the 1/11 changeover, Lt Gen Masud Uddin Chowdhury is having to clear his desk for a second time in less than a week. Chief coordinator of the corruption-busting task forces since they came into being, the general has now been transferred to the foreign ministry for possible appointment as an ambassador. On June 2, he was ordered to leave his position as principal staff officer to the Armed Forces Division and made head of the country's top military school, the National Defence College. A government announcement Sunday said his services were now being placed under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and that President Iajuddin Ahmed had signed necessary orders. His latest transfer puts all speculation to rest about his role in the anti-corruption national committee that oversees the much-feared task forces. A graduate of the National Defence College, Lt Gen Masud Uddin Chowdhury was inducted into the army from the Jatiya Rakhshi Bahini and rose to become a two-star general when Khaleda Zia was prime minister. As she returned to power in 2001, Gen Masud, then a brigadier general, was made head of the Counter-Intelligence Bureau at the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence. A recruit of the 6th batch of the JRB, he joined the powerful paramilitary in May 1975. Gen Masud is the brother-in-law of Khaleda's once-powerful younger brother, former major Sayeed Iskander. On January 11, 2007, he was the general officer commanding of the 9th Infantry Division and believed to have played a vital role in enforcing emergency declared on the day by the president. Last year, he was promoted to the three-star rank, along with two others.
