 Cox's Bazar, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  A senior Jamaat-e-Islami leader claimed Friday that businessmen and politicians in the caretaker government's favour enjoyed immunity, while those not in the administration's good books were branded as corrupt, regardless of their actions. Jamaat's secretary general and former minister Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed made his comments at a meeting of party officials in Cox's Bazar town Friday morning. Referring to the government, Mojaheed said: "They speak of freeing the country of corruption, when in reality they are trying to create a political vacuum." The Jamaat leader accused the government of having ulterior motives behind their anticorruption drive, adding that the party would be forced to act if their party chief, Motiur Rahman Nizami, was not released from detention. Mojaheed said Jamaat-e-Islami would go to the government with a petition containing "crores of signatures" demanding Nizami's release. He also took aim at the caretaker government for not being elected to power, saying: "The constitution does not support your existence." "Jamaat-e-Islami considers democracy a better system," he added. bdnews24.co
