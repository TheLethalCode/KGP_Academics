 Beijing, June 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The heaviest rainstorms in 50 years drenched parts of Guangdong province over the past two days, killing at least 1 student and causing widespread flooding, local media reported on Sunday. The Guangzhou Daily newspaper reported that one primary school student died after being swept away by a flood on Saturday in Maoming in the west of Guangdong province. It said another primary school student and a high school student were missing. The newspaper said more than 6,500 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Torrential rains have affected the province over the past two weeks, with rainfall in some areas measuring more than 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) in just the past two days, the paper reported. The provincial government website forecast more heavy rain for Tuesday. The region normally experiences heavy rainfall about this time every year, but meteorological authorities said this was the worst in five decades. Flooding has affected many cities in the Pearl River Delta -- home to many export manufacturing plants -- and the western part of Guangdong province.
