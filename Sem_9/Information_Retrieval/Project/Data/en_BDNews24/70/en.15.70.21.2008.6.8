<TEXT>
 Iraq, 8 June,(bdnews24.com/BBC) Iraq will not allow its territory to be used to attack Iran, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has said during a visit to Tehran. He was speaking after meeting Iran's foreign minister and is later due to meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The role of the US in Iraq is high on the agenda, with Tehran concerned about a treaty under discussion on the terms of the US military's future in Iraq. Iran's alleged backing for militants in Iraq is also likely to be discussed. "We will not allow Iraq to become a platform for harming the security of Iran and neighbours," Iranian state-run media quoted Mr Maliki as saying after late-night talks with Manouchehr Mottaki. Militias evidence The BBC's John Leyne, in Tehran, says Iran has made no secret of its opposition to the current negotiations going on between Iraq and the US, which are aimed at regulating the presence of US forces in the country after their UN mandate expires at the end of 2008. The US-Iraqi talks, which are seeking to reach agreement by the end of July, have run into problems over issues related to Iraqi sovereignty. The Iraqi prime minister also is expected to raise allegations of Iranian support for Shia militants in Iraq. Shia militiamen fought bitter battles with US and Iraqi government forces between March and May. Mr Maliki is on his third visit to Iran since taking office in June 2005. Government sources say Iraqi security officials with the delegation will be showing the Iranians evidence of their alleged support for the militias, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports. Iran has always denied any involvement, but officials say Mr Maliki will once again urge Tehran to support the Baghdad government and stop secretly backing militias
