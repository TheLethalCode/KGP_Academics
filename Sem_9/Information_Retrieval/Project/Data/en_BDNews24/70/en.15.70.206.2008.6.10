 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to suspend the monthly pay order or academic recognition of 834 secondary schools under the general education boards and 82 technical and business management colleges for bad performance in the SCC and HSC examinations. "Orders will be issued about business management colleges in a day or two. And the orders for the schools will be issued very soon," senior assistant secretary of the education ministry Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com Tuesday. A senior official of the same ministry told bdnews24.com that a decision had been taken to take punitive action against 834 schools from which fewer than five candidates passed last year's SSC examinations. Of them, 512 schools will lose MPO, while academic recognition will be suspended for the remaining 322. The government moved to take punitive action against 82 technical and business management colleges for bad results in last year's HSC examinations under the Technical Education Board. The suspension order will be withdrawn if the institutions showed good performance in future, the education ministry official said. In line with the manpower structure, there is a provision to take action against an educational institution with fewer than 15 successful examinees. After a private school or college is established, the related educational board gives it academic recognition to continue academic activities. "If the institution meets certain conditions after receiving academic recognition it is included in the MPO," the official explained. bdnews
