<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) The Centre for Policy Dialogue has said the newly announced budget expenditure is not too large, but has questioned the government's revenue targets, in the think-tank's annual budget analysis broadcast live on Tuesday. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman, speaking at the Brac Inn Centre, said the government's proposed Tk 100,000 crore budget was not too large compared with the outgoing year's budget allocations for development interventions and increases in pay and allowances, especially taking inflation into account. The CPD executive director said, expenditure-wise it may be called a 'pro-people welfare budget'. But he said it could be difficult to finance given the resources detailed in the finance adviser's budget speech on Monday. Moreover, he commented, to finance the budget deficit funds could be mustered easily and at lower interests from foreign sources. Mustafizur said the budget aimed to widen the tax net, but pointed to the lack of details in the proposed budget on how this would be achieved. Direct tax was a very low percentage of total tax revenue, Mustafizur added. If direct taxes could have been increased, then tax coverage could have been decreased among low income and the poor, in line with the overall social welfare focus of the proposed budget, said the economist. Income tax and VAT could both have been increased to achieve this, said Mustafizur. The prestigious think-tank thought one of the budget's merits was statistical transparency. On the usefulness of statistical clarity in the budget, Mustafizur said it would help in easily ascertaining the extent of implementation of the budget. The CPD executive director said his organisation, in pre-budget discussions with the caretaker government had mentioned nine relevant challenges, which they believed the government had incorporated in formulating the budget. On expansion of the social security net, Mustafizur said the budget has addressed the government's poverty reduction strategies. However, he said there was no target fixed in the budget with regard to employment generation. On government subsidies to the agricultural sector, the economist said subsidies on fertiliser could have been further enhanced considering price hikes in the international markets. bdnews24.com
