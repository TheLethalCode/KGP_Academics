<TITLE> Pope to host Bush in unusual Vatican setting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VATICAN CITY, Mon Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict will unusually host talks with US President George W Bush in a restored medieval tower on Friday, to repay him for a warm reception at the White House, the Vatican said. The pope usually receives heads of state in his private study in the Apostolic Palace, overlooking St Peter's Square. But Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the change was to repay Bush for "the cordiality of the meeting at the White House" when the pope visited the United States in April. St. John's Tower is a round structure on a hilltop inside the Vatican gardens that is sometimes used as a residence for important guests. After their private talks, Bush and the pope will stroll in the gardens to see a statue of the Madonna. The late Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958 to 1963, restored the tower as a place where he could work in peace. Bush will be in Rome from Wednesday to Friday as part of a trip to Slovenia, Germany, Italy, France and Britain
