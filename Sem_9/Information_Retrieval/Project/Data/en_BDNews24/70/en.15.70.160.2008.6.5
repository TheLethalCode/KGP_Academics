 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  The National Economic Council is set to approve a Tk 25,600 crore annual development programme for fiscal 2008-09 at a meeting Saturday, a senior government official said Thursday. Planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that Tk 13,568 crore or 53 percent of the total ADP would come form local sources and the remaining Tk 12,32 crore or 47 percent from foreign funds. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam would announce the budget for the next fiscal year on June 9. BTV and state-run radio would air his budget speech. The planning secretary said that the ADP had earlier been fixed at Tk 25,500 crore. Tk 100 crore was added at the eleventh hour. In the present budget, the size of the original ADP was Tk 26,500 crore. As implementation was not satisfactory, the NEC meeting on March 24, chaired by chief adviser Fakhrudddin, cut it down to Tk 22,500 crore. Although the ADP was revised down, the number of projects increased. The number of projects was 931 in the original ADP, which increased to 1,058 in the revised one. The new ADP will undertake more projects in agriculture, power, rural development and poverty alleviation. An analysis of 36 ADPs since independence reveals that every year the size of the ADP has increased. For the first time, the ADP has been cut down. In fiscal 1972-73, the size of the country's first ADP was Tk 501 crore. In fiscal 2006-07, the ADP size was Tk 26,000 crore. After slashing this year's ADP, Mirza Aziz had told reporters: "ADP revision is a continuous process. This year also, the original ADP has been slashed down to Tk 22,500 crore." In the first 10 months (July-April) of this fiscal year, 54 percent of ADP has been implemented. bdnews
