<TITLE> Budget populist in revenue spending: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The Centre for Policy Dialogue has termed the proposed budget "expansionary and populist" in terms of revenue spending, and "traditional" about revenue earnings. The budget proposed by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam could have set a more ambitious target for revenue earnings to help build more capacity of the government, CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman said in an annual budget analysis Tuesday. The private research organisation said: "The budget is conservative in terms of development spending." "For faster alleviation of poverty and narrowing regional disparity, Bangladesh needed more liberal development expenditure," Mustafizur said. But the fiscal part of the budget is "quite investment-friendly", he added. At a press conference at the city's BRAC Centre, CPD appreciated the move to widen the social safety net with an allocation of Tk 16,932 crore which accounts for 2.8 percent of GDP, but expressed concerns about implementation. "The country's local government infrastructure is not strong enough to execute this huge task. The government will have to monitor the whole matter very closely for successful implementation," he said. CPD said the newly announced budget expenditure was not too big, but questioned the government's revenue targets. "The Tk 100,000 crore budget was not too big compared with the outgoing year's budget allocations for development and increases in pay and allowances, taking inflation into account," said Mustafizur. CPD however said it would be more logical to question the capacity of the government in ensuring "quality implementation" rather than the size of the budget. CPD said revenue growth would solely depend on higher revenue collections by the National Board of Revenue. "However, since the anticorruption drive is expected to ease during the second half of the fiscal year, achieving the revenue target will be a challenge," said the CPD executive director. He warned that failure to increase the revenue-GDP ratio would make the country more dependent on foreign aid. CPD expected the budget would ensure development management in line with poverty reduction strategy's second scheme (PRS II) objectives. "PRS II is yet to be finalised. A better sequencing would have been helpful," added Mustafizur. Speaking on employment, he said there was no target fixed for employment provision in the budget. The think-tank said subsidies on fuel, fertiliser and other agricultural commodities announced in the budget could have been further enhanced considering their price hikes on the international market. "If the government thinks of readjusting it afterwards then it's all right. But there was no such indication in the budget." On the annual development programme, CPD said the budget did not specify what type of administrative and institutional reforms would facilitate better implementation of the ADP. Mustafizur expressed concerns over the proposed huge bank borrowings to narrow the budget deficit saying it would hamper the private sector investments. CPD recommended more care to avoid a "crowding-out" effect on the private sector credit threatened by high government borrowings. Proposed tax and duty measures would help generate more jobs and income, said Mustafizur. The CPD official said the opportunity to legalise undisclosed income was not in line with the government's anticorruption drive. "Let's hope it is for the last time." He said that failure to supply enough gas and power would not help increase investments. "Therefore, the targeted GDP growth could not be achieved." Asked whether it is possible for the present government to implement this budget, Mustafizur evaded a direct answer but said it would not be a problem if a democratic government comes through a free, fair and credible election in December. "If political instability arises it will be very difficult to implement this budget." bdn
