 TEHRAN, Mon Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's supreme leader told visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday the main problem facing Iraq was the presence of US and other foreign forces there, Iranian state radio reported. "The presence of occupiers in Iraq, particularly the US armed forces ... is the main obstacle to unity in Iraq," Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest authority, was quoted as saying during a meeting with Maliki in Tehran. Iraq, which fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s, is negotiating with the United States on a new agreement aimed at giving a legal basis for US troops to stay in Iraq after Dec. 31, when their United Nations mandate expires.

"The most important problem of Iraq is the presence of foreign forces in that country," Khamenei said. The United States says Iran is arming, funding and training Shi'ite militias in Iraq, a charge Tehran has always denied. Maliki on Sunday sought to soothe Iranian concerns about the talks with the United States, saying "there is nothing in today's Iraq which could threaten the stability of the neighbouring countries."

Ties between Iran and Iraq have improved since Sunni Arab strongman Saddam Hussein, who led Iraq into war against Iran in the 1980s, was ousted in the 2003 US-led invasion and a Shia-led government came to power in Baghdad. Khamenei pledged Iranian support for its neighbour: "Helping Iraq ... is our religious duty," he told Maliki
