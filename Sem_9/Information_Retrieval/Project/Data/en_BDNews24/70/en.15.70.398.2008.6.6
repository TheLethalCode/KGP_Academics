 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission is to declare the detailed election schedule of four city corporations and nine municipalities by June 20, in a move described as a "test and trial" prior to the national polls in December. Election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain briefed reporters Friday at the launch of a three-day training course for field officers at the Election Training Institute in Agargaon. The commissioners said that the local elections mentioned are now scheduled to be held at the end of July. "We have received a copy of the ordinance relating to local government, municipalities and city corporations, and the law ministry is now assessing the Election Act," said Sohul. Commissioner Sakhawat said the move was in line with the EC roadmap declared in July, 2007, which stated local government polls were to be held before December. "The local government election is being arranged prior to national election as a test and trial of the system," said the commissioner. "The EC will not take any risks which may hamper the national election. We are also determined to hold the national polls in the third week of December," he said. Sakhawat said the EC had now completed 95 percent of voter listing throughout the country. The commissioners added that the training programme at the Election Training Institute would bring local officers up-to-speed with new legislation covering local government. Also attending the event was Election Commission secretary Humayun Kabir and district election officers among others. bdnews
