 LUGANO, Switzerland, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden midfielder Christian Wilhelmsson is out of Euro 2008 because of a hamstring injury. "Christian has torn a hamstring and will be out for the rest of the finals," team doctor Anders Valentin told reporters on Wednesday before adding the injury would take at least three weeks to heal. The Deportivo Coruna winger was hurt towards the end of Sweden's 2-0 Group D win over Greece in Salzburg on Tuesday. Coach Lars Lagerback said no decision had been made on whether Wilhelmsson would remain with the squad or go back to Spain. Sweden play Spain in Innsbruck on Saturday followed by Russia at the same venue on June 18. Valentin said utility player Niclas Alexandersson, who was substituted in Tuesday's match with a calf strain, could be a doubt for Saturday. "I have not examined him today but he says he feels better. We will take a few scans later to see but he may not be fit enough for the next match. We will have to wait and see," Valentin told Reuters. EARLY EXIT Lagerback was upset about Wilhelmsson's injury although he added he still had plenty of options. The coach hinted midfielder Sebastian Larsson, who did not feature against Greece, could make his first appearance of the tournament. The players who took part in the victory did not train on Wednesday after the heat and humidity took its toll on a starting XI including seven players aged 30 or more. "It was a very physical game," said Lagerback. "The play was very concentrated and it was very humid. "A number of players may not train tomorrow either. The main thing now is to eat, sleep and rest.
