<TITLE> High fuel prices spur anger, protests in Asia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Tue Jun 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Discontent over soaring fuel prices faced governments across Asia this week, surfacing in strikes and protests and pressuring leaders to consider policies to quell the anger. Like others around the globe, Asian governments are struggling to keep rising prices from breaking their budgets while not making the burden on the public so heavy it threatens political stability. In India, Hong Kong and Nepal, protesters took to the streets over the issue, while South Korean truckers threatened a nationwide strike. Malaysia pledged 1 billion ringgit ($306.6 million) in extra spending for the politically key state of Sarawak to shore up support there among lawmakers unhappy over a sharp jump in fuel costs. Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had flown to the eastern state on the island of Borneo to meet with them. "He pledged 1 billion ringgit for various development projects," Alex Linggi, a member of parliament, told Reuters by telephone from Sarawak. Abdullah has been trying to fend off a challenge to his leadership since his Barisan Nasional coalition suffered its worst electoral performance in March. A decision last week to raise petrol prices by 41 percent and diesel by 63 further soured the mood in the country, and the opposition is calling for protests later this week. In South Korea, up to 1 million people were expected to rally on Tuesday after a row over beef imports from the United States turned into a lightning rod for a broad range of grievances against President Lee Myung-bak's three-month-old government, including high fuel prices. South Korean truck drivers, following the lead of unions in a number of countries across Asia and Europe, voted on Monday to go on strike over rising fuel prices. They ignored the government's $10.2 billion financial aid package announced a day before and designed in part to cushion the impact of mounting energy costs. "We are faced with a 'resources crisis' coming next only to the oil crisis in the 1970s and the financial crisis in the 1990s," President Lee Myung-bak said in a speech, as the prime minister of Lee's three-month-old government offered the cabinet's resignation over the various mounting protests. In Hong Kong about 500 minibuses, lorries, garbage trucks and coaches staged a go-slow protest, crippling traffic in a demonstration calling for fuel taxes to be scrapped. Hundreds of demonstrators later converged on foot on Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang's office. "If today we cannot see the CE (Chief Executive) we will make a stronger action tomorrow," said Dobbie Cheng, a spokesperson for the organizing group. NEPAL JOINS IN On Monday, Nepal became the latest Asian country to raise fuel prices, in its case to stem losses at the state-run oil company and help overcome a domestic fuel shortage. Student activists burned tires on roads and blocked traffic in Kathmandu on Tuesday. "The government is not sensitive to the difficulties of the people," said Thakur Gaire, chief of the All Nepal Free Students Union that organized the protests. The union is the student arm of the Communist UML party, Nepal's third largest group. "The government must withdraw the decision immediately," Gaire said. Communists protesting over fuel price rises burned tires and blocked roads in parts of eastern India as well on Tuesday, but elsewhere in that country calls for strikes were largely ignored. A call for a one-day strike in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar evoked little response in the capital Patna where people seemed as angry about the proposed shutdown as about higher fuel prices. But in small towns and the countryside, communist supporters stopped cars and buses by flinging burning tires on highways. A similar shutdown call in the neighboring state of Jharkhand was rejected by people who said a strike hurt businesses and worsened an already biting rise in fuel prices. India increased petrol and diesel prices last week by around 10 percent after the cost of fuel subsidies brought state oil companies close to bankruptcy. Oil was trading at $135 a barrel on Tuesday, down from Friday's record of $139 a barrel, as the US dollar strengthened and the market digested Saudi Arabia's plan to bring producers and consumers together to discuss soaring crude prices that have gained more than 40 percent so far this year
