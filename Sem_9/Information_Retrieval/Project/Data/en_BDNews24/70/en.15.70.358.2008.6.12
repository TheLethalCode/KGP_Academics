<TITLE> Turkey send Switzerland sliding out </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BASEL, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey sent co-hosts Switzerland sliding out of Euro 2008 in the cruellest possible way on Wednesday when a stoppage time goal from Arda Turan secured a 2-1 victory in an enthralling Group A match at St Jakob Park. The Swiss fans were just about to applaud a draw that would have kept their team in contention when Arda curled in a shot that took a deflection off defender Patrick Mueller and flew past goalkeeper Diego Benaglio for the winning goal. The result also means Portugal, who earlier beat Czech Republic 3-1, became the first team to reach the quarter-finals. They are top of the group with six points ahead of the Czechs and Turkey on three with the Swiss bottom with no points. The victory was a measure of revenge for the Turks because the last time they met Switzerland, in a World Cup qualifying playoff in 2005 in Istanbul, the Swiss went through on the away goals rule and the match ended in a touchline brawl. "It's a wonderful feeling," said Turkey coach Fatih Terim. "The players need it for their confidence and I congratulate them on their incredible efforts. "The three points give us a lot of hope for the last match (against Czech Republic on Sunday). We're still here and still playing. This is the beginning of the Euros for us." BIG DISAPPOINTMENT Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn added: "It's a very, very big disappointment. The whole country is probably as disappointed as the team. You hope for so much and go all out. But at the end of the day it's not enough. That's football." Arda's goal, which came from a superb counter-attacking move after the Swiss had a chance to go 2-1 ahead themselves, keeps Turkey afloat in the tournament after torrential rain had reduced the pitch to a quagmire in the first half. A 30-minute downpour that began soon after kickoff made conditions in the first half almost unplayable as the increasingly rain-sodden surface became dotted with puddles. For a few minutes it looked as if the match might have to be abandoned, but the worst of the rain passed by halftime and the pitch improved in the second period. Switzerland had taken the lead in the 32nd minute with a goal that owed as much to the conditions as to the quick thinking of forward Eren Derdiyok. Forced out wide he hit a low cross into the box that eluded goalkeeper Volkan Demirel, and bounced in and out of a puddle before falling for Hakan Yakin who poked it into an empty net. Turkey equalised after 57 minutes when substitute Semih Senturk outjumped Swiss skipper Ludovic Magnin to reach Nihat Kahveci's cross and power an unstoppable header past Benaglio. The second half was evenly balanced and Volkan had to make a fine double save from Yakin and Swiss substitute Ricardo Cabanas late on before Arda collected a superb pass from Tuncay Sanli before cutting inside to score from the edge of the area
