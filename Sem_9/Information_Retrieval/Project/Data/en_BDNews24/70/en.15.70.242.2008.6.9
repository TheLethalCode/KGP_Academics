 BOSTON, Mon Jun 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sen. Edward Kennedy, the patriarch of America's most famous political family, will return home to Massachusetts on Monday, a week after surgery for removal of a malignant brain tumor, his office said. "His doctors are pleased with his progress since surgery ... and he will continue to recuperate at home before starting the next phase of his treatment," his office said in a statement. It said Kennedy, 76, was returning to his home in Hyannis Port, after initial recuperation at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, where he underwent surgery last Monday. "In the interest of family privacy, there will not be regular updates regarding the senator's daily schedule or treatment plans moving forward," the senator's office said. Kennedy, the youngest brother of slain President John F. Kennedy, was diagnosed on May 17 with a malignant brain tumor called a glioma, which usually proves fatal within three years. His doctors at Duke said Kennedy will begin targeted radiation and chemotherapy treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. There has been no word on when he may return to work in the Senate
