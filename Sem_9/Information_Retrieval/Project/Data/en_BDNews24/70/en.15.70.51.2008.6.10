<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia said Tuesday the caretaker government has no jurisdiction to enforce new taxes in the budget. "Our constitution hasn't mandated a caretaker government with the authority of slapping taxes on the citizens. I call this an instance of crossing the limits," said Khaleda as she faced charge-framing proceedings in the Gatco graft case. She was produced before the Special Judge's Court-3 Tuesday morning along with her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco and other accused. Judge Shahed Nuruddin adjourned the charge-framing proceedings to resume on June 16. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain along with other lawyers stood for her defence in court. Khaleda's lawyers narrated her statements to reporters outside the court after the court proceedings ended. They said Khaleda once again rejected the Gatco charges against her involving, saying they were aimed at harassing her politically. They said she sought justice. "I seek justice. The court must ensure that everybody gets justice, as every citizen has the right to seek justice in the court of law," Khaleda was quoted as saying by one of her lawyers. She demanded that the government must send her two ailing sonsTarique Rahman and Cocoabroad for better treatment. The lawyers said Khaleda also demanded the lifting of emergency rule and introduction of food rationing and OMS programmes for the poor. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Khaleda and 12 others on Sept 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station. The ACC later pressed charges, on May 13 this year, against some 25 people. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque shifted trial proceedings to the special court on May 28 on security grounds. Former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, one of the original accused, was dropped from the chargesheet after his death. Seven people accused in the case are still absconding. bdnews24.com/pc/ff
