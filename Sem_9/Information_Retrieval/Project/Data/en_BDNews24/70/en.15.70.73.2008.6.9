<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  US Ambassador James F Moriarty said Monday he thought the caretaker government was proceeding on the right path, although he declined to comment specifically on whether the government's efforts to send the two former prime ministers was a revival of the 'minus two formula'. The ambassador directed his comments to reporters following a meeting with M Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of energy and mineral resources. When reporters queried him on the detentions of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, Moriarty said the government's efforts to create a strong democracy should bear fruit in the future. The US envoy said he would not comment specifically on the fate of the BNP or Awami League chiefs, adding that the issue was for the government, people and political parties of Bangladesh to decide on. Moriarty also held separate meetings, earlier in the day, with the CA's special assistant in charge of post and telecommunications Abdul Malek, and the CA's special assistant in charge of fisheries and livestock ministry Manik Lal Samadder. bdnews24.
