 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  A 23-member Pakistan cricket team arrived in Dhaka Friday noon to play a tri-nation one-day international series involving India, Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh. Pakistan, led by Shoaib Malik, will take on Bangladesh Sunday in the tournament opener before facing their archrivals India in their second and final group match Tuesday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The Pakistan team are playing the series as preparation for the Asia Cup in the hopes that it will be a competitive tournament. "It will be a preparatory series for us ahead of the Asia Cup later this month as we had earlier played against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh at home and this time we have to play against India and Bangladesh," key player Shahid Afridi told reporters on arrival at Zia International Airport Friday. Afridi thought that the absence of pace duo Shoaib Akhter and Mohammad Asif would affect the side, but he believed they would nevertheless do well with the squad comprising experienced and young cricketers. The all-rounder considered hosts Bangladesh a strong side, and that their win against Pakistan in 1999 was not a 'fluke', which they proved after having later defeated Australia and India. The final between the two top finishers of the group will take place at the same venue on June 14. The four-match series will be day-night affairs, with Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium seeing day-night cricket matches for the first time since it was christened 'the home of cricket' in December 2006. The Indian cricket team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, are scheduled to arrive in the capital on Sunday. Pakistan squad: Shoaib Malik (capt), Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Muhammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Khan, Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftikhar, Wahab Riaz, Nomanullah, Fawad Alam and Bazid Khan.
