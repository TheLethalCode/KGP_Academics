 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)--Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka for the US Thursday, a day after she was released from prison. The Awami League chief left Zia International Airport by British Airways at 8:27am. Hasina's special aide Hasan Mahmud and chief security officer Tareq Siddiqui were seen with her when she left her Sudha Sadan home for the airport. Hasina is scheduled to meet her sister Sheikh Rehana during a stopover at Heathrow Airport, Mahmud told reporters in a morning press briefing at Sudha Sadan. Mahmud said the former prime minister was not released on parole. "It was an unconditional release," he said, pointing to apparent misreporting in the media. Security officials escorted Hasina to Zia International Airport, reports bdnews24.com's Abu Noman Sajib. Senior AL leaders including Zillur Rahman saw their party chief off at the airport, reports bdnews24.com's Sumon Mahbub. Security was tight on the road to the airport.
