 VIENNA, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA president Michel Platini said on Wednesday he was delighted with the first week of action at Euro 2008, both in terms of football and behaviour. "We have passed the first milestone, with eight matches now already behind us," Platini told www.UEFA.com ahead of Portugal's 3-1 win over Czech Republic in the ninth. "All the teams have played and all the stadiums have hosted their first match. "We've seen some great football, with some exciting action and a quantity of goals which is well within the average for a 16-team European Championship. "There is no denying that the instructions calling for respect have had an undeniable impact. "On the field, and this is the most significant effect, we've seen a spectacular decrease in the number of yellow and red cards. In fact, no red cards have been shown so far and the number of yellow cards is down by 40 percent compared with Euro 2004." After eight games there had been 24 yellow cards and, with only two being shown in the Czech Republic versus Portugal game, the average dipped under three. NO INCIDENTS "In the stadiums, there have been no incidents to report  the crowds have been enthusiastic and excited by all the action on the field," Platini said. "What's more, we've heard all the different groups of supporters singing their national anthems, as well as respecting and even applauding the national anthem of the other team. Bravo!" Platini said the fan zones were proving hugely successful, though he did voice regret at the incidents in Klagenfurt when there were 157 arrests around the Germany versus Poland game. He also had some interesting comments about Ruud van Nistelrooy's controversial opening goal in Netherlands' 3-0 win over world champions Italy when he was played onside by Christian Panucci even though the defender was off the field. "This first series of matches also produced a nice bit of controversy about the laws of the game, which triggered superb debate about the offside rule which was worthy of the finest debates that take place in the courts of our continent," said the former France midfielder. "I think everyone has learned something from this episode." He added that TV viewing figures were breaking records in many countries. "I hope that all these positive trends continue," he said
