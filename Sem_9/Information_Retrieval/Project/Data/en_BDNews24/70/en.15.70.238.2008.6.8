 Dhaka, June 8 (bndews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda warned potential election candidates Sunday against convening any large crowds, that might halt traffic or disrupt the peace, as they go to submit their nomination forms. "Those who gather large crowds of supporters or hold mass meetings will have their candidacy cancelled," the CEC said at a training programme for trainers of field-level election officials at the Election Training Institute. He also cautioned the candidates that defiance of electoral rules by any means would lead to cancellation of their candidacy. He called upon the officials to assist all in learning and abiding by the rules properly. Election candidates will not be allowed to take their campaigns to religious or sacred sites such as mosques and temples, said Huda, adding that there would be a total of 20 restrictions on campaigning activities in the election laws. "The new laws are not very difficult but a little complicated. So the people concerned will have to be well informed beforehand," he said. The authorities have taken up a series of training programmes to raise awareness of the 'dos and don'ts' relating to election candidates and their campaigns. Huda stressed mass awareness among grassroots candidates about the election rules as a lack of knowledge would be no defence against cancellation of candidacy. "I hope honest and competent candidates will come up in future," he said. The Election Commission will announce the election schedule for polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities by June 20, the CEC reminded those present. Deputy election commissioners, district election officials and other government officials from across the country participated in the three day training course. bdnews24.
