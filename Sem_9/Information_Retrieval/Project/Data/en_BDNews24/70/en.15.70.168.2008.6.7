<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  A senior Awami League leader said Saturday that the two detained former prime ministers, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, could not be eliminated from politics. Demanding unconditional release of party leader Sheikh Hasina, acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "The 'minus two' theory is over." "We hope that good sense will prevail upon the government." "We believe that the government will send Sheikh Hasina abroad for treatment after releasing her. The country will return to a normal situation and she will return home," he told reporters after laying floral tributes at the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the Bangabandhu Museum, to mark the day the nation's six-point charter of liberation was first announced. "Hasina should be sent abroad after releasing her without attaching any condition." Ashraful mentioned the moves by his party for Hasina's release, including a letter to the chief adviser and a countrywide mass signature campaign starting from Saturday. "We will join the polls under Sheikh Hasina's leadership. We hope the party will form a government under her leadership as prime minister." Ashraful said nobody had contacted them so far about any recommendations by the medical board to send Hasina abroad for treatment on parole, as some national dailies have reported. Earlier in the day, AL presidium members, working committee members, Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League and other front organisations placed wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujib and observed one-minute silence to mark historic June 7. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman officially announced the six-point charter for liberation from Pakistan on June 7, 1966. He first placed the six-point demands at a meeting of political parties in Lahore on Feb 2, 1966. Later, on Mar 1 the same year, an Awami League council in Dhaka decided on the six-point demand as the charter for freedom and self-rule of the Bangalees. On June 7, 1966, hartal (general strike) was observed throughout the then East Pakistan to realise the six point-charter for liberation announced by Sheikh Mujib on the day. Eleven people were shot dead by the Pakistan police during the hartal. The six-point charter was one of the major movements ahead of the liberation war of 1971. bdnews
