 BERNE, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Roberto Donadoni refused to blame a controversial first goal for Italy's 3-0 thrashing by Netherlands in their Euro 2008 opener on Monday. Ruud van Nistelrooy appeared to be offside when he turned the ball home although Italy defender Christian Panucci was lying behind the byline having been accidentally pushed out of play by Gianluigi Buffon as the goalkeeper went to punch. The world champions protested to Swedish referee Peter Frojdfeldt and the Azzurri fans joined in having seen a replay of the 26th-minute incident on the stadium's big screen. But the goal stood. "I don't like to talk about referees's decisions. A goal is a goal and it is impossible to change the decision," Donadoni told a news conference after the Group C tie. "We accept it." Italy striker Luca Toni was convinced it was offside. "I looked at the replay during the match and it looked to me as if it was offside," he told reporters. "I said to the referee, 'look at the replay'. But he didn't look so that was that." PHYSICAL QUALITY Italy were outmuscled by the Dutch in midfield and also failed to create many clearcut chances. "We weren't very good. The Dutch players have physical quality," said Donadoni, adding he was alarmed by some of his side's defending. France's 0-0 draw with Romania in the other Group C game on Monday gives Italy hope of rescuing the situation. Donadoni's men next face Romania on Friday and France on June 17. "It has just been one of those nights, now we must look forward. It's hard but you must be optimistic. There are other games (to play)," the coach said
