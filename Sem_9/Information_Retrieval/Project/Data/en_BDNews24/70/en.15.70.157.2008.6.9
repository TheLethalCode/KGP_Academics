 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka magistrate has ordered the government to restore the passports of detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, that were seized after her arrest and detention a year ago. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Abdullah Al Mamun gave the order Monday to return the passports to Hasina's counsel Kamrul Islam, as the former prime minister's lawyers sought to clear a legal path for her treatment overseas. Special public prosecutor Sarder Shohidul Islam told the court the state did not object to returning Hasina's three passports. Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com of the three, two were expired and one was current. "We will probably get the passports back today," he added. Dhanmondi police confiscated Hasina's passports when she was arrested from her home in Dhanmondi on July 16, last year. bdnews24
