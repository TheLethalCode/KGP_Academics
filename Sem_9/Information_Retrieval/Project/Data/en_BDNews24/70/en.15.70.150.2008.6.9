 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Archrivals India and Pakistan enter the fray for the seventh time in Bangladesh when they face each other Tuesday in the Kitply tri-nation one-day international series at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. No doubt, a large number of fans of both teams in Bangladesh are gearing up to watch the exciting match, but monsoonal rains could hamper the match as Tuesday's forecast reads light to moderate rain. Whether inclement weather permits holding the match, both teams Monday practiced, the Indian cricketers for over three hours in the morning while only six Pakistani players had light practice in the afternoon at 'the home of cricket' in Mirpur. Coaches of both the sides expect the match to be an exciting one. "It's going to be a great game." said India's South African coach Garry Kirsten. "As you have pointed out, every India-Pakistan game is great, and I know that our guys are very geared-up for this match. They are very motivated for the game. So there is no doubt about the motivation, about the intensity. They know that they are representing their countries. It's a big game." Opener Virender Shewag was kept out of Monday's practice following his slight cold, but Kirsten said that the all players were fit and available for the selection. All the Indian cricketers were involved in the Indian Premier League, and it was an inevitable question whether they would face problems playing a 50-over-a-side match after their long involvement in the twenty20 IPL matches. "We worked hard on it in the last two days and we just want to make sure our game plan, our strategies are designed for a 50-over cricket game. It is different to what we were doing in the IPL," said Kirsten. We felt no pressure and prepared to face Pakistan and the boys were enjoying here, Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters during the practice session. On the other hand, Pakistan's Australian coach Geoff Lawson also thinks the match will be a very close and high quality one with no team as favourites. "There will not be any favourite and it will be a very close, very high quality match," Lawson told reporters before the practice session. "We had recently a pretty close record against India and they finished just in front of us, but we want to make our 12th unbeaten match the 13th," said the 52-year old Australian. The Pakistan coach said that India was a good opponent and their players were in form after having done well in the IPL. "I think India will be confident after having played good cricket against Australia, but we had had very close games against them recently." warned Lawson. The Australian coach also said that the controversy over the players would not affect the game as the players played some pretty cricket since he took charge in July 2007. Pakistan won 66 in 113 outings they had played against India while India won 43 times as there were no results in four.
