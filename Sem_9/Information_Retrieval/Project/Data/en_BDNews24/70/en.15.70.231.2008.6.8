 TOKYO, Sun Jun 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man who said he was tired of life went on a stabbing rampage on Sunday in a popular Tokyo shopping district, killing six people, Japanese media reported. The man drove a truck into a crowd of pedestrians and then attacked passers-by with a knife in Akihabara district, known for its discount electronics and maid cafes, at lunchtime. "I came to Akihabara to kill people," Kyodo news agency quoted the attacker as telling police. "I am tired of the world. Anyone was OK. I came alone." Six people were killed, including a woman and three men aged 19, 47 and 74, Kyodo said. Another 12 were wounded during the attack in a crowded street. "It's pretty shocking, considering that I come here all the time," a man told NHK television, which said the attacker was shouting as he cut down his victims. Nippon Television showed footage of a slight, blood-splattered man being arrested by police. Rescue services said several were killed or injured. A spokesman for Tokyo police said he was unable to confirm the arrest. The street, usually crowded with tourists and locals seeking cheap gadgets, was cleared by police, who painstakingly gathered clues amid pools of blood. As well as electronics, Akihabara has become known in recent years as a centre for Japan's expansive "nerd" culture of video games, comic books and outlandish fashion -- including street performers and cafes with waitresses dressed as French maids. Although Japan has relatively little violent crime, several recent high-profile cases have raised public concern about violence, leading to increased penalties. Shooting deaths still remain rare in Japan, although there have been some recent cases involving "yakuza" crime groups
