"This is a turning point election," she said, in the speech broadcast live on the BBC. "We must help elect Obama as president." She urged her supporters "to work as hard for Obama as (you did) for me." She spoke of Obama's "grace and wit" during the nomination race, saying: "Together Obama and I achieved milestones."
