<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Usha Krira Chakra retained their Premier Hockey League title Friday when the old Dhaka outfit handed a 4-2 defeat to Abahani Limited in the Super League's last encounter at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. The victory marks the club's 12th win in 13 matches, and brings Usha's point tally to 36. The club clinched the title with a five point cushion over last season's co-champions Abahani, who also lost to Usha in the first-leg of the fixture. Maksudul Alam Habul found the back of the net twice for Usha, while Shahidullah Titu and Pakistani Tareq Aziz netted one goal apiece. Debutant Pakistani Kasif Ali scored both of Abahani's consolation goals. This is the second title for Usha since the premier hockey league was introduced in 1998, after emerging joint-champions with Abahani in 2006. Following the match, Usha's Pakistani coach Jahir Ahmed told reporters that their strategy of "counter-attack" had borne fruit, and they had managed to capitalise on most of their opportunities. Abahani coach, Mahbub Haroon, conceded that failures in defence in the second half had led to an inability to maintain any momentum following a respectable first half outing. Haroon also criticised his strikers for squandered several good opportunities. Striker Habul supplied Usha with an early lead when he scored a field goal in the fifth minute, then it was up to Kasif to level the score board for Abahani when he converted a penalty corner in the 22nd minute. Midfielder Titu put Usha ahead for the second time one minute into the second half, and Aziz made it 3-1 from a field goal in the 41st minute. Kasif reduced the Abahani margin in the 55th minute, converting their sixth penalty corner; before Habul sealed the match for Usha three minute from time to the joy of club faithful. bd
