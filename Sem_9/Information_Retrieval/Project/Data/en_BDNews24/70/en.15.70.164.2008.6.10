 LONDON, Tue Jun 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World oil demand will rise at its slowest pace in six years during 2008 as a recent raft of subsidy cuts in several Asian countries cuts into oil demand, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. The adviser to 27 industrialized economies said in its monthly Oil Market Report that global oil consumption will now rise by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 230,000 bpd less than its previous forecast. The head of the IEA's oil industry and markets division, Lawrence Eagles, told Reuters this year's demand growth will be the slowest since 2002. Rising oil prices have forced several developing economies in Asia to take the knife to subsidies in recent weeks. India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan have all revised their administered prices of fuel, which the IEA said would tame oil demand growth in the region slightly. "The lull in oil demand growth, however, may only be temporary as strong economic growth remains the key driving force," the IEA said, adding that prospects of a substantial cut in subsidies in China and the Middle East were remote. The IEA also cut its forecast for non-OPEC supply growth to 460,000 bpd, against 680,000 bpd in its previous report. It raised its expected demand for OPEC oil for the year by 300,000 bpd to 31.6 million bpd. Oil prices pared losses after the IEA's report. US crude was 25 cents down at $134.10 a barrel by 0820 GMT, off lows of $133.41. Oil hit a record high of $139.12 a barrel last Friday
