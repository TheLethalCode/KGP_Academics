 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday proposed to revise the tax rate for companies listed for public trading from 30 percent to 27.5 percent. In his budget speech for fiscal 2008-09, the adviser also proposed to cut the tax rate for the companies not listed for public trading to 37.5 percent from 40 percent. The rate for banks, insurers, financial institutions and mobile phone operators will, however, remain unchanged at 45 percent. The adviser proposed to impose income tax on dividend income in accordance with the applicable scheduled rates for companies instead of existing 15 percent. Currently, according to Section 16CC of the Income Tax Ordinance, all companies, irrespective of profit or loss, have to pay a minimum tax on the basis of their turnover which is clearly in breach of the fundamental principles of Income Tax. bd
