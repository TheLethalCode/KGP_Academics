<TITLE> Vettori says England too strong for New Zealand </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NOTTINGHAM, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said his side had been dominated by England after slumping to an innings defeat with almost two days to spare in the third test at Trent Bridge on Sunday. The innings and nine run margin gave England a 2-0 series victory after New Zealand were dismissed for 232 following on. "I don't want to take anything away from England. They have dominated us since (the second test at) Old Trafford on the third day," Vettori told reporters. "We have to appreciate how well they played and how well their swing bowlers swung the ball. "We have not been able to keep up with the pace of England. It's a lack of ability on our part and a lack of fortitude as well. When you get guys like James Anderson (nine wickets in the match) bowling the way he did there is very little you can do." Vettori, who was one of the last five New Zealand wickets to fall on the fourth morning for 35 runs, said England will be a tough proposition for Graeme Smith's South Africa when the teams meet over four tests in July and August. "If they can put performances in consistently like that and with Andrew Flintoff (back after injury) as well they will have a very complete team," Vettori added. "Once he comes back they will be very hard to beat. The South Africa series will be a good one to watch." England and New Zealand now contest a five-match one-day series from June 15, preceded by a one-off Twenty20 international at Old Trafford on Friday
