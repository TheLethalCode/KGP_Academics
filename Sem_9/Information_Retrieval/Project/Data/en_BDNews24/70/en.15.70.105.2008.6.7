 Chittagong, June 7 (bdnews24.com)--Inspector General of Police Noor Mohammad has rejected the claim by US-based Human Rights Watch that a crackdown of mass arrests in Bangladesh was politically motivated. "The special drive is being conducted to create an environment conducive to national elections in December," he told reporters in Chittagong on Saturday. Speaking after the launch of a website for Bangladesh Police, Chittagong Range, the IGP claimed that the drive was not aimed at harassing anybody politically. "The drive was initiated against those who faced arrest warrants or cases." On the arrest of local leaders of Awami League and BNP, he said: "If any political leader or worker is arrested, it means there is a specific allegation or case against him. It is never motivated." Such arrests were regularly monitored, Noor Mohammed added. When asked if they were being shown arrested under the emergency powers rules, he said that a very small number of arrestees fell under that category. The inspector general told journalists that the rate of crime had increased as the ban on indoor politics had been withdrawn, and hence the drive was being conducted. When asked about allegations that members of the police force were earning money through this drive in different areas of the country, he said: "No specific allegation in this regard has been received. If there are allegations, action will surely be taken." Speaking at the launch ceremony earlier, Noor Mohammad said the police force needed overhauling. It could not be undertaken in the past for many reasons, nor is it possible to make a change overnight, he said. "But steps are being taken so that no one is harassed by the police," the IGP said. Chittagong Range deputy inspector general of police, Shahidul Haque, presided over the occasion. Chittagong Metropolitan Police commissioner M Akbar Ali, Chittagong Range additional DIG Monzur Quader Khan and senior police officers were also present. bdne
