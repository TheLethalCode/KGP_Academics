 Beirut, June 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged Lebanese leaders on Saturday to seal reconciliation through dialogue and commitment to an agreement that has pulled the country back from the brink of civil war. Sarkozy, heading a large delegation, arrived in Beirut for a one-day state visit. He became the first Western leader to visit the Lebanese capital since the election of President Michel Suleiman last month. Lebanon's political crisis was defused by a Qatari-mediated agreement in Doha after the worst bout of internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. Suleiman was elected in line with the deal but leaders have so far struggled to form a national unity government. "The Doha agreement improved the situation and led to national reconciliation. President Suleiman has a major responsibility to make this reconciliation succeed," Sarkozy said at Beirut airport. "All sides must implement their commitments through dialogue," the French president said with Suleiman by his side. He added that the Lebanese must look forward to "a future based on dialogue". Sarkozy held talks with Suleiman before a lunch at the presidential palace to be attended by leaders of the main Lebanese political parties, including the Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah. Sarkozy was accompanied by Prime Minister Francois Fillon, senior ministers and leaders of all the main French political parties. He said his "exceptional" delegation reflected the strong bond between both countries. French Defense Minister Herve Morin will visit French peacekeepers in south Lebanon later in the day. France has 1,600 troops in the U.N. force deployed on the border with Israel. Lebanon won its independence from France in 1943 but Paris maintained strong ties to the country, especially with its Christian community, ever since. Sarkozy and his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, tried and failed to broker a deal to end the Lebanese crisis in December. But the recent breakthrough is set to improve ties between Paris and Damascus. Syria remains a key player in Lebanon and Sarkozy had demanded that it facilitate a solution in Lebanon before relations could improve.
