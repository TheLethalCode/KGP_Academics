<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina may go abroad for better medical treatment, if necessary, said her lawyer Sunday. But Khaleda Zia said she would take treatment at home. The government is likely to take a decision Sunday on sending the former prime ministers abroad for medical treatment, inspector general of prisons Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com after a meeting with home adviser MA Matin. Also, the government may send Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco abroad for treatment, he said. "No final decision has yet been taken. A high-level meeting might decide on the matter later in the day," Zakir said. The home adviser, however, declined to comment. Asked what they had discussed at the meeting, Zakir said: "We have discussed a number of issues. But we have not come to any decision on sending them abroad." The government had formed three medical boards to examine the health of Hasina, Khaleda and Coco Thursday. The boards submitted their reports to the government. Khaleda, who appeared in court in the Niko case Sunday, expressed her unwillingness to go abroad, when she spoke to reporters. "I am not going anywhere. There are good physicians at home." But a lawyer, Abdul Mannan Khan, quoted Hasina as saying that she would travel abroad for medical treatment if the doctors suggested so. Hasina appeared in court in the barge-mounted power plant case Sunday. "If the medical board recommends overseas treatment for her, she said, she would accept it," Khan said. "The hearing aid transplanted in her ear is not working anymore. The re-transplantation is possible only in the US," Khan told reporters, speaking on the condition of Hasina. "Sheikh Hasina's blood pressure is also unstable. It is fluctuating everyday." The special court Sunday concluded the recording of testimonies from three more witnesses in the barge mounted power plants case. Judge Feroz Alam of the Special Court-1 set June 12 for the next testimony-taking. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept 2 last year charging Hasina and others with taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in return for approving the installation of three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna during her term as prime minister. bdnews2
