 LUGANO, Switzerland, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An experienced Sweden got off to a flying start at Euro 2008 with a 2-0 win over Greece on Tuesday but how far they progress may depend on how far their older players can run. Coach Lars Lagerback's preference for experience over youth paid off against the defence-minded defending champions. But with eight of his starting line-up aged 30 or older, question marks remain over their ability to contend with a rampant Spain or a youthful Russia in their next two games. Timing is everything in soccer and Sweden's two goalsa piece of pure class from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a messy effort from defender Petter Hanssoncame at a perfect time. Having stepped up a gear in the second half, the Swedes got their just rewards against a Greek side lacking imagination. But after Hansson's goal, the Scandinavians looked worn out. With over 15 minutes left of the 90, they resembled a team which had just gone through extra time in a cup final. On Tuesday's evidence, had they not found the net in time, Sweden may have settled for a scoreless draw in the last quarter hour, a dangerous tactic against a vibrant Spain and Russia. Lagerback's lack of youthful vigour was compounded when 28-year-old winger Christian Wilhelmsson pulled up with a hamstring injury which looks likely to rule him out of the Spain game. Defender Niclas Alexandersson had to be replaced with cramp, while Ibrahimovic's knee problem means he is not guaranteed to last the whole 90 minutes. His 36-year-old strike partner Henrik Larsson also complained he was very tired after the Greece game and central defenders Olof Mellberg and Hansson also looked shattered. GOAL DROUGHT On the positive side, Ibrahimovic ended his goal drought with his first international goal since October 2005. He will hope his renewed partnership with Larssonwho looked sharp and worked tirelesslycould open the floodgates for him. If Lagerback chooses or is forced to change his tactics, he does have options, albeit limited. "If it had been 0-0, we have options on how to be more attacking," he said after the Greece game. The lively dead ball specialist Sebastian Larsson is likely to replace Wilhelmsson, killing two birds with one stone since Sweden's set pieces in and around the box lacked telling delivery against Greece. The more attacking Fredrik Stoor is capable of filling Alexandersson's boots at fullback and attacker Johan Elmander may not have the Ibrahimovic style but can be just as dangerous in his own right. But the there is no turbo injection for the engine room with Lagerback admitting Tobias Linderothhis only realistic alternative in central midfieldis not match fit
