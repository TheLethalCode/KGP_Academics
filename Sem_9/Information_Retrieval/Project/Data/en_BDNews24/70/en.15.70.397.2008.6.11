<TEXT>
 INNSBRUCK, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Villa said he was happier about Spain's emphatic 4-1 win over Russia in their opening Group D match on Tuesday than becoming the first player at Euro 2008 to score a hat-trick. "I'm very pleased about the way things went, but especially for the three points we've now got under our belts," the 26-year-old striker told reporters. "We all said it was vital to start with a win and we did just that. I'm also happy for the goals but that's the job I have to do." Villa struck his first after 20 minutes, steering into the open net after strike partner Fernando Torres drew the keeper and slipped the ball into his path. He grabbed his second on the stroke of halftime when he darted on to a neat through-ball by Andres Iniesta and completed his hat-trick with another cool finish 15 minutes from time. "It is difficult for the team to win and for a player to score three goals but that's what happened," he said. "It isn't a dream and I'm very happy about it. But the Valencia striker, who has now scored 17 goals in 42 international appearances, was anxious to dispel any euphoria following the win. "Now we have to keep on working because we've still got a long way to go," he said. "We have done no more than just take one step forward. "We could still be knocked out in the first stage despite this result.... Until we are assured of going through then we won't be thinking of anything else. "I hope the best is yet to come." Spain continue their group campaign against Sweden on Saturday and finish against holders Greece on June 1
