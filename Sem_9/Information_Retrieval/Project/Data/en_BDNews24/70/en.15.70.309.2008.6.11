 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government is ready to invite Awami League president Sheikh Hasina to political dialogue with her party, said education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Wednesday. Zillur, speaking to reporters after the government dialogue with Unity for Political Reforms (UPR), said: "We are ready to sit with Awami League and its chief Sheikh Hasina." "We had already sent an invitation to the party. We'll do the needful as soon as they notify us about their decision in this regard." The government decided to release Sheikh Hasina on parole on legal and humanitarian grounds, to facilitate her receiving proper medical treatment according to a medical board's recommendations, the adviser said. Asked if the government would also consider freeing detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her son Coco for treatment, Hossain Zillur said, "Any decision in this regard will also be based on both humanitarian and legal grounds." He said the government was treating the matter as most urgent. On the possibility of Sheikh Hasina attending the dialogue with the government, AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu told bdnews24.com: "We're waiting for our leader. All decisions will be taken once Sheikh Hasina is with us." bdnews24.com/ehb-ah
