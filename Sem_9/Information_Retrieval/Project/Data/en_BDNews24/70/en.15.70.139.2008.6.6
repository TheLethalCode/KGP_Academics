 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The twin blasts at the capital's Orchard Plaza Hotel last Sunday claimed their third victim on Friday when Sri Lankan citizen AR Samanthilake, injured in the explosions, died at the City Hospital in Mohammadpur. The body was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for autopsy at around midday. Officials from the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, who collected the victim's body following the post-mortem, told bdnews24.com that Samanthilake had come to Bangladesh on May 29 as part of the bank's annual audit. They said that Mrs Samanthilake arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday to attend her husband in hospital, and had been staying at a hotel in the city. Around 30 people were injured in two explosions at the Orchard Plaza Hotel in Naya Paltan on Sunday. The first explosion took place shortly after nine in the evening, while the second occurred at around 11.30pm. Members of the fire brigade, reporters and police were among the injured, as well as hotel guests and employees. The exact cause of the explosion is yet to be identified, but investigations are focusing on a possible short circuit or gas leak. Samanthilake is survived by his 14 year-old daughter and nine year-old son. The explosions earlier claimed two victims, hotel housekeeper Ali Azam Ahmed and hotel worker Kiron. bdnews
