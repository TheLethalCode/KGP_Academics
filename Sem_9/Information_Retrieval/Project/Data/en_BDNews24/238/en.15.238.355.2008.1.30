 ROME, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's president called Senate speaker Franco Marini to a meeting on Wednesday, fuelling speculation that the second highest-ranking official in the country could be asked to head an interim government. President Giorgio Napolitano is widely expected to ask him to seek cross-party consensus for an interim government with a mandate to reform election laws before Italy votes for a new parliament, after Prime Minister Romano Prodi quit last week. Napolitano, a former communist, and centre-left veteran Marini -- considered to have broad appeal because of his neutral role as Senate president -- were due to meet at 1600 GMT. But 74-year-old Marini, if appointed, would have a tough time convincing conservative opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi to drop his demands for immediate elections. "Our laws do not include the possibility of a government born exclusively to prepare for elections," said former prime minister Berlusconi, who lost power to Prodi in 2006 but has a clear lead over the fragmented centre left in opinion polls. His foe in an election would be Walter Veltroni, mayor of Rome and secretary of the Democratic Party founded with Prodi last year. Veltroni wants electoral reform first, which might give his party a fighting chance against Berlusconi. Italian business, where confidence is at a two-year low, asked politicians to work together for the best solution, while the European Commission urged the next government not to undo Prodi's work on reducing Italy's budget deficit. "I look forward to the continuation of these very good policies that were followed so far by Prodi and (his Economy Minister Tommaso) Padoa-Schioppa," said EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. Aided by a crackdown on tax evasion, the Prodi government looks to have got 2007 budget deficit under the EU ceiling for the first time in five years. Markets fear another free-spending Berlusconi government would reverse progress on the deficit and public debt, the highest in the EU. BERLUSCONI LEADS POLL A new poll suggested that if the existing coalitions faced off again, in a repeat of the 2006 elections, Berlusconi would win 54 percent versus 44.5 percent. The centre left would stand a better chance, said the poll by ISPO, if the main Democratic Party split from its partners -- which range from Catholics on one hand to communists on the other -- and ran alone. That would be a closer contest, with Berlusconi winning by a narrower margin of 51 percent versus 48.5 percent. Prodi resigned after his nine-party coalition, weakened by a small Catholic party's defection, lost a Senate confidence vote. His 20 months in office were constantly undermined by bickering among his allies. Industry chief Luca Cordero di Montezemolo said Italy desperately needed "governability and economic growth ... both require united efforts towards a shared solution". But with Berlusconi digging his heels in, consensus looked elusive, which could fuel popular distaste for the political class
