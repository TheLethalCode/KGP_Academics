 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh is to lose potential resources worth $700 million if it fails to achieve the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)-targeted 7 percent growth for the current fiscal year, a seminar was told Wednesday. Sluggish business activity, increasing inflation, price hike of petroleum products and fertiliser and pressure on the budget were the major challenges to the economy. "According to the Bangladesh Bank, the growth rate this year would be 6 percent against the 7 percent targeted in the PRSP. This shortfall would cost the country $700 million this fiscal year," Prof Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of the private think-tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said at a discussion on "State of Bangladesh Economy," at Gulshan in the city. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute (BEI) organised the discussion at its conference room with its president Farooq Sobhan in the chair. "We will require $3 billion instead of the previous $2billion to import the same quantity of petroleum products as we did as the prices of crude oil have almost doubled," Rahman said. He said that the government would feel a huge pressure on the budget in continuing subsidy on agriculture. "The government sells one kilogram of fertiliser at Tk 6 against the international rate of Tk 31 per kilogramme. This high subsidy will create a tremendous pressure on the budget," Rahman said. He said that poor implementation of the annual development programme (ADP) was a concern for the Bangladesh economy. "In six months of the current fiscal (July to December), only 21 percent of the ADP has been implemented. This is not encouraging at all," he added. "Food inflation for the poor and marginal people is about 21 percent and has made people more vulnerable," said economist Dr Atiur Rahman. He said that the import of machinery (capital machinery) was low indicating to the slow economic activities in the country. "About 200 business people are out of the country or not doing business now. This is not good for the economy," said Dr Atiur Rahman, chief of an NGO Unnoyon Sumonnoy. Farooq Sobhan said that Bangladesh now had the highest amount in foreign reserves- $5 billion. "There is a tremendous flow of remittance into Bangladesh," said Sobhan, a former foreign secretary. Last year, non-resident Bangladeshis and expatriate workers remitted about $7 billion, according to the ministry of foreign affairs. A good number of diplomats, businessmen and bureaucrats, were present at the meeting. bdn
