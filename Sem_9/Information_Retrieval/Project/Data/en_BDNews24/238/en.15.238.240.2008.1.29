 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  An Indian firm has proposed to export 500,000 tonnes of rice to Bangladesh with each tonne priced below $500, a government official said Tuesday. State-run West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation (ECSC) submitted a bid Thursday to the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management to make the staple available. "The cost of per tonne of rice will not exceed 500 dollar. On Thursday we invited two officials from the ECSC to come to Bangladesh," Mollah Waheduzzaman, director general of the Directorate of Food, told bdnews24.com. The two officials are expected to arrive in Dhaka Wednesday to discuss the delivery schedule and other details of the deal. The ministry will refer ECSC's proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Pubic Purchase where the final work order will be given. A government delegation visited India earlier in the month to meet specified organisations to discuss the deal, although until now only ECSC have come forward with a proposal.
