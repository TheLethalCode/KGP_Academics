<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Shipping adviser MA Matin Thursday announced before disenchanted discontent shareholders that beleaguered Bangladesh Shipping Corporation would be made a public limited company (PLC) by July 1. Senior BSC officials faced the wrath of the general shareholders at the annual general meeting of the state-run organisation Thursday over the BSC sliding into a less profitable concern. The shareholders expressed the fear that the organisation might not exist in the next five years if the situation persisted and urged authorities to intervene to save it. Matin, also BSC chairman, who presided over the AGM at the BSC auditorium in the port city, said the deplorable state was unacceptable. "I'm not at all satisfied with the present activities. Here the achievement is way short of the expectation. I have no hesitation in accepting the failures of the BSC in the present situation, but this must change." He directed the BSC officials to start work to fulfil the demand of the shareholders after the AGM. The adviser said the government was working to making BSC a profitable organisation. It had approved the purchase of a new container-carrying ship at a cost of Tk 84 crore. He assured the shareholders of immediate steps to implement the construction of a 30-storey commercial building for BSC in Dhaka and purchase of the ship. He said in last two decades, the BSC fleet had come down to 13 ships from 26. This was the biggest proof of the BSC's vulnerability. There would be massive reform and new structure like those of Biman, he added. When it was announced at the meeting that time was limited and the statements would be heard later, about 400 members from among 1580 shareholders became agitated. Later, they calmed down at the intervention of the adviser and some were allowed to speak. The shareholders protested renting out of ships instead of running them. They said corruption and irregularities were the main causes of the pitiable condition of the state-run concern. Shareholder Rafiquddin Ahmed said that if ships were rented out, there was no need for the BSC to have such a big manpower. Another shareholder, Rokeya Jebunnesa, said the BSC was losing wealth every year because of lack of competent leadership, farsightedness and irregularities. Agrani Bank additional general manager Abul Hashem Khan who represented the bank at the meeting said though the BSC had made profits in last few years, it would take more than 65 years to recover its total losses. BSC executive director Shahidul Alam said the average age of the 13 existing ships had crossed 25 years. If no new ship were added to the fleet, the BSC would only exist in paper within five years, he added. Earlier, BSC managing director Kamrul Alam Rabbani announced that the organisation made a net profit of Tk 15.96 crore in the last fiscal year (2006-07) and a dividend of 10 percent was announced. He said in six months from July 2007, the BSC had a total income of Tk 14 crore. Shipping secretary Enayet Ullah and BSC executive director Abdul Hannan Sheikh were also present. bdnews24.c
