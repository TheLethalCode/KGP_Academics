<TITLE> South Africa's power crisis also an opportunity </TITLE>

 LONDON, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - What did South Africa have before candles? Answer: electricity. This has become an unfunny joke for Africa's biggest economy, which this week restored power to its all-important mines, but faces years of tight supply. Critics say the government ignored warnings from experts as early as 10 years ago about the scale of investment needed. It now has limited short-term options, although for the long term, there could be opportunities for the region as a whole. "It's going to be very challenging, including for the world cup," said Alex Vines of London-based think-tank Chatham House. South Africa is to stage the 2010 Soccer World Cup. "They have not planned for the kind of growth .... especially providing for South Africa's black majority." Expansion has averaged 5.1 percent, while the infrastructure was designed to cope with annual growth of around 3.5 percent, analysts have said. "It means the system is going to be tight, but it does not necessarily mean brown outs and blackouts," said Brian Statham, chairman of the South Africa National Energy Association. Short-term solutions he favoured included exponential tariffs, meaning consumers pay more if they use more, to encourage efficiency balanced with subsidies to ensure the poorest are not starved of power. COMBINATION OF FACTORS State utility Eskom [ESCJ.UL] said the current crisis began after some power plants were closed for routine maintenance. Others broke down unexpectedly and coal stocks have dwindled after unseasonably wet weather flooded some open pits. The complex underlying situation stems from a government refusal to allow Eskom to invest enough, while private investors, wary the cheapest power tariffs in the world would limit their profits, did not fill the breach, Statham said. Following recurrent power cuts and dips in voltage, or brown outs, Eskom on Jan. 25 cut electricity to the country's mines after the gap between supply and demand fell to an unprecedented 4,000 megawatts, threatening to cause the entire electricity network to collapse. "The scale of the problem is indicated starkly by the production problems experienced by the mines. This is the most acid signal of the size of the supply-demand imbalance," said independent analyst Jayesh Parmar. "There are no easy answers to the challenge of bringing significant generation onstream quickly." Eskom said on Wednesday it would increase electricity supply to mines by up to 90 percent by the end of this week and has already raised supplies to 80 percent for most mines. But it has asked that miners and other big industries cut back their electricity consumption by 10 percent and warned it will start to ration supplies for all its customers in March. Supplies are likely to be tight until it can bring on new capacity in about five years' time, Eskom has said, and has gone as far as requesting South Africa should not be promoted as a major investment destination. COAL DOMINANT Halting mining activity on one level aggravated the problem because coal stockpiles to supply South Africa's power stations, the bulk of which are run on coal, were low. The Department of Minerals and Energy said around 77 percent of South Africa's primary energy needs are provided by coal. Another near-term solution is to focus on using South Africa's coal reserves for domestic needs, rather than more lucrative coal export markets. "They have been a bit cavalier in terms of exporting the coal rather than focusing on domestic use," Statham said. Eskom would pay more for its coal if the emphasis shifts, but that could feed into the higher tariffs needed to encourage efficiency. South Africa is the fifth largest coal-producing country in the world, says Eskom, and coal is likely to remain central, but future investment could encourage some diversification and also cleaner use of coal. "There are massive coal reserves in South Africa. You can't expect South African people to abandon them," Statham said. "But it's an opportunity to diversify and to look at how to use coal more efficiently and more benignly." Building a new coal plant can take around five years, but is likely to take around twice that because of the wait for parts and bureaucratic hurdles, analysts say. South Africa is also looking to increase nuclear capacity, but that takes even longer to come onstream. As the regional giant, it has exported power and its problems have had knock-on effects for neighbours. For the future, countries like Botswana and Zambia, which have their own power projects, could help to provide South Africa with electricity. "The big advantage of all of this is in terms of regional opportunities," said Razia Khan of Standard Chartered Bank.
