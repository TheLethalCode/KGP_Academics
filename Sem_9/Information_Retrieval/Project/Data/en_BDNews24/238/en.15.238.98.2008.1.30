<TEXT>
 TAMALE, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angola coach Luis Oliveira Goncalves said his team will avoid the temptation to play for a draw against Tunisia (1700) on Thursday when a point apiece will send both through to the African Nations Cup quarter-finals. "We're going for a win and try to guarantee our place without depending on other teams," he said. "We are going to play our game and fight for victory in every game, regardless of the opponents." Angola, who pulled off a shock 3-1 win over Senegal on Sunday, and Tunisia are level on four points from two games at the top of Group D. Senegal and South Africa, who meet at the same time in Kumasi, have one point each.

Former Poland defender Kasperczak said he took full responsibility for the team's results, although there is speculation that the squad is split down the middle. The Senegal players were seen to argue amongst themselves during the Angola match with captain El Hadji Diouf repeatedly remonstrating with his team mates. South Africa, who are concentrating on building a team for 2010 when they host the World Cup, see the game as another chance to test their young side. German-based striker Sibusiso Zuma is also hoping to get off the mark in the tournament after failing to hit the target against Angola or Tunisia. "I want to score in the next match, I don't want to leave here without scoring," he said. "Our game will be based on attacking and I hope we manage not to make any mistakes this time. "The boys know we made mistakes last time so we are just ready to play and try and win the game." Goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs added: "We've got people at home who are supporting us, our technical staff have full confidence in us, so why can't we go out and do the job
