<TITLE> BFF to sit with clubs to finalise players' transfers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) - In a bid to finalise the date for the inter-club footballers' transfers, the B. League Committee holds a meeting with the professional football league clubs Tuesday. "We hope that we will be able to announce the transfer date tomorrow (Tuesday) after the discussion with the clubs," said B. League manager Abu Nayeem Shohag. Country's top footballers on Jan 17 threatened to boycott all types of tournaments with their demand for transfers as the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is apparently inactive since the first-ever B. League (professional football league) concluded in August last. To resolve the matter, the B. League committee , after three days, sat with the clubs, which cleared the committee to announce a fresh date for transfers as they saw no problem in taking part in the transfers. All hoped that the BFF, at its executive committee meeting on Jan 24, would announce the transfer date but it asked the league committee to meet again with the clubs before announcing the date by February. "We don't know why they again call us as we had earlier told them to announce the transfer date," said Mustaqur Rahman, additional general secretary and coordinator of the professional football league clubs. Rahman said they would want to know whether the federation would be able to maintain the calendar they revealed on Feb 24 as the clubs want to rope in the players in keeping with the duration of the games. The second edition of B. League is expected to roll in the field in April for five months after the Independence Cup Football tournament in March. The window of the transfers will remain open until the previous day of the start of B. League, according to bylaws.
