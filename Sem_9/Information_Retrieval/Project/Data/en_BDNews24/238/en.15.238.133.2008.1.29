<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina's Canadian lawyer Payam Akhavan raised questions Tuesday about the trial process of the detained former prime minister. Expressing doubts at a press conference he has appealed to the concerned authorities for permission to meet Sheikh Hasina in special jail. At the same time he has sought the government's permission to observe Hasina's trial process at the special court set up at the Sangsad Bhaban. Speaking to reporters at the Hotel Sonargaon, he questioned whether Hasina would receive justice in the trial process that was brought under the Emergency Powers Rules. Such a process deprived a person of the rights guaranteed by the Bangladesh constitution and international human rights laws, Akhavan said. Questions raised about the allegations brought against Hasinaespecially in the light of Azam J Chowdhury's recent public statementsadded to the concerns, he said. Professor of law at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and a former UN war crimes prosecutor, Akhavan said the responsibility of deciding the next leadership of Bangladesh does not lie "with the caretaker government or any military ruler". The responsibility of the caretaker government is to hold a free, fair and neutral election, he said, adding that the country's constitution gives the present government that power. But it is the people of the country that will decide who leads the next elected government through a mandate, the Canadian lawyer said. It has to be understood that Sheikh Hasina is a leader of the people and it is they who will give a verdict about her, he added. Explaining his objective in coming to Bangladesh Akhavan said he was here at the behest of Sheikh Hasina's family. The law professor said he was here to assist the former prime minister's defence lawyers in the trial process and to observe whether any human rights were being violated. Akhavan said he had also applied for a meeting with chief adviser Dr Fakhruddin Ahmed. According to international human rights law and articles of the UN Human Rights Council a person has the right to justice in a trial, he said. It must be ensured, he stressed, adding that the dissolution of people's right to bail under the Emergency Powers Rules was an obstruction to justice. Akhavan said he would speak to reporters again before leaving Dhaka on Friday. Akhavan arrived in Dhaka Monday seeking permission to see Hasina, now detained in a special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. He has yet to meet with Hasina as inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hassan said Tuesday there was no provision in the Jail Code for allowing Akhavan to see the former prime minister in jail. A foreign lawyer may be granted access to a foreign national detained in a Bangladesh prison through the intervention of the diplomatic mission of the country, and only if Bangladesh allows it, the IGP said. But the Jail Code does not allow for a foreign lawyer to have access to any Bangladeshi detainee, he added. "Since he wants to see a Bangladeshi citizen in jail, that's not possible," he said. bdnews24.com/
