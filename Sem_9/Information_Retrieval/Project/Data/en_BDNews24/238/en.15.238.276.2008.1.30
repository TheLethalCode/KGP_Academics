 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)A philanthropist, who declined to identified, will donate $130 million to Bangladesh government to support rehabilitation work in the Sidr ravaged region, a spokesman said Tuesday. The government will receive the donation through Islamic Development Bank after a deal is signed on Feb 4. An IDB team, led by Dr MH Salem, Tuesday discussed the matter with finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam at the Planning Ministry. Salem told reporters: "Of the donation, $110 million will be spent on reconstruction of schools and building shelters in the worst-hit areas. The rest of the fund will be spent on agriculture and fisheries." Salem said IDB would also support the government with a hefty loan after an assessment of the damage left by the Nov 15 cyclone that killed about 3,000 people in its wake. Mirza Azizul Islam said: "Different donor countries and agencies stood by Sidr survivors. Contribution from this person is a similar gesture." bdnews24.co
