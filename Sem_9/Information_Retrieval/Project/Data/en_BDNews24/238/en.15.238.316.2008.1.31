 LONDON, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gordon Brown wants greater transparency over MPs' expenses, his spokesman said on Thursday, a move now seen as inevitable after a Conservative MP was found to have paid his son taxpayers' money for work he never did.

Conservative leader David Cameron expelled Conway from the parliamentary party on Tuesday. He has said he will resign as an MP at the next election. On Monday, Conway apologised in the Commons for his "administrative shortcomings". The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received a letter from Liberal Democrat Duncan Borrowman, who is contesting Conway's seat, asking them to investigate whether fraud had been committ
