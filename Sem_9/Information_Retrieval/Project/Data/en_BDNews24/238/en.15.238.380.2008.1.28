 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club will distribute some souvenir balls signed by its former booters among spectators on the opening day of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Cup Football tournament. Mahbub Jamil, chief adviser's specialist assistant, is scheduled to declare the eight-team meet open on January 30 at Bangabandhu National Stadium, said Mohammedan additional general secretary Mustaqur Rahman. With the help of Proteeti Pharma, Walton and G Hanz, Mohammedan is organising the tournament to turn the Swadhin Bangla Football Team members' dream of holding a Victory Day Football tournament into a reality. "We have already completed all our preparations and are ready to host the tournament," said Rahman adding that they needed two sunny days to prepare the field following recent inclement weather. B League champions Abahani Limited will take on Badda Jagaroni in the opening fixture. The three giants of Dhaka football, Mohammedan, Abahani, Muktijoddha Sangsad will participate in the event along with clubs such as Arambagh KS, Victoria SC, Fakirerpool Youngmens, Dhaka Wanderers Club and Badda Jagaroni. This leaves only two major clubs, Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel KC, out of the 11-day meet. A section of the galleries will remain open to school students. Co-sponsor Walton will award the man of the match and the man of the gallery every day while another co-sponsor G Hanz will award prizes for man of the tournament, best organiser of the tournament, best referee of the tournament and best spectator during the final match.
