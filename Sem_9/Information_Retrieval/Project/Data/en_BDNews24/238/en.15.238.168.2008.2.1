<TITLE> Gunmen attack Israeli embassy in Mauritania: police </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nouackchott, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen attacked the Israeli embassy in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott early on Friday, wounding some people, police and emergency services said. A bar near the embassy, in the centre of Nouakchott, was also hit by gunfire in the attack before the attackers fled, they said. The attack followed recent public calls by political parties in Mauritania, an Islamic Republic which straddles black and Arab Africa, for the government to sever diplomatic ties with Israel. The country is one of the few Arab League states to have relations with Israel. It also came just weeks after the Lisbon-Dakar rally was cancelled due to fears of an armed Islamist threat in the West African country following two attacks in late December in which four French tourists and some soldiers were killed.
