 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The interim cabinet Tuesday approved an ordinance to free the Election Commission Secretariat from the grips of any ministry, division or department, a government spokesman said. The cabinet also gave financial freedom to the Secretariat burying a long practice of seeking approval for funds from the government to conduct its activities, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet. "From now on the Election Commission Secretariat is free from ministries, divisions and departments," Munaim said referring to the decisions of the meeting, which took place at the Chief Adviser's Office. He said the chief election commissioner will "fully control" the secretariat. According to the approved ordinance, all officials of the EC Secretariat would be appointed in line with the commission's service rules. A committee headed by the CEC will evaluate the secretariat's activities, Munaim said. The commission secretary will act as the member secretary of the committee. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting where all 10 advisers and five special assistants to the CA were present, he said. Earlier in June, the cabinet had in principle approved a draft proposal to ensure independence of the Secretariat. Munaim said the ordinance would be signed into a law soon. The cabinet approved another ordinance to ensure transparency in appointing judges to the Supreme Court, Munaim said. The title of the ordinance is Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance-2007, Munaim said, adding that it will ensure more transparency in appointment of the judges. A nine-member commission headed by the chief justice will now recommend names for the appointment of the judges to the Supreme Court. The other members of the commission are law minister or adviser, two most senior judges of the Appellate Division, the attorney general, a member of parliament selected by the leader of the parliament, a member selected by the leader of the opposition, the Supreme Court Bar Association president and the law secretary. To make judges' posts permanent, the commission's recommendations will be required, Munaim said. According to the ordinance, the commission will sit at least once every six months. A decision will be taken with consent from all or the majority of members, he said. The commission will recommend the names to the president through the Prime Minister's Office, currently through the Chief Adviser's Office, Munaim said, citing the cabinet meeting decisions. The commission will propose two names against one vacant post, Munaim said. If the president does not approve the proposed names he could send the list back to the commission, which will sit again. Munaim said freedom of the EC Secretariat was important since "everything is being done to meet the government's target for a free and fair election." The approval is meant to give the freedom of EC secretariat a permanent shape, he said. "The government has separated the judiciary from the executive, and now transparency in the appointment process is important to make it functional," he said. "Both demands (freedom of the EC Secretariat and transparency in judges' appointment) are long-expected by people," he said. The cabinet also decided not to curtail pension money from a bureaucrat, reappointed by the government after retirement from his previous regular job, Munaim said. Previously, the authorities had adjusted pension money from a bureaucrat's salary that he received from his new post. The new decision means that a retired government official, who is reappointed to any government post, will get the original salary as well as pensions from his previous job. The decision came as the Ministry of Establishment placed a proposal at the cabinet meeting for ending the previous provisions for the chairman and the members of the Public Service Commission, Munaim said. "But the cabinet thinks it should apply to all as they are all entitled to the pension after years in service," he said. The cabinet, however, returned a proposal for increasing salary and other benefits for the PSC chairman and members, Munaim said. He said the cabinet asked the establishment ministry to re-submit the proposal after examining similar provisions of other departments and divisions. "The cabinet wants a uniform proposal," the press secretary said. bdnews
