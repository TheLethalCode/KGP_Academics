<TITLE> No-needle anesthetic method useful for vasectomy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A no-needle anesthetic method is an effective means of pain control for men undergoing no-scalpel vasectomy, a popular type of vasectomy that involves a small puncture of the skin rather than an incision, according to a report in the journal Urology. No-needle anesthesia uses a device (MadaJet) that injects an aerosolized local anesthetic into the skin, underlying tissue, and vas deferens without the need for a hypodermic needle, the authors explain. Dr. Michael A. White and Dr. Thomas J. Maatman from Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine and Michigan Urologic Clinic, Grand Rapids, compared jet injection anesthesia with needle delivery for no-scalpel vasectomy in 50 men. The patients received jet injection to one vas deferens and traditional nerve anesthesia to the other vas deferens before the procedure. Pain as measured with a standard scale was significantly lower with the jet injection than with the needle injection, the authors report. The pain score for the vasectomy itself was lower after jet injection than after needle injection, but the difference was not significant from a statistical standpoint. None of the patients required additional anesthesia to either vas deferens, the researchers say. "No-needle anesthesia with jet injection reduces the pain associated with the traditional delivery of anesthesia to the skin and vas deferens before no-scalpel vasectomy," the investigators conclude. "Additional studies are needed with more subjects to evaluate whether the decrease in procedural pain is statistically significant when comparing the two types of anesthetics," the authors add.
