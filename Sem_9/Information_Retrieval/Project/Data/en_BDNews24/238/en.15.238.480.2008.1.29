 ANTANANARIVO, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A cyclone has killed two people in Madagascar and caused widespread damage to the world's fourth largest island, a senior relief official said on Tuesday. "(Cyclone) Fame has killed two people, a child in Majunga, carried away by the waters, and a man," said Jean Rakotomalala, executive secretary of the Malagasy government's National Office of Disasters and Risk Management. "The material damage is enormous in all four districts of Melaky region," he told journalists. The cyclone hit the Indian Ocean island's west coast on Sunday, leaving several hundred families in need of emergency assistance. It has since moved on. Last year, six cyclones hit the island killing at least 150 people and destroying homes and crops in Madagascar's worst season on record.
