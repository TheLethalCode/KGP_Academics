 BRUSSELS, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - King Albert called on Belgium's political leaders on Wednesday to end the country's government crisis and restore its credibility as one of the main advocates of European integration. "We must acknowledge that we will only be credible to encourage European integration if we are able to resolve our own internal problems," he said in a speech to Belgian and foreign political leaders, including European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Belgium, a founding member of the European Union, launched a debate on devolution this month to try to bring an end to the political deadlock that emerged after a general election in June. The crisis raised fears that the country might split into Dutch-speaking and French-speaking regions. Prosperous Flanders wants the regions to acquire more powers, such as in labour market policy, and have some ability to levy taxes. This has aroused fears among French-speaking Walloons that Belgium will become nothing more than an empty shell and the economic divide between their depressed southern region and the the rich Flemish north will widen. "Belgium is sometimes mentioned as a laboratory for Europe. If our different regions and communities live in harmony in the same entity, we can stimulate European construction and become an example," Albert said. Prime Minster Guy Verhofstadt, an EU enthusiast, was appointed by the king to head a temporary coalition in December to end the impasse and rule the country while a compromise on devolution was found. "Our country needs a new balance, a new balance with strengthened regions within a strengthened federal state," Verhofstadt said before Albert spoke. Verhofstadt, who wrote a book called "The United States of Europe", was regarded in 2004 as a possible European Commission president, but his candidacy was resisted by Britain and Italy after the Iraq war, which Belgium opposed. Flemish Christian-Democrat leader Yves Leterme, hailed as the main victor in the June election, is expected to take over from Verhofstadt and form a permanent government once broad agreement on devolution is reached
