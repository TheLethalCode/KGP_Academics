 MOSCOW, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had halved the number of foreign observers invited to presidential elections in March and suggested some monitors in the past had been fundamentally hostile to Moscow. President Vladimir Putin, seeking to extend his influence by ensuring a loyal ally succeeds him, has accused European observers in previous polls of being biased. "We are inviting around 400 foreign observers," Election Commission Chairman Vladimir Churov told a news conference after signing a thick pack of invitations. The commission says 800 observers monitored the 2004 presidential vote. Europe's election watchdog ODIHR said it would have liked the invitation earlier to send an assessment mission before the polls. At this point it was not possible to conduct the entire observer process it would have liked. Asked if such numbers of observers would be enough to monitor an election in a country stretching from the Pacific coast to the Baltic, Churov said those invited were roughly proportionate to thsoe who monitored Poland's recent elections. "If you invite a guest, you invite someone you want to see, not just someone curious to see your house, right?" he added. Last year ODIHR refused to monitor Russia's December parliamentary election after the authorities cut the number of foreign observers to just over 330 from 1,200 in the previous election and delayed issuing visas for them. Putin, popular for bringing stability and economic recovery after the chaos of the 1990s, is forbidden by the constitution from running for a third term at the March 2 election. CHALLENGER BARRED Kremlin critics at home and abroad say the election has been slanted in favour of Dmitry Medvedev, 42, the first deputy prime minister whom Putin has backed as his successor. Ex-Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was barred on Sunday from running for president, a move he said was taken to block any real challenge to Putin's chosen candidate. "Russian laws do not allow the Kremlin to give orders to the Central Election Commission," Churov told the news conference. Churov said there were still suspicions about the true intentions of foreign observers. "We cannot help feeling concerns about the way some foreign observers, already notorious for their unacceptance of our state, are being selected." ODIHR said its purpose was not to criticise any particular country. "The purpose is to help that country hold better, more democratic elections," ODIHR spokesman Curtis Budden told Reuters by telephone. Churov said Russia was inviting 70 ODIHR observers to monitor the election. The parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe will send 30 observers each, he sa
