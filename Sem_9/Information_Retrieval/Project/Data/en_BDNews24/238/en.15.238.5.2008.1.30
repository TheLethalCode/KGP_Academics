 Tehran, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's judiciary chief has ordered a halt to public executions in the Islamic Republic unless they have his approval, his spokesman said on Wednesday. While those convicted of crimes like murder, drug smuggling and rape would still be hanged behind prison walls, the move by Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi appeared designed to lower the public profile of an increasing number of executions in Iran. European governments and Western rights groups have criticised Iran for the hangings, many of them in public, since authorities launched a clampdown on "immoral behaviour" in July. Some are hanged from cranes in public places. In one case, three drug smugglers were publicly put to death in the holy city of Qom, south of Tehran, on Jan. 2. "Based on the order ... carrying out executions in public is only possible with the agreement of the judiciary chief and based on social necessities," judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said in a statement. "The punishment of execution ... should not be carried out or publicised in a way that would create psychological tensions for the society, especially the young," he said, without elaborating. Shahroudi also banned the media from publishing television footage and pictures of executions, Jamshidi said. Earlier this week, two people convicted of rape and murder were shown on state television hanging from two cranes before hundreds of onlookers in central Iran. Murder, adultery, rape, armed robbery, apostasy and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Iran's sharia law, practised since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Iran's students' news agency ISNA reported the execution of five convicted murderers on Wednesday inside Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where many political activists are held. Rights group Amnesty International says Iran has one of the highest rates of executions in the world. During the campaign launched last summer, police have arrested dozens of drug addicts, smugglers, rapists and murderers
