 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Retail investors took to the streets Wednesday to demand regulatory interventions to stabilise the market that slumped. Dhaka Stock Exchange's (DSE) general index at midday fell about 51 points, prompting the investors to come out on them the streets to demand regulatory moves to stabilise the market. The benchmark index, however, gained later but ended lower. Several retail investors told bdnews24.com whenever the market overheated the Securities and Exchange Commission would take initiatives to help it cool down. "Then why are they (SEC) not doing anything now to protect our interest?" said one of the agitating investors. The investors said the market was short of funds because of the offloading of state-run Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum. They demanded initiatives to inject funds in the market. "We think the Securities and Exchange Commission should immediately come up with moves like readjusting the ratio of margin loans for merchant banks or anything that would create access of funds in the market," said Ali Ahasan, a retail investor. The SEC, meanwhile, has withdrawn the restrictions on financial adjustment it imposed on July 30, 2007, Farhad Ahmed, executive director of the market watchdog, told reporters at his office Wednesday. "The decision will be effective from Feb 3," he said. He said the decision would enable every investor to buy shares with the money gained from selling other shares on the same day. Earlier with the restriction in force, an investor had to wait three days after the trading to buy other shares. "The move came to address the lack of liquidity in the market," said Farhad. This facility will be available for A, B, G and N category shares. "However, someone can sell a Z category share and buy other category shares. But no-one can buy Z category shares through this process," the SEC official added. The DGEN or general index declined 26.58 points, or 0.93 percent, to end at 2811.94. The DSI or all share price index closed at 2374.02, down 19.56 points or 0.81 percent. The blue chip DSE-20 also fell 13.43 points, or 0.58 percent, to end on 2281.88. Turnover slightly increased to Tk 1.65 billion from Tuesday's Tk 1.54 billion, with 9,995,188 shares traded. Losers beat gainers 139 to 91 with some 12 scrips remaining unchanged. Summit Power topped the day's turnover board, closing 4.35 percent higher at Tk1592.25. It rose after the SEC approved the company's issuance of right shares. Jamuna Oil continued to fall to end on Tk 342.40, down 2.56 percent. Market major BRAC Bank gained after losing Tuesday on reports that it was announcing a 10 percent dividend for the year 2007. It surged 1.10 percent to close at Tk 1353.25. AB Bank fell 1.52 percent to Tk 2592.75. Grameen Mutual Fund One also lost 1.61 percent to close at Tk 97.70.
