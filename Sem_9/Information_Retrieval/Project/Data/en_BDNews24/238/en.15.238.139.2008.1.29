 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The interim cabinet Tuesday approved an ordinance to free the Election Commission Secretariat from the grips of any ministry, division or department, a government spokesman said. The cabinet also gave financial freedom to the Secretariat burying a long practice of seeking approval for funds from the government to conduct its activities, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet. "From now on the Election Commission Secretariat is free from ministries, divisions and departments," Munaim said referring to the decisions of the meeting, which took place at the Chief Adviser's Office. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting where all 10 advisers and five special assistants to the CA were present, he said. Earlier in June, the cabinet had in principle approved a draft proposal to ensure independence of the Secretariat. Munaim said the ordinance would be signed into a law soon. The cabinet approved another ordinance to ensure transparency in appointing judges to the Supreme Court, Munaim said. The title of the ordinance is Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance-2007, Munaim said, adding that it will ensure more transparency in appointment of the judges. A nine-member committee headed by the chief justice will now recommend names for the appointment of the judges to the Supreme Court. The committee will recommend the names to the president through the Prime Minister's Office, currently through the Chief Adviser's Office, Munaim said, citing the cabinet meeting decisions. The committee will propose two names against one vacant post, Munaim said. The cabinet also decided not to curtail pension money from a bureaucrat, reappointed by the government after retirement from his previous regular job, Munaim said. Previously, the authorities had adjusted pension money from a bureaucrat's salary that he received from his new post. The new decision means that a retired government official, who is reappointed to any government post, will get the original salary as well as pensions from his previous job. The decision came as the Ministry of Establishment placed a proposal at the cabinet meeting for ending the previous provisions for the chairman and the members of the Public Service Commission, Munaim said. "But the cabinet thinks it should apply to all as they are all entitled to the pension after years in service," he said. The cabinet, however, returned a proposal for increasing salary and other benefits for the PSC chairman and members, Munaim said. He said the cabinet asked the establishment ministry to re-submit the proposal after examining similar provisions of other departments and divisions. "The cabinet wants a uniform proposal," the press secretary said. bdnews
