 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained 1.6 percent by midsession Tuesday, tracking a rise in global markets on prospects of an aggressive cut in US interest rates after the recent roller-coaster ride in financial markets. Banks advanced, with rogue-trading-hit lender Societe Generale up 0.7 percent, HSBC up 1.6 percent and UBS 1.7 percent higher. Commodity-related stocks were also stronger as economy-sensitive metal prices rose. By 1145 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was 1.6 percent higher at 1,337.9, recovering from Monday's losses and after falling 2 percent last week. The index tumbled as much as 10 percent last week, battered by recession worries and talk of more mortgage-related writedowns at banks. "I think equity markets are ready for a significant fall in (corporate) profit but quite frankly I am not sure we are going to see that kind of fall," said Dirk Thiels, head of global equity funds at KBC Asset Management. "This probably puts a bottom in the markets. Our bet would be long finance, short cyclicals on a six months to one year horizon," he said, citing valuations and expectations that banks' earnings would not be badly hit. The FTSEurofirst index has lost 11 percent so far in January and is on track for the worst month since September 2002. Around European markets, London's FTSE 100 and Paris's CAC-40 both gained 1.6 percent and Frankfurt's DAX edged up 1.2 percent. Societe Generale disclosed last week that unauthorised trading by one of its employees had cost it $7 billion, and the Wall Street Journal reported that French peer BNP Paribas was weighing a bid for the group. BNP shares rose 1.8 percent. FED HOLDS KEY With the Fed expected to announce a further cut in rates on Wednesday, the focus was on the U.S. central bank after a torrid month for equities. "What we've had is a mix of weak data, poor corporate numbers, fears over writedowns and problems at monoline insurers, with the element of a rogue trader thrown in, all of which have conspired to create a perfect storm of uncertainty," said Barclays strategist Henk Potts. "It now all comes down to the ability and willingness of central banks to act." A total of 18 out of 20 primary dealers polled by Reuters forecast the Fed to cut benchmark rates, with 14 expecting a half-point reduction. The Fed cut rates by 75 basis points in an emergency move last week. Across Europe, miners tracked higher metal prices, with Xstrata gaining 3.9 percent, Anglo American 4.8 percent and Rio Tinto 2.7 percent. Shares in travel group TUI soared 5 percent in Germany and London-listed TUI Travel 2.5 percent after TUI Travel said it was in talks about merging its TUIfly airline with Lufthansa's Germanwings. Among standout gainers, Swiss bank Julius Baer jumped 3.7 percent on market talk that Qatar was interested in buying a stake, traders sa
