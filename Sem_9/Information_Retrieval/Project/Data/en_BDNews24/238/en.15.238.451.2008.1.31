 ADDIS ABABA, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN chief Ban Ki-moon, warning of catastrophe in Kenya, plans to head to the east African nation on Friday to try to help end violence that has killed 850 people. Ban told reporters at an African Union summit in neighbouring Ethiopia he would try to help his predecessor, Kofi Annan, who is trying to mediate an end to a month of ethnic bloodshed in a nation once seen as an island of stability. Discussions at the three-day summit, which opened in Addis Ababa on Thursday, are expected to be dominated by the crisis, which erupted after the disputed re-election of President Mwai Kibaki on Dec. 27. The mounting death toll has driven 250,000 people from their homes. "Violence continues, threatening to escalate to catastrophic levels," Ban said in one of the first addresses to the 53-nation African Union summit. He said Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga must do everything possible to resolve the crisis. Ban, who was seeing Kibaki on Thursday, told reporters: "Tomorrow I will go to Nairobi to give my full support to the panel of eminent African persons led by my predecessor, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I will meet Mr. Odinga, some civil society leaders and visit my U.N. staff." Ban asked the AU to urge "the leaders and people of Kenya to calm the violence and resolve their differences through dialogue and respect for the democratic process". Alpha Oumar Konare, the AU's top diplomat, shared the concern over Kenya, saying it "had been a country of peace that had urged others to talk peace. If Kenya burns, what is left?" Until a month ago, Kenya was more used to attending summits of the 53-nation AU as a respected regional peacemaker and a refuge for those fleeing wars in neighbouring countries. Now it is Africa's biggest crisis, torn by a cycle of ethnic bloodshed that threatens to destabilise a key regional ally of the West and damage the economies of neighbouring countries. VOICES MUST BE HEARD Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade said in Addis Ababa that Kenya should be top of the summit agenda. "It is unacceptable that right next to us, thousands of people are dying and that we should just come here and then leave without making our voices heard," he said. "It is Africa's image which is at stake in this Kenya affair," he added in comments to Radio France International. Kibaki is attending the summit but made no comment. He has only been recognised by a small number of African countries, but Ethiopian sources said a delegation from Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement had been prevented from attending the summit, following AU practice of only admitting governments. Wade said he had spoken to Odinga and believed he should be allowed to come to Addis Ababa and address a message to the summit - something vehemently opposed by Kibaki's government. Kenya's crisis presents the AU with the dilemma of either breaking with its traditional reluctance to interfere in the internal affairs of its members, or being seen as ineffectual in addressing the continent's most pressing probl
