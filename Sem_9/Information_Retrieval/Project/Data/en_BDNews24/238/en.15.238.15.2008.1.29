<TITLE> Putin's candidate Medvedev avoids TV debates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW/BARNAUL, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, has refused to meet his rivals for the presidency in live television debates in the run-up to the March 2 election. His opponents hit back, with veteran Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, the main opposition contender, saying Medvedev had been spooked by the Kremlin which was afraid of tough debate broadcast live to the Russian people. "Society ought to force Medvedev to accept debates," Zyuganov said on Tuesday in a campaign trip to Siberia's Altai region. Medvedev, a 42-year-old lawyer, is buoyed by the strong support of the popular Putin and, ensured of blanket coverage in the state-run media, is already way ahead of his rivals in opinion polls. Official campaign rules envisage live TV debates among candidates. But in past elections Putin and his United Russia have refused to take part, saying they saw no worthy partners with whom to discuss policy. Vyacheslav Volodin, a senior United Russia member, defended the move saying Medvedev was meeting ordinary citizens in extensive travel across Russia. TV debates would disrupt his schedule. "The most important thing for us is real deeds, meeting people and solving actual problems, not wrangling in a TV studio," Russian news agencies quoted Volodin as saying. MEDVEDEV "FRIGHTENED" Zyuganov, 63, who lost to the late President Boris Yeltsin in 1996 and was soundly beaten by Putin in 2000, said: "I now see they (the Kremlin) have frightened Medvedev," he said. "They are afraid to face us in a tete-a-tete dialogue." The Election Commission disqualifed an ex-prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, from running. Apart from Zyuganov, Medvedev will compete with pro-Kremlin nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and little-known independent Andrei Bogdanov. "The authorities are afraid of any discussion, any risk," Kasyanov told Ekho Moskvy radio and he repeated his call for opposition candidates to boycott the poll. "My insistent recommendation is that you do not take part in this farce, this special operation," Kasyanov said. Medvedev's decision renders TV election debates pointless. Zyuganov reiterated he would not quit the presidential race, because in this case voters would have no genuine choice. "Should I retreat, there will remain Medvedev, Zhirinovsky and Bogdanov ... And they will tell everyone: 'You had a choice, an alternative'. But all this is 'three in one', a primitive game played by Kremlin political technologists," Zyuganov said. "I don't want to hide in a trench, or lag behind or be thrown by the wayside." Kasyanov and Zyuganov earlier said Medvedev's refusal to take part in television debates would show Russia's polls were a staged succession designed to ensure Putin keeps grip on power.
