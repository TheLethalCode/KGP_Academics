<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) -- Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has claimed she was barred from seeing her relatives for three months, her lawyers said Monday. The AL chief's lawyers made the claim following a visit to their client in special jail in the Sangsad Bhaban complex. Jail authorities denied the allegation. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "There is a provision to allow detainees with division the right to see relatives every 15 days." "I can't say right now how many days Hasina did not receive her relatives. An arrangement for Hasina to see her relatives will be made soon," Siddiqui said. Barrister Shafiq Ahmed and advocates Sahara Khatun and Abdul Mannan Khan went to the special jail to discuss the Azam J Chowdhury case. Following the visit, advocate Khan said the AL chief had asked her party to help the government hold a free and neutral election. Barrister Shafiq said metropolitan sessions judge Azizul Haque made a ruling allowing 10 lawyers to meet Hasina for discussions on the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. The court asked them to meet Hasina in two days, although barred them from going as a group. "Five lawyers were supposed to meet Hasina today. But the jail authorities suddenly phoned and told us there was permission for only three lawyers," Shafiq said. Advocate Khatun said Hasina had expressed her concern over the spiraling prices of rice. Canadian lawyer Dr Payam Akhavan arrived in Dhaka Sunday night to provide legal assistance for Hasina. Akhavan teaches law at McGill University in Canada. He was the adviser for international tribunal formed to try war criminals of Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud said. The Canadian lawyer wants to meet Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim to discuss the Azam J Chowdhury case. "We submitted an application to the jail authorities on his behalf for permission to see Sheikh Hasina in special jail," Hasan Mahmud said. bdnews
