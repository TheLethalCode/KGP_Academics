 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council Wednesday approved a Tk 2,168 crore project that would give the Dhaka-Chittagong highway four lanes. The ECNEC also approved 10 other projects at a meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the NEC conference centre in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway project had earlier been included in the annual development programme for fiscal 2007-08. Widening the highway from two lanes to four began in January 2006, and the road from Dhaka to Daudkandi of Comilla now has four lanes. The Roads and Highways Department will implement the project. The government took up the project in an effort to reduce road accidents, traffic congestion and to ensure smooth travelling. The project was also meant to boost the country's economy through setting up an effective transport system between Dhaka and Chittagong. After the meeting, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said that it would reduce traffic accidents and ease transport of products to different areas of the country from Chittagong. The ECNEC also approved projects to rebuild the Gouripur-Jaria-Jhangail and Shyamganj-Mohanganj sections of Bangladesh Railway at a cost of Tk 152 crore, develop a link road from the coastal embankment to Chittagong city at Tk 96 crore, develop Khulna city infrastructure and a water supply system at Tk 50 crore, protect Chapainawabganj and Shibganj Upazila from river erosion at Tk 143 crore and develop the Barind irrigation area at Tk 162 crore. bdnews
