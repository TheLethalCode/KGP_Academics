 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff Wednesday asked businessmen to repay the outstanding loans and work for the development of the country. "Return the loan to the banks. This is people's money," the adviser said at the inaugural session of the second general meeting of International Business Forum of Bangladesh. United States charge d'affaires Denise Rollins in her speech said the government's vow to hold national elections by the year-end as well as the anticorruption drive had had an impact on the business sector. Businesses were in uncertainty, she added. The government should emphasise staging elections in line with the roadmap to restore confidence, she added. Ariff said, "The government and the business community remain far away from each other in our country. The forum can work as a bridge to narrow the gap." "It can initiate introduction of a rational revenue and tax policy for the businessmen. It can also assist the government in introducing different government policies related to the interest of the business community." On the government's initiative to bring back business confidence, the adviser said, "The government has formed the Better Business Forum to this end and is resolving various problems." Rollins said the government's efforts to curb corruption in the country would encourage foreign investment. The anticorruption campaign should be transparent as lack of transparency would discourage foreign investors, she said. An elected government, business-friendly rules and stable economy were essential for domestic and foreign investment, she observed. Businesses and investments should be encouraged for development, she added. IBFB president Mahmudul Islam Chowdhury presided over the meeting. PHP Group chairman Sufi Mizanur Rahman and Runner Group chairman Hafizur Rahman Khan spoke among others. bdnews24
