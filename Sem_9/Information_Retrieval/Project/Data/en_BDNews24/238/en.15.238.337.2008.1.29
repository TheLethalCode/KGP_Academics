 BERLIN, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries has rejected European Union plans to collect more personal data on air passengers as part of new anti-terrorism measures. The European Commission will next month propose a register collecting biometric information on all travellers entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc, and an Internet form which will have to be filled in some days before travelling. "I worry that this will be a further step towards a preventionist state, that is already monitoring and policing citizens without prior cause," Zypries, a Social Democrat, told a policing conference on Tuesday. Under the plan, EU states would collect and store for 13 years some 19 pieces of personal data on international air travellers including their phone number, e-mail address, payment details, and travel agent. Zypries said the measures would damage civil liberties and questioned whether all the details would actually be useful in fighting crime. Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a conservative and vocal supporter of stricter security measures, welcomed the proposed measures, which the EU hopes to introduce in the first half of 2009.
