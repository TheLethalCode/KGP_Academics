<TITLE> Myanmar`s Suu Kyi to meet party leaders: sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Yangon, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been given permission to meet leaders of her political party at a state guest house in Yangon on Wednesday, party sources said. It was not known which National League for Democracy (NLD) figures would be allowed to attend. Party number two Tin Oo, who like Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since May 2003, was barred from attending a meeting with Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders in November. That meeting stemmed from unprecedented international pressure on the former Burma's military rulers after their bloody crackdown on mass protests in September against decades of army rule and declining living standards. At least 31 people were killed in the crackdown, the United Nations says. U.N. special envoy Ibrahim Gambari has been allowed into the country twice since the protests, although he failed to obtain a third visa in December to try to kickstart formal talks between the junta and Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi and the NLD won an election landslide in 1990 but were denied power by the military, which has ruled in one form or another since a 1962 coup. During that time, the once-promising economy has collapsed. Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has spent more than 12 of the last 18 years in prison or under house arrest.
