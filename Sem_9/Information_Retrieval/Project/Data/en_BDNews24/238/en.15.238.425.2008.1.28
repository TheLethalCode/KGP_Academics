 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Monday appointed seven senior lawyers as amici curiae (friends of court) to assist the court in the final hearing on AL president Sheikh Hasina's writ petition that challenges a case against under emergency powers rules, filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Shahidul Islam appointed the seven lawyers to assist the court in hearing of the writ petition. The lawyers are former judges TH Khan and Monsurul Haque Chowdhury, former attorney general Mahmudul Islam, former Supreme Court Bar Association president Mahbubey Alam, barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, senior advocate Abdur Rab Chowdhury and advocate Mahbubur Rahman. The hearing on the writ petition is continuing in the same bench. Additional attorney general Monsur Habib took part in the hearing Monday from the government side. While speaking, he presented different provisions of the Emergency Powers Ordinance. Hasina's counsel barrister Shafique Ahmed told reporters that the seven legal experts would assist the court in disposing of the petition. They will explain whether an incident that occurred before the promulgation of the state of emergency could be included in emergency powers rules and whether the provisions of the emergency powers rules go against the articles 7(2), 26, 27, 31, 32 and 35 of the constitution. Businessman Azam J Chowdhury filed the case against Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim with Gulshan Police Station on June 13 last year accusing them of taking about Tk 3 crore in extorted money. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year and the case was included in the emergency powers rules the same day. The High Court on July 30 last year on a writ petition of Hasina challenging the validity of taking the case under the emergency powers rules, issued a rule nisi asking the government to explain why the inclusion of the case in the EPR would not be declared illegal. Charges were framed against Hasina, Sheikh Selim and Sheikh Rehana in the case on July 24 last year. The metropolitan sessions judge on Jan 13 framed charges against the accused. Rehana, Hasina's sister living in London, was implicated in the case later. Hasina on Jan 27 appealed to the High Court for quashing the case. Hearing on the appeal would be held next week. bdnew
