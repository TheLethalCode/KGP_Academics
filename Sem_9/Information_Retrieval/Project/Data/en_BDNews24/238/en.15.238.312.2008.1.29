 Reazul Bashar and Mahmud Sharif bdnews24.com Correspondents Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The increasing cost of paper is set to hit sales at this year's annual book fair, according to publishers. The Ekushey Boi Mela will see the retail price of books up by at least 20 percent as the cost of domestic and international paper continues rising. "The price of paper has registered an increase of 25 percent over the last year. So we have had to increase the price of books by 20 percent," Osman Gani, chief executive of publishers Agami Prokashoni, told bdnews24.com. "We are not sure how the readers will take this. The cost of paper always rapidly increases prior to the book fair," said Gani. This year a rim of foreign paper is being sold at Tk 2,000 compared with Tk 1,650 last year. Local paper is selling at Tk 1,750 a rim, while last year it was Tk 1400. The Bangla Academy's public relations department said 2402 new books were launched at the fair in 2006, while the number had dwindled to 1842 in the 2007 event. "We fear the number of books launched at this year's fair might not exceed 1500," said Gani. The publisher said the government should half the taxes imposed on paper to stimulate book sales. Arifur Rahman Naim, chief executive of publishers Oitijyo, said this year's price hike may finally prove too much for book lovers. "The price of books has been increasing for a few years, but it was still bearable for readers," said Arifur. "But this year prices have really jumped, readers may not be able to sustain them," he said. With increases in the cost of printing and binding, a book sold at Tk 160 last year could rise to as much as Tk 200 this year. bdnews24.com
