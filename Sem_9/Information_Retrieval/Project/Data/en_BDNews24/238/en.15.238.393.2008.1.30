 Canbera, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Race riots on Sydney's beaches and ugly street battles between white youths, neo-nazis and ethnic Lebanese make an unlikely seed for a four-storey-high photo montage of Australia's migrant diversity. But from the walls of a central Melbourne building a gallery of more than 220 faces from nearly every nation stares down to remind passers-by that Australia was forged on immigration. "I saw those riots and just thought it was awful, and I just didn't want to see that sort of thing happening here again," photographer Michel Lawrence told Reuters of the racial conflict on Sydney's southern beaches in December 2005. "There was just this frustration that this sort of thing could happen in my own backyard so to speak, and I thought 'what can I do?'," Lawrence said. "I thought instantly about a photo of every nationality currently living in Australia." Australia is a land of immigrants, with almost a quarter of the country's 21 million population born overseas. Many came during a post-war wave of immigration in the 1950s and 60s, or after the Vietnam conflict in the 1970s and 80s. Most came from Great Britain (1,1 million), New Zealand (389,000) and China (207,000).Other large immigrant communities include Italians, Vietnamese, Indians, Greeks and South Africans. Many were lured by balmy weather and beautiful beaches, others by education and career prospects better than at home. Australia has also taken in significant numbers of political refugees from the Third World. Lawrence has spent the two years since the riots photographing immigrants every weekend, with the results on show for the next two months in the "All of Us" exhibition above a popular Melbourne square. ADOPTED ORPHAN Ivan Laughlin, who arrived an adopted orphan from Guatemala in 2002, lies laughing on a brown teddy bear atop a striped rug in one giant picture. Andrew Mugerwa from Uganda stands still in a leafy streetscape in a black sleeveless t-shirt. "We would switch the lights off at night, but they would still come into the house and search," Mugerwa told Lawrence, recalling a childhood filled with guns and military boots before his arrival in Australia in 1984. Fatima al-Qarakchy, from the Iraqi city of Najaf, landed in 2001 with a master's degree in microbiology. She stands regally in a cream scarf, holding her daughter's hand, outside her new home in a regional town. France-born Francoise Libotte leans on a doorframe with arms crossed over a white peace dove. She came to Australia in 1990 after a childhood spent watching Skippy kangaroo adventures on television. "We had no idea what these people look like, and most race riots revolve around how people look," Lawrence said. "The idea was to show them in as normal a situation as possible, in their homes. Photos are a great leveller and so you can show these people are just like you and I, leading normal lives," he said. Also included in the exhibition are Aborigines who landed in Australia up to 40,000 years before European settlement. Lawrence, 59, was born in Sydney and grew up in Melbourne, said to be the country's most diverse multicultural city. His work hangs in Australia's National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. He said the "All of Us" project had restored his faith in his country's ability to absorb people from every country peacefully and productively. "The riots did great damage to Australia's image internationally, but I have found great generosity of spirit," he said. "It reminded me of the Australia I grew up in, with a sense of common bond, a country where the door was never locked, where people feel safe and where they feel happier than they did where they came from."
