 Sherpur, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Thursday said the country would see more development if the trend of good work they had been setting was carried forward. "We won't stay for long. However, though on small scale we are starting off some good work. If the trend continues there will be more development in the country. "Later the people's representatives, businessmen and administrative officials with the assistance of the local people can carry forward the trend of this good work," he said. Moeen made the remarks while speaking as chief guest at the inauguration of a self-reliant small dairy farm and biogas project at Saikat cluster village in Char Pakkhimari Upazila in Sherpur Sadar. The farm and biogas project has been set up with the funding of Bangladesh Army. "Bangladesh has lots of resources. If those can be used properly there will be no poverty. This small dairy farm and biogas project is an example that we can do many things using small resource. "From this project besides meeting nutrition needs, electricity and fertiliser can be derived and cooking is also possible from what is available from a few cows." To farmers, the army chief said, "There is no fertiliser crisis in the country. None of you will hoard fertiliser. Use as much fertiliser as necessary. Using more fertiliser than necessary destroys soil fertility. Use of necessary fertiliser increases production. There is no cause to worry about fertiliser." He said the country suffered huge loss because of two floods and cyclone Sidr. All would need to work together for get over the loss. Not a single inch of land should be kept out of cultivation in current boro season. Moeen added it was the responsibility of the government to ensure fertiliser, oil and electricity to the farmers. Fertiliser stocks have been built up in 64 district headquarters this year and fertiliser was also being imported from abroad. He distributed 24 cows among 20 families and Red Crescent quilt and relief materials among 300 destitute people who have been victims of river erosion in Saikat cluster village. The small dairy farm aims to make 20 families self reliant through cooperatives. Besides, 100 poor families would get uninterrupted electricity supply for four to five hours from the biogas plant. At least 30 families would get gas for cooking. Sherpur deputy commissioner Shamsun Nahar Begum also spoke. GOC of 19 Infantry Division Major General Md Mujahid Udddin, 309 Brigade Commander Brigadier General Abu Musa Sharf Uddin, and Commander of Sherpur Army Camp Lt Col Mujib and high officials of administration were present. Moeen arrived by a helicopter at the helipad constructed at the char of the river Brahmaputra at 10:40am, about one and half an hours behind schedule, because of dense fog. After inaugurating the project at Saikat cluster village, he left for Ghatail Cantonment. bdnews2
