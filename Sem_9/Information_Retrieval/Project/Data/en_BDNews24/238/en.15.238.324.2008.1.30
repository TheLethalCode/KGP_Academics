<TEXT>
 Amsterdam, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutch Queen Beatrix turns 70 on Thursday, prompting speculation she is preparing to abdicate and hand the throne to her son Prince Willem-Alexander just as her mother did on her birthday 28 years ago. "Most Dutch people look forward to stopping work at 65. Queen Beatrix is about to turn 70 but is still working flat out. How much longer?" asked Christian daily Reformatorisch Dagblad. "It is clear that the throne change is not far away but how much longer? One year? A couple of years? Who can say?" Unlike in Britain, where Queen Elizabeth, 81, shows little sign of handing over to Prince Charles even though he is nearing retirement age himself, Dutch queens have made a tradition of stepping aside for the next generation over the last century. Queen Wilhemina was 67 when she handed over to her daughter in 1948 after half a century on the throne. Queen Juliana made way for a 42-year-old Beatrix on her 71st birthday in 1980. Gossip magazines note no state visits are planned for the second half of the year and suggest police are preparing for a coronation on Sept. 6, the same day Juliana was crowned 60 years ago and the birthday of the Queen's late husband Prince Claus. Reconstruction work is under way on the royal palace on Dam square in Amsterdam, where abdications are signed and coronations celebrated. The Drakensteyn castle where Beatrix is expected to retire to is also being spruced up. MONARCHY STILL POPULAR A politics graduate fluent in several languages, Queen Beatrix did not have an easy start as monarch. Riots by squatters marred her investiture and her marriage to German Claus van Amsberg also provoked unrest 14 years earlier. Industrious, sober and lacking Juliana's motherly charm, Beatrix had to work hard to win her subjects' hearts, but she has steered her family through a number of scandals in recent years to keep the monarchy popular. A poll by TNS-NIPO published last weekend shows that 79 percent of Dutch people support the royal family, with only a minority wanting to curb her already limited role in negotiations between parties to form coalition governments. Right-wing lawmaker Geert Wilders recently demanded she retreat to ceremonial functions after a Christmas appeal for tolerance he said was full of "multicultural nonsense". Jeroen Snel, presenter of the Blue Blood royalty programme on public television, predicts Beatrix will reign until her 30th jubilee in 2010, giving her son more time with his children. "The Queen still enjoys her work...and anyway the prince is very busy at the moment," he said. "But nothing is certain. The only thing that we can now see is that everything is being prepared." After a youth making headlines for his love of fast cars and attractive women, Willem-Alexander has polished a more kingly image in the last decade, chairing a U.N. panel on water and sanitation and working for the International Olympic Committee. The 40-year-old prince would be crowned Willem IV -- the first Dutch king in more than a century after four Queens. He married Argentine investment banker Maxima Zorreguieta in 2002, stirring controversy because her father was a minister during Argentina's 1976-83 brutal military dictatorship. But Maxima has become a popular royal for her Latin glamour and bearing three daughters in quick succession, despite raising eyebrows last year by questioning Dutch national identity. "The only person who knows when she will step down is the Queen and we can't say any more," a spokeswoman said
