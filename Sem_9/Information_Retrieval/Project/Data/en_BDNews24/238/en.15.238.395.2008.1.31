 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)The country's two bourses ended upbeat on Thursday after the trading week's losses. Analysts cited return of confidence among investors for the market heating up. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan said: " The regulatory move to withdraw restrictions from financial adjustments helped investors to gain back confidence." Market analyst and AIMS of Bangladesh CEO Yaweer Sayeed, who manages over Tk 1 billion in funds, echoed the statement saying: "It's a positive sign and we were anticipating such a thing after the regulatory move." The benchmark DGEN or general index was up 95 points, or 3.39 percent, to end at 2907.17 while the DSI or all share price index closed at 2499.45, up 75.43 points, or 3.18 percent. Turnover crept up to Tk 1.68 billion from Wednesday's Tk 1.65 billion. Gainers outnumbered losers 174 to 52 with some 12 issues holding steady. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange ended upbeat with all the sectors advancing except food and services. The day saw ICT, miscellaneous and paper-printing sectors gaining the most. The CSCX or selective categories index climbed 155.04 points, or 3.34 percent, to end on 4793.07. The CASPI or all share price index ended at 7454.81, up 222.22 points, or 3.38 percent. The blue chip CSE-30 index climbed 219.62 points, or 3.38 percent, to end at 6710.69. Turnover on the port city's bourse also increased to Tk 353.92 million, from Wednesday's Tk 269.63 million, from 3,063,106 shares traded. Of the issues traded, 40 advanced, 85 fell and ten remained unchanged. Information about individual share prices and movements were not immediately available. Disruption to internet services in South Asia due to a damaged submarine cable in the Mediterranean apparently slowed the website of Dhaka Stock Exchange, but there was no formal notice from the DSE. bdn
