The ministry said in a statement it was not known how the cable was cut but that services would probably take several days to return to normal.

"There has been a cable cut on several cable systems in Alexandria, Egypt which has impacted internet connectivity in India," Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), an internet service provider, said in a statement. VSNL said its service had been "largely restored" by diverting to another cable. India said it had lost more than half of its capacity.
