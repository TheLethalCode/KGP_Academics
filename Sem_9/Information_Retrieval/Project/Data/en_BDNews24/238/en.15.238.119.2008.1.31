 Kabul, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted an Afghan army bus in the centre of Kabul on Thursday, wounding one army officer and four civilians, officials said. The suicide bomber was in a Toyota saloon car, a police official said, adding he blew himself up prematurely, before reaching the target. "The army bus was passing from here when the explosion occured. It looked like the whole place caught fire. Pieces of metal were flying. I saw one man on bicycle got hurt and policemen put him on a ambulance," said witness Sayed Tahir. Ambulances were seen leaving the scene with sirens screaming, and several civilian vehicles were also damaged by the blast, witnesses said. Buses carrying army and police personnel are a favoured Taliban target with at least 65 killed in four such previous attacks in the capital since June last year. Taliban insurgents launched more than 140 suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan last year
