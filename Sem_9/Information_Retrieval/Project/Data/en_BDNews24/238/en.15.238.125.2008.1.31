 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com) - A double strike from Liton Barman powered Sunrise Thursday to a 2-1 win over Wari Club in the Senior Division Football League at Birshreshthho Shaheed Mostafa Stadium in Kamalapur. Wari went ahead in the fourth minute with a strike from Mobarak, but the Old Dhaka outfit's lead was short-lived before Liton Barmon equalised the margin for Sunrise five minutes later. Liton scored his second goal in the 60th minute to give Sunrise second triumph in six matches to join the fifth-placed Badda Jagaroni Chakra with nine points. It was the third loss to Wari, who stuck to the ninth place with six points from seven matches.
