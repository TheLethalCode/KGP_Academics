 PARIS, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France and Germany condemned on Tuesday the arrest of leading Syrian dissident Riad Seif and called on the Damascus government to respect its obligations under international human rights law. Seif, who is ill with cancer, was arrested on Monday and charged with undermining the state. Similar charges that carry long sentences were levelled this week against 10 members of the Damascus Declaration dissident grouping who attended a meeting at Seif's house to galvanise the opposition against President Bashar al-Assad. "France demands the immediate and unconditional liberation of Mr Seif -- whose state of health is a great cause of concern -- as well as other signatories of the Declaration," Foreign Ministry spokesman Pascale Andreani said. "France calls on the Syrian government to respect its international obligations," he said, pointing out that Syria had ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Syrian authorities have denied Seif's requests to be allowed to travel abroad for treatment despite appeals from the United States and the European Union. In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Seif must not be imprisoned for exercising his beliefs. The 60-year-old former member of parliament had already spent almost five years as a political prisoner. "It should not be allowed to happen that someone who has fought with peaceful means for political reform, for the rule of law and for human rights can have their freedom taken away," Steinmeier said in a statement. France and Germany have been leading European efforts to re-engage diplomatically with Syria after relations with Damascus virtually froze after the assassination of former Lebanese premier Rafik al-Hariri, who was well connected with European leaders. A United Nations investigation implicated Syrian and Lebanese security officials in the assassination. Syria denied involvement. Seif has been critical of Syria's policy toward Lebanon, arguing that the Baathist government could learn from Lebanon's democratic model and free market economy. Syria has been ruled by the Baath Party since it took power in a coup in 1963 and banned all opposition. The authorities have renewed a campaign against dissidents in the last two months, including members of what became known as the Damascus Declaration, a grouping of liberal parties who signed a 2005 document calling for democracy in Syria.
