<TITLE> Khodorkovsky on hunger strike over ill colleague </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jailed Russian oil boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has gone on a hunger strike in solidarity with an imprisoned colleague who has been denied treatment for AIDS, his lawyer said on Wednesday. Russia's Supreme Court has refused to release Vasily Alexanian, another jailed executive from Khodorkovsky's YUKOS oil firm who has AIDS and says he will die in prison because prosecutors are deliberately denying him life-saving treatment. "He has started a hunger strike," Khodorkovsky's lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told Reuters on Wednesday. Amstersdam criticised Western governments for not speaking out against the treatment of Alexanian and said Russian prosecutors were "flouting not only international law, but the norms of morality". Jailed for tax evasion and other crimes in a case seen as the Kremlin's vendetta for his political ambitions, Khodorkovksy made a vast fortune following the Soviet Union's collapse. He is serving a 9-year term in a Siberian prison camp. "Khodorkovsky doesn't do things very much halfway. I would say an action like this is pretty serious," said Amsterdam. Alexanian, a former YUKOS vice-president, has AIDS and says he will die in prison because prosecutors are deliberately denying him life-saving treatment. Russia has ignored requests from the European Court of Human Rights that Alexanian be moved to a hospital from jail, where he is being held on pre-trial detention. His case has also been championed by London-based human rights campaigners Amnesty International. Alexanian says he is nearly blind and has a constant fever and suspected tuberculosis. Appearing in court on a video link from his Moscow prison earlier this month, he spoke hoarsely, had difficulty standing and at times appeared close to tears. He has a brother who works as a translator in the Reuters Moscow office
