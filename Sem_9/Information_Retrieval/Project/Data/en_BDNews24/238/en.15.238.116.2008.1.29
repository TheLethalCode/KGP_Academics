 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com) National University's second year honours English examination was held peacefully Tuesday, despite Monday's rumours of leaked questions. There were mixed views about the alleged leaking of questions. Titumir College student of economics Nilufar Yasmin told bdnews24.com after the exam: "Rumours that had spread yesterday about leaked question papers were not true." Nusrat Afreen, a student of Bengali at Eden Girls College, however said she found similarities between the leaked questions and Tuesday's test papers. While another Eden student Parveen Sultana said she found the rumours to have no foundation at all. Fakir Rafiqul Alam, dean of NU's undergraduate (honours) school, told bdnews24.com that the rumours were totally baseless and the examinees disproved them by sitting Tuesday's exams peacefully. Dean of the NU's development and assessment centre Mohammad Bin Kashem, said certain quarters spread the rumours Monday to malign the administration. But whose designs were foiled by holding the exams Tuesday as scheduled, he added. Dozens of students of Eden Girls College and Dhaka College took to the street Monday night after a rumour broke out that questions for Tuesday's exam had been leaked. Traffic on Mirpur Road between Science Laboratory and Azimpur junctions came to a halt during the protest. Students blockading the road demanded the resignation of National University's acting vice chancellor Syed Rashidul Hasan. Hasan Monday ruled out the possibility of leaked questions, saying the questions that were circulating in the dormitories do not match those on the examination paper. He also claimed a vested quarter, with links to private coaching centres, was plotting to taint the image of National University. The examination had already been postponed twice in the wake of similar allegations. It was originally scheduled for Nov 11, deferred to Jan 11 and deferred again to Jan 29. bdnews24.c
