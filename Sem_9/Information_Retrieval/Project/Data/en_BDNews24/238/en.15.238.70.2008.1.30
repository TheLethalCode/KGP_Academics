<TITLE> OPEC unlikely to offer economy help with more oil </TITLE>

 VIENNA, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday offered little hope to consumer nations that it might lift oil supplies to rein crude from over $90 a barrel at a meeting of the producer group on Friday. Alarmed by the growing possibility of a US recession, oil importers are calling on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise production to ease the impact of high fuel costs on slowing economic growth. "At $92 a barrel, OPEC should be thinking of an increase in output," said Francisco Blanch, energy analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It would be the equivalent of an interest-rate cut by the Fed." US crude rose 62 cents to $92.26 by 1500 GMT on Wednesday. US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman has asked OPEC to open the taps "to help our economy." But the 13-member cartel that controls more than half the world's oil exports appears more worried about defending crude prices, even if that stokes recessionary pressures and slows slow demand for its oil. All ministers who have offered an opinion in the run-up to to the meeting say they expect no change in output with talk turning to the prospect of a cut in supply to prop up prices when OPEC next meets in March. "I don't think that OPEC should take any action now," said the head of Libya's OPEC delegation Shokri Ghanem. "We don't think we should do more than consultations and wait until March." "There is no talk about raising output," said one of the first delegates to arrive in Vienna. "I think there is going to be no change." With Washington pushing Saudi Arabia to open the taps, lingering hopes for an output increase rest with Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi. The long-serving minister who guides OPEC thinking may see the political benefit of an increase in cartel production to legitimise the extra volumes Riyadh is thought to have pumped out in recent weeks beyond its official allocation. Tanker trackers estimate Saudi has lifted supplies to about 9.3-9.4 million barrels daily (bpd) in January compared to its 8.8 million bpd OPEC allocation to meet robust winter demand. OPEC decided against an official increase when it last met in December but analysts say demand has lured more oil from Riyadh despite worries about an economic slowdown to come. Naimi would need to bring others in OPEC on board for an agreement on a modest 500,000-bpd increase and convince them that it would not hit prices too hard. "It would be a good chance to gain some political goodwill, but it does not seem there is much consensus on an increase," said Blanch. "There's not a lot of capacity left for OPEC to increase but even the gesture of increasing would be welcome," said Harry Tchilinguirian of BNP Paribas. OPEC habitually blames speculators for high prices but that argument has lost credibility since prices fell from the early January record above $100 a barrel. In the week ending Jan 22, speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange crude contract cut net long positions, a bet prices will rise, to 37,142 positions from 83,991 positions the week before, down from a record 127,491 positions in the middle of last year
