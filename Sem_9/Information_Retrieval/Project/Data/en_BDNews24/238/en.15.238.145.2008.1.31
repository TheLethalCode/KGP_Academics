<TITLE> Serbia's Tadic draws on Kosovo for re-election bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CERNICA, Serbia, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian President Boris Tadic, facing an election on Sunday, pledged his support for the Serb minority in Kosovo on Thursday during a visit to the province that will soon defiantly declare its independence. Shadowed by UN police, Tadic spent an hour in the Serb quarter of Cernica, a 30-minute drive from the eastern boundary of the territory, which has been run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO since 1999. "Thank you for living in Kosovo, and wanting to live in Kosovo, because through you, Serbia lives in Kosovo," he told the small community of a few hundred Serbs, before rolling up his sleeves to play basketball in a tiny schoolyard. Around 120,000 Serbs remain in the territory of 2 million, dominated by ethnic Albanians. Just over half the Serbs live in isolated enclaves like Cernica and the rest in a northern slice adjoining Serbia, and where the West fears a violent backlash against Kosovo's independence. The future of Kosovo is a central issue in the presidential vote in Serbia, which pits Tadic against nationalist challenger Tomislav Nikolic. Both men oppose independence for Kosovo, Serbs' ancestral homeland in the Balkans, but they differ on how Serbia should react, with Kosovo backed by the United States and major Euopean Union powers. Tadic has said he would try to prevent a slide into the defiant nationalism of the 1990s, Nikolic favours a tougher stance and closer ties with Russia, which also opposes Kosovo declaring independence. "We will never give up on our people in Kosovo, and I will do everything I can to take care of them," Tadic said in his last campaign stop before his final rally in Belgrade. Monitors say the race is too close to call. Whoever becomes Serbia's next president will be faced with Kosovo's independence within days of taking office, followed swiftly by recognition from the United States and major EU countries. If Nikolic wins, political sources in Pristina say the West will support a declaration the following weekend, seeing no hope of easing the blow with a hardline president whose party leader is standing trial for war crimes in the 1990s. A Tadic victory could buy at least another week, as the European Union tries to minimise the political fallout from the loss of what many Serbs regard as their religious heartland. "I think Europe will see in Tadic a man who wants to help these people, and will help Europe see that we want to stay here and lead better lives," said villager Zoran Paunovic. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to drive out Serb forces and halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two-year counter-insurgency war.
