<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government Wednesday dismissed a claim in the Indian press that Bangladesh was the main source of the avian virus in the state of West Bengal. The foreign affairs ministry in a statement said that India reported the outbreak of bird flu officially in 2006, and is now the fourth recurrence. On the other hand, the situation in Bangladesh was under control thanks to intensive surveillance, the statement said. "Due to the demand-supply situation and price differentials, movement of poultry products from Bangladesh to India is neither conceivable nor viable," the statement said adding that the virus was transmitted only through contact with contaminated birds and chicks. It said that poultry could rather be smuggled to Bangladesh from India as the price was higher in the former. The government said that the pubic officials had not dealt with the matter in an objective manner. The Indian media quoted some government officials in their reports. Bangladesh urged all to be objective while reporting to avoid pessimistic impression in the minds of the peoples of the two countries. It said that the situation needed to be addressed by both the countries and Bangladesh was fully prepared to co-operate with India in this regard. bd
