 LONDON, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading shares dipped 0.4 percent early on Wednesday, pulled lower by banks, ahead of the US Federal Reserve's verdict on interest rates later in the day. At 0833 GMT the FTSE 100 was down 26.1 points at 5,859.1, after advancing 1.7 percent in the previous session. European shares also eased in early trade, and Asian markets fell back overnight, though rate-cut hopes had lifted US stocks on Tuesday. Financial markets see a three-in-four chance the Fed will lower benchmark rates by a half-percentage point, with at least a quarter-point trim considered a certainty, as the central bank seeks to counter the risk of a US recession. "The market will tank if we don't get a cut," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. "It is needed -- it could go further, (but) I do not think we'll have greater than a 50 basis point cut today." "It doesn't solve the (slowdown) problem. It creates an environment where we can begin to move forward, but we still have to learn to adjust from the huge sweeping change from West to East of economic power." Among banking stocks, Barclays dipped 1 percent after Citigroup cut its price target to 400 pence from 450 pence, while Royal Bank of Scotland was down 1.8 percent after the same brokerage cut its target to 350 pence from 400 pence. Investors remained cautious towards banks, as UBS posted a 12.5 billion Swiss franc ($11.45 billion) loss for the last three months of 2007, dragging the bank deep into the red for the full year as subprime losses took their toll. British Finance Minister Alistair Darling is expected to set out plans to beef up Britain's financial supervision laws to try to prevent any repeat of a bank run such as hit Northern Rock last year. Investors fearing for the health of the world's largest economy are also waiting for U.S. fourth-quarter GDP data due at 1330 GMT. In commodities, BHP Billiton fell 0.7 percent, and its bid target Rio Tinto rose 2.1 percent on market talk that Rio had opened its books to its predator, traders said. Rio was not immediately available for comment. Australian newspapers reported Rio's financial advisers suggested BHP could afford to raise its share offer by at least 42 percent to $157 billion.. Elsewhere in the sector, Indian-focused metals group Vedanta Resources rose 1 percent after it posted a 7.3 percent fall in third-quarter core profit, better than analysts had expected. Copper miner Kazakhmys was up 0.5 percent after posting a 19 percent jump in fourth-quarter copper cathode output relative to the previous quarter. Friends Provident fell 3.3 percent after the appointment of a well-respected new chief executive dimmed the likelihood that the insurer will be taken over. Standard Life lost 2.4 percent, despite posting a 12 percent rise in 2007 worldwide life and pensions sales on Wednesday, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts, but signalled a tougher year ahead in 2008. See. United Utilities dropped 0.7 percent after it said it was trading and growing its assets as anticipated. On the upside, Vodafone shares rose 1.8 percent after Merrill Lynch added the company to its "Europe 1" list of top European stock recommendations. Merrill analysts said the telecommunications sector, especially wireless technology, was well positioned to weather current market turmoil.
