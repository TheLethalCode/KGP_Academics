<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu Monday insisted that representatives from professional groups be present during dialogue between the government and political parties. "The dialogue should be broadcast live. Measures must be taken to ensure transparency, and then no one can be blamed if the dialogue fails," Amu told reporters at his Eskaton home. The AL leader said teachers, lawyers and student representatives should be present during the dialogue as observers. "The Awami League will not take part in the discussion if any undue conditions are imposed. The dialogue must be held by March," said Amu. The AL leader added that his party was now willing to wait until the end of the year for the general election. The AL had previously demanded the national polls be held in June or July. bdnews
