 NAIROBI, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least nine political inmates have died in a secret Eritrean prison where they are routinely tortured using plastic whips, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Wednesday. The media rights groups said an anonymous source detailed how detainees, including four journalists, were kept day and night under lights. Some were manacled and tortured, it said. "The prison camp known as Eiraeiro is a disgrace for Eritrea and Africa," RSF said. Asmara routinely denies criticism from foreign-based rights groups, accusing them of acting on behalf of some world powers. Information Minister Ali Abdu says the government will not respond to "each stupid comment" by groups such as RSF. The press freedom organisation called the prison on Eritrea's eastern coastline an "African gulag" and "daily hell." It said the prisoners' heads were shaved every two months and they were allowed only 20 minutes per week to bathe. Late last year, RSF called Eritrea the worst nation in the world for press freedom. Lacking independent media and often accused of harassing journalists, Eritrea is consistently ranked among the world's top violators of press freedom by rights groups
