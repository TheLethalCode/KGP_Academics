<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission reiterated Tuesday that it did not violate the constitution by failing to hold elections within the stipulated 90 day timeframe. "As commissioners, we have pledged to sustain the constitution. We in no way violated it," election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at the EC secretariat. Another commissioner, Mohammad Sohul Hossain, echoed him. Sakhawat said the High Court order made following a writ petition on Jan 29 last year halted all elections for three months. The commissioner added that a later directive from the HC, on March 27, ordered the EC to prepare voter listing and national identity cards under a revised system. In addition, the commission was tasked with reforming electoral law. "The directive did not contain any time frame for holding the elections. We have made the roadmap based on that ruling," he said. "The court's verdict shelved any obligation to hold the election within 90 days," Sakhawat said. The HC Sunday ordered the government and the EC to explain why they should not be directed to hold the Jatiya Sangsad elections within a 'reasonable timeframe'. The court also asked the caretaker administration to explain why their failure to hold the national polls within the allotted timeframe should not be declared illegal. On the government's recent decision to delegate responsibility for upazila elections to the commission, Sakhawat said: "We haven't received the notice yet. We have only seen it in the newspaper." "If we get responsibility to hold the upazila polls we will have to consider whether to hold them simultaneously with the parliamentary elections," said the commissioner. bdnew
