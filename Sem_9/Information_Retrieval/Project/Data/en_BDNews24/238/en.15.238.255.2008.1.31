<TITLE> EU to fully open postal markets from 2011 </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's 88 billion euro ($130.8 billion) mail markets will be opened up to full competition from the start of 2011 under plans adopted by the bloc's assembly on Thursday. The European Parliament sealed a 15-year long process of injecting competition into national postal services by prising open the final protected sector -- letters weighing up to 50 grams. Mail above that weight is fully liberalised. "So far, the liberalisation of the postal market has been a success story," said Andrej Vizjak, economy minister for EU president Slovenia. Slovenia holds the EU's rotating presidency. "New players have entered the market, new market opportunities have emerged not only for new market entrants but also for the incumbents. And for users, new services have been developed," Vizjak told the assembly. The measure adopted on Thursday has already been agreed with EU states, who will formally rubberstamp it in coming weeks. The plans have sparked protests by postal workers in many EU nations, especially France, who fear job losses in a sector that employs 5.2 million people that deliver 135 billion letters a year. Most letters are now from businesses, such as bank statements, as people opt to communicate with each other by email or mobile phone. Twelve of the EU's 27 states, mainly in eastern Europe along with Greece and Luxembourg will not have to open up their markets until the start of 2013. Safeguards on working conditions and collective pay bargaining were also inserted into the reform. Five EU states, Britain, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and Sweden have already fully opened up their markets to full competition where operators such as Germany's Deutsche Post and Dutch TNT compete. The European Commission, which drafted the measure, had wanted full market opening from 2009 but was defeated by the assembly and many EU states who wanted longer for their national monopolies to adapt. The plan contains several options for EU states to ensure that the so-called universal service -- regular collections and deliveries -- is of a high standard in all parts of the country, including rural areas. "Postal services must be able to compete not necessarily against each other but against other technologies and there must be a level playing field," British socialist lawmaker Brian Simpson said. The Green Party said liberalisation will lead to scaled down services. "This will particularly hit those in rural, peripheral or mountainous regions, who are dependent on these services and whose access to other modes of communication is already reduced in many cases," Austrian Green lawmaker Eva Lichtenberger sa
