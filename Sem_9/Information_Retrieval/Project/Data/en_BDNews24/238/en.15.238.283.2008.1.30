 Kinshasa, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rescuers in Democratic Republic of Congo have recovered at least 10 bodies from a ferry packed with passengers and merchandise which sank on Lake Tanganyika after hitting a rock, a maritime official said on Wednesday. Francois Xavier Kafimbo of Congo's maritime inspection agency said authorities were trying to find survivors thought to have swum ashore after the sinking, which occurred on Friday five km (three miles) south of the eastern lake town of Kalemie. Twelve people have been reported missing by relatives. Kalemie is located on Congo's far eastern Lake Tanganyika border with Tanzania and it took several days for news of the accident to reach the capital Kinshasa in the west. Kafimbo said the accident occurred in the early evening when the ferry approached the lake shore to pick up more passengers. "The lake was calm, but the captain didn't take precautions before putting ashore ... He hit a rock and that's what sank it," he told Reuters by phone from Kalemie, adding that the boat went down some 200 metres (yards) from the shore. Kafimbo could not say exactly how many passengers were still missing. Friends and relatives had asked the authorities to help find 12 passengers who they reported missing, he said. The passenger manifest listed 58 people on board the vessel, which was travelling to Moba, 130 km(80 miles) south of Kalemie. River boats and lake ferries in Congo are routinely overloaded with unregistered passengers and goods, safety regulations go largely unenforced and accidents are frequent. Congo, a vast former Belgian colony in central Africa which is still struggling to recover from a devastating 1998-2003 war, has few good roads and people often choose to travel on lakes and rivers in canoes and ferries
