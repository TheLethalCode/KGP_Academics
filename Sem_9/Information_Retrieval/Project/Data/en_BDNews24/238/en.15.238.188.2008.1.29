 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court is expected to give a ruling on Feb 25 in the case of Prothom Alo cartoonist Arifur Rahman, arrested and detained last year for drawing a cartoon that purportedly hurt religious sentiment. Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Shahin Uddin set the verdict date after hearing Barrister Sara Hossain's appeal that the accused should be should be cleared of all charges. Barrister Hossain said that Arif had simply submitted the cartoon in question to Prothom Alo's satire magazine Aalpin. He did not have the authority to decide whether it would be published, she argued. He did not draw the cartoon with the intention of hurting anybody's religious sentiment, and he expresses his sorrow if anybody was hurt unintentionally, she said on behalf of her client. Detective branch police arrested Arif on Sept 18, 2007, in connection with the cartoon that appeared in the magazine Aalpin, published by Bangla language newspaper Prothom Alo. Former Tejgaon police chief Jane Alam filed the case against Arif with the CMM Court for Dhaka on Sept 20 accusing him of hurting the religious sentiment of the Muslim community. Arifur Rahman has been detained in jail since his arrest. bdnews24.
