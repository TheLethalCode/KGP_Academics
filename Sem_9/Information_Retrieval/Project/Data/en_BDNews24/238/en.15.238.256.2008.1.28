<TEXT>
 ADELAIDE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia completed a 2-1 series victory over India on Monday after the fourth and final test ended in a draw at Adelaide Oval. With neither side in a position to push for a result, India batted out the last day before the opposing captains agreed to an early finish. Australia skipper Ricky Ponting congratulated his side on their success and paid a glowing tribute to India after a hard-fought series. "India have played some great cricket over this series, they can be very proud of their efforts this series," Ponting said. "They've probably proved now that they are the No.2-ranked team in the world, so congratulations India for the way you've played. We've certainly enjoyed playing against you." Indian captain Anil Kumble repaid the compliment as the two sets of players embraced each other on the field, in stark contrast to the bitter ending to the Sydney test earlier this month when a feud almost forced the cancellation of the tour. "I'd like to congratulate Ricky and his team and then congratulations to all my team mates for the effort shown right through the series," Kumble said. "It was always a challenge to come to Australia and do well but we showed that Indian cricket is here and competing against the best and the way that we played, I'm really proud." India, who needed to win the match to draw the series, finished the game on 269 for seven in their second innings and an overall lead of 232 runs. The final day was dominated by India's dashing opener Virender Sehwag and the emotional retirement of Adam Gilchrist. Australia's vice captain stunned the cricket world on Saturday when he announced he was quitting test cricket at the end of the match, then one-day internationals in March. Gilchrist capped his last day in test cricket with two catches to take his final career tally to 416 dismissals, three days after breaking the world record for a wicketkeeper. "It's joy, sadness, everything. Every emotion you could imagine I suppose," Gilchrist told the crowd. "To walk away from something you've loved so much, it was a big decision, but I know it's the right one." Sehwag thumped a brilliant 151 and occupied the crease for more than five hours, contributing more than half the Indian total. No other Indian batsman made more than 20, though most seemed content simply to bat for time rather than runs once the prospect of a result faded. GLIMMER OF HOPE There was never much chance of a result after both teams made in excess of 500 runs in their first innings, but Sehwag at least gave the Indians a glimmer of hope of getting far enough ahead to set up an early declaration on the last day. The 29-year-old blazed his way to his 13th test century off 123 balls before lunch but was forced to curb his attacking instincts when Rahul Dravid suffered a broken finger and India started losing wickets at regular intervals. Dravid retired hurt on 13 when he was struck on the finger by a short-pitched delivery from express paceman Brett Lee, who was named player of the series. Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman all fell cheaply, forcing Sehwag to adopt a more defensive approach. Tendulkar, who was named man of the match after scoring a hundred in the first innings, was run out for 13 after a direct hit from Mitchell Johnson. Ganguly went for 18 when he spooned a catch off Johnson to Mike Hussey at short cover, while Laxman fell for 12 when he glanced a catch off Lee to Gilchrist. Lee captured a second wicket when he dismissed Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 20, brilliantly caught by Matthew Hayden in the slips, then Gilchrist caught Sehwag when he got a nick off Andrew Symonds. Harbhajan Singh departed for seven, caught by Ponting off Brad Hogg, leaving Kumble (nine not out) and Ishant Sharma (two not out) to bat out the last few overs before the skippers shook hands
