 NAIVASHA, Kenya, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Like many in Kenya's Rift Valley town of Naivasha, Jane Njeri tried to return to business as usual on Wednesday, opening her shop doors to those needing anything from maize and vegetables to phone credit. After days of attacks by Kikuyu mobs against Naivasha's Luo, Luhya and Kalenjin communities, the army sent in helicopters on Tuesday which fired rubber bullets to disperse armed crowds. Since then, the looting of houses and burning of property appear to have subsided. More buses are plying the main road through the lakeside town, which lies at the heart of Kenya's multi-million dollar horticultural industry. "We thank God. Since the helicopters yesterday, things have begun to get back to normal," Njeri said from behind her counter as customers dropped into her tiny shop. "Because people were stuck at home, they are coming in and buying lots." Clashes since President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election on Dec. 27 have killed over 850 people and displaced at least 250,000. His challenger, Raila Odinga, says the vote was rigged. More than 100 people have died in clashes in Naivasha and Nakuru, another Rift Valley town, over the last week alone. The top U.S. diplomat for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, described what has happened in the Rift Valley as ethic cleansing. During the violence, mobs in Naivasha stopped buses and checked identity cards of those on board, dragging off, beating and, in some cases, killing those from rival ethnic groups. Though calmer, the town remains deeply divided. Hounded from their homes, which have since been looted and in some cases torched, Naivasha's 8,000 displaced have gathered under armed guard in the town's police station and prison. Eyewitnesses said several who tried to return home to retrieve belongings on Wednesday were caught by Kikuyu crowds and beaten until police intervened, firing into the air. Officers also had to fire into the air to prevent a crowd of displaced people from lynching several Kikuyus walking past the police station, an aid worker said. DEEP WOUNDS Land and ethnic issues have played a long and complicated role in Kenya's politics and history. But clashes have never degenerated into the level of violence that the country, long seen as a haven of stability in the region, is experiencing now. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is leading mediation efforts, has said the unrest had gone beyond an election dispute, denouncing systematic rights abuses. Kibaki and Odinga's representatives began formal talks on Tuesday, offering Kenyans some hope of a peaceful solution. Many of Naivasha's flower farms are opening up again, trying to make up for lost time harvesting and packing roses before Valentine's Day, which makes up some 40 percent of earnings. Farms are still short of labour, running at just 30 percent in one case, and are having to recruit casual workers to make up for those who are unable or too afraid to go to work. Other residents are anxiously watching the negotiations, saying peace here depends on their leaders' priorities. "It depends on how they go about it," said Edward Njoroge Chege, a science and maths teacher at Naivasha Highway School. "They must listen to what the people want not just what they want. They should find a compromise and not take a hardline stance. There must be some give and take. People have suffered too much."
