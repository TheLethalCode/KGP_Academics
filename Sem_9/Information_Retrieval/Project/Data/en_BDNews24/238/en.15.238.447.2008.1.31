<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday ruled illegal the detention of Sylhet City mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran. The court ordered the government to release him from prison if there was no other case against him. Justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman issued the ruling after hearing a writ petition filed by the mayor's son Arman Ahmed challenging the detention of the mayor. Kamran's lawyer AM Aminuddin told the reporters that his client would not be released now as another case was pending against him. Joint forces arrested the mayor on May 19 last year. Later on May 21, the government ordered his detention under the Special Powers Act. Arman filed the writ petition with the High Court on June 6, challenging the legality of detention of his father. The HC on June 17 asked the government to explain why the detention of Kamran would not be declared illegal. AM Aminuddin defended the mayor in court while deputy attorney general Mubina Asaf represented the state. bdnew
