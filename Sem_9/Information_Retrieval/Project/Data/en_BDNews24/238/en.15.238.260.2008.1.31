 PODGORICA, Jan 31 (bdnews2.com/Reuters) - Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic resigned on Thursday citing health reasons, paving the way for the return to power of former PM Milo Djukanovic, the longest-serving politician in the Balkans. Sturanovic, who announced last year he has lung cancer, said in his resignation letter to parliament that his doctors recommended a "significant decrease of his working activities". "At this time, Montenegro needs the full commitment of all its officials," he wrote. "I decided to resign to create the conditions for the government to function at full capacity." Senior officials in Sturanovic's governing Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) told Reuters that Djukanovic, 45, was lined up to take up the post, likely at a party session next week. Djukanovic was president or prime minister of the coastal republic from 1991 to 2006 and the main driver behind its vote for independence two years ago. He quit from active politics in late 2006 but retained the post of DPS head. He earlier said he was aware of his responsibility as DPS leader, but was not in a rush to get back to politics. "If the occasion calls for a different political layout, I do not have a right to follow only my personal interest," Djukanovic told Bosnia's Hayat TV last week. Even in semi-retirement, few doubted he was still the most powerful political figure in the Adriatic state of 650,000. The DPS's junior coalition partner in the government, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has said it was ready to support Djukanovic as Premier. Since leaving its lopsided union with Serbia, the country has posted strong growth mostly due to a boom in tourism and steady foreign direct investment flows, especially in real estate. It has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union and hopes to join the bloc by 2015
