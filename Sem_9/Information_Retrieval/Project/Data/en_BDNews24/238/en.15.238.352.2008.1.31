<TITLE> Ex-minister warns UK's Brown he could lose election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former cabinet minister attacked British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government on Thursday, warning there was a risk the ruling Labour Party could lose the next election and face a decade in opposition. Although he did not target Brown by name for his fiercest criticisms, former interior minister Charles Clarke's broadside was the strongest sign yet of unrest within the Labour Party over Brown's leadership. Since replacing former Prime Minister Tony Blair in June last year, Brown's opinion poll ratings have slumped due to a series of government blunders, a party funding scandal and the country's first bank run in more than a century. The opposition Conservatives, who lost the last three general elections, now lead Labour by around eight points. In an article, Clarke said Labour had to stop harping on its achievements over the last decade and look to the future. "If Labour gets it all wrong (and the Conservatives get it all right) the next general election ... will become the next major turning point, leading to more than a decade of Tory (Conservative) power," Clarke wrote in Progress magazine, the voice of a group of "progressive" Labour members. But if Labour got it right, the party could easily win well again, he said. Brown does not have to call an election before 2010 and Clarke said he expected it in May 2010. Blair fired Clarke from his cabinet in 2006 over immigration scandals. He has always been outspoken, attacking Brown in a September 2006 newspaper interview as a control freak. Clarke wrote in Progress that Labour had wasted much of the last two years, preoccupied with internal party politics. Interviewed on BBC Radio, Clarke said his point "isn't about Gordon Brown's leadership specifically". He said the party had suffered similar problems during Blair's final years in office. He insisted he had a "very cordial" relationship with Brown. "He's obviously entitled to express his views. The prime minister believes Charles Clarke is a distinguished and experienced former minister with much to offer public life," Brown's spokesman said in response to Clarke's article. Despite poor poll numbers, Brown has faced no overt challenge to his leadership.
