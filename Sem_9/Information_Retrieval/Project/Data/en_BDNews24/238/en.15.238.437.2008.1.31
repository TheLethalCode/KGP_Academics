 HONG KONG, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks ended one of the worst months on record on a slightly brighter note on Thursday, brushing aside worries about top US bond insurers' credit ratings, while the latest US interest rate cut weighed on the dollar. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was up 0.9 percent at 0700 GMT, but remained on track to fall more than 12 percent in January, its worst monthly fall since September 2001. With US gloom lingering despite a 50 basis point cut from the Federal Reserve, financial bookmakers expected major European markets to open 0.8-1.2 percent lower. "The 'Doubting Thomases' have certainly massed their troops. Is this cut enough? Is recession just around the corner? US GDP for the fourth-quarter came in at 0.6 percent when 1.2 percent was expected," said David Buik of Cantor Index. "However jobs are still being created, so the market waits with bated breath for Friday's US payroll numbers." Speculation on financial television network CNBC that credit rating firms might downgrade Ambac Financial Group Inc and MBIA Inc pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 0.3 percent and spooked Asian markets in early trade. But stocks recovered ground after MBIA said private-equity firm Warburg Pincus had made a $500 million investment in it. TOKYO, SEOUL GAIN Japan's Nikkei average ended 1.9 percent higher, with shares of top bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) back in the black and exporters such as Toyota Motor Co, Hitachi and Sony Corp, providing some extra lift. Seoul rose 2.2 percent, with battered shipbuilders such as STX Pan Ocean seen as oversold and cheered by a 5 percent jump in the Baltic Exchange's dry freight index on Wednesday. Chip makers also rose on stabilising DRAM memory chip prices. "National pension funds stepped in to buy domestic stocks after markets plunged to nine-months lows on Wednesday," said Lee Woo-hyun, a strategist at Kyobo Securities in Seoul. "Most possible negative news seem to be out of the bag; U.S. recession fears, inflation, subprime mortgages ... and now some investors are turning focus to how a recent string of economic stimulus measures will be making an impact." FED CUTS The Fed's widely-anticipated half-percentage-point rate cut on Wednesday did little to prop sentiment, with expectations that U.S. rates will fall further keeping the dollar under pressure. It hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc, dipping under 1.08 francs on electronic trading platform EBS before recovering to 1.0826 francs. Against the yen it slumped towards 106 before recovering to above 106.5. A Reuters poll showed 15 out of 16 primary dealers on Wall Street surveyed after Wednesday's rate cut expect the central bank to trim rates again at its next meeting in March. In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index ended up 0.6 percent, but still shed 10.9 percent in January -- its biggest ever monthly fall. Stocks in Shanghai, Taiwan and Hong Kong all fell. Safe-haven gold hovered around $925 an ounce, just shy of the record $933.10 set on Tuesday. But an auction of two-year Japanese government bonds, often seen as safe haven debt, produced a slightly weaker result than expected with investors cautious of buying the maturity on doubts whether the Bank of Japan will cut rates. "The JGB market continues to take its cue from stocks, but it's mainly driven by incentives to earn quick profits from dealings rather than investment based on a clear conviction that the Bank of Japan will cut interest rates," said Naomi Hasegawa, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Crude oil prices which had risen past $92 a barrel on Wednesday fell as far as $90.80 in early Asian trade but bounced back to recover most of the lost ground at $91.
