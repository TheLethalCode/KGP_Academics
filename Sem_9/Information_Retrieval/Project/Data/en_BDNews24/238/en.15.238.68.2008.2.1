"To avoid and minimise public harassment, there will be twelve separate entrance lines to two gates of the Bangla Academy this year." "There will also be a separate entrance for women and children. The middle gate of the academy will be the exit," he said. Event management organisation Media Step is undertaking the staging and lighting. A number of decorative gates have also been erected across the avenue in front of the academy from Shikkha Bhaban to Dhaka University's TSC. The academy's coordination and public relations department will hold a press conference titled Gronthomela Protidin at 5.30pm every day in the seminar room. bdnews24.com/mds
