 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  A prisons official Tuesday said doctors had recommended former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman receive treatment in hospital. A five-member medical team led by Prof Sirajuddin Ahmed, chairman of BSMMU's orthopaedic department, called for the transfer after examining Tarique. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of prisons, said Tarique was taken to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University at 11.30am after he complained of pains in his neck and midriff. The senior joint secretary general of the BNP was returned to Dhaka Central Jail mid-afternoon. "He will be taken to hospital again Wednesday," Siddiqui said. Siddiqui said no detainee's treatment is neglected, and everyone under detention receives medical assistance in line with the jail code. "We asked the medical board to make a final decision after reviewing the test results," he said. As many as 18 VIP detainees were scheduled to return to jail Tuesday from the BSMMU hospital's prisons cell after medical reviews. bdnews
