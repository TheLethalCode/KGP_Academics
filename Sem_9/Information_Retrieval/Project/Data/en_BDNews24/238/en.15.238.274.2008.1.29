 Dhaka, January 29 (bdnews24.com) The home ministry Tuesday asked top police officers to stay vigilant against extrajudicial killings and potential cases of torture in custody, officials said. The directive came from MA Matin's first meeting as home affairs adviser with senior police officers. "We have instructed all parties concerned to strictly adhere to the orders given from the meeting," Noor Mohammad, inspector general of police, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. The adviser and the home secretary declined to talk to reporters. An official who attended the meeting said the police had asked the adviser to assist in their application of a 30 percent incentive bonus. The official, who requested anonymity, said the adviser declined to commit to the wage bonus, citing budget constraints. He did not, however, rule out a future deal. According to the official, Matin asked the police officers to play their part in ensuring the upcoming general elections are conducted in a free and fair manner. The adviser also expressed concern over prosecution rates in acid attack cases, the official said. Matin also demanded higher levels of scrutiny from senior police officers over their subordinates' actions to increase prosecution rates and good conduct, the official said. bdnew
