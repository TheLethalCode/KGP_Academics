 MOSCOW, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, President Vladimir Putin's chosen successor, will win 71 percent of the votes in March's Russian presidential election, state-owned pollster VTsIOM predicted on Thursday. Medvedev, who enjoys full Kremlin backing and blanket coverage in state-owned media, has been consistently way ahead of his opponents in all polls published to date. In field work conducted from Jan 26-27 among 1,600 committed Russian voters in 46 regions, VTsIOM predicted Communist Party Leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 12.8 percent. Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was second with 11.5 percent. Andrei Bogdanov of the tiny Democratic Party received 0.9 percent of the predicted votes. VTsIOM said the margin of error was 3.4 percent and predicted a 70.7 percent turnout on March 2.
