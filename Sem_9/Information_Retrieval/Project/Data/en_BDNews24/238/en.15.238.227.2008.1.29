<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Tevez, enjoying one of the best spells of his career at Manchester United, said he was impressed with fellow striker Wayne Rooney and former England midfielder Paul Scholes. In an interview with an Argentine radio station, Tevez also said the going was tough in the Premier League and he needed a break at the end of the season, casting doubt over his availability for Argentina against Brazil in a World Cup qualifier in June. "Rooney is phenomenal. He was one of those who treated me best when I arrived (at United). He would come and talk to me and was concerned about me," Tevez told Radio Del Plata in quotes picked up by La Nacion newspaper. "Before I got to Manchester he always said he wanted to play with me. He and Scholes are the ones that have impressed me most as players," Tevez said after scoring in United's 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday. Tevez, who has scored 10 league goals for United and 13 overall, said Premier League defences were tough but fair. "The defenders are very hard. I finish the matches very tired. They don't go in to hurt you but they go very hard for the ball," he said. "I'm struggling to recover (after each match) because I haven't had any holidays... I can't finish the matches because I dip in the final 25 minutes, I struggle to maintain the rhythm. "It's going to be difficult for me to play against Brazil in the qualifiers," Tevez said. "My body's asking me to rest because I haven't had a holiday for two years. I want to see how I am at the end of May to see how my body is." Tevez will miss Argentina's next qualifier against Ecuador in Buenos Aires on June 14 or 15, three days before match in Brazil, through suspension. The 23-year-old added that he would like to end his career back at Boca Juniors, but only after another four or five years at United and maybe even a return to Corinthians in Brazi
