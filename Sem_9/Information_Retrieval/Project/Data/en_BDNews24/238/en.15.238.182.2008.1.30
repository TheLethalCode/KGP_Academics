VPIB is a joint venture between US-based non-resident Bangladeshi (NRB) institutional investors, namely US-Bangladesh Investment Group and Terra Resources International. Speaking at the launch of the company, acting charge d'affaires of US embassy Denise Rollins said the US supported the current government's stand to reform institutions as it would enhance the country's economic growth.
