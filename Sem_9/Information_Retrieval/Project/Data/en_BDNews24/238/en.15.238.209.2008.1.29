<TITLE> The property mass exodus: has it created value? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Billions of pounds have been flowing out of commercial property funds as investors desert a sector that went into freefall when the global credit crunch exacerbated the onset of a cyclical decline in property prices. The mass exodus has seen a growing band of fund managers shut the door on new withdrawals to ensure that the high level of redemption requests does not force property sales. Some analysts, however, are calling the bottom of the market, and say there are now bargains to be had. It begs the question: is there currently value in property? And are property shares -- which investors are, of course, free to buy and sell at will -- a better bet than funds that invest in actual bricks and mortar, with their intrinsic illiquidity? Total returns from commercial property fell 3.7 percent in December -- the worst performance for 20 years -- according to latest statistics from the IPD index, the key industry benchmark. UK pooled property funds saw a 9.1 percent drop in total returns in the last quarter of 2007 -- the lowest figure since the index began in 1990 -- and annual returns were down 6.7 percent, their weakest since the last property slump in 1991. As performance nosedives, investors have been clamouring for the exit -- a major contributing factor to New Star's shock profit warning earlier this month, which sent its share tumbling more than 30 percent. It is a marked turnaround from the first half of 2007. Overall, the specialist sector proved the most popular in sales of unit trust and open-ended investment companies (Oeics) during 2007, according to data from the Investment Management Association (IMA). It attracted 3.2 billion pounds-worth of new retail money, of which property funds accounted for 2.1 billion pounds. But in December, 242 million pounds of a total net retail outflow of 844 million pounds was from property funds. Institutional investors staged a similar mass departure, taking the total net outflow from property funds to 537 million pounds. "The first 10 months of 2007 saw a continuation of the strong performance of the previous year," said Richard Saunders, chief executive of the IMA. "In November and December, however, as the impact of the credit crunch began to be felt, investors significantly re-evaluated their portfolios and the industry experienced its first overall retail outflows in 15 years." In a bid to prevent liquidity dropping to dangerous levels, forcing fire-sales, and safeguard value for those who remain invested, insurers and investment houses have suspended trading in property funds. Close Investments recently followed Scottish Widows and Friends Provident in imposing a freeze of at least six months on withdrawals. "(This) is just another example of apparently open-ended property funds that permit redemptions not being open if too many people want to leave at once," said Stuart Law, chief executive of Assetz Fund Management, which operates closed-ended property funds that tend to have a life of five to seven years. Scottish Equitable (part of Aegon) has told 129,000 small investors that they will not be able to access their money for up to a year, while Standard Life, Prudential, Norwich Union and New Star all raised the cost of exiting their property funds as confidence in the sector started to wane. Investing in property equities or real-estate investment trusts (REITs), like British Land and Land Securities, where liquidity is provided by the stock exchange rather than fund providers, allows investors to avoid such "lock-ins". But, while the IPD is off about 14 percent since last summer, property shares have dropped more sharply and REITs are now trading at discounts of around 30 percent. "The twin investment risk of negative equity sentiment and negative property sentiment can act as a double whammy when they occur together," said Steve Potter, head of technical services at Tilney Private Wealth Management. "Sure, you can generally exit these investments more easily -- but at what price? "Suffering a significant paper loss when the buy-out value is less than the NAV (net asset value) is not necessarily a good move." Property company shares are, however, starting to bounce back, implying that the write-down in values has been taken and analysts think prices are beginning to bottom out. "It does represent a significant buying opportunity for people looking to buy into REITs and open property funds, as these artificially low values are like winding the clock back and allowing investors to buy in on past values at respectable yields again," said Law. But others say the continuing volatility in equity markets could thwart any recovery in property shares. "It would only take one piece of bad news to get out for the shares to dip rapidly again," said Iain Keys, director of real estate at investment manager London & Capital. The outlook appears similarly shaky for the commercial property sector overall and funds that invest in it. Keys believes existing property funds will sustain further losses in the next three to six months, while Peter Bickley, director of economics at Tilney, the UK arm of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, thinks that, despite recent falls, much UK commercial property -- especially at either end of the market -- is "still looking overpriced". "Many investors see property as a non-correlating asset class (something that behaves differently from equities) and that's why, when buying into commercial property, they prefer bricks and mortar funds," he said. "But now's not the time to buy these: we think there's still further to go." Experts do, however, see some opportunities. Bickley said investors could find value in "well-run" property funds in Asia, while Keys said new property funds set up to take advantage of the sector's collapse could represent opportunity. "If prices are near the bottom, an investment into a new fund should provide the most stable and least volatile investment," said Keys. "There is an argument the market has over-reacted to the crisis, so a new fund with no baggage could produce some good return
