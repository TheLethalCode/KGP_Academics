 TAMALE, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o scored twice to help his side beat Sudan 3-0 and reach the African Nations Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday, while his coach Otto Pfister fumed over organisation at the tournament. Eto'o's first goal, a 27th-minute penalty, made him the highest scorer in the tournament's history with 15 goals. A bizarre own goal put Cameroon in complete command before Eto'o struck again in injury-time to send Sudan to their third straight 3-0 defeat. Cameroon finished second in Group C with six points, one behind defending champions Egypt who guaranteed their place despite being held 1-1 by unfancied Zambia. Sudan's record of three defeats, no goals scored and nine conceded is the worst in Nations Cup history. Eto'o, who overtook the 38-year-old record of Ivory Coast's Laurent Pokou, refused to comment but Pfister had plenty to say about tournament organisers. "This is a total disaster. I don't know if this is the Nations Cup or a tournament for children," he said. "We have to put on this organising committee people who have played football." Pfister complained that his team had been forced to travel from Kumasi to Tamale on the eve of the game and had wasted most of Tuesday day sitting around and waiting. He said their flight was late, their luggage and balls were left behind and their hotel rooms and lunch were not ready when they arrived in Tamale. "We completely lost the day," said the German, whose outburst was still gathering steam when Confederation of African Football (CAF) officials stopped the media conference. MISSED CHANCES Eto'o should have scored in the third minute when he had a clear chance from close-range but his first effort was saved by Mahjoub El Moez and he somehow fired the rebound over the crossbar. But the Barcelona striker made no mistake from the spot after Cameroon won a penalty. Cameroon went further ahead six minutes later when Sudan midfielder Rtshard Justin Lado's attempted clearance hit Mohamed Ali Khider and rebounded into the net. Sudan improved after halftime but Eto'o had the last say when he broke away to score his fifth goal of the tournament in injury-time. In Kumasi, Egypt went ahead in the 15th minute when Amr Zaki scored at the end of a swift move, Sayed Moawad providing him with an easy finish for his second goal of the tournament. Egypt missed a string of chances and were caught out when Chris Katongo blasted home from close range in the 89th minute. "At least we go home with some kind of satisfaction, displaying the talent and skill in our team. It is a pity we are going, as we could have added more entertainment to this tournament," insisted Zambia coach Patrick Phiri. Egypt stay in Kumasi for Monday's quarter-final against the runners-up from Group D, which features Tunisia, Angola, South Africa and Senegal. Cameroon stay in Tamale to face the Group D winners the same da
