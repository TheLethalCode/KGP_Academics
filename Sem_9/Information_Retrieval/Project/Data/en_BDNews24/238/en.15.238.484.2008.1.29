In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed." - May 1, 2003, aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln under a banner declaring "Mission Accomplished."

"Stay the course means keep doing what you're doing. My attitude is, don't do what you're doing if it's not working -- change. Stay the course also means don't leave before the job is done. We're going to get the job done in Iraq." - October 11, 2006, White House Rose Garden. "It's my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. ... Absolutely, we're winning." - October 25, 2006, White House East Room. "We're not winning, we're not losing." - December 19, 2006, interview with The Washington Post (published on December 20).

Realizing this vision will be difficult, but it is achievable." - September 13, 2007, address from the Oval Office. "Some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt.
