 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Professor Muzaffer Ahmad, chairman of corruption watchdog TIB, Thursday said that mobile phone operators tied to illegal VoIP business must be punished. Contacted by bdnews24.com, Ahmad said the mobile phone operators had violated telecoms rules by not taking permission from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission for running VoIP business. "Perhaps there was a backer of the business. Legal action should be taken against all of them," said Ahmad of Transparency International, Bangladesh. On the notice BTRC served on Grameenphoneits business largely tainted by alleged links to VoIP operationsthe TIB chairman said only Grameenphone should not be held responsible. "Legal action should be taken against all involved in illegal VoIP business." The TIB chairman said that corruption in the private sector cost the state coffers millions in lost revenue. Businesses get mired in corruption, so do the NGOs, Ahmad said. Meanwhile, post and telecommunications secretary Iqbal Mahmood said the government would provide all-out cooperation for the BTRC in its drive against VoIP. Mahmood said the BTRC's move, detecting VoIP operations in particular, was praiseworthy. He said the ministry and the BTRC set the same goalto serve customers. The BTRC has so far carried out 21 operations to seize VoIP equipment. Mobile operators Grameenphone, CityCell, Aktel and Banglalink were all fined on charges of running VoIP business. BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com that measures were underway to strengthen the commission. The telecoms regulator Wednesday asked Grameenphone to explain in 30 days why its licence would not be suspended or cancelled on charges of breaching agreement and telecoms rules. BTRC had earlier filed a case against GP's two preceding chief executives and eight incumbent and former high officials, charging them with involvement in VoIP business. bdnews
