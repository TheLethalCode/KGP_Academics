<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Russia are to establish a formal economic dialogue at ministry level because of increased investment and trade between the two countries, the US embassy in Moscow said on Thursday. "As appropriate, this dialogue will include various US departments and agencies, Russian ministries, and our respective business communities. The inaugural meeting of this dialogue will be in the spring in Washington, D.C," it said in an e-mailed statement. US-Russian trade and investment is soaring despite disagreements between Washington and Moscow over a range of world issues such as US plans for a missile defence shield and the future of the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo.
