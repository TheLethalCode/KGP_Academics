<TITLE> Fresh snow adds to China holiday havoc </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Guangjhou, China, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh snow fell across swathes of south China already paralysed by harsh winter weather on Friday, a day after President Hu Jintao headed down a coal shaft to urge miners to help to end widespread powercuts. China's snow-stricken railways were creaking back into action, but hundreds of thousands of travellers stranded by the worst cold spell in half a century had to fight their way through scrums to get on board departing trains. Miners are working overtime and coal given priority to speed through the rail network as Beijing fights the country's most serious power crisis ever. Millions of people have spent over a week without electricity or water and are gearing up for a cold, dark start to the Chinese New Year next week. "It is still snowing, no one knows when power and transport might resume," said one man surnamed Li in Guizhou province where petrol and candle prices have quadrupled. Also facing fresh storms or icy rain are badly hit provinces including Guizhou, Hunan and Jiangxi, the National Meteorological Centre said on its Web site (www.nmc.gov.cn). Hu visited the key coal port of Qinghuangdao and asked dock workers to speed up loading of the fuel for shipping to the power stations of the stricken south, Xinhua news agency said. "Disaster-hit areas need coal and the power plants need coal," Hu was quoted as telling miners and their managers who will be sacrificing the most important holiday of the Chinese year to try to get fuel supplies back to normal. "I pay an early New Year call here to those miners who will not go back home to celebrate the Spring Festival for (the sake of) the coal production," Hu said. TRAINS START TO RUN In Guangzhou, where hundreds of thousands of travellers have milled around the station in icy weather for days, trains were starting to move again and a police cordon in nearby streets had brought some order to the chaotic station forecourt. The key line between Beijing and Guangzhou had been restored, the government said, in part by using diesel locomotives to get through areas hit by power shortages. The train system would be able to take some 400,000 people a day out of Guangzhou, with travellers allowed to board depending on the date of their ticket, the Southern Metropolis paper said. But with large crowds surrounding most trains that pulled out of the station, travellers needed luck as well as a ticket. "It's not looking good. This is like if you prepare dinner for two and 200 people show up," said Hu Lin, an environmental assessment official from Hubei province. Other workers had given up on spending the holiday with their family, and planned a trip home later in the year instead. "The central government actually cares a lot about us migrant workers, but there is just nothing anyone can do about this worsening weather," said Lu Tingjie, a construction worker who had hoped to make it back to Sichuan to see his three children, but now planned to turn in his ticket for a refund.
