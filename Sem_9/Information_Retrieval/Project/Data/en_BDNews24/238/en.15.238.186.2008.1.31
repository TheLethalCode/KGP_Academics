 ELDORET, Kenya, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A second Kenyan opposition legislator was shot dead on Thursday, overshadowing the resumption of negotiations between the country's feuding politicians after more than a month of violence. Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) member of parliament David Kimutai Too was killed in the Rift Valley town of Eldoret, the party said. An unidentified woman was also critically wounded. Police commissioner Hussein Ali said Too's murder was a "crime of passion" and that the traffic police officer responsible had been arrested. But ODM leader Raila Odinga said it was a political act. "David Kimutai Too was killed by a policeman. I condemn this second execution of an ODM member of parliament. The purpose of this killing is to reduce the ODM majority," he said. Political and ethnic violence has killed 850 people in Kenya since the Dec. 27 election. The instability has shocked its neighbours and Western donors, and battered Kenya's image as a stable trade and tourism hub. The violence has taken the lid off decades-old divisions between communities over land, wealth and power dating from British colonial rule, which have been stoked by Kenyan politicians during 44 years of independence. Shops shut down in Eldoret after the killing and some residents began to leave town. Around 200 people gathered outside the police station demanding the traffic officer responsible be handed over. "Let him be brought out so we can do our own justice," they shouted. "This is a government plot to wipe out ODM." Scores of people, some of them wailing, flocked to the mortuary where Too's body was taken. Earlier this week, another opposition legislator, Melitus Were, was gunned down outside the gate of his Nairobi home, in a murder that triggered rioting and ethnic killings. ODM said Were's killing was a "political assassination", although police said they were treating it as "murder". President Mwai Kibaki flew to Ethiopia on Thursday for a summit of the 53-nation African Union, likely to be dominated by the violence gripping his country which was triggered by his disputed re-election last month. 'STOP SWEET-TALKING' In Nairobi, government and opposition teams met for a second day of talks led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, backed by an international community alarmed at the continuing killing. Many Kenyans fear what will happen if Annan's mediation fails to strike a deal between Kibaki and his rival Odinga, who says vote-rigging stole his victory. Jendayi Frazer, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa, said on Wednesday the violence had degenerated into ethnic cleansing in parts of the Rift Valley and that she wanted to see "some kind of power-sharing and some kind of coalition government". Annan launched formal mediation between the government and ODM on Tuesday, each side represented by a team of three -- both a mix of moderates and hardliners. Kibaki, 76, says he is the legally elected president, but is open to sharing power. Odinga, 63, says he was robbed by fraud during the vote count and wants Kibaki to stand down or allow a new election after a period of power-sharing. Kenya's unrest may have been triggered by an election dispute but the tinder for ethnic conflict was there and has burned before at elections in 1992 and 1997. Members of Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe were the first to be attacked, and are now seeking revenge on Luos, Luhyas and Kalenjins who largely back Odinga in what many fear will turn into tit-for-tat attacks. After a month of bloodshed, the Kenyan government vowed to adopt a tougher approach to contain the conflicts. The opposition-leaning Standard paper in an editorial urged police to act tough despite criticism of excessive force. "With the killings and blocking of roads going on, the police must stop looking on and sweet-talking criminals. This is no longer a tribal issue. This is barbarism at its worst and it must be stopped" the Standard wro
