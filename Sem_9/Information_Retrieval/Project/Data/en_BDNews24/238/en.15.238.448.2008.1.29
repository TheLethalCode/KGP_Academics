 SYDNEY, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's troubled tour of Australia will proceed as planned after the International Cricket Council (ICC) cleared spinner Harbhajan Singh of racial abuse at an appeal on Tuesday. There were fears the tour might be cancelled after Indian officials demanded the ICC to overturn its decision to suspend Harbhajan for three tests for allegedly calling Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds 'a monkey' during the second test. However, the crisis was averted on Tuesday when independent New Zealand high court judge John Hansen dismissed the charge after a 5-1/2 hour hearing at Adelaide's Federal Court. Hansen ruled that there was not enough evidence to convict Harbhajan of racial abuse but charged him with the lesser offence of using abusive language. Harbhajan pleaded guilty and was fined half his match fee but is clear to play in the triangular one-day series with Australia and Sri Lanka. "We are very happy with the proceedings, we are very satisfied," Indian board secretary Niranjan Shah told Reuters in New Delhi. "Now the team must concentrate on the game." Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young said the Australians were pleased with the outcome and happy to put the incident behind them. "All parties will move on with the cricket," Young said. "The game is the important thing." ICC communications officer Sami-ul-Hasan had earlier read a brief statement to reporters in Adelaide confirming the decision and saying Hansen would deliver his full verdict on Wednesday. "Justice Hansen said he was convinced that on all evidence submitted before him the charge of level 3.3 was not proven but that Harbhajan Singh should be charged with a level 2.8 offence," the statement said. "Harbhajan pleaded guilty to this charge and after hearing submissions on the penalty, justice Hansen imposed a fine of 50 percent of his match fee." SUSPENDED TOUR Harbhajan was originally found guilty by ICC match referee Mike Procter after this month's bad-tempered second test in Sydney. Symonds, Australia's only black player, claimed Harbhajan called him a monkey during a verbal exchange at the wicket and Australia captain Ricky Ponting reported the offence to the on-field umpires. The BCCI suspended the tour for two days and threatened to go home before the ICC made a number of concessions including the sacking of West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor. Harbhajan was also allowed to play on until his appeal had been heard while the ICC appointed a mediator to broker a peace deal between the feuding teams. They agreed to a truce and completed the remaining two tests but speculation increased that the tour was under renewed threat in light of Harbhajan's pending appeal. The entire Indian squad stayed in Adelaide for the five-hour hearing rather than travel to Melbourne to prepare for Friday's Twenty20 match against Australia. Harbhajan, his Indian teammate Sachin Tendulkar, Ponting, Symonds, Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden were all ordered to appear at Tuesday's closed hearing. All the players signed an agreed statement of the facts that took place and were each cross-examined. Additional evidence, including television footage and audio transcripts, was also tendered that was not available at the initial hearin
