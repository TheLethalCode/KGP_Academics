<TEXT>
 Orlando, Fla., Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, finishing a distant third in Florida's primary where he staked his entire campaign, gave strong hints on Wednesday he might soon end his quest for the White House. Giuliani addressed supporters amid reports he would bow out and endorse the winner of Florida's contest, John McCain, before a Republican presidential debate on Wednesday. Asked about the reports, Giuliani said only: "We're heading to California, we're heading to California." He spoke at length about his vision for the country, repeatedly referring to his presidential campaign in the past tense and emotionally dedicating it to the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. "We'll stay involved and together we'll make sure that we do everything we can to hand our nation off to the next generation better than it was handed to us," Giuliani said. "The responsibility of leadership doesn't end with a single campaign," he said.
