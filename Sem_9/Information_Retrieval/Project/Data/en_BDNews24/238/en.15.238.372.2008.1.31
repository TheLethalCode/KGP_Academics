 ELDORET, Kenya, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A police officer in Kenya shot dead an opposition legislator on Thursday, the second killed in a week, sparking fresh protests and interrupting talks to try to end more than a month of violence. Warning of catastrophe, UN chief Ban Ki-moon said he would travel to Nairobi on Friday from an African Union summit in neighbouring Ethiopia to help his predecessor Kofi Annan, who has been trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Political and ethnic violence has killed 850 people in Kenya since the disputed Dec. 27 re-election of President Mwai Kibaki. The instability has shocked neighbouring states and Western donors, and turned Kenya from one of Africa's more stable and prosperous nations to the continent's most urgent crisis. "Violence continues, threatening to escalate to catastrophic levels," Ban told the 53-nation African Union summit. The unrest has taken the lid off decades-old divisions between communities over land, wealth and power dating from British colonial rule, which have been stoked by Kenyan politicians during 44 years of independence. Fresh protests erupted on Thursday after David Kimutai Too, an opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) member of parliament, was killed in the Rift Valley town of Eldoret. Police commissioner Hussein Ali said Too's murder was a "crime of passion" and that the traffic police officer responsible, who had been arrested, had shot a fellow officer believed to be his girlfriend along with the legislator. ODM leader Raila Odinga said it was a political act, without giving evidence. "I condemn this second execution of an ODM member of parliament. The purpose of this killing is to reduce the ODM majority," he said. TALKS POSTPONED, PROTESTS ERUPT Kenya's feuding political parties postponed their second day of talks brokered by Annan after the killing. "Because of what has happened ... we have postponed this afternoon's session and we will work all day tomorrow so that the leaders can attend to urgent matters," Annan told reporters. Shops shut down in Eldoret and some residents began to leave town. Around 200 people gathered outside the police station demanding the traffic officer responsible be handed over. Others flocked to the morgue. "Let him be brought out so we can do our own justice," one protester shouted. "This is a government plot to wipe out ODM." Youths also started burning tyres and blocking roads with stones in the pro-opposition western town of Kisumu. "They are saying Raila should withdraw from the talks and assemble his army because the government has declared war on ODM," said Kisumu resident David Onyango. "I can hear gunshots and the youths are not even running away. There are so many and they are really charged." Earlier this week, another opposition legislator, Melitus Were, was gunned down outside the gate of his Nairobi home, in a murder that triggered rioting and ethnic killings. ODM said Were's killing was a "political assassination". Police said they were treating it as "murder". 'STOP SWEET-TALKING' Many Kenyans fear what will happen if Annan's mediation fails to strike a deal between Kibaki and his rival Odinga, who says vote-rigging stole his victory. Jendayi Frazer, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa, said violence had degenerated into ethnic cleansing in parts of the Rift Valley and that she wanted to see power-sharing. Annan launched formal mediation between Kibaki's Party of National Unity and ODM on Tuesday, each side represented by a team of three -- both a mix of moderates and hardliners. Kibaki, 76, says he is the legally elected president, but is open to sharing power. Odinga, 63, says he was robbed by fraud during the vote count and wants Kibaki to stand down or allow a new election after a period of power-sharing. The tinder for ethnic conflict was there before the election and has burned before at elections in 1992 and 1997. Members of Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe were the first to be attacked this time, and are now seeking revenge on Luos, Luhyas and Kalenjins who largely back Odinga in tit-for-tat attac
