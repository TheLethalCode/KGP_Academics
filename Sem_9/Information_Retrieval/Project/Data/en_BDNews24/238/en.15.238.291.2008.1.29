<TITLE> Two Koreas may cut back rail service over border </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The two Koreas discussed on Tuesday whether to cut back the first freight train service over their heavily armed border for more than 50 years because there is so little cargo. Held up as a symbol of warming ties on the Cold War's last frontier when it started last month, North Korea now sees little point of a daily service when the wagons are mostly empty, South Korean officials said. "The freight train runs every day but only once or twice a week is there freight in the containers," said Byun Hyun-jin, a South Korean railway official who helps supervise the cross-border runs. South Korea runs a 12-car train on a route of some 20 km (12.5 miles) between the South and the Kaesong industrial enclave it manages just inside North Korea where its companies have access to cheap land and labour. Because the level of output at Kaesong it still low, companies there find it more convenient to ship by a road that runs across the heavily militarised border, South Korean rail officials said. The Roh government envisions a day when more than a half million North Koreans are working at Kaesong and the rail link will play an essential role in transport. The rail talks in Kaesong end on Wednesday. The outgoing government of President Roh Moo-hyun had hailed restoration of the rail service -- the first since the 1950-53 Korean War and agreed at an October summit with the North's leader Kim Jong-il -- as a milestone in reconciliation. President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who takes office on Feb. 25, has said he would review all joint projects agreed under Roh and tie aid to progress the destitute neighbour makes in ending its nuclear arms programmes. South Korean officials want a daily service to ensure the upkeep of railway tracks between the states technically still at war. South Korea hopes to eventually run trains into China and Russia and through to Europe.
