 MANILA, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine central bank cut its policy rates less aggressively than expected on Thursday, persuaded that the economy needed only modest support after it grew at its fastest pace in 31 years in 2007. The economy beat forecasts with its fourth quarter growth, taking full-year expansion to 7.3 percent and heralding a strong start to 2008 despite fears of a recession in its biggest trading partner, the United States. "After that robust GDP number maybe they felt there was less need to boost the economy," said David Cohen, director of forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore. Governor Amando Tetangco signalled that the central bank had room to cut again by describing price pressures as "manageable" and noting the continuing cooling in annual money supply growth, its key gauge of inflation risks ahead. The central bank expects inflation to creep up this year from last year's 21-year low of 2.8 percent, but to stay between 3.5 and 4.4 percent, safely within its 3-5 percent target range. Despite the stellar fourth quarter performance, most economists had expected the central bank to match Wednesday's 50 basis point cut by the US Federal Reserve. They said a bigger move would ease the upward pressure on the peso currency by narrowing the yield spread between local and US rates. The peso was Asia's top performer last year and its gains helped the central bank keep a lid on prices despite four rate cuts. But its rise has fanned concerns it could hurt exporters and erode the relative earning power of millions of Filipino overseas workers, whose remittances count among the mainstays of the local economy. Thursday's cut, announced after markets had closed, brought the Philippine overnight borrowing rate to 5 percent, its lowest level since May 1992, yet still two percentage points above the US> benchmark. The overnight lending rate was cut to 7 percent from 7.25 percent. A jump in public expenditure, partly related to congressional elections last year, as well as President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's order to rejuvenate the country's crumbling infrastructure helped boost the economy in 2007. Although 7 percent growth is seen as the minimum to start making inroads into widespread poverty, there has so far been little trickle-down in the Philippines, where nearly 50 percent of the population live on less than $2 a day. There has also been no boost in popularity for Arroyo, dogged by lingering allegations she cheated in the 2004 presidential election. Nonetheless, with growth rates at levels not seen since 1986, the year dictator Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown, the government is anxious to maintain last year's momentum and has agreed that a stimulus package may be necessary to prop up domestic consumption. The government has maintained its 2008 growth target of 6.3-7.0 percent despite the expected slowdown in the United States. Deputy central bank governor Diwa Guinigundo told reporters that the central bank did not take into account the possible implementation of a stimulus package in Thursday's rate decision. The monetary authority said it would maintain the wide availability of its high-yielding, short-term, special deposit accounts, a tool it uses to mop up excess liquidity and which has helped cool annual money supply growth to a near two-year low of 9 percent in Decemb
