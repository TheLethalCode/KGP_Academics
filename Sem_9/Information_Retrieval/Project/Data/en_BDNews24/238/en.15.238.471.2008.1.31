<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com) - Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff has said that the fate of the cases filed before the promulgation of the state of emergency and brought under the emergency powers rules later hinges on the verdict in the Sheikh Hasina case. Asked to comment on the views of the amici curiae that taking the case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against Hasina under the EPR was illegal, the adviser said: "The matter is subjudice. I won't comment on it." The adviser, also in charge of the land portfolio, was speaking to the media at the land ministry Thursday. Six amici curiae (friends of court), commenting on a writ petition, said that no case dated before the promulgation of the state of emergency can be tried under EPR in line with the constitution. A High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Shahidul Islam Wednesday heard the amici curiae. Asked when the state of emergency would be withdrawn, Ariff said: "The state of emergency is being relaxed in phases. The emergency now is not like what it was earlier. A decision to lift the state of emergency would not be mine alone, but would require a combined decision." On alleged torture of detainees in custody, the law adviser said that the home ministry had already taken special steps in this regard. However, if any such allegation came to him, he would make necessary recommendations to investigate it. Asked whether the Election Commission had violated the constitution by not holding elections in 90 days from the dissolution of parliament, Ariff said: "This is the concern of the Election Commission. I won't say anything about it. However, the caretaker government has no timeframe. They will hand over power to an elected government." The main task of the government is to assist the Election Commission in holding a free, fair and neutral election, he said. "The situation is now much better than it was in January 2007. The government felt that a level-playing field had been created. The Election Commission did it," he added. Asked whether there was any misuse of the emergency powers rules or whether there was any need to amend the EPR, the adviser said: "I don't think so. There is no need for any amendment either." bdnews24.c
