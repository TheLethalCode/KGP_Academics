 MANCHESTER, England, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifty years ago the plane carrying Manchester United home from Belgrade crashed after a refuelling stop at Munich, killing 23 of the 44 people on board. Eight United players died as a result of the accident, seven immediately and the eighth, Duncan Edwards, the jewel in the crown of the Busby Babes, 15 days later due to his injuries. Here are some details on the tragedy and its aftermath: THE CRASH: -- On Feb. 6, 1958, a British European Airways twin-propped Elizabethan plane carrying United's players crashed on take-off after refuelling at Munich's Riem airport. Eight players died as well as three United club officials, eight journalists, two crew members and two other passengers, including the travel agent who arranged the trip. -- The aircraft had faced problems taking off and crashed in the slush and snow on a third attempt. THE TEAM: -- Nicknamed the Busby Babes after manager Matt Busby, United were champions of England in 1956 and 1957.

Two of the survivors, Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower, never played again. THE TRAGEDY: -- The eight players who died were England's Roger Byrne, 28, the left-back and captain; Eddie Colman, 21; England centre-forward Tommy Taylor, 25; Mark Jones, 24; David Pegg, 22; Ireland's Billy Whelan, 22; Geoff Bent, 25; and England's half-back Duncan Edwards, 21.
