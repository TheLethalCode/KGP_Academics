 JERUSALEM, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel indicted an Islamic leader on Tuesday for "inciting violence and racial hatred" during protests last year against excavations in Jerusalem's Old City near the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site. Sheikh Raed Salah, leader of the Islamic Movement in northern Israel, called for a new uprising against what he termed an "Israeli crime". He also compared Israel's military and police officers to "terrorists", according to the indictment by Israel's attorney general. Israel defended its dig near the al-Aqsa complex, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. Israel said the aim was to salvage artefacts before the construction of a pedestrian bridge leading up to the religious compound sacred to both Muslims and Jews. "Those (the Jews) who want to build a place of worship for God cannot do so when our blood is on their clothes, in their food and in their drinks," Salah was quoted as saying in the indictment during a speech he delivered in Jerusalem last year. The Jewish state suspended work near al-Aqsa last year to mollify angry Arabs and Muslims who feared it could damage the foundations of the 1,300-year-old mosque.
