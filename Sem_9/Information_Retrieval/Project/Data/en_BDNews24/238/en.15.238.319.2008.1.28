<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)A wedding ceremony at the Chittagong Club Sunday night saw the bride and groom married via the cyberspace gadgets of webcam and headphones. It was almost a regular wedding, with the exception being the happy couple were geographically separated by thousands of miles. The dazzling bride in Chittagong said 'kobul' to her man in the US state of Connecticut, while guests enjoyed both parties on projector screens. "Cyber-weddings are becoming popular in Chittagong. I've registered five such weddings in the past one and a half years," Kazi Abul Kashem said. "It's an innovative idea!" said wedding guest Rashed Bhuiyan. The bride Rohini Parveen teaches at a local English medium school, while groom Ahmed Reza is an engineering student living in Connecticut for the past 12 years. "Our initial plan was for an engagement party," said mother of the groom Nasrin Ahmed. "Then everybody pressed for the wedding. It was not possible for my son to arrange his homecoming in such a short time. So, we decided to go for a cyber-wedding." The groom's father, journalist Syed Mohiuddin Ahmed, felt the wedding was "the more suitable arrangement". Syed Samiul Haque was "happy that everything went smoothly." "We were worried about the connection speed," said Haque, director of local ISP company BBTS that provided technical support for the wedding. bdnews24.c
