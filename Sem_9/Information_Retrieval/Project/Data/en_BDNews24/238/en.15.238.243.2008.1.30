 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Wednesday ruled that the detentions of Tarique Rahman and ASM Hannan Shah were illegal. The court ordered the government to release the two if there were no other cases pending against them. The two-member bench of justices Mirza Hossein Haider and Mamnun Rahman gave the ruling after hearing the proceedings on two separate writ petitions challenging the detentions of Tarique and Hannan. Lawyers for Khaleda Zia's political adviser Hannan Shah said their client should be released from prison immediately as there are no further litigations against him. BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman cannot leave jail for now, however, as he is yet to receive bail in six out of the 10 cases filed against him, lawyers said. Barrister Rafique Ul Haque represented both Tarique and Hannan Shah at the hearings, assisted by barristers Mahbubuddin Khokan and Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed and deputy attorney general Mubina Asaf represented the government. Barrister Nasiruddin told bdnews24.com that Tarique faces 10 separate cases against him, out of which he has been granted bail in four. He said the High Court found that several charges brought against Tariqueincluding money laundering and abuse of powerwere not well founded and so the court had declared his detention illegal in these cases. The barrister added that Hannan Shah should be allowed to walk out of jail straight away as he faces no other cases. Joint forces arrested Tarique on March 8, 2007, and the government issued his detention order, effective from April 13. Police arrested Hannan Shah on Nov 7 and the government ordered him to be detained under the Special Powers Act on Nov 25. Both writ petitions were filed with the High Court on Dec 2, separately challenging the legality of Tarique's and Hannan's detentions. The same day, the court ordered the government in both cases to explain why the detention orders should not be considered illegal. bdnews
