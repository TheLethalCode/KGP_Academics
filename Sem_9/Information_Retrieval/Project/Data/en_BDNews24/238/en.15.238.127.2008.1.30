 KARACHI, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities said on Wednesday that one of the militants arrested a day earlier after a shootout in Karachi was a leading member of an al Qaeda-linked group. Qasim Toori, a member of the Jundullah group, was arrested late on Tuesday following a raid by police and paramilitary troops, Akhtar Zamin, home minister of Sindh province, told Reuters. Two policemen and three militants were killed during the gunbattle, while Toori and two wounded militants were arrested. "We have also recovered a large quantity of weapons and ammunition, including rocket launchers, C4 plastic explosive as well as suicide jackets," Zamin said. "The recovery of such a large quantity of arms and ammunition also indicates that they were planning more attacks in Karachi." Jundullah, which means "Army of God", was blamed for an attack on a convoy escorting Karachi Corps Commander Lieutenant-General Ahsan Saleem Hayat in June 2004, in which 10 people were killed. Hayat was later promoted. He retired last year as vice chief of army staff. Zamin said Toori was involved in that attack, as well as other acts of violence. "The links go to Wana," he said, referring to the main town in South Waziristan, a tribal region on the Afghan border where the Pakistan military is fighting Taliban and al Qaeda. Police were also investigating Toori's role in a recent roadside bomb explosion in a low-income neighbourhood of Karachi, in which 10 people were killed, said Zam
