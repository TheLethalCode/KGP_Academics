 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  A special court dealing with serious charges of corruption Thursday sentenced former chief forest conservator Munshi Anwarul Islam to three years in jail on charges of misuse of power. Special court 3 judge Shahed Nuruddin also fined him Tk50,000, and if he fails to pay the amount he has to stay serve out another month. Anwarul was in the dock when the judge announced the verdict. The charges involve appointment of 79 officials through misuse of power and taking bribe during his days as the chief conservator from Jan 29, 2004 through August 31, 2005. Anwarul had appointed the employees without approval from the Ministry of Establishment, the prosecution said. ACC assistant director SM Shahidur Rahman filed the case with Gulshan Police Station against Munshi on June 26, 2006. In the original case, charges had also been pressed against the employees but later they were withdrawn. The court indicted Munshi on Oct 30 last year. Security officials arrested Munshi on March 7, and a court later ordered him to jail. bdnews2
