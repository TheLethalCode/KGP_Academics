<TEXT>
 Macau, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Macau court jailed a former top official for 27 years on Wednesday for taking millions of dollars in kickbacks to speed up construction of the gaming haven's multi-billion-dollar casinos. Macau's highest court found former secretary for transport and public works Ao Man-long guilty on most of 76 counts of corruption, including taking bribes, laundering money and abusing power. Ao, driven to court by a police convoy in heavy rain, stood stony-faced and motionless as the verdict was read out in a hushed courtroom. Head bowed, he was then escorted out of the courtroom after standing silently throughout the two hours it took a judge to outline the scores of charges against him. Ao had been accused of graft totalling 252.8 million patacas, or roughly $32 million. Macau's government now intends to confiscate that amount from among Ao's assets, and also seize property he owned both locally and abroad. "It has had a strong negative influence on Macau's reputation, and this influence continues. His illegal activities were complicated and brazen," said Sam Hou Fai, president of Macau's Court of Final Appeal, calling it a shocking case. Ao's lawyer, Nuno Simoes, said he thought the sentence was a harsh one and would try to have the decision reviewed, though he saw only a slim chance of getting it reversed. Of the charges levelled against Ao, he was found guilty on 57, Simoes added. Observers had expected a more lenient sentence. "I'm very unhappy with the decision," Simoes said. "It's quite a severe decision. I've never seen a court in Macau give such a high sentence. "We think we're entitled that someone else can review the sentence to check that it's a correct decision," he added. Ao's case cast a spotlight on the crime feeding off Macau's boom and his arrest sent shock waves through the region's political establishment, given his role in approving land sales to property developers vying for a lucrative slice of real estate. RISING TENSIONS The trial comes at a time of rising social tensions despite Macau's soaring economy, with workers decrying a growing wealth gap, flawed governance and rising corruption. People welcomed the sentencing, taking it as a sign of Macau's seriousness in cracking down on official graft. "I hope the government will learn from this, and that its policies will be more transparent in future," said 30-year-old office worker Francisco Lau. Once considered a political ally of Macau leader Edmund Ho, Ao was the most senior official to go on trial since the former Portuguese-run enclave returned to Chinese rule in 1999. Anti-graft officers and prosecutors said they had evidence he had amassed a fortune worth about $100 million, more than 57 times his income over seven years as a top policy secretary. Raids on his home and offices had revealed a web of offshore firms and bank accounts through which Ao had funnelled funds, they said. Officers also found wads of $100 bills, euros, Hong Kong currency, luxury watches, vintage wine and cigars, prosecutors said
