 BRUSSELS, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Despite his reputation as a firebrand Russian nationalist, Moscow's new envoy came to his first formal meeting at NATO on Wednesday carrying an axe in what officials said was a gesture of reconciliation. "The idea was that we should bury the hatchet,"NATO spokesman James Appathurai said of the meeting with Dmitry Rogozin, former head of the nationalist party in parliament. The Western military alliance and its former Cold War foe are at odds on issues ranging from the independence claim of Serbia's breakaway Kosovo province to U.S. plans for a missile defence shield in eastern Europe. Rogozin, who was appointed NATO ambassador earlier this month, was not expected to lighten the atmosphere and has called for Russia to re-arm to counter a perceived threat from NATO. In Russian, the expression for seeking reconciliation is usually expressed as "burying the war axe"
