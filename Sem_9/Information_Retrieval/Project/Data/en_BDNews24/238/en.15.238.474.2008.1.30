 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Minnows Badda Jagaroni Chakra Wednesday stunned Abahani Limited 1-0 in the inaugural match of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Milon struck the decisive blow with an impressive move two minutes into the second half. Taking advantage of a defensive lapse, he drove the ball home with his left foot, giving Abahani goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya no time to react. The sky-blues, however, enjoyed better procession throughout the game amid chilly weather, but the failure of their strikers cost the B. League champions dearly. Abahani's defender Sujan took to the field after two years following an ankle injury, but the defender was far from his best along with his colleagues in the defence, Nazrul, Wali and Siraji, who were shaky. Badda, however, made the first move in the 18th minute with the Nasir and Rana combining, but Rana had his low shot cleared by Sujan. Abahani striker Tipu disappointed the fans by spoiling a couple of scoring chances. Defender Wali set unmarked Tipu on the right, but the lanky striker headed the low cross outside in the 41st minute. Two minutes later Tipu saw his header rattle the Badda woodwork. Badda's Milon, however, broke the Abahani backline in the 39th minute before shooting wide with only the Abahani keeper to beat. Abahani toiled hard after the breather but failed to equalise and left with a loss in the season's first match. Earlier, Mahbub Jamil, chief adviser's special assistant in charge of sports ministry, opened the eight-team meet following a colourful ceremony. The inaugural ceremony included physical display by the artists of Spandan Shilpo Goshti and march past by the children, who wore jerseys of participating teams. Mohammedan general secretary Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan, Abahani director Kazi Nabil Ahmed, tournament committee chairman and Swadhin Bangla Team captain Zakaria Pintu were among those present. bd
