 CHICAGO, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A surgeon's education, gender or medical training may play a role in whether a woman gets radiation after breast cancer surgery, which is seen as a standard of quality, US researchers said on Tuesday. Prior studies have shown that a patient's race, age, income, and other factors affect whether she receives routine radiation after surgery to remove a lump in her breast. "We have fantastic treatments but we know a substantial number of patients do not initiate them," Dr. Dawn Hershman of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University in New York, said in a telephone interview. "We haven't really turned the tables on ourselves to see if our own characteristics might be affecting this," said Hershman, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Cancer Institute. Hershman's team looked at data on nearly 30,000 women aged 65 and older diagnosed with breast cancer between 1991 and 2002 who had surgery in which a lump was removed. The researchers collected data on the 4,453 surgeons who did the operations -- including gender, medical school location, number of surgical procedures they perform and type of medical degree. About 75 percent of the women received radiation after surgery. Older women, black women, single women and those who lived outside urban areas were less likely to undergo radiation, which has been shown to help prevent cancer from coming back. DIFFERENCE 'SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT' After controlling for patient characteristics that lead some women to decide to skip radiation treatments, Hershman found some significant trends. Women treated by a female surgeon were more likely to have radiation, although it is not clear exactly why. "It was a small but significant difference," Hershman said. She also found that a surgeon's medical training was important, and that surgeons trained in the United States were more likely to have women follow through with radiation after their operations. Additionally, she found that women were more likely to receive radiation if they were treated by a physician with a medical doctor degree rather than a doctor of osteopathy degree. Hershman acknowledged that treatment decisions are complex and said the study does not explain why some women got radiation while others did not. But she said the results might prompt doctors to ask themselves whether they are doing all they can to ensure patients understand their treatment options. "We have to be clear in our recommendations and we may need to be better at explaining why we make the recommendations we are making," Hershman said. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, according to the American Cancer Society, which estimates 465,000 women died from it globally in 20
