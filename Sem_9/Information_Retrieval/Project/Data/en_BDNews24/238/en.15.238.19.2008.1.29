<TEXT>
 Manila, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The city hall in the Philippine capital Manila was cleared of thousands of employees on Tuesday and police SWAT teams searched the building after two gunmen shot dead a former mayor and escaped. Television reports said the assailants appeared to have escaped after gunning down Reynaldo Yap, a former mayor of a town on the southern island of Mindanao, who was on trial for murder at a court in city hall. Yap's bodyguard and a bystander were wounded. Panic spread through the area as police teams moved into the five-storey building to search for the gunmen. Employees were told to go home for the day and a room-by-room search was launched, but the assailants appeared to have escaped, ABS-CBN television said.
