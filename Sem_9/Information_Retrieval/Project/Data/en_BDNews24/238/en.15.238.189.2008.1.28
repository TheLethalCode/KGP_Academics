 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) - Dozens of students of Eden Girls College and Dhaka College took to the streets Monday night after a rumour broke out that questions of an English examination scheduled for Tuesday had been leaked. Traffic on Mirpur Road between Science Laboratory and Azimpur junctions came to a halt during the protest. Students blockading the road demanded the resignation of National University's acting vice chancellor Syed Rashidul Hasan. Hasan Monday ruled out the possibility of leaked questions, saying the questions that were circulating in the dormitories do not match those on the examination paper. The examination has already been postponed twice in the wake of similar allegations. It was originally scheduled for Nov 11, deferred to Jan 11 and deferred again to Jan 29. Hasan claimed a vested quarter, with links to private coaching centres, was plotting to taint the image of National University. Dhaka College student Syed Imran Hossain told bdnews24.com that the allegedly leaked questions were available in student dormitories. "We don't want to take the exam," he said. New Market police sub-inspector Habibul Islam said the students took to the street at 7.45pm. bdnews24.co
