<TITLE> King wins second term as UK central bank chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mervyn King won a second term as head of Britain's central bank, the Treasury said on Wednesday, ending months of speculation that he was out of favour because of the run on Northern Rock bank. Reuters had reported last month that King would get the nod to run the BoE for another five years when his term ends on June 30, but there have been numerous reports suggesting Prime Minister Gordon Brown would choose another candidate. King, who turns 60 this year, has taken a lot of heat over the last year for his handling of the credit crunch hitting financial markets but economists welcomed his reappointment at a time of great uncertainty for the British economy. "The market will benefit from a period of stability," said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. "It's a good thing. King has crafted the BoE into the institution it is today." Hawkish Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance also got another 3 years on the rate-setting body, boosting expectations the BoE would not follow the aggressive monetary easing started in the US by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who was once King's office neighbour at the Massachusets Institute of Technology. At the BoE since 1991, first as chief economist, then deputy governor and finally the top job in 2003, King is widely respected as a deep thinker but his schoolmasterly approach at the start of the credit crunch last summer irritated a lot of bankers both in Britain and abroad. The former London School of Economics professor initially took a hard line when interbank lending virtually dried up as financial institutions became wary of each others' exposure to risky US mortgage lending. King's take was that people should have been aware of the risk they were taking and bailing them out with extra cash when their bets went wrong would only encourage such behaviour. Moral hazard is not an abstract issue, argued King, who has also taught at Harvard and MIT. City of London financiers were predictably angry. But then Northern Rock, Britain's fifth-biggest mortgage lender, fell foul of the credit crunch and had to seek emergency help from the Bank of England in September, prompting the first run on a British bank in more than a century. King's critics screamed for blood. They said Northern Rock would not have happened if he had not been so dogmatic. The BoE changed tack and started throwing money at the markets but many complained it was too little, too late. COMMUNICATION The governor has admitted that in retrospect the central bank could have been better at communicating its message as the credit crunch took hold. But he maintains that he had long been warning of the dangers of too much risk-taking in financial markets. Blunt and ready to speak his mind, King's relationship with the government has been strained. Last month, he caused a stir when it was reported that he had told a prominent newspaper columnist that Gordon Brown's government was in paralysis. One senior Treasury official branded him "naive" in his approach to the media. But even his firmest critics say King's record on the economy has been good. The economy has grown continuously since the Monetary Policy Committee was set up in 1997. Inflation has been low, only once breaking out more than one percentage point above the central bank's 2 percent target. Ever the hawk, King keeps warning that the next decade could be much worse. Policymakers were facing the most challenging environment, he said last week, as growth slows and inflation is on the rise. "There is no denying that there has been some tarnishing of Mr King's previously exemplary reputation due to the Bank of England's handling of the Northern Rock problem," said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight. "Nevertheless, we believe that Mr King has done an excellent job in conducting monetary policy over his term as governor and that is the over-riding factor. We also believe that there is no better candidate to replace him." Bookmakers were now offering 16-1 that King would get a third term when his new term expires in 2013
