<TITLE> Vancouver is 'world's best city', Dhaka among the 'worst' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)Vancouver is the world's best city, according to the annual survey of world cities by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The think-tank division of London-based Economist magazine ranked 127 cities in terms of personal risk, infrastructure and the availability of goods and services. Among the 10 worst performing cities were Tehran, Karachi, Dhaka and Algiers because "many aspects of daily life present challenges", the EIU survey said. All the cities that fell into the top "liveability" bracket were based in Canada, Australia and Western Europe. Vancouver was previously named 'best city', by the EIU four years in a row from 2001-2005. But other Canadian cities also scored well in the past and in this year's survey, as did Melbourne, Vienna and Geneva, primarily because they are not seen as targets for terror attacks. "In the current global political climate, it is no surprise that the most desirable destinations are those with the lower perceived threat of terrorism," said Jon Copestake, editor of the EIU report. The survey has produced a mixed picture of the world's cities. London was ranked in the 10th group, on a par with Dublin and Los Angeles, but one place below Manchester, four behind Berlin, five lower than Tokyo, and six off Helsinki, Frankfurt and Stockholm. In Asia, cities in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China and Taiwan all score well, as do Australia's main hubs. Africa and the Middle East fare less well, with the EIU citing concerns about terror attacks, and economic and political instability. In Latin America, "no city manages to present ideal living conditions, neither do any fall into the category where extreme difficulties are faced", the EIU said. Montevideo in Uruguay, Santiago in Chile and Buenos Aires in Argentina offer the region's best conditions. Bogota in Colombia and Caracas in Venezuela score the least favourably.
