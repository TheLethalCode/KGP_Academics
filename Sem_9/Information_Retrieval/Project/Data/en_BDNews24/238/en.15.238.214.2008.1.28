<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Monday got another poor response to the re-bid for the sponsorship rights for the home series against South Africa in Feb-March. "It has been a disappointing experience for us as AB Bank stuck to their previous offer and Axiom Technologies increased only Tk 50,000 for the title sponsorship rights," Mirza Salman Ispahani, chairman of marketing and commercial committee, told bdnews24.com Monday. The sponsorship package had three tiers, with first one priced at Tk 1.2 crore while the second and the third at Tk 40 lakh each. The package has included title sponsorship, parameter board, mid-wall, bowling ends, boundary ropes and pitch mates. AB Bank, the sponsor of the National Under-19 team in the next month's ICC U/19 World Cup in Malaysia, stuck to their previous offer of Tk 50 lakh for the title sponsorship against the floor price of Tk 1.2 crore. Axiom Technologies, which offered 1.12 crore for whole package, Monday increased only Tk 50,000 to their previous offer of Tk 60 lakh for the title sponsorship. The BCB Sunday asked AB Bank and Axiom Technologies to come up with renewed sponsorship offers after both bidders failed to meet the floor price. Ispahani said they would decide Tuesday whether to re-float the tender or choose a bidder between AB Bank and Axiom Technologies. He said had the mobile phone companies taken part in the bidding, they would not have faced such poor response. bd
