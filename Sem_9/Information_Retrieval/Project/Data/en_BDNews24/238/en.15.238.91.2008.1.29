<TITLE> Berlusconi urges Italian president: call polls now </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi called for immediate elections at a meeting with the president on Tuesday, seeking a return to power after the collapse of the centre-left government last week. With Berlusconi wanting a vote now and the centre left -- including President Giorgio Napolitano, a leftist -- favouring an interim government to reform electoral laws before Italy votes again, it was hard to see a way out of the deadlock. "How can you think of putting on hold a country which needs a real government urgently, while we look for something on which there is not even a remote chance of finding a common platform today?" Berlusconi told reporters after the meeting. But Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni, head of the Democratic Party which is Italy's second largest after Berlusconi's Forza Italia, told Napolitano elections should be held by June, or even as late as spring 2009, after deep political and economic reforms. "Elections now mean instability tomorrow," said Veltroni. Napolitano met leaders of the biggest parties on the fourth and final day of crisis talks. After a last meeting at 1700 GMT, he may ask someone like Senate Speaker Franco Marini to try to form an interim government, or he could say he needs more time. CONFIDENCE SAGS The collapse of Prodi's government, triggered by the defection of a small party that robbed him of his slim majority in the Senate, where he lost a confidence vote on Thursday, came at a sensitive moment for the euro zone's third largest economy. New data showed Italian business confidence had hit its lowest since end-2005 -- when Berlusconi was in power and the economy was stagnating -- and a think-tank trimmed its growth forecast for 2008 to 0.9 percent from 1.4 percent. Already a growth laggard in the 15-nation bloc and bearing the world's third largest public debt, Italy is entering a global downturn without a strong, credible government. Worse still, say analysts, if Berlusconi has his way Italy would go to the polls under the same rules blamed by many for making Prodi's 20 months in office ungovernable. Some economists worry that another free-spending Berlusconi government will undo Prodi's work on cutting the budget deficit. With pre-crisis polls putting him 10 points ahead of Prodi, Berlusconi has reason to sense victory if he can fight elections while Prodi's defeat is still fresh in voters' minds. In typically flamboyant, off-the-cuff comments to reporters after meeting the president, Berlusconi said Italy's image was being hit by political mismanagement of the Naples trash crisis. The media tycoon and his allies argue electoral reform can be discussed later. "It would be bad for national interests to drag this out in an attempt to find a solution no matter what, or, worse still, just to postpone an election," said Berlusconi's main ally, Gianfranco Fini of the right-wing National Alliance. Prodi's motley coalition of centrist to hardline communists, smashed by the defection of a small Catholic party whose three seats in the upper house or Senate had secured Prodi his tiny majority there, looked unlikely to put up a good fight. Outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli said there were "no longer any coalition ties" binding the nine parties that took Prodi to a narrow victory in 2006 elections and then proceeded to bicker over every area of policy. "Enough of coalitions that are too wide," said Rutelli. "It doesn't mean we won't make alliances, but that we will only do so with people who share our visio
