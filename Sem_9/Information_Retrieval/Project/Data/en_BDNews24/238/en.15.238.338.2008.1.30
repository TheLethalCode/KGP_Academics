 NAIROBI, Jan 30(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai on Wednesday urged tribal elders to help stop a spiral of ethnic killing in the east African nation following last month's disputed presidential poll. President Mwai Kibaki's re-election on Dec 27 sparked an unprecedented wave of violence, marked by bloody clashes between members of his Kikuyu ethnic group and the Luos, Luhyas and Kalenjins seen as supporting his challenger Raila Odinga. "I appeal to the elders of the various communities to reach out to others and appeal to the youth to stop the cycle of violence and vengeance," Maathai, a veteran of the civil rights movement in Kenya, told reporters. The turmoil, in which around 850 have been killed, may have been triggered by the disputed vote but has since taken on a momentum of its own, exposing the bitter ethnic animosities beneath Kenya's politics as rival tribes seek out revenge. Maathai -- an internationally lauded environmentalist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 -- met elders from the Kikuyu community on Wednesday and plans to hold talks with representatives of other ethnic groups in the coming days. "I urge the youth to stop the violence, stop killing each other. The international community will support us, but at the end of the day it is all up to Kenyans to sit down and resolve the issues," added Maathai. She was one of several big names to have lost their seats in parliamentary elections also held on Dec 27. But many Kenyans, tired of a month of unrest which has shattered the image of their country, support her appeal for peace. Peace activists and other concerned citizens have started laying wreaths of flowers at Nairobi's "Freedom Corner" in a city-centre park. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is leading mediation efforts between Kibaki and Odinga's camps, has said the violence has gone beyond a simple electoral dispute, denouncing systematic rights abuses. He has urged civil society groups to play their part in mediation efforts
