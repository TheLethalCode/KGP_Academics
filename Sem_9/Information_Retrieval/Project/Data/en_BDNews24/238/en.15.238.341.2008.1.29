 TBILISI, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Georgian opposition on Tuesday threatened fresh protests and a boycott of parliamentary elections unless authorities carry out a recount of a presidential vote the opposition says was rigged. The opposition has been protesting around Tbilisi since the Jan. 5 poll. In Tuesday's ultimatum they said they would move to the parliament steps where police cracked down on protesters in November, triggering a state of emergency and the snap January election. The former Soviet state's central election commission awarded President Mikhail Saakashvili 53 percent of the vote, a narrow majority but enough to avoid a runoff against his nearest opponent Levan Gachechiladze, who polled nearly 26 percent. Despite violations, Western monitors approved the win by Saakashvili, who swept to power in the peaceful 2003 "Rose" revolution. He promised to call new parliamentary elections by May 31. The opposition want a recount and investigation into vote fraud, the resignation of the interior minister and the prosecutor-general and assurances that the parliamentary election in the spring will be fair. "We are going to discuss with parliament these minimum conditions. The deadline for political consultations will be Feb. 15," said Salome Zurabishvili, an opposition leader. "If we don't get those minimum conditions, we'll use street protests in order to have our voice heard." Opposition leaders have been trying to galvanise support since the election. On the day of Saakashvili's inauguration, around 80,000 people gathered in the capital, a few km (miles) from the ceremony.
