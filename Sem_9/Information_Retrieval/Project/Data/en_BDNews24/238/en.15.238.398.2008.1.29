 TAMALE, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts Ghana beat Morocco 2-0 to reach the African Nations Cup quarter-finals on Monday and the tournament claimed its first coaching victim with Henryk Kasperczak quitting Senegal. Guinea also went into the last eight, following Ghana through from Group A despite managing only a 1-1 draw against rank outsiders Namibia. Midfielder Michael Essien scored a goal and set up another as Ghana finished their group with maximum points from three games. Ghana, who will stay in Accra for their quarter-final on Sunday, will face the Group B runners-up -- most likely Mali although it could be arch-rivals Nigeria.

The only cheers in an almost empty stadium came from the volunteers and policemen celebrating Ghana's goals in Accra. Guinea were without captain Pascal Feindouno, who was handed a two-match ban for violent conduct during their 3-2 victory against Morocco on Thursday. In Tamale, Kasperczak, coaching at his fifth Nations Cup, resigned the day after his team's shock 3-1 loss to Angola. The former Poland defender quit with one match to play in Group D and with his team still holding a mathematical chance of progressing. "I'm the only one responsible for the results," he said. "There is still a small chance and I think the players will respond to the presence of a new coach."
