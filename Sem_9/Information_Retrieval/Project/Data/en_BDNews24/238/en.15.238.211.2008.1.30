<TITLE> McCain strikes upbeat note to rally Republicans </TITLE>

 MIAMI, Jan 30(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Invigorated by a win in Florida, Republican front-runner John McCain will woo conservatives and independents with an upbeat message lauding Reagan-era economic values and a pledge to defeat Islamic extremism, strategists say. McCain, an Arizona senator, defeated former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in a tight Florida battle that gives him crucial momentum heading into critical Feb 5 "Super Tuesday" voting in 21 states with Republican contests. "He has tremendous momentum coming out of this race, and we'll be out talking about the two issues that Americans care most about, which is winning the war against radical Islamic extremism ... and the economy," Steve Schmidt, McCain's key strategist said at a party celebrating McCain's win. Schmidt helped craft McCain's message in the hard-fought primary. He said McCain would draw on the legacy of Ronald Reagan, the Republican president whose two terms in the 1980s are revered by many in the party as a golden era, to reach out and attempt to unite the party going forward. McCain's victory speech in Miami late on Tuesday was peppered with references to Reagan, who he said "stood by" him while he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Reagan was governor of California. Strategists said McCain would also reach out to independent voters and even dissident Democrats in campaigning that he takes to California on Wednesday by demonstrating a willingness and talent to reach across the aisles to work with opponents. McCain showed his ability to draw support from beyond his party in Florida, where prominent Democrat Sen. Joe Lieberman turned out last week at a rally in the Sunshine State to give him a ringing endorsement. "I'm not going to let party labels stand between me and doing what I think is best for America," Lieberman told Reuters as he left a rally at Lady Lake on Sunday, where he shared a platform with McCain. "John McCain is the person in either party who in my opinion is best prepared to be president and commander-in-chief. I know it's unusual for a Democrat to support a Republican, but he's the best in my opinion." RALLYING CONSERVATIVES McCain is already in a strong position in many of the Super Tuesday states such as delegate-rich California, New York and New Jersey. Now he has funding secured for the rest of his campaign to Nov 4, from both big "establishment" donors and individuals over the Internet, Schmidt said. In the weeks ahead, advisers say he will try to use a strong national security message and an appeal to conservative Reaganite principles of low taxation and small government to win over disaffected conservatives alienated by his willingness to support unpopular issues such as immigration reform. Romney, who has spent millions of his personal fortune on the race and vastly outspent McCain in Florida, said it was now a two-man race. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who led the Republican field in national polls for much of 2007, came in a distant third in Florida and was expected to end his campaign and endorse McCain as early as Wednesday. Senior Republicans who backed McCain in Florida said they believed opponents such as conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who rails against him in syndicated shows, and former Republican House leader Tom Delay, would rally behind him. "Electability is a very big issue," said John Lehman, a former Navy Secretary under Reagan, as he campaigned with McCain in Orlando this week. "A huge majority of Republicans want to win, and they would rather have victory than total litmus test purity," he added. On polling day in Florida, McCain appeared confident of his ability to win over support from conservatives as he takes his campaign across the nation in coming days. "Oh, they'll rally behind me," McCain told reporters on his campaign battle bus, the Straight Talk Express. "Most Republicans respect the process, most Republicans say 'He's the nominee of our party ... I'm going to get behind our candidate to make sure a Democrat doesn't come in.' It's a fairly natural evolution.
