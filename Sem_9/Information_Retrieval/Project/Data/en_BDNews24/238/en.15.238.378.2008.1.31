 San Jose, Costa Rica, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The bodies of five men, bound with plastic handcuffs and shot in the head, were found in a quarry in Costa Rica on Wednesday, the latest murders to blight the country, a popular US tourist destination. Police found the bodies about 9 miles (15 kms) from the border with Panama after an anonymous tip-off, judicial police chief Jorge Rojas told a news conference. "It seems the men were foreigners," he said, adding that they had yet to be formally identified. Rojas said the murders were similar to those of five Panamanians who were shot in December in a battle between drug gangs.
