 Kathmandu, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of people were wounded when a bomb exploded on Wednesday near a political rally attended by thousands of supporters of Nepal's governing alliance in the south of the Himalayan nation, police and medical officials said. "I think there are more than 30 -- about three of them appear to be critical," said doctor Ram Kishor Singh at Birgunj hospital. "I think it was a plastic bomb," police official Yogeswor Romkhani told Reuters. He said at least 16 people were wounded in the southeastern town of Birgunj, 62 km (39 miles) southeast of Kathmandu. No one has claimed the responsibility for the blast, the latest in a series that have rocked the restive southern Terai plains in recent weeks. Police said the blast took place 200 metres from a political rally which was being addressed by senior leaders of the ruling seven-party alliance. Scores of people have died in ethnic violence and clashes with rebel groups in the area, also known as Madhesh, in the past year.Rebel groups want the region to have more autonomy
