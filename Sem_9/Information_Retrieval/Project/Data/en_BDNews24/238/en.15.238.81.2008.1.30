 Beijing, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the FBI said on Wednesday he expects Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games to be "secure and safe" while offering China help against potential threats. Robert Mueller, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, was in Beijing to discuss cooperation with Chinese police and security officials for the Games, which open on Aug. 8. "I fully anticipate that the Olympics will be secure and safe," Mueller told a news conference. "I have been impressed by the preparations that have been made." China is treating the Games as a live-to-air display of its economic and social progress. Security measures against militants, but also dissidents and protesters, have been intense. Senior Chinese police said in September that terrorism was the biggest threat to the Beijing Olympics. They did not publicly say which groups might target the Games, but China is home several restive minorities, especially Muslim Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang, who have been blamed for bomb attacks and threats in recent years. Previous Games have been marred by violence. A bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics killed one person and wounded more than 100, while at the 1972 Munich Games 11 Israelis died in an attack by Palestinian gunmen and botched rescue attempt. Mueller did not detail the kind of help the FBI might give, and did not directly discuss Uighur groups that China calls terrorists, a claim some foreign human rights groups call highly exaggerated. "We'll be continuing to work with our counterparts in the run-up to the Olympics," Mueller said, adding that his focus was on securing the venues. He said his talks with Chinese officials also covered cyber-crime and corruption. He leaves for Vietnam on Wednesday.
