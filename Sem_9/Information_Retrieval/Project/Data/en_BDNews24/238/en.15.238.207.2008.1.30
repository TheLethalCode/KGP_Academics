 LONDON, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banks led European shares nearly 0.5 percent lower by midday on Wednesday after UBS shocked investors with a fresh writedown and investors fretted about how deep a likely Federal Reserve rate cut would be. At 1152 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.47 percent at 1,332.13 points, a loss of 11.6 percent so far in January, with just one full trading day left. The index is on course for its worst month since September 2002. Shares in UBS lost 1.5 percent after the Swiss bank posted an $11.5 billion loss for the last three months of 2007. Its additional $4 billion in write-downs lifted the total cost of its exposure to the US subprime mortgage debacle to $18.4 billion so far. Barclays fell 1.5 percent, HSBC was 1.2 percent lower, and BNP Paribas down 2.2 percent, the French bank falling after saying it expected fourth-quarter profits to be lower than a year earlier. On Tuesday, the FBI said it was investigating 14 corporations over possible accounting fraud and insider trading violations in a crackdown on subprime lending. Analysts said markets continued to be gripped by uncertainty. "This is a very shaky market, trading in an environment with poor visibility," said Philipp Musil, a portfolio manager at Constantia Privatbank in Vienna. "To be honest, valuing the market seriously is not possible, given the uncertainty, and we're keeping a lot of funds -- 10-20 percent -- in cash." The DJ Stoxx European banking sector index has lost nearly 12 percent so far this year after a 12 percent fall in the whole of 2007 and a 17 percent fall in 2006. "2007 has been a horrible year for the banks and the sector is not out of the woods yet," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers, in Paris. "The fourth-quarter reporting season will be a real acid test for the banks. Most of them will try to put all the write-downs in their 2007 results, as they want to clean the balance sheet going forward." Among other losers, Standard Life fell 3 percent as CEO Trevor Matthews left to join rival Friends Provident, whose stock lost 3.3 percent because investors bet that the company was no longer a takeover target after gaining a well-respected CEO. A downbeat note from Goldman Sachs sent car stocks sharply lower. Renault fell 4.6 percent, and Continental lost 3.7 percent. BMW bucked the trend, rising 1.6 percent after posting strong sales. Oil shares were among the heaviest weighted losers, despite crude trading above $92 a barrel. Total was down 2.3 percent. SPOTLIGHT ON FED After riding to the rescue of markets with an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week, the Fed is expected to announce a further reduction around 1915 GMT. A total of 18 out of 20 primary dealers polled by Reuters forecast the Fed would cut benchmark rates, with 14 expecting a 50 basis point reduction. "We look for the Fed to cut 50bp, but, at the same time, we think that its accompanying statement could see the Fed somewhat cool to the idea of another rate cut at the March meeting," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. "The problem, though, is that this might be a negative one for stocks if the market senses from the statement that the Fed might not follow up with another cut in March." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.5 percent, and France's CAC 40 down 1.4 percent, depressed by car stocks. Shares in Rio Tinto were up 3 percent as traders cited market talk that the miner was opening up its books to suitor BHP Billiton. Rio said it had nothing to disclose. Earlier, Australian newspapers reported that Rio's financial advisers had suggested that BHP Billiton could afford to raise its offer by at least 42 percent to $157 billion. Spanish power firm Iberdrola surged 5.5 percent after a report in the Financial Times said France's EDF and builder ACS had held talks over a possible joint bid for the power producer. ACS said it had not reached a deal with EDF to bid for the gro
