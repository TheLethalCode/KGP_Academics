 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil dropped more than a dollar to near $89 a barrel on Monday as falling global stock markets, amid renewed worries about the health of the global economy , spurred profit taking. Expectations that OPEC is unlikely to agree to boost supply, when ministers meet later this week, prevented deeper losses. US crude slid $1.51 to $89.20 a barrel by 1535 GMT. Prices gained 14 cents last week after clawing back from a six-week low of $86.11 a barrel. Brent crude in London was down $1.05 at $89.85 a barrel, moving to a small premium against US crude, the market benchmark. "Traders are squaring their positions before the OPEC meeting, hence there is some profit-taking," said Tetsu Emori of Japan's Astmax Futures Co Ltd. After falling sharply early last week, as growing concern over the US economy rattled global equity markets, oil bounced back from Thursday as US legislators and the White House hammered out a $150 billion stimulus plan. But with prices lately moving together with stock markets, traders began to fear that Friday's $1.30 surge might have been overdone after Wall Street ended the week on a weak note following two days of sharp gains. Worries over the health of the U.S. economy, and with it the global economy, hit shares across Asia and Europe and the Union States on Monday. The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies amid expectations of yet another aggressive rate cut this week by the Federal Reserve after data showed lower-than-expected U.S. new home sales for last month. While many analysts say the risk of an economic slowdown could still take some steam out of oil prices that are not far off their record high of $100.09, a thirst for alternative investments and OPEC's resolve have limited the downside so far. ATTENTION TURNS TO OPEC Attention this week will shift to Vienna, where OPEC ministers will meet on Feb. 1 to discuss production rates, although the market is not expecting a boost in output. "The U.S. inventory data and OPEC meeting are the two important drivers of oil prices in the near term. I do not expect OPEC to add production," said Badung Tariono, an Amsterdam-based fund manager for ABN AMRO's energy fund. Many officials have said they do not see the need to pump extra oil, despite the growing threat of recession and seasonally weak second-quarter demand, as crude inventories are comfortable. For OPEC ministers comments click on: The International Energy Agency's executive director last week expressed concern about the world economy and said oil producers could help the situation by pumping more. Prices may remain hostage to the fortunes of global stock markets, which gyrated wildly last week, forcing some oil speculators to shed positions to cover margin calls. U.S. regulator data on Friday showed that speculators in the NYMEX crude oil market slashed their bets on rising prices in the week to Jan. 22 to their lowest since mid-December, cutting net long positions by nearly 50,000 lots to 37,000. "It shows the large speculative funds reducing aggressively their net length exposure on futures through a combination of long liquidation and fresh short positions," said Olivier Jakob at Petromatr
