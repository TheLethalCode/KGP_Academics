<TITLE> Myanmar migrants fear the worst from new Thai govt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In the heart of Bangkok's Klong Toey slum, Than Maung, an illegal migrant worker, fingers a grubby wad of notes and debates whether to send his savings home to Myanmar. With a new elected but unpredictable government about to take over in Thailand, these are nervous times for the estimated 1 million workers from neighbouring Myanmar, where 45 years of military rule have crippled a once-promising economy. "I have no worker registration card in my present job and have heard the new government will be stricter on us," said the 32-year-old carpenter, who earns just 2,500 baht ($75) a month, a third of Bangkok's legal minimum wage. "I think I should spend this money trying to get a good job that can guarantee my security," he said. With the majority of Myanmar workers unregistered, it is a predicament playing out across the sprawling capital, where people from Thailand's historical foe are regarded with suspicion and contempt. Under Thai law, registered migrants have the same rights as Thais, but in practice this is far from the case. Migrants are routinely denied access to such basic rights such as education, medical care and freedom of movement. Several provinces with high migrant populations, such Phuket and Phang Nga in the south, or Samut Sakhon west of Bangkok, have imposed curfews on alien workers and barred them from owning mobile phones. "The Thai government should recognize the Burmese migrant workforce. It should no longer ignore their rights," said Ko Htwe, General Secretary of International Transport Workers Federation (ITWF). However, the prospects of positive change were slim, with many Thai officials deliberately hampering alien worker registration to keep wages low, he said. "The worse the situation for the migrants, the cheaper the labour for the Thai businessmen," Ko Htwe said. "The new government will not change things." However, other activists said there was faint cause for optimism, given the influence of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra over the new administration, led by the People Power Party (PPP). Thai Ministry of Labour figures show an overall increase in the number of registered migrant workers under the Thai Rak Thai party of Thaksin, a telecoms billionaire who came to power in 2001 and was removed in a September 2006 military coup. "In its time, Thai Rak Thai did pay attention to migrant workers. So, hopefully, the TRT-influenced PPP will take migration issues into account," said Myint Wai of the Thai Action Committee for Democracy in Bur
