 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka Wanderers Club Thursday held giants Muktijoddha Sangsad to a goalless draw in the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Muktijoddha Sangsad, comprising stars players like Alfaz Ahmed, Khanchan, Arman Mia, Aminul Islam, Hasan Al Mamun, Rajani Kanta Barman, hardly found rhythm in their season's first match, sixth months after the first-ever B. League. Minnows Wanderers put up a spirited show in their tournament opener enjoying better ball possession boosted mentally after having played six outings in the ongoing senior division football league. It would be nothing surprising if Wanderers won the match like Badda Jagaroni, who upset giant Abahani Limited 1-0 in the tournament opener Wednesday. Taking advantage of a disorganised Muktijoddha, Wanderers' two foreign wingers -- Lunti and Laksal -- several times tore Muktijoddha's defence put up by Rajani, Mamun, Din Mohammad and Parvez. Country's number one goalkeeper Aminul Islam, however, confidently denied all moves to frustrate the Wanderers boys, and the freedom fighters' team left the field with a point. Aminul, who sat out last season following back pain, rescued Muktijoddha in the 29th minute with a gripping close-range shot from Lunti, who squandered a sitter in the 35th minute sending the ball outside. Three minutes into the second half, Lunti again tested Aminul with a powerful shot but failed to overcome the last wall of Muktijoddha. Muktijoddha Sangsad, however, made the first move in the 26th minute with striker Khachan depositing the ball straight to Wanderers goalkeeper Jahangir Alam. Young strike Enamul replaced veteran Alfaz Ahmed in the second half, but the change made no impact on Muktijoddha, whose players played a lot of miss-passes. The first match between Arambagh KS and Victoria SC also ended in a goalless draw.
