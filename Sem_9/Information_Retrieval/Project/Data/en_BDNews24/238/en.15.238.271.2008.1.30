The government said gross domestic product -- the broad measure of economic activity -- increased less than expected in the fourth quarter. The report offset earlier news on jobs data from the private sector that topped analysts' expectations. Internet media company Yahoo reported a drop in quarterly profit and forecast 2008 revenue below Wall Street's expectations. Its shares were down 10 percent at $18.73 on Nasdaq. Investors braced for the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision later in the session, with most expecting a rate cut of 50 basis points. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 69.09 points, or 0.55 percent, at 12,411.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 8.27 points, or 0.61 percent, at 1,354.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 12.42 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,345.64.
