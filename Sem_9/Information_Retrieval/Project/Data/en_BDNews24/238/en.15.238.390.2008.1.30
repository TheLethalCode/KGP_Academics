 KAMPALA, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A five-storey building collapsed on Wednesday just outside the Ugandan capital Kampala, killing at least five people, injuring eight, and trapping about 30 others inside, police said. The building, still under construction, was meant to be an extension to a school. It collapsed as parents and children came to a nearby administrative office but police said those trapped were all construction workers. "We have so far rescued eight people who were critically injured and five bodies. We believe there are about 30 people still stuck in the pile of debris and walls," police spokesman Gabriel Tibayungwa told Reuters. Voices calling for help could still be heard under the debris late into the day as five earthmovers and dozens of fire-fighters tried to move the rubble. "We heard the building shaking like there was an earthquake, we rushed down to call the foreman," said one of the survivors, Godfrey Makanga, who was working as a porter at the site. "He said it seemed the workers on the top floor were knocking, then he climbed up to see ... Shortly after he climbed up, the building started coming down. We ran, but those inside were unable to escape," he said. The incident was the second of its kind in two years. Officials have previously warned construction companies against shoddy building, criticising some firms for using substandard materials or insufficient cement to cut back costs
