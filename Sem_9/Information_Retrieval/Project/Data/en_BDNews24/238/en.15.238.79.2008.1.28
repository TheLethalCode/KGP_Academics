 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Those most responsible for global climate disasters should compensate those worst affected, veteran environmentalist Atiq Rahman said after being named as one of the recipients of the UNEP 'Champion of the Earth 2008' award. The environmental campaigner and researcher shared his views with bdnews24.com following the announcement Monday of the names of this year's seven champions in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. "I am happy. I feel proud as a Bangladeshi to achieve the award," Atiq told bdnews24.com after being notified by the United Nations Environment Programme of the win. "The UN has honoured Bangladesh with recognition, that it is possible to form an international standard research centre with the manpower of such a poor country like Bangladesh." "No one should think that good work is not possible as the country is poor. We have been able to prove this isn't true," Atiq said. However, Atiq also highlighted that Bangladesh is among the countries at highest risk to the effects of climate change. On the global threat posed by increasing frequency and intensity of natural calamities, Atiq believes that those who are most responsible should also compensate for the disasters of the world. "If the sea level increases just one metre one fifth of (Bangladesh) will be inundated. Some 2.5 crore (25 million) people will be turned into environmental refugees." Other effects of climate change would be increased intensity of earthquakes, more frequent floods covering larger areas, and northern areas such as Rajshahi becoming drier, Atiq said. "Overall food security will be threatened. Preparations to face that should be made now." The UN Environment Programme has been giving the 'Champions of the Earth' award since 2004. Previous award winners include Michael Gorbachev, Al Gore and Prince Hassan Bin Talal of Jordan. Atiq was awarded for his research on the management of environment and development of natural resources. As a young man, Atiq went to London in 1974 to study for a PhD under a Commonwealth scholarship. He stayed for 14 years, also teaching at Oxford University. He returned to Bangladesh in 1986 to establish the 'Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies'. After returning abroad for some time, he came back home to Bangladesh for good in 1988. "I dreamt of establishing an international research centre utilising our own particular resources  our manpower," Atique said, adding that his main concern was to represent domestic as well as international and global issues. "The award feels like an acknowledgement of that dream," he told bdnews24.com. "There is no difference between the knowledge of developed countries and undeveloped countries. Knowledge is one  that is the quest for truth and solution of problems." "We have conducted research and campaigned on the impact of climate change on the people." Atiq announced his win Monday at a press conference held at his BCAS office in Gulshan. UN under secretary general and UNEP executive director Achim Steiner notified Atiq of the award in a letter, he told reporters. The award will be officially handed to the winners on April 22 in Singapore. The other 'Champion of the Earth 2008' winners are: New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark, senior researcher at Sudan's Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources Balgis Osman Elaasha, former energy and environment minister of Barbados Henrietta Elizabeth Thomson, secretary general of the Yemen People's General Congress Abdul Quader Ba-Jammal, former United States senator Timothy E Wirth and Prince Albert the Second of Monaco. Bangladesh's campaigning environmentalist and researcher is the second Asian to receive the UN award after former vice president of Iran Masumeh Ebteker. bdnews
