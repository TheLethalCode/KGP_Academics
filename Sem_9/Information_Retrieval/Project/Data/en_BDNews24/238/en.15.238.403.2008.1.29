 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The BBC has teamed up with Bangladesh's top news website bdnews24.com to enable its users to listen to BBC radio, according to a joint statement released Tuesday simultaneously in London and Dhaka. "Thanks to the new partnership, visitors to the 24/7 site across the world can now access BBC radio programmes in English and Bangla," the statement said. bdnews24.com becomes the first news site in Bangladesh to carry the BBC radio content, it said.

I'm certain that this partnership will not only be of great convenience to many who'd gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio but also will prove beneficial to BBC and bdnews24.com."

Bangladesh is a very important country for the BBC, and this tie-up with bdnews24.com reflects our commitment. "Availability of our radio content on this news portal means further growth of the BBC's outreach around the world. It's an exciting development for us."
