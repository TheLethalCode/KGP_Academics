 JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A government-commissioned report is expected to criticise Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government over the 2006 Lebanon war on Wednesday but allies said he would not quit and ruled out a snap election. "I tell you, there will be no elections," Finance Minister Ronnie Bar-On, a member of Olmert's centrist Kadima party, told supporters late on Tuesday. "The prime minister is steadfast in this position. No pressure campaign will change that." Defence Minister Ehud Barak, leader of Olmert's main coalition partner the Labour party, was quoted saying the prime minister did not bear sole responsibility for any failings -- a signal Barak may not heed calls from Labour members to bring down the government if the inquiry faults Olmert. Olmert received the Winograd Commission of inquiry's final report on the 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas on Wednesday afternoon, his office said. The panel was to present its findings at a news conference starting around 6 pm. Olmert has already survived scathing criticism in the panel's interim report nine months ago and has made clear he does not plan to go now, however sharp the committee's comments. Though unpopular and hampered by sleaze allegations, he has no clear, strong challenger within his party and his coalition partners are wary of triggering an election which polls show would be won by right-wing opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu. A poll by Israel's Channel 10 television showed 58 percent of respondents want Olmert, who re-launched US-backed peace negotiations with the Palestinians in November, to quit. The prime minister has lost allies from his fractious coalition, but has vowed to stay in office, repair any faults found by the inquiry and press on with the most serious peace talks in seven years. NO "NIGHT OF LONG KNIVES" The commission does not have the power to push Olmert or others to resign, and, although rivals have been quietly jostling for position in case he quits, the prime minister lacks an obvious rival. Housing Minister Zeev Boim told Israel Radio Winograd would not trigger a "Night of the Long Knives", or purge, in Kadima. Barak, eyeing an eventual comeback as prime minister after returning to public life last year, was quoted as saying Olmert alone should not take the blame for any military failings. "This is not a presidential regime like in the United States where the president commands the army," Barak, a former general, told the security cabinet, according to an official present. Olmert, who once declared himself "indestructible", also enjoys support from U.S. President George W Bush, who visited Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank earlier this month. Bush's hopes for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal during his final year in the White House would almost certainly be destroyed if Israel turned inward to fight an early election in which Likud leader Netanyahu would start as clear favourite. The Lebanon war started when Hezbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed eight in a cross-border raid in July 2006. Nearly 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 157 Israelis, mostly soldiers, were killed in 34 days of fighting. In its interim findings, the commission accused Olmert of lacking "judgment, responsibility and prudence" in going to war. Wednesday's report is expected to focus on the conflict's final days when Olmert ordered a ground assault that cost many Israeli lives even as a U.N.-brokered truce was in the works. The defence minister at the time and the army chief resigned last year. Olmert's ratings -- also hurt by a string of graft scandals in which he denies wrongdoing -- plunged to single digits, but he shrugged off the criticism and kept his job
