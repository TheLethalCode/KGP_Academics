<TITLE> Japan's Asano a film hit, whether hero or geek </TITLE>

 TOKYO, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Oscar-nominated epic about 12th century warrior prince Genghis Khan might appear to have nothing in common with a nostalgic drama about an impoverished Japanese family struggling to survive World War Two. In fact, the fearsome, long-haired hero of "Mongol" and the bespectacled student in "Kabei - Our Mother", nominated for a Golden Bear award at this year's Berlin film festival, are both played by Japan's chameleon-like Tadanobu Asano. Such career twists are nothing new for the 34-year-old Asano, who made his teen acting debut in "Kinpachi Sensei," a long-running school drama on Japanese television and has since played everything from a samurai warrior to a suicidal librarian. His off-beat choice of roles has led some fans to dub him Japan's answer to Johnny Depp. "The fact that a non-Mongolian wanted to make a film about a Mongol hero, using a Japanese actor was fascinating," he said in an interview at a Tokyo film studio, days after hearing the film had been nominated for an Oscar for best foreign film. "And on location in rural China we had people from all over the place: Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Japan and South Korea," he added -- a situation that sometimes led to misunderstandings. "Mongol," based on the story of the man who united nomadic tribes of northeast Asia to create a formidable force that invaded much of Asia, was funded by Kazakh investors to the tune of 15 million euros and shot by Russian director Sergei Bodrov in China and Kazakhstan. Preparing for the role was hard work for the Yokohama-born Asano, who had to learn to ride a horse in the one-handed, backward-leaning Mongol style, speak the language and eat by ripping pieces of meat off a joint with a knife. "Of course I'm happy," he said of the Oscar nomination for best foreign film. "We made this film in circumstances that were not easy, it was tough. So I'm glad we have produced something good." At the Feb. 24 Academy Awards in Hollywood, "Mongol" will be pitted against "The Counterfeiters" from Austria, "Katyn" from Poland, the Israeli war drama "Beaufort" and Russia's "12". The nomination is the first for a Kazakh-funded film. But an international nod for Asano's work could come earlier if "Kabei," directed by veteran Yoji Yamada, finds success at Berlin. "I play a very straightforward person," Asano said of his role as Toru Yamazaki, a student who befriends the troubled family at the centre of the story. "He's a bit clumsy, but that is part of his appeal. He is lonely, but tries hard to get close to people he likes. He's very cute." The nomination for "Mongol" comes a year after Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi was nominated for an Oscar and four years after Ken Watanabe was nominated for the best supporting actor award for "Last Samurai". "I think people are paying attention," Asano said of the recent focus on Japanese acting talent. "Just like baseball players are going to the United States these days, I want people to look at what we're doin
