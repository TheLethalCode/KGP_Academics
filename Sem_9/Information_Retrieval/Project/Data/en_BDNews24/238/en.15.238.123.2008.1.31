<TITLE> Japan opposition battles to tap longing for change </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's conservative Liberal Democratic Party has been in power for most of Makiko Inaba's life. Now the 61-year-old Tokyo housewife says she's ready to gamble on a change. "I want to replace the LDP. I think the time has come," she said after hearing an opposition leader speaking in the capital's upscale Ginza shopping district. "If it doesn't work, fine. But I think the time has come," she said. "I want to take an adventure." Inaba is not alone. An opinion poll this month showed that 44 percent of respondents said they want the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) to win the next general election, compared with 35 percent who opted for the LDP. The LDP has ruled almost continuously since its founding in 1955, kept in power by a political machine that combined fundraising prowess with public works largesse and catered to groups such as business, farmers and builders. But the party's popularity has suffered in recent years from its slowness in tackling sluggish growth, stiffer global competition and repeated scandals. Since splitting and being booted out of government for just under a year in 1993/94, the LDP has had to rely on small coalition partners to stay in power. Some analysts think the Democrats now have a shot at taking over. "There are lots of people who think it's worth taking a risk (on the Democrats)," said Keio University professor Yasunori Sone. "That's a reflection of hopes for a change in government." No general election need be held until September 2009 but the opposition has vowed to trigger an early poll and many Japanese media say one is likely this year. 'DEVIL YOU KNOW' That said, the Democrats, an untested and often fractious group of former LDP members, ex-socialists and younger hawkish lawmakers, face a huge hurdle in persuading a majority of voters to put them at the helm of the world's second-biggest economy. "At least the LDP is 'the devil you know'," said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano. "The opposition party by definition has a harder task persuading people to switch votes." The Democrats have made strides since the party's formation in 1998. But their fortunes faltered when the LDP's media-savvy Junichiro Koizumi took over as premier in 2001, co-opting many of their reform promises and eventually leading his party to a huge lower house victory before retiring in 2006. Koizumi's successor Shinzo Abe seemed more concerned with a nationalist agenda than pocketbook issues such as pensions. Voters unhappy with that stance and a spate of scandals handed the ruling bloc a huge defeat in a upper house election last July, giving the opposition the power to stall laws. Support for cautious moderate Yasuo Fukuda, who replaced Abe, has slipped to about 33 percent on doubts about his leadership, so he is wary of bringing forward an election which is likely to see his coalition lose seats, if not its grip on power. "Why would the LDP want to hold an election?" said Steven Reed, an electoral expert at Chuo University. "There is no way in the world they can be better off, except if they win and can split the Democrats. That might happen, but you can't plan it." Still, political foot soldiers in the electoral districts are picking candidates and preparing for a poll. "Everyone is getting ready as if it could happen tomorrow," Reed said. KOIZUMI LESSONS LOST Ruling and opposition parties backed off from a clash in parliament on Wednesday over a government plan to extend a gasoline tax devoted to building roads that the DPJ argues should be scrapped. A showdown now over the tax, which expires on March 31, could have triggered an election had the upper house adopted a non-binding but embarrassing censure motion against Fukuda. The squabbling risked confirming cynical voters' view that there was little to choose between the two major parties. "Politicians are not considering the people. They're just thinking about themselves despite the fact Japan has lots of problems," said 57-year-old housewife Akiko Shinomiya. Policy-wise, the two mainstream parties differ more in nuance than substance. Both include security hawks and doves, free market advocates and proponents of more government action to ease the widening social gaps that have accompanied economic reforms. That means the next election could well be won by the side that comes up with a catchy, if vague, reform message. "Koizumi figured it out, but they've thrown out all the lessons," Reed said. "It's not the policy, but standing for something, paying attention to the media and capturing the reform image." Neither Fukuda, a 71-year-old moderate, nor Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa, 65, a former LDP heavyweight and skilled backroom dealer who seems ill at ease before the cameras, seems likely to fire the public imagination, analysts said. Ozawa upset party backers last year by holding private talks with Fukuda on possibly forming a coalition. The Democrats rejected the idea, but speculation about the possibility lingers. "Ozawa is not spectacular, nor is Fukuda," Nakano said. "The options for the Japanese are not really enticing.
