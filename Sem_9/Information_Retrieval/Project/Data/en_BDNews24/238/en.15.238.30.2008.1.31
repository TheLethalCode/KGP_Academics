<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britney Spears was taken from her home in Los Angeles by police and rushed to a hospital in the early hours of Thursday morning, the Los Angeles Times reported. Spears, 26, was rushed into an ambulance from a side entrance of her home in the Studio City district shortly after 1 a.m. (4 a.m. EST), escorted by more than a dozen motorcycle officers, two police cars and two police helicopters, the Times reported, citing unidentified authorities. Television images showed the motorcade snaking its way through empty streets from Spears' house. She was taken to UCLA Medical Center after a call from her psychiatrist, the authorities told the newspaper. Hospital spokesman Mark Wheeler said he could not confirm the report and Los Angeles police also had no immediate comment. The pop star, whose personal life has veered out of control in the last 12 months, lost custody of her sons Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1, in October, but had been allowed to see them three times a week in court-monitored visits. Those visiting rights were removed on January 4 after Spears refused to hand back the boys to her ex-husband Kevin Federline and reportedly locked herself in a bathroom in a fit of hysterics. That episode ended with her being taken away on a stretcher and kept in hospital for two days.
