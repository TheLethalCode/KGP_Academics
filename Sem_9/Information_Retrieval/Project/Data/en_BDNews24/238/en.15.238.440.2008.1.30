<TITLE> Lebanon war report won't topple Olmert, say allies </TITLE>

 JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli report is expected to criticise Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government over the 2006 Lebanon war on Wednesday but his allies said he would not quit and ruled out a snap election. "I tell you, there will be no elections," Finance Minister Ronnie Bar-On, a member of Olmert's centrist Kadima party, told supporters late on Tuesday. "The prime minister is steadfast in this position. No pressure campaign will change that." The government-appointed panel investigating the conduct of Israel's 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon is due to publish its final report at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Wednesday. The Winograd Commission's interim findings, delivered last April, were highly critical of Olmert and his government, and the final verdict could spur fresh calls for him to resign. A poll by Israel's Channel 10 television showed 58 percent of respondents want Olmert, who re-launched US-backed peace negotiations with the Palestinians in November, to quit. The prime minister has lost allies from his fractious coalition, but has vowed to stay in office, repair any faults found by the inquiry and press on with the most serious peace talks in seven years. The commission does not have the power to push Olmert or others to resign, and, although rivals have been quietly jostling for position in case he quits, possibly triggering a snap election, the prime minister lacks an obvious challenger. Housing Minister Zeev Boim told Israel Radio the report would not trigger a "Night of the Long Knives" -- or purge -- within Kadima. Minister Jacob Edery, also from Kadima, said Olmert and his government would "continue to do their jobs". Olmert, who has declared himself "indestructible", also enjoys support from U.S. President George W. Bush, who visited Israel and the occupied West Bank earlier this month. Bush's hopes for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal during his final year in the White House would almost certainly be destroyed if Israel turned inward to fight an early election in which right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu would start as favourite. "IRRESPONSIBLE" The Lebanon war started when Hezbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed eight in a cross-border raid in July 2006. Nearly 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 157 Israelis, mostly soldiers, were killed in 34 days of fighting. In its interim findings, the commission accused Olmert of lacking "judgment, responsibility and prudence" in his decision to go to war. The final findings is expected to focus on the conflict's final days when Olmert ordered a costly ground assault even as a UN-brokered truce was in the works. The defence minister at the time, Amir Peretz, and the army chief, Dan Halutz, resigned last year. Olmert's approval ratings -- also hurt by a string of graft scandals in which he denies wrongdoing -- plunged to single digits, but he shrugged off the criticism and kept his job. The commission will give Olmert a copy of the report at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT). An unclassified version will be released to the public after a news conference about an hour lat
