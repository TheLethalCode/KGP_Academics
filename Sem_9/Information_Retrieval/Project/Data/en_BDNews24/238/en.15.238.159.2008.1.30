 Johannesburg, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's central bank began a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday at which it is widely expected to decide on leaving rates unchanged on concerns economic growth may be waning, and despite surging inflation. The Reserve Bank has lifted its key repo rate by 400 basis points since June 2006 to 11 percent as it fights to bring down targeted CPIX consumer inflation, which jumped to 8.6 percent in December, breaching the upper end of a 3-6 percent band for the ninth straight month. The seven-member monetary policy committee chaired by Governor Tito Mboweni has previously said its main focus in determining rates relates to its inflation target mandate, but analysts say signs that the economy could be slowing down may hold sway this time. Economists believe the weight of a global downturn, coupled with a domestic power crisis, could substantially slow gross domestic product expansion, which has been at around 5 percent in the last three years. This could see the South African Reserve Bank putting its upwards rates cycle on pause on Thursday, despite the latest jump in CPIX from November's 7.9 percent. A Reuters poll last week showed 17 of 23 economists predicted the repo rate would remain unchanged on Thursday. One of six analysts who had expected a hike has since switched to a steady forecast. "The energy crisis pulls the rug out from underneath the economy, and its effect is much more immediate than conventional monetary tightening," said Razia Khan, London-based regional head of research for Africa at Standard Chartered Bank. "Yes, CPIX now looks like it will peak above 9 percent. But further interest rate tightening in the face of very real downside risks to growth will be ineffectual." Official data earlier on Wednesday showed that growth in demand for credit from South Africa's private sector slowed to 21.46 percent year-on-year in December from an upwardly revised 22.62 percent in November, backing the argument that another increase is not needed this month. Critics say the central bank has already taken its inflation targeting mandate too far, sacrificing key sectors like manufacturing, which has been hurt by rising production costs and repressed consumer demand as higher rates bite
