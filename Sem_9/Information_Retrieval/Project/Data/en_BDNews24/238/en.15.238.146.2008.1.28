<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Abu Dhabi has decided to pay Bangladeshi workers wages through banks to stop labour exploitation by the employers, the foreign affairs adviser said Monday. The authorities in Abu Dhabi also decided to adopt some health safety measures for the foreign workers "The foreign minister of the UAE at the meeting told me that Abu Dhabi authorities will pay wages of Bangladeshi workers through banks," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said. He briefed journalists on the outcome of the meeting of the Colombo Process, a forum of labour-receiving and labour-sending countries, held in Abu Dhabi on Jan 22-23. He said the measure would reduce to some extent labour exploitation. Iftekhar attended the meeting represented by 20 countries including 11 labour-sending countries. The meeting, coordinated by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), was convened to highlight the problems of labour-senders and labour-receivers. Allegations are rife that companies exploit the foreign workers and harass them. The foreign adviser said the Abu Dhabi government would provide the workers with air-conditioning facilities and allow them breaks at work in the afternoon. "I have proposed that there should be a ceiling on minimum wage of the workers," the adviser said. Some 700,000 Bangladeshis live in the UAE, according to the foreign ministry estimates. Last year Bangladeshi workers in the UAE remitted home $1 million. The Abu Dhabi meeting adopted a declaration paving the way for better management of temporary contractual labour mobility. The participating countries were Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Yemen. bdn
