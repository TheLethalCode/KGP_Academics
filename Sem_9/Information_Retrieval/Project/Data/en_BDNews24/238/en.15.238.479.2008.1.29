 TEHRAN, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has executed a customs contractor for corruption and three customs employees have also been sentenced to death, the judiciary said on Tuesday, a rare use of capital punishment for economic crimes in the country. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said he did not know whether it was the first time an execution for such crimes was carried out in the Islamic Republic, whose leaders have vowed to root out graft.

Earlier this month, the judiciary said an Iranian court sentenced three state gas company managers to 10 years in jail and 74 lashes each for taking bribes totalling 23 billion rials. In December, four former officials, including one who held a key Oil Ministry position and an ex-customs director, were jailed for up to five years for taking bribes and embezzlement. Murder, adultery, rape, armed robbery, apostasy and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under Iran's Sharia law, practised since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. The number of executions for such crimes has increased since July, when police began a crackdown on "immoral behaviour". Rights group Amnesty International says Iran has one of the highest rates of executions in the wor
