 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) - A total of 126 employees of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company have pledged to return Tk 400 crore in illicit wealth to the government, an army officer said Monday. They gave the written pledge to an anticorruption taskforce deployed at Titas Gas. Of the 126 staffers having links to corruption, eight are senior officials. Lt Col ATM Hasan Ahmed, chief of the taskforce, told bdnews24.com that the Titas employees had been interrogated, with many already pledging to return the illegally-earned wealth. "It's an ongoing drive against corruption," he said. A Titas employee, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that the taskforce members had interrogated a total of 288 Titas staffers. In a written statement to the taskforce Monday, Petrobangla project coordinator engineer M Kamal Uddin Ahmed provided information about corruption at Titas Gas. In the statement, he alleged that large-scale corruption was always committed in sharing costs with private companies of laying gas pipelines for consumers. "There are no specific rules on cost-sharing. As a result, after getting applications from subscribers, the related department and the managing director were sometimes given money  to get the projects passed," the report said. Giving a picture of corruption in services and connections, Kamal Uddin said gas connections had been delayed in the last five years on excuses of paucity of gas and lack of meters and regulating machines. "On many occasions, connections were provided in return for money or other benefits," the report said. The taskforce made a broader list of about 1,000 employees of Titas Gas with links to irregularity and corruption. Of them, 175, including CBA leaders, had been sent out of Dhaka. The taskforce started work in Titas Gas by setting up a camp on the first floor of Titas Bhaban in Karwan Bazar in October last year. bdnews24.com
