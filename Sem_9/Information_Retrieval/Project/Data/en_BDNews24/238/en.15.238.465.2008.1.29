 SYDNEY, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shaun Tait became the latest high-profile Australian to quit cricket on Tuesday after the fast bowler announced he was taking an indefinite break due to emotional and physical exhaustion. Tait's shock announcement came just three days after Australia's vice captain Adam Gilchrist stunned the cricket world by announcing his retirement. Australia have been hit by a series of retirements in the past 14 months with Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn all quitting during last season's Ashes.

ENTHUSIASM Tait is one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket and was named in 2007 as the International Cricket Council's emerging player of the year. But he has struggled to secure a place in the Australian test team, making just three appearances in his career. Tait said he was taking an indefinite break from the game in the hope that it would help him regain his enthusiasm. "A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear mind and a chance for my body to rest and recover," he said. "My love and enjoyment of the game is struggling due to these issues and if I continue to go on, it will be unfair on my team mates and support staff of both the Australian and South Australian cricket teams - and most importantly my family and close friends." Tait played two tests on the 2005 Ashes tour of England but did not break into the side for another two and a half years after being hampered by shoulder problems. He was recalled for this month's third test against India in Perth but failed to take a single wicket in the match. Tait has had more success with one-day cricket, capturing 33 wickets from 18 appearances, and was a key member of the Australian side that won last year's World Cup in the West Indie
