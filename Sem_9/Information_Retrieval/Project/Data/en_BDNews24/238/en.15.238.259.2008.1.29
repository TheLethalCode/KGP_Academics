 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Cup Football Tournament, organised by Mohammedan Sporting Club, gets underway Wednesday with popular Abahani Limited taking on Badda Jagaroni Chakra in the opening match. Mahbub Jamil, chief adviser's special assistant, is scheduled to declare the eight-team meet open with ATN Bangla telecasting the ceremony and the inaugural match live from Bangabandhu National Stadium. The private channel will also telecast four more matches -- Abahani-Muktijoddha match, both semifinals and the final. The popular black and white outfit will also distribute some souvenir balls signed by its former booters among spectators on the day. In this regard, the Motijheel-based outfit Tuesday held a programme where Mohammedan's former captain and Swadhin Bangla Football team skipper Zakaria Pintu, Kaikobad, Salam Murshidi, Kaiser Hamid, Rummon Bin Sabbir, Shafiqul Islam Manik, Ayaz, Nakib, Riaz, Titu, Ponir signed on souvenir balls. Mohammedan is organising the tournament to turn the Swadhin Bangla Football team members' dream of holding a Victory Day Football tournament into a reality. The three giants of Dhaka football, Mohammedan, Abahani and Muktijoddha Sangsad will participate in the event along with clubs such as Arambagh KS, Victoria SC, Fakirerpool Youngmen, Dhaka Wanderers Club and Badda Jagaroni. This leaves only two major clubs, Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel KC, out of the 11-day meet. Co-sponsor Walton will give awards to the man of the match and the man of the gallery every day while another co-sponsor G Hanz will award prizes for man of the tournament, best organiser of the tournament, best referee of the tournament and best spectator during the final match.
