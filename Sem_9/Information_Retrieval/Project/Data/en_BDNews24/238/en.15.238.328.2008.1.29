 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Inter Service Public Relations (ISPR) Directorate, the public relations wing of the military, has protested a bdnews24.com report on the restrictions on tourists travelling remote Chittagong Hill Tracts areas. bdnews24.com ran the story titled "Tourists entry into CHT hills restricted for security reasons" on Dec 26. A statement signed by ISPR director Lt Col Kazi Md Kabirul Islam Tuesday said the report was "totally untrue and baseless". "Actually there is no restriction or bar for local and foreign tourists to visit remote areas of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Security personnel did not impose any embargo on tourists to visit any parts of CHT. "Local or foreign tourists can easily visit remote spots of Boga Lake, Keokradong peak, Tajingdong, Naikhongchhari, Rongchhari, Alikadam and any other remote places of CHT," the statement said. The ISPR also alleged that the bdnews24.com correspondent misquoted ISPR's assistant director Lt Commander M Zakaria Khan on the story. "Actually there had been absolutely an unofficial talk between Lt Commander M Zakaria Khan and Biplob Rahman before publishing the report. Lt Commander M Zakaria also requested Biplob Rahman not to quote him in the news. Biplob Rahman even did not take permission from him to quote him which is also violation of ethics of journalism." bdnews24.com's explanation: The story was based on the correspondent's visit to the CHT. Tourists were aware of the restrictions on travelling remote hills for security reasons. The report followed the ethics of journalism. The reporter talked to ISPR assistant director Lt Commander Khan in absence of its director. And part of the conversation with Khan was mentioned in the news with his permission. bdnew
