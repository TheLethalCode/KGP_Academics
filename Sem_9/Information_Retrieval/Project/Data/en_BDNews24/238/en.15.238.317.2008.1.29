<TITLE> Wild China weather kills 25, besieges heartland </TITLE>

 Shanghai, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chaotic winter weather besieged China's business and farming heartland on Tuesday amid the country's worst power crisis, with one mountain-road accident blamed on snow killing 25 people ahead of a major holiday. Icy temperatures, snow and sleet blanketing much of central, eastern and southern China have crippled thousands of trucks and trains loaded with coal, food and passengers in the most severe winter weather seen there in 50 years. A bus plunged more than 40 metres (130 ft) from a snowy mountain road in the southwest province of Guizhou, Xinhua news agency said, the first known major accident caused by the freak weather. Elsewhere, about 24 people have died in recent weather-caused accidents, including three workers killed while trying to fix iced-up power lines. Premier Wen Jiabao visited stricken Hunan province in the south, Xinhua said. Wen first flew to neighbouring Hubei province, because Hunan's main airport was iced-in. The snow and biting cold across regions that usually have fairly temperate, snow-free winters were likely to stretch beyond Tuesday, the national forecaster said on its Web site (www.nmc.gov.cn). Beijing remained cold but clear. China warned residents of Shanghai and neighbouring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces -- the country's commercial engine room -- to stay indoors if possible. In Shanghai, some food shelves in shops emptied as people stocked up. Analysts said the brutal weather was a short-term blow to the economy and would stoke inflation -- it hit an 11-year high of 4.8 percent last year -- that already has the government worried. "The short-term impact on the economy is big, with transport being disrupted, prices of agricultural products, in particular vegetables, rising," said Jin Dehuan of the Shanghai Securities and Futures Institute with stock prices appearing to stabilise after huge losses on Monday. ENERGY FEARS Jin said the weather chaos could jolt inflation higher in January but the broader impact would be limited. Blocked roads and railways have also choked coal shipments, magnifying energy shortages that have brought electricity brownouts to 17 of China's 31 provinces and province-status cities. The country's worst power crisis has forced major industrial users like metal smelters to shut down and Beijing is urging small coal mines closed in a safety drive to restart production if they have been "rectified". Fuel stockpiles at many plants have plunged to levels that cover just a few days of generation, but analysts say the power problem is caused as much by policy as weather. Coal prices are rising but Beijing keeps a tight cap on power tariffs to fight inflation, so some plants unable to turn a profit have seized on the weather as an excuse to cut production and limit their losses. Adding to energy woes, blocked roads and railways have disrupted fuel shipments so diesel is running out in some areas. NOODLE RATIONS Paralysed roads and railways also threaten to make this year's Lunar New Year celebrations a miserable one away from families hometowns. On the main highway between Guangdong, the manufacturing powerhouse of the south, and neighbouring Hunan province, more than 20,000 trucks and other vehicles were stranded, Xinhua said. Among them was a man taking 10 children by bus to Guangdong to visit their migrant-worker parents. "Today is our fifth day on the bus," Tan Wenming told Xinhua. "Every day, we each get two packs of instant noodles to eat." Railway stations and airports remained choked with stranded passengers trying to return to families to celebrate the Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, which starts on Feb. 7. In the south, more than 150,000 people crammed around the main station in Guangzhou, hoping for word of restored services -- which seems unlikely soon, reported the Guangzhou Daily. At the main Shanghai railway station, over 70,000 people were stranded by Monday night, local radio reported. Up to 19 airports are completely shut and flights from many others are badly delayed. The government has mobilised troops and officials to help citizens by sending food, clearing ice and speeding supplies of coal to starved power plants. But newspapers said the disaster has also exposed bureaucratic confusion and obfuscation. The Beijing News complained that some railway officials refused to share information about severed services. "Blocked information is the big enemy of disaster relief," the paper said.
