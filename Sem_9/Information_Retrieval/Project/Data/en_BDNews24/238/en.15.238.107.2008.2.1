<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Thursday took a tougher line on locker safety and asked banks to improve security measures. Bangladesh Bank's banking regulation and policy department issued a letter, referring to the looting of valuables from a city bank branch in a January heist. Failure to comply with the central bank's directive will lead to "appropriate actions" including cancellation of a branch licence. "Recent incident involving the breaking of lockers and  loss of lifetime savings of locker holders have created serious repercussions on the banking business," the central bank said in the letter to the chief executives of all scheduled banks. Robbers made off with gold ornaments and other valuables from 60 lockers at the Dhanmondi branch of BRAC Bank, sometime between Jan 3-7. Security officials arrested four people with suspected ties to the robbery. The BB said the banks must obtain corporate group insurance depending on the category and size of the locker. "Locker holders have to be informed about the insurance policy before they use a locker," it said. In case of any loss caused by break-ins, the banks must pay the damages to locker users in line with the claim within the insurance ceiling. "Subsequently the bank shall claim the amount from the relevant insurer." The BB asked the banks to put in play an adequate security arrangement and carry out "due diligence" on any security agency before hiring. The banks have been asked to keep an undertaking from the security agency that it would pay part of the compensation in case of theft or burglary. The BB emphasises that it is the responsibility of the banks to ensure "security and safety" of the lockers although they are not informed about the valuables kept inside. bdn
