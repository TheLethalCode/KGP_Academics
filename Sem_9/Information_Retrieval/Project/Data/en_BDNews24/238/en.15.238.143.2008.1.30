 SYDNEY, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have named a new-look squad for Friday's Twenty20 international against India in Melbourne. Ricky Ponting returns as captain after missing the last Twenty20 against New Zealand but just five other members of the test side that beat India made the 13-man squad announced on Wednesday. Matthew Hayden was left out to give him more time to recover from his hamstring injury while his fellow test opener Phil Jaques also missed out. Fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clarke and spinner Brad Hogg were also overlooked, while Shaun Tait was not considered after announcing his retirement on Tuesday. Ben Hilfenhaus, James Hopes, Nathan Bracken and Ashley Noffke were all added to the bowling roster while Brad Hodge and David Hussey, the brother of established international Mike Hussey, was selected for his international debut. "He's a good friend of mine, not only my brother, but he's such a fantastic player to watch so I am excited about playing with him," David Hussey told reporters. "I'm also excited about playing with Ricky Ponting, the world's best batsman, and Adam Gilchrist who has probably revolutionised the game." Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said the squad had been selected with an eye on next year's Twenty20 World Cup in England and as part of a strategy to keep their regular players from burning out. The squad for the triangular one-day series against India and Sri Lanka will be announced on Thursday. Australia - Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist, Nathan Bracken, Ben Hilfenhaus, Brad Hodge, James Hopes, David Hussey, Mike Hussey, Brett Lee, Ashley Noffke, Andrew Symonds, Adam Voge
