 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Wednesday said he had many questions about the independence of the Election Commission Secretariat. "I personally think that the draft (proposal on separation of the EC secretariat) does not contain a number of issues such as the category of people to be appointed and their qualifications," he told reporters in his office Wednesday. "There are many more things. We will talk about them once we get the whole thing in hand," he added. The interim cabinet Tuesday approved an ordinance to free the Election Commission Secretariat from the government control. From now, the EC Secretariat is free from ministries, divisions and departments. The Secretariat also got financial freedom burying a long practice of seeking approval for funds from the government to conduct its activities. According to the ordinance, the chief election commissioner will have the overall control of the Secretariat. The EC sent a draft proposal on independence of the Secretariat to the government on June 7 last year. The Council of Advisers approved the proposal on June 23. bdnew
