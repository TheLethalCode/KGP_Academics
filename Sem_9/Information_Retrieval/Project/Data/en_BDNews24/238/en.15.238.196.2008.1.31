 HONG KONG, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors jumped back into shares on Thursday, brushing aside worries about top US bond insurers' credit ratings that plagued markets in early trade, while the latest US interest rate cut weighed on the dollar. Stock markets began the day spooked by speculation on financial television network CNBC that credit rating firms might downgrade Ambac Financial Group Inc and MBIA Inc Both fell more than 10 percent, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average down 0.3 percent by Wednesday's close. But stocks recovered ground after MBIA Inc said private-equity firm Warburg Pincus had made a $500 million investment in it. Japan's Nikkei average gained 1.9 percent by 0600 GMT, with shares of top bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) back in the black. "This has helped boost the market, especially in financials, though the main impetus is from short-covering," said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. Exporters such as Toyota Motor Co, Hitachi and Sony Corp, due to announce earnings later on Thursday, helped to provide some of the lift. "Markets in Asia fell quite a bit on Wednesday before the Fed meeting, preceding a Wall Street fall, so we are seeing some interest from investors buying on dips," said Kang Mun-seok, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. "But the first quarter will continue to be rocky as more negative news from the subprime mortgage crisis will be unearthed." The Fed's widely-anticipated half-percentage-point rate cut had little market impact, but expectations that U.S. rates will fall further kept the dollar under pressure. It hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc at 1.0814 franc on electronic trading platform EBS in early Asian trade before recovering to 1.0840 franc. Against the yen it slumped towards 106 before recovering to 106.5. A Reuters poll showed 15 out of 16 primary dealers on Wall Street surveyed after Wednesday's rate cut expect the central bank to trim rates again at its next meeting in March. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was up 0.5 percent at 0614 GMT. Seoul's main index led the charge, rising 2.2 percent , with battered shipbuilders such as STX Pan Ocean seen as oversold and cheered by a 5 percent jump in the Baltic Exchange's dry freight index on Wednesday. Chip makers also rose on stabilising DRAM memory chip prices. In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index climbed 0.6 percent after an early slip as investors bought into talk that the world's two biggest miners, BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd, might be able to negotiate a friendly merger. Taiwan and Hong Kong, however, refused to join the rebound party and were down about 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. "The market is in a negative direction and very news-driven," said Peter Lai, director at DBS Vickers in Hong Kong. "Sentiment is pessimistic because of the bad weather in mainland China and subprime problems in the U.S." BONDS UP, OIL DOWN Safe-haven gold hovered around $923 an ounce, just shy of the record $933.10 set on Tuesday. Japanese government bonds rose to track a rally in US Treasuries after the Fed's latest cut, while recent weakness in Tokyo shares also spurred buying of safe-haven government debt. But an auction of two-year JGBs on Thursday produced a slightly weaker result than expected with investors cautious of buying the maturity on doubts whether the Bank of Japan will cut rates. "The JGB market continues to take its cue from stocks, but it's mainly driven by incentives to earn quick profits from dealings rather than investment based on a clear conviction that the Bank of Japan will cut interest rates," said Naomi Hasegawa, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Crude oil prices which had risen past $92 a barrel on Wednesday fell as far as $90.80 in early Asian trade but bounced back to recover most of the lost ground at $91.45 by 0515 G
