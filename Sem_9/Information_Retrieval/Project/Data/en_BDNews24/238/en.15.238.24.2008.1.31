<TITLE> Italian opposition has big lead in survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Italian opposition has a 16-point lead over the centre-left coalition that collapsed last week, according to an opinion poll released on Thursday. The survey for L'espresso magazine, sent to Reuters a day before publication, suggests Berlusconi would be the clear winner if Senate speaker Franco Marini fails in his attempt to form an interim government, and a national election is called. Media magnate Berlusconi has called for an immediate election after Romano Prodi, who beat him in 2006, resigned as prime minister. The main task of the cross-party government that Marini is trying to form would be to reform much-criticised electoral rules introduced by Berlusconi when he was premier in 2005. These rules are widely blamed for giving Prodi an unstable coalition that made his 20 months in power unworkable. Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni, secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) he founded with Prodi last year and Berlusconi's likely rival for the post of prime minister, wants to move Italy closer towards a two-party system by making it harder for small parties to enter parliament. He sees a better chance of beating Berlusconi if he ditches the PD's bickering communist and Catholic allies and others, and fights elections alone. The latest poll appears to back this view. It sees Berlusconi's centre-right bloc beating a centre-left line-up by 58 percent to 42 percent, whereas the breakdown by party gives the PD 27.5 percent, close behind the 29.6 percent for Berlusconi's Forza Italia. When respondents were asked who they most trust to run the country, 16 percent named Veltroni, just behind Berlusconi and his main ally, rightist National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini, both with 17 percent. Nearly four out of 10 voters -- and the same proportion of PD supporters -- believe the PD should run alone in the next elections, whenever they are held, rather than doing so only if Veltroni manages to get the current election rules changed. A poll one day earlier in Corriere della Sera newspaper gave the Berlusconi-led centre-right 54 percent against 44.5 percent for a combined centre-left. But when voters were asked how they would vote if the centre left broke up and the PD ran alone, Berlusconi's lead narrowed to 51 percent against 48.5 percent for the combined centre-left, and the PD's sole share of the vote rose to 33.5 percent from 28.5 percent.
