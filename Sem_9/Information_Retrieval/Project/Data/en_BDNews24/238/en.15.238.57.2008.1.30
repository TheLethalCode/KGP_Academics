 BANGUI, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central African Republic's education minister has resigned 24 hours after being appointed, saying he objected to being switched from his old job as health minister and calling the president "ungrateful". In a letter sent to President Francois Bozize late on Tuesday, Bernard Lala said that after two years as health minister he did not deserve being moved to head the education ministry in a new government named by Bozize on Monday. "I wasn't consulted ... I don't deserve being treated so ungratefully, so off-handedly, so scornfully. You will understand I cannot accept the new mission that you give me," Lala said in the letter, which was made public on Wednesday. Facing a public sector strike by unions which has dragged on since Jan 2, Bozize appointed a largely unchanged cabinet on Monday in which he kept the defence ministry post and brought his son, Francis, into the government as his defence deputy. Lala said that in his two years as health minister he had overseen notable progress in reducing the incidence of diseases like tuberculosis, river blindness and AIDS and restored confidence to the health sector in the former French colony. "So what is the reason for this nomination to another department without consultation? This is ingratitude on the part of President Bozize," he said in the letter. There was no immediate reaction from Bozize or Prime Minister Faustin Archange Touadera, a university maths professor whom the president named earlier this month to be the new head of government, replacing the previous premier who resigned. Central African Republic, which has suffered a spate of coups, mutinies and unrest over the last deacde, is facing a humanitarian emergency in its northwest and northeast, where raids by armed groups and counter-attacks by government soldiers have driven nearly 300,000 people from their homes since 2006
