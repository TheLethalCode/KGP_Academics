 MINSK, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia promised on Wednesday to help Belarus withstand "short-sighted" punitive measures against President Alexander Lukashenko by Western countries that accuse him of human rights breaches. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the pledge after the latest round of talks defining foreign policy priorities of the two ex-Soviet states, which have been engaged for more than a decade in discussions on a post-Soviet merger. Little progress has been achieved although the neighbours remain allies despite a row last year over increased prices for Russian energy exports. "We are concerned at the line adopted by some Western countries in putting pressure on Belarus," Lavrov told a news conference. "We point out to our European and American partners the short-sighted nature of political sanctions. You must not resolve problems through pressure." Lavrov said nothing about what measures Russia might take. His Belarussian opposite number, Sergei Martynov, rejected Western sanctions as "groundless". The United States and European Union have barred entry to Lukashenko and several dozen officials over allegations the president rigged his re-election to a third term in 2006. Last year Washington imposed financial sanctions on Belarussian oil processor Belneftekhim. Western countries say Lukashenko hounds opponents, muzzles independent media and has systematically rigged elections in the country of 10 million since the mid-1990s. Progress towards a political merger have been hampered by disagreements between Putin and Lukashenko, although the Kremlin leader visited Minsk late last year and Belarus was offered gas prices below those proposed to other ex-Soviet states. Since quarrelling with Moscow, Lukashenko has appealed for better ties with the West, but rejects any notion that Belarus must first take measures to clean up its rights record. In recent months the EU has eased its criticism of Belarus, and praised authorities for showing restraint towards opposition demonstrators and releasing some detainees early
