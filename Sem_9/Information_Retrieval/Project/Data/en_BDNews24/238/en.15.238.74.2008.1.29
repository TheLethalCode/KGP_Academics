 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British bank Alliance & Leicester (A&L) said it had secured funding to see it through this year but warned that profits would plunge after it trebled the impact of its losses on complex financial instruments. A&L said its write-down on holdings of structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and other products swelled to 185 million pounds ($367 million) from an estimated 55 million pounds in November. The bank said that excluding the writedown its 2007 operating profit would have beaten a consensus forecast of 598 million pounds but, with the hit, profits were likely to be little more than 413 million pounds, down 29 percent from 585 million in 2006.

Tuesday's update said 145 million pounds of write-down emanated from impairments on its asset SIVs. Another 10 million pounds related to collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and the remaining 30 million came from Treasury investments. The bank said the fair value of other CDOs it held had fallen by 147 million pounds in 2007, reflected in its reserves. Its shares have been supported this year by speculation it could be a takeover target for Spain's Santander. A&L has a market value of about 3.3 billion pounds. A&L also said Chief Executive David Bennett was on temporary leave but that Finance Director Chris Rhodes would stand in for him while he recovered from an abdominal illne
