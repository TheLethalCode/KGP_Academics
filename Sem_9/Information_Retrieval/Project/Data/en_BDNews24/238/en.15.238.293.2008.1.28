 NEW DELHI, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India have moved past South Africa and Sri Lanka into second place in the test rankings despite a 2-1 series defeat by Australia on Monday. South Africa, who earlier this month secured a 2-1 home series win over West Indies, dropped to fourth with Sri Lanka staying third, an International Cricket Council (ICC) release said. Australia continue as the clear number one with 141 rating points despite losing two points after India (111) surprisingly won the third test at Perth and drew the final game in Adelaide. India are followed by Sri Lanka (109), South Africa (108) and England (107)
