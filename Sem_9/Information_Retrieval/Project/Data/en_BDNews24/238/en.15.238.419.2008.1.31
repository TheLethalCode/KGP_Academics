"The idea is to control national inventories and be alerted when necessary about any sector," Osorio said. Chavez has promised to cool his socialist rhetoric in 2008 in favor of concrete action to deal with daily problems like crime, inflation and food shortages. Frequent lines at markets and the virtual impossibility of finding milk in the capital Caracas are widely cited as contributing to Chavez's stinging defeat in a December referendum on political reforms.

Chavez has issued a flurry of decrees to monitor companies and promote farming, and this month the government sent troops to border states to hunt down illegal food traders.
