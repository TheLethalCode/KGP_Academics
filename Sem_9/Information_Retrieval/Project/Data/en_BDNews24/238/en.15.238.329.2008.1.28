 ZAGREB, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia expects to implement the last reforms needed to reach NATO standards soon and win an invitation to join the alliance in April, state officials said on Monday. Croatian analysts say the former Yugoslav republic should join NATO as soon as possible, particularly in view of potential instability in the Balkans that could follow a declaration of independence by Serbia's Kosovo province in the next few weeks.
