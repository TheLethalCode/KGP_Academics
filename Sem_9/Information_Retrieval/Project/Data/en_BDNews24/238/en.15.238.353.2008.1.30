 HERZLIYA, Israel, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova will make her long-awaited Fed Cup debut for champions Russia when they face World Group newcomers Israel in the first-round tie this weekend. Fresh from her victory at Melbourne Park, the Florida-based Russian was keen to forget her strained relationship with some of her team mates and finally step on court to represent the country of her birth. "Ever since I saw the girls win the Cup last year I was so excited to be asked to be a part of the team and it is a great opportunity," said the world number five, who pulled out of last year's semi-final against the U.S. citing injury but turned up to cheer on the Russians in the final against Italy. "Since the beginning of the year this was one of my top priorities." Sharapova will be joined by world number seven Anna Chakvetadze, Dinara Safina (16) and Elena Vesnina (53) as the Russians launch their bid to capture a fourth Fed Cup title in five years. Shahar Peer will spearhead Israel's hopes of pulling off an upset victory but she was more excited at the prospect of making a rare appearance in front of her home fans. "According to the rankings we are not supposed to win but we are playing in Israel and in front of our home crowd for the first time ... I think it will help our chances," said the world number 17. The Jewish state is riding on a wave of tennis euphoria after Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich captured the men's doubles title at the Australian Open, while Peer was runner-up in the women's doubles with Belarus' Victoria Azarenka. The success in Melbourne has added an extra dimension to this weekend's showdown with Russia. "An event like this has never taken place here. It is an unreal opportunity for the crowd who (usually) see these players on TV to actually see the top women and Israel's best players," Israel captain Oded Jacob said. Peer, the only top 80 player for the hosts, will be joined by 34-year-old Tzipi Obziler, Julia Glushko and Keren Shlomo. The tie in Israel is one of four taking place this weekend, with the U.S. hosting Germany in California, France travelling to Beijing to face China and Italy are at home in Naples to Spain. ITALY DEPLETED Last year's runners-up Italy are without Mara Santangelo and Roberta Vinci because of injury but have seasoned Fed Cup players Flavia Pennetta, Tathiana Garbin and Francesca Schiavone, who was inspirational in the tournament in 2007. The 2006 winners have also included Sara Errani for the first time and will be keen to extend their 3-2 head-to-head record against Spain. Former world number one Lindsay Davenport will lead the United States against Germany. The former Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Australian Open champion will team up with Lisa Raymond, Ashley Harkleroad and Laura Granville in La Jolla, California. Davenport, 31, will be keen to reproduce the form that has helped her win 19 of 21 matches since her comeback to the tour last September after taking a year out to have a baby. Germany will be represented by Tatjana Malek, Julia Goerges, Sabine Lisicki and Anna-Lena Groenefeld. China will look to avenge the only previous meeting with France in 1992. Li Na leads the Chinese after celebrating her comeback from injury with victory in the Australian Hardcourt Championships in the Gold Coast earlier in the month. France will have to rely on a second-string team after former world number one Amelie Mauresmo and last year's Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli opted out of the ti
