<TITLE> Putin's candidate Medvedev says 'No' to TV debates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, has refused to meet his rivals for the presidency in live television debates ahead of the March 2 election. His opponents denounced his decision as unfair and said it would make it even harder for opposition candidates to gain airtime to get across their views. "Dmitry Medvedev has informed the Central Election Commission about his decision not to take part in joint events," a member of his campaign staff said. The 42-year-old lawyer, buoyed by strong supplort from the popular Putin, is already way ahead of all rivals in opinion polls and gets blanket coverage on state-run media. Official campaign rules envisage live TV debates among candidates. But in past elections Putin and his United Russia have refused to take part, saying they saw no worthy partners to debate with. The Election Commission has disqualifed an ex-prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, from running in the election leaving Medvedev to compete with veteran Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, pro-Kremlin nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and little-known independent Andrei Bogdanov. "The authorities are afraid of any discussion, any risk," Kasyanov told Ekho Moskvy radio and repeated his call for opposition candidates to boycott the poll. "My insistent recommendation is that you do not take part in this farce, this special operation," Kasyanov said. Medvedev's decision renders TV election debates pointless. Ivan Melnikov, the Communist Party's number two, said Zyuganov would not debate without Medvedev, Interfax news agency reported. Kasyanov and Zyuganov have previously said that a Medvedev refusal to take part in television debates would show that the Russian polls were a staged succession designed to ensure power stays in Putin's hands.
