 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangla Academy, the organiser of the Amar Ekushey Book Fair that begins Friday, held a press conference Thursday to brief the media on the management and preparation for the annual event. The book festival will have 373 stalls of 236 publishing houses and other organisations. Besides government, private and voluntary organisations will have a few more stalls. There will be one pavilion for the Nazrul Institute and two for 22 little magazines. There will be a writers' corner where the writers will sit and books will be launched from Nazrul Mancha. The National Book Centre will offer an opportunity to small publishing houses and the writers who have published their books personally to sell books. There will be some food stalls in front of the Bangla Academy adjacent to Suhrawardy Udyan. The information centre has been set up at the western stairs of Burdhaman Bhaban and the media centre to the north of the information centre. The visitors will be provided with fax and internet facilities to exchange information on the fair for the first time. Coordination and Public Relations Department of the Academy will hold press conference titled Gronthomela Protidin at 5:30pm every day at the seminar room of Academy. Like every year, the venue has been divided into five sections commemorating martyred language movement veterans Salam, Rafik, Jabbar, Barkat and Shafiur. A portrait will be installed in the memory of Chittaranjan Saha, late publisher of Muktodhara, the pioneer of the book fair. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will inaugurate the fair. State-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar will broadcast the inaugural programme live from the venue. Bangla Academy director Syed Md Shahed said in the previous book fair the visitors had to queue up for and some unwanted incidents happened. "To avoid harassment, there will be twelve entrances to two gates of Bangla Academy this year. There will be a separate entrance for women and children. The middle gate of the academy will be opened for the exit. Media Step, an event management organisation is doing the stage, lighting and gate decorations. BRAC Bank, which is sponsoring the event, has made a gate from Shikkha Bhaban to TSC of Dhaka University. There will be two ATM booths of BRAC Bank and Mutual Trust Bank in the fair for the visitors. A seminar will be held at 4pm from Feb 2 to 20 at the main stage of the fair. The theme of the seminar is 'Achievements in three decades in the arts and literature in Bangladesh.' The month-long festival will see cultural programmes every evening. Shahed said the academy had published some 40 books on different issues this year and another 15 books would be published during the fair. The budget for the fair has been estimated at Tk 26 lakh, he added. The number of awards accorded by Bangla Academy has been slashed to only three from six. But the prize money has been increased to Tk 1 lakh from Tk 50,000, the director said. "The number of stalls has increased in last two years. It was not possible to provide space to all of the publishers. We did not reject those who have applied in line with our rules and those who have been picked in the final selection," Shahed said. Asked whether the preparation for the fair would finish in time as the stalls were allocated late and the weather was not ideal, the director said, "There is nothing to worry about, the preparation will be complete in time." The fair will be open from 3pm to 9pm on weekdays, from 11am to 9pm on weekends and from 8am to 10pm on Feb 21, the International Mother Language Day. There will be a break for two hours from 12 noon on Fridays. bdnews24.
