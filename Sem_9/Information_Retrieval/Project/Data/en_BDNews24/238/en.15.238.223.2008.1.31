<TITLE> South Korean leader Lee faces party rebellion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect is facing a rebellion in his party that could set back his economic reform plans, with members saying on Thursday they might break away because of a dispute over nominees for an April vote. "Since the party is trying to kick me out, I may have to leave the party," Kim Moo-sung, a senior lawmaker with the conservative Grand National Party (GNP), was quoted as saying by an aide. With the liberals in shambles after the landslide loss to Lee Myung-bak in the Dec. 19 election, analysts said a united GNP would be able to alter the country's political landscape with a sweeping win in the April 9 parliamentary vote. Lee's camp wants to set up ethics standards for nominees for the April vote but that could remove several old guard members who have been convicted of corruption but still kept their seats. Kim is leading a block of 35 MPs upset with the standards and who are thinking of forming a new group with Lee's main GNP rival Park Geun-hye, the daughter of an assassinated president. Lee has outlined an ambitious set of policy initiatives for when he takes office on Feb. 25 that call for streamlining government and rolling back regulations he feels stifle business. He wants Asia's fourth-largest economy to grow by 6 percent a year. Lee, a former CEO of Hyundai's construction arm, and the GNP are riding a wave of public support. Liberal groups now hold a slim majority in the 299-seat National Assembly but their support has waned. "If they can manage to stay together, the GNP will probably be able to capture two-thirds of the seats and give the new president big stability," said political analyst Yu Chang-se
