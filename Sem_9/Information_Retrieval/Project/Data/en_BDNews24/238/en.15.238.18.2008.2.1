<TITLE> South Korea, EU steer clear of cars at trade talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korean and EU envoys steered clear of the politically sensitive topic of cars in a week of trade talks that ended on Friday, but made major progress in other sectors, the chief European negotiator said on Friday. Ignacio Garcia Bercero said 70 percent of the deal, which studies have said would boost the $80 billion bilateral trade by 25 percent, was done, but what remained was "a very significant number of difficult issues" such as tariffs and automobiles. "We've come to the conclusion that these issues, which clearly are the more difficult in the negotiations, will require political steer," Garcia Bercero told reporters. "It was not going to be possible to reach agreement at this stage." He said significant progress was made in other sectors, including agreement on labour standards, anti-dumping measures and a mechanism to remedy trade disputes. The two sides also narrowed differences on the services sector and investment. "We're convinced that we'll be able to achieve a very ambitious result on services and investment," he said. "Of course, I would not hide that we still have a very significant number of difficult issues outstanding." The two sides launched talks in May 2007, shortly after South Korea struck a free trade pact with the United States, but they failed to meet an end of 2007 goal to finalise an agreement. The EU has said South Korea's proposed measures on technical standards would hurt European car exporters and warned it could scupper the talks. South Korea has said it would see if more concessions on standards such as vehicle emissions were possible. South Korea has some of the lowest import auto penetration levels in the developed world due to tariffs and technical barriers that favour domestic cars, foreign automakers have said. Garcia Bercero said the two sides will probably meet again in April, and it was "not coincidental" that a significant amount of time was given between rounds as South Korea inaugurates a new president, Lee Myung-bak, a conservative former CEO of a major construction firm, later in February. "I think the sooner we have some more clarity on the political picture in Korea, the better it would be to try to see how we can tackle those very difficult questions," he said. South Korea's chief negotiator Kim Han-soo said the new administration was just as committed to free trade and there would be little change in the country's negotiating position. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that the nuts and bolts have been worked out for a deal and what remained was a political decision by the two sides' leaders, Kim told reporters. "It doesn't matter if it's 70-30 or 99-1 done deal. This thing called negotiations is a single undertaking," he told reporters. "If that 1 percent is something neither side can give up, then the 99 percent simply becomes hostage."
