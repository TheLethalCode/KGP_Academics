 LONDON, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Parliament has approved the suspension of Conservative MP Derek Conway for 10 days after he was found to have paid his son almost 50,000 pounds of taxpayers' money for work he never did. MPs on Thursday also ordered Conway, 54, to pay back 13,161 pounds of the money while Prime Minister Gordon Brown backed calls for greater transparency over members' expenses. Frederick Conway, 22, a Newcastle University geography student, was paid almost 12,000 pounds a year, plus bonuses, for almost three years from Conway's publicly funded allowance. The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee found that Frederick had been "all but invisible" from parliament.

A number of MPs speaking in the debate on Conway said it would be wrong to ban them from employing relatives although several supported a suggestion for their expenses to be randomly audited. Conservative leader David Cameron expelled Conway from the parliamentary party on Tuesday. The MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent has said he will resign at the next election. Leaked documents also show Conway's elder son, Henry, 25, had been paid more than 32,000 pounds in parliamentary allowances and bonuses between 2001 and 2004 when he too was an undergraduate. On Monday, Conway apologised in the Commons for his "administrative shortcomings". The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had received a letter from Liberal Democrat Duncan Borrowman, who is contesting Conway's seat, asking them to investigate whether fraud had been committ
