 MANILA, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines' human rights chief criticised President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Thursday for possibly jeopardising a regional charter by demanding that democracy be restored in military-ruled Myanmar. Arroyo has warned that the Philippine Congress will not ratify the Association of South East Asian Nations' (ASEAN) landmark charter if Myanmar does not release opposition leader and democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi.

Quisumbing said human rights bodies in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand had agreed to push for a more independent regional rights body to curb abuses. But the creation of such an organisation could only happen once all 10 Southeast Asian states, including Myanmar, had ratified the charter, which they have promised to do within 12 months. "The question is, will we wait for 40 years for these terms of reference? There is no deadline, but if we keep it alive, we'll be able to get such body," she said. Arroyo's bold stance on Myanmar contrasts with criticism by the United Nations and human rights groups of her government's failure to stop abuses at home, in particular the involvement of soldiers in the murder of hundreds of left-wing activists. Ratification in the Philippines needs a two-thirds majority in the slow-moving Senate, which has yet to ratify a free trade deal with Japan that was signed in 2005.
