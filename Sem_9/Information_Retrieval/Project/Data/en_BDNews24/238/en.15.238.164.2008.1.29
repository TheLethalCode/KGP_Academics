<TITLE> Shops to pull down shutters at 8pm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government has ordered all shops and malls to shut down at 8pm to ensure smooth power supply to farmers for irrigation through the boro season. "The government decision of shutting down shops at eight in the evening will be effective from Tuesday night," said M Tamim, special assistant to the chief adviser on power. Earlier, Tamim at a meeting with the leaders of the shop owners' association held at the energy and power ministry conveyed to them the latest government directive. Helaluddin Helal, president of the association, told reporters that they would abide by the government order despite objections from their side. Tamim said the shutdown order will be effective in the metropolises, divisional cities and district towns from 8pm Tuesday, which is in accordance with the labour law too. The government in 2007 decided to rigorously implement the existent law to save power. Helal said with a tinge of dissatisfaction, "We understand that supplying power to the farmers is of utmost priority. But the government seems to have forgotten all those seasonal fairs and exhibitions, factories and industries etc consuming power heavily. "It looks like they decided to bring down the axe only upon the shop-owners." The shop-owners, however, asked the government to immediately review the decision of shutting down the shops. Tamim thanked the shop-owners for agreeing to cooperate with the government. bdnews24.com
