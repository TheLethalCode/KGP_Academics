<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar said Thursday he would take an initiative to unite BNP if either of the two factions came up with a proposal. Sircar said he could not do anything for unity in the party in his role as Speaker but he was willing to do something as a member of BNP. On the BNP's split, Sircar said: "BNP is a big political party. There may be disputes in such a big party." "But I believe the party will take part in elections being united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, breaking all disputes, once the election schedule is announced." Speaking to reporters after attending prayers for Khaleda's mother Toyeba Majumder at the National Press Club, Sircar also said the present caretaker government was constitutionally sound. "This government came to power in a constitutional way," he said. He asked the Election Commission to hold a peaceful election by Dec. "It should not take so long to complete the electoral roll. Power should be transferred to elected representatives through a quick election." Sircar had said in the milad mahfil earlier that it was improper not to allow Khaleda and her two sons to pay their last respects together to Toyeba. "What would have happened if Khaleda Zia had been allowed to see her mother's body alongside her two sons?" He asked the people attending the milad to pray for the release of Khaleda, Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco. bdnews24.
