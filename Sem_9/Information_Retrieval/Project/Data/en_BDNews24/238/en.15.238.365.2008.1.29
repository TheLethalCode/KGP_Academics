 MOSCOW, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's government on Tuesday approved the legal framework for Joint Implementation projects under the Kyoto agreement, allowing businesses to earn and trade credits for trapping greenhouse gases. Russia had already ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for developed nations to cut carbon emissions that scientists say cause climate change. But businesses have had to wait for two years for the government to draw up the legal framework through which it can approve the projects. "The key reason is to attain ecological benefits both globally and locally here in Russia," Vsevolod Gavrilov, deputy director at the natural resources department in the economy ministry, told a news briefing at the World Bank Offices in Moscow. The Joint Implementation mechanism allows industrialised countries to buy rights to emit greenhouse gases and use them to help stay within their Kyoto emissions caps by 2012. It lets countries busting their caps fund projects that cut emissions in countries that are well within their limits, like most former communist states, and count the cuts as their own. Russia is considered potentially one of the largest sellers of carbon credits in the world because of the often heavy emissions from its Soviet-built industry, which can easily be changed through such means as insulating pipes to reduce heat waste or plugging leaky gas pipes. Russia's emissions of greenhouse gases plunged in the 1990s along with the collapse of Soviet-era smokestack industries, but have risen as the economy has since boomed. Current emission levels are still far below 1990 leve
