<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In his annual State of the Union address on Monday, President George W. Bush said the economy was slowing, bogged down by the housing slump, sluggish job growth and steep food and energy costs. Following are some key facts about Bush's economic outlook: Bush called on Congress to avoid the temptation to "load up" a $150 billion fiscal stimulus plan with extras, saying it would delay or derail the deal agreed last week between the White House and leaders in Congress. He urged Congress to make tax cuts permanent, and warned that he would veto any bill that raised taxes. He said the United States was working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and must complete a "good agreement" this year. Bush also urged Congress to approve trade deals with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.
