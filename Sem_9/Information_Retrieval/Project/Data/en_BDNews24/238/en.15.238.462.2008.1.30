 MOSCOW, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jailed Russian oil boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky said on Wednesday he had started a hunger strike in solidarity with an imprisoned colleague denied treatment for HIV-AIDS. Khodorkovsky's lawyer criticised Western governments for not speaking out over the treatment of Vasily Alexanian, a former vice-president of the YUKOS oil giant born of the rapid and chaotic privatisations following the Soviet Union's collapse. Russian prosecutors were "flouting not only international law, but the norms of morality", lawyer Robert Amsterdam said. Khodorkovsky, jailed for 9 years for tax evasion while his YUKOS was bankrupted by back tax claims and its assets brought largely under state control, complained about Alexanian's treatment in a letter to authorities posted on his website www.khodorkovsky.ru. "I am compelled to go beyond the scope of the proceedings and inform you that I am beginning a hunger strike," he wrote. Analysts described Khodorkovsky's case as a Kremlin vendetta because of Khodorkovsky's political ambitions; the government said Khodorkovsky, one of the powerful 'oligarchs' who influenced policy in the 1990s, had broken the law. SUSPECTED TUBERCULOSIS Russia's Supreme Court has refused appeals to release Alexanian, who says he will die in prison because prosecutors are deliberately denying him life-saving treatment. Khodorkovsky said he faced an "impossible moral dilemma" and had to act for his colleague. Radio Ekho Moskvy said Khodorkovsky would go on a dry hunger strike - refusing both food and water. Russia has ignored requests from the European Court of Human Rights that Alexanian be moved to a hospital from jail, where he is being held in pre-trial detention. His case has also been championed by London-based rights group Amnesty International. Alexanian says he is nearly blind and has a constant fever and suspected tuberculosis. Appearing in court on a video link from his Moscow prison earlier this month, he spoke hoarsely, had difficulty standing and at times appeared close to tears. He has a brother who works as a translator in the Reuters Moscow office
