 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip index rose 1 percent early on Tuesday after a throng of company updates and as expectations of a US interest rate cut rose. At 0847 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 58.1 points at 5,847.0. Overnight, both US and Asian markets rose on hopes of a further cut in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve. "It's a big week this week on the calendar," said Nick Hodson, head of investments at Lloyds TSB Private Banking. "There is not going to be a great deal of volume ahead of the Fed ... (we predict) 50 basis points lower." "We are bullish but the conviction in that call is lower than we'd like ... We are at or near a bottom, clearly trying to find some value out there." He said the bank's own indicators showed greater chances of the FTSE rising than falling but with significant risks. Among a host of companies reporting, Europe's biggest travel firm, TUI Travel, added 3.8 percent after it bumped up forecast synergy benefits from last year's tie-up with First Choice and said it was in talks about merging its TUIfly airline with Lufthansa's Germanwings. Elsewhere in the sector, Thomas Cook tacked on 5.1 percent. Alliance & Leicester eased 0.7 percent after it said it would take a 185 million pound ($367 million) hit from losses on its Treasury investments, more than three times its previous estimate of 55 million. Banking stocks accounted for 12 positive index points, as HSBC, HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland all gained. Some investors said a sprinkling of M&A chat was boosting the sector. Also, British life insurer Prudential gained 1.3 percent after it reported a 16 percent rise in 2007 sales, just above analysts' forecasts, helped by a deal with Equitable Life in the fourth quarter and continuing strength in Asia. SKY SHARE SALE The British government ordered pay-TV firm BSkyB to reduce its 17.9 percent stake in broadcaster ITV to below 7.5 percent because it hampered competition. BSkyB gained 0.4 percent, while ITV added 1.9 percent. Oil shares gained ground as US crude traded just below $91 a barrel. BP was 0.5 percent higher and BG Group climbed 2.3 percent. Shell was down 0.9 percent after the Daily Telegraph said the company is to delay publication of key data about its oil reserves that it would normally have released alongside profit figures being published on Thursday. Xstrata gained 4.4 percent after controlling shareholders of Brazil's mining giant Vale, including government representatives, said that a study of a takeover bid for the Swiss-based miner can go ahead to see if a deal is viable. As base metal prices ticked up, other miners on the upside included Vedanta, Lonmin and Kazakhmys. Traders will look to US durable goods data due at 1330 GMT as well the US consumer confidence survey due at 1500 GMT for further market directi
