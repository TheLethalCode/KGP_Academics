 MOSCOW, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's domestic intelligence service on Tuesday to raise their guard against any attempts by foreigners to meddle in March elections that are expected to install his choice as successor. Putin has often said that Russia's economic and diplomatic resurgence has fuelled envy and opposition in the West. The former KGB spy has portrayed domestic liberal opponents, who accuse him of reviving autocratic rule, as Western puppets. "You must step up efforts to receive on time information about any attempts to interfere into our domestic affairs," Russian news agencies quoted Putin as telling a meeting of Federal Security Service (FSB) leaders. "This country is a sovereign state and we will not allow anyone to manipulate the election campaign from abroad." Putin, whose eight years in power has seen strong economic growth and the return of relative stability after a decade of post-Soviet turmoil, wants to ensure a smooth transition of power in March to his chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev. Opinion polls indicate he will score an overwhelming victory, but opponents complain they are allowed little or no access to the media and they suffer government interference. Putin is barred by the constitution from standing for a third successive term, but has said he intends to retain influence in the governance of Russia. Putin has described the FSB, one of the successor organisations to the Soviet-era KGB, as a "key national institution" and has sharply increased its budget.
