 MANCHESTER, England, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Welsh winger Kenny Morgans was the last survivor to be rescued from the wreckage of the plane crash that killed the Busby Babes but while he escaped with his life, his promising career all but died. Morgans was the youngest babe of them all at just 18. His precocious talent had been spotted by manager Matt Busby who gave him his first-team debut along with goalkeeper Harry Gregg in a First Division match against Leicester City in December 1957. Just six weeks later he was saved from an almost certain death by sheer chance after lying, undetected, in the wreckage of the plane on the freezing, slush-covered Munich runway for five or six hours. Two German reporters, searching the burnt-out tail section of the plane for a can of film containing footage of Manchester United's match against Red Star Belgrade the previous day, saw a piece of material moving among the jumble of passengers' luggage. "I was knocked unconscious in the crash, and later, at eight or nine o'clock, two German reporters went back to the plane. I was still in the plane at that point. I was the last to come out alive," Morgans told Reuters in an interview. "They saw my shirt and I was breathing," he said. The crash happened on Feb 6, 1958, but it was three days later before Morgans regained consciousness to find out that eight of his team mates were dead or dying and that manager Busby was fighting for his life in an oxygen tent. "I woke up on the Sunday morning and there was Albert Scanlon, Bobby Charlton and Ray Wood and I thought that the other players would be in a different room. "Then the professor of the hospital came and sat by me and told me the players that had died." GOOD RUN The crash changed the young Welshman's life. After making his debut the previous December he had had a good run in the first team, playing in five of the next six league matches and in the opening two rounds of the FA Cup against Workington and Ipswich Town. He had made his European debut in the first leg of the European Cup quarter-final against Red Star on Jan. 14 and retained his place in the return leg in Belgrade. Then his world collapsed. "I never really got over the crash, not really. I've got the picture of the last line-up of the team in my lounge. "I see them every time I go downstairs. I was lucky because I was in digs in Manchester and Duncan Edwards was in digs two doors down and five doors down there was Tommy Taylor." Edwards and Taylor both lost their lives in Munich. "I used to call for them to train, every morning for three months while I was in the first team. "I got to know them and I trained with them as well so I got to know them like brothers. I missed them a lot." SHATTERING BLOW Morgans eventually recovered from his injuries, returned to the side at the beginning of April and played in six of the last seven league games of the season. There was another shattering blow to come however. Despite the tragedy, Manchester United had ridden a wave of public sympathy and reached the FA Cup final at Wembley where they were playing Bolton Wanderers. With Busby still recovering, the team was being managed by his assistant Jimmy Murphy, who told Morgans on the night before the final that he was in the team. "I was picked on the Friday night to play at Wembley and I was over the moon. "I thought that I could play my heart out for the players that had died. But walking around the ground, Jimmy came up and told me that he wasn't going to play me after all because he thought that the atmosphere and the ground was too heavy for me." Manchester United lost 2-0. Two weeks later Murphy apologised to Morgans for dropping him. It was too much for the youngster. "I just sort of packed my career in," he says now. "I didn't want to play in the first team because I missed the boys that had died." Morgans dropped out of the picture at Old Trafford, playing just four more league matches over the next three seasons until he returned to Wales and signed for Swansea in March 1961. "I went home to Swansea, I thought it would be better. My heart wasn't in it any more." He made a final move in June 1964 to Newport County, scoring 46 goals in 126 Fourth Division games, before retiring in 1967 aged just 28. A year later Matt Busby and Manchester United won the European Cup. Morgans was running a pu
