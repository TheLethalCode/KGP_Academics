 BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union failed to agree on Monday to sign a pact with Serbia for closer ties in time to boost its pro-Western president in a runoff vote against a pro-Russian challenger, Bulgaria's foreign minister said. But foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc were seeking a formula to encourage pro-Europeans in Serbia that their future lies in the EU, he said. "Not before the (Sunday) election, not before the end of this week," Bulgarian minister Ivailo Kalfin said when asked by reporters if they had agreed to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, the first step on the road to membership. "What can be done is to make an offer to Serbia to stir up (the) process of going the European way," he said in English. This could take the form of some lesser political accord. European Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged the ministers to agree to sign the SAA this week and make ratification conditional on full cooperation with the UN war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia. But participants said the Netherlands and Belgium blocked that move to demand the arrest and transfer of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, believed to be in hiding in Serbia. "We should today send a very strong signal of a European future to the Serbian people by deciding to sign an SAA shortly," Rehn told reporters just before the meeting. Rehn seemed to make a concession by saying full cooperation with the tribunal should be a condition for ratifying the agreement. The EU has until now made that a condition for signing the SAA. Mladic is wanted on genocide charges over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 7,000 Bosnian Muslims. KOSOVO Many European diplomats believe signing at least an interim deal on trade would boost Serbia's pro-European President Boris Tadic in his tough fight against nationalist challenger Tomislav Nikolic, a pro-Russian hardliner. Rehn urged EU countries to quickly ease arrangements for Serbs to travel to the bloc. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana also backed an early move to sign the SAA with Serbia, whose Foreign Minister Vuc Jeremic was due to fly to Brussels later for a previously scheduled meeting with his EU counterparts. However Dutch European Affairs Minister Frans Timmermans said his country, which has led opposition to taking a lenient line on Belgrade, could block any early step. "We will not sign till we have full cooperation with the ICTY," he told reporters. Although the presidency has little power, EU leaders are keen to see Tadic win to bolster pro-European forces ahead of an expected declaration of independence by Serbia's breakaway Kosovo province. Nikolic took a five-point lead in last Sunday's first round. A Serbian analyst said delaying the SAA any longer would "fuel a widely present perception of permanent exclusion and unparalleled conditioning". "Conservatives would only benefit," Srdjan Gligorijevic, chief analyst for the Belgrade-based International and Security Affairs Centre think-tank, told Reuters. "Serbia needs more collaborative relations with the EU, not just a carrot-and-stick approach." The leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, who make up 90 percent of the breakaway province's 2 million people, say they are within weeks of declaring independence from Serbia. The UN Security Council has been split and unable to agree on Kosovo's future. The United States and major EU powers are expected to recognise an independence declaration despite opposition from Serbia and Russi
