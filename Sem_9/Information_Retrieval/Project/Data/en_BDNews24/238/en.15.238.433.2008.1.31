<TITLE> Bangladesh reeling from internet outages </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)Internet users experienced slow speed for a second day Thursday, affected by submarine cable cuts in Alexandria of Egypt. The disruption that hit users from Egypt to Bangladesh affected businesses in the Middle East. Outages caused a slowdown in traffic on Dubai's stock exchange. Business reporters in Bangladesh struggled hard to get information about stocks as the website of the Dhaka Stock Exchange went down. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board could not confirm how long it would take to restore the link. BTTB general manager Zia Rashid Safdar told bdnews24.com that it would take "some days". Internet traffic was being diverted via Singapore, he added. News agency Reuters quoted the Internet Service Association of India to say it would take up to 15 days to repair the submarine cable. Rough weather and seas stopped ships from getting to the site to repair the damaged cable. Bangladesh businessmen fear that the internet trouble would hurt their business further. Business is now run via the internet, Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com "Receiving orders and taking part in bidding are done through the internet," he added. Chowdhury feared that problems might become severe from Monday due to the lingering internet trouble. Rafiqul Islam Rowly, president of Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, said they did not receive enough speed Thursday. "This incident means that we should not make further delay in joining a second submarine cable." BTTB Wednesday said only one STM-1 out of eight used for internet bandwidth was active in Singapore. Russell T Ahmed, secretary general of the Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com that the internet speed was far from sufficient. "It's less than half the demand. Everybody is affected. Our customers complained." The SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cable has been cut in Alexandria of Egypt Wednesday, suspending the BTTB's internet connectivity with the Europe and USA. bdnews
