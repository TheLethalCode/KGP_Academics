 MADRID, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troubled Valencia lifted the gloom on Wednesday when they claimed a place in the semi-finals of the King's Cup after an away goals win over Atletico Madrid. Valencia, who have won just one of their last 10 league matches, lost 3-2 on the night, but their 1-0 win in the first leg was enough to see them through to the last four.

Valencia extended their advantage before the break when forward Juan Manuel Mata hammered home inside the near post from the left side of the area. Atletico piled forward into attack and went 3-2 up on the hour when defender Juan Valera headed in after a corner.
