 OTTAWA, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canada will pull its 2,500 troops out of Afghanistan early next year unless NATO sends in significant reinforcements, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Monday, signaling Ottawa has lost patience with what it sees as foot-dragging by allies. Harper, who wants the soldiers to stay longer than their current withdrawal date of February 2009, said NATO's failure to station enough forces in Afghanistan meant the whole future of the organization was under serious threat. He said he accepted the recommendations of an independent panel which last week urged Canada to end its mission in the southern city of Kandahar unless NATO provided an extra 1,000 troops as well as helicopters and aerial reconnaissance vehicles. "For this mission to go forward and achieve its objectives and be successful, we do have the need for a substantial increase in combat troops and particular needs in terms of military equipment," Harper told a news conference. "Both of those recommendations will have to be fulfilled or Canada will not proceed with the mission in Afghanistan. We believe these are essential to our success." Canada is exasperated at the refusal of many other NATO nations to commit more troops to Afghanistan, in particular to southern areas where the Taliban is strong. So far, 78 Canadian soldiers and a diplomat have died since Ottawa deployed troops to Afghanistan in 2002. Polls show Canadians are split over the wisdom of the mission. "NATO's reputation is on the line here ... all the increasing evidence suggests that NATO's efforts in Afghanistan as a whole are not adequate, but particularly in Kandahar province," Harper said. "Canada has done what it said it would do and more. We now say we need help. I think if NATO can't come through with that help, then I think -- frankly -- NATO's own reputation and future will be in grave jeopardy." Harper, saying he was "always optimistic on these things", said he would raise Canada's demand for more troops with its allies before NATO leaders hold a summit in the Romanian capital Bucharest in early April. His bid to prolong the mission is also complicated by his fragile hold on power. The Conservatives hold a minority of seats in the House of Commons and require the support of at least one opposition party to pass legislation. One of the opposition parties wants the troops out now, while the other two have said soldiers should stay longer only if their combat role fighting Taliban militants came was ended. Harper said he had already spoken to Stephane Dion, the leader of the main opposition Liberal Party, and would ask the House of Commons this spring to approve the way forward on the Afghanistan mission. He declined to say whether he would make this a matter of confidence, saying his strong preference was to come up with a motion that would win the support of the Hou
