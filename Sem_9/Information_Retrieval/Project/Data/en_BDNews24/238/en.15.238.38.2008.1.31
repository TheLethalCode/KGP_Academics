<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)Noisy remonstrations from shareholders Thursday morning led United Commercial Bank Limited to suspend its annual general meeting. As the anger of shareholders grew towards the management of UCBL, Ramna police were brought in to control the situation and prevent any untoward incident. After an hour of failed initiatives from law enforcers to resolve the crisis, the AGM was suspended at around 12.30pm. AKM Dowlat Akbar, officer-in-charge of Ramna Police Station, told bdnews24.com that the agitation rose partly from the declaration of dividends for two years only and from the unequal distribution of refreshments. "There were two groups of shareholders. Some were protesting the inadequate refreshments and some were shouting about the dividend for two years only," he said. The agitation amplified as time passed despite several attempts from management and law enforcers to control the situation, according to the officerin-charge. "After trying for an hour, we had to shut down the AGM," Akbar said. bdn
