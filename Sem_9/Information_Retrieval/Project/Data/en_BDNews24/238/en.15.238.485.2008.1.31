<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer believes Germany can win Euro 2008 in June to achieve their first major honour in 12 years. "Germany are one of the tournament favourites and they have a good chance of winning the European championship," Beckenbauer told Reuters ahead of Thursday's UEFA Congress in the Croatian capital. "Traditional soccer powers France, Italy and maybe Spain are also among the front runners and I am sure it will be a very competitive tournament," he said. "It may bring a surprise like the one four years ago when Greece were crowned champions and no one expected that to happen." The tournament will be played in Austria and Switzerland from June 7 to 29. Triple world champions Germany last tasted success when they won Euro 96 in England. Beckenbauer, who captained West Germany to 1974 World Cup victory on home soil and emulated the feat in Italy in 1990 as coach, acknowledged the Germans' Euro 2008 group B rivals Croatia, Poland and Austria would be no pushovers. "It's not the most difficult group in the tournament but it's not easy either. No one will make it easy for Germany to go through but they have the ability to go all the way," he said. Polish FA president Michal Listkiewicz told Reuters he was confident Poland, who are organising the 2012 tournament jointly with Ukraine, would do well in their maiden appearance in the finals this year. "We've had World Cup success in the past but it's our first appearance in the European Championship finals and all our fans expect us to get very far after finishing top of our qualifying group," he said. "It's going to be a tough group for us in Austria and Switzerland but our (Dutch) coach Leo Beenhakker is very optimistic and I am too. We can be the surprise team of the tournament. "The first priority is to reach the last eight and I hope we can stage a major surprise in our opening match against Germany
