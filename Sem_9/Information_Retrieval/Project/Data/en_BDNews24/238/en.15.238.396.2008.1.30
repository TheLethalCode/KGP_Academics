 Moscow, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin called on Wednesday for changes in Russia's foreign policy to guarantee a stable environment for investors. "We should adjust our foreign policy goals in the nearest future to guarantee stable investment," leading cabinet liberal Kudrin told an investment conference in response to a question. President Vladimir Putin has pursued an increasingly hawkish foreign policy towards the West in recent years, boosting Russia's military might and attacking Washington over plans for missile defence, an independent Kosovo and the war in Iraq. Kudrin, who is close to Putin and his chosen successor Dmitry Medvedev, did not say which policies should be changed. Kudrin's remarks were highly unusual since policy differences between top Russian officials are almost never aired in public. The finance minister also implied that Putin's decision not to alter the constitution to allow himself a third consecutive presidential term marked a victory for the Kremlin's liberal camp over hardliners. "The main political event of last year was that Russia did not change its constitution and did not yield to those who called for Putin to be elected for another term," Kudrin said. Foreign investment flows are at record highs as Russia's economy grows for a tenth straight year, crowning the country's longest boom for a generation. Last year, foreign direct investment was $47 billion. But some senior officials say Russia -- which needs to spend billions of dollars on major oil projects and infrastructure upgrades -- still attracts too little investment compared with other high-growth countries such as China. Kremlin officials explain the hawkish foreign policy by saying Putin has merely reasserted Russia's clout on the international stage and pursued the country's legitimate national interests after Moscow's influence drained in the chaos that accompanied the fall of the Soviet Union. But some officials privately concede that Moscow may have gone too far, damaging Russia's image among investors and business people in the process. One example was a bitter row with Britain over the murder in London in 2006 of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko and the closure at the start of this year of the British Council's offices in two regional cities
