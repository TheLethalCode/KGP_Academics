<TITLE> Anger grows over Japan PM's about-turn on US base </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 24 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Activists and politicians on Japan's Okinawa have vowed to keep up their battle against a deeply unpopular US airbase, a day after the premier apologised for shelving plans to move it off the island. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama was met by protesters shouting "Hatoyama, Go home" when he visited the island Sunday to apologise for his decision to relocate the unpopular airbase within Okinawa, as demanded by Washington. The premier, before taking power last year, pledged to move the base off Okinawa, but in a policy U-turn has decided to move it to the island's coastal area of Henoko, despite fierce local opposition and environmental concerns. On Okinawa, which has chafed under a heavy US military presence since the end of World War II, the move has sparked widespread anger. Last month, nearly 100,000 protesters rallied against the base. The row over the US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma has seen Hatoyama's support ratings dive into the low 20 percent range and threatened his three-party ruling coalition as July upper house elections near. Mizuho Fukushima, the leader of the Social Democrats, which has joined Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan in the ruling coalition, has threatened to leave the alliance if the base stays on Okinawa. Fukushima plans to visit the far-southern island Tuesday. Susume Inamine, the mayor of Nago city, which is set to host the new base at Henoko, told Hatoyama Sunday: "I cannot hide my rage." A Nago official said Monday: "It's unlikely that we will compromise with the Hatoyama government. We are currently discussing what measures to take next." Okinawa's Ryukyu Shimpo daily accused Hatoyama of a "betrayal" of public trust and demanded he re-negotiate the deal with Washington. "The prime minister should restart re-negotiations even now with the US to move the base out of the country. The public is demanding an 'equal' US-Japan relationship based on the popular will," it said. Hiroshi Ashitomi, who leads a local anti-base activist group, said: "They decided the deal on their own without the approval of Okinawa's residents. "Some people are so angry that they are very close to acting recklessly," said Ashitomi. "But if they do lose control and do something irrational, it will be the government's responsibility. "I think it will be a matter of a year or two before the battle comes to an end. The political environment is changing, with mayors supporting our cause, so we don't have to be frantic over what to do." Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of the Buddhist-backed New Komeito opposition party, demanded the premier step down for his "betrayal of the people of Okinawa." Hatoyama, speaking Monday, said keeping the base on Okinawa was justified in light of the rise in regional tensions after a multinational panel accused North Korea of sinking a South Korean warship in March, killing 46 people. "I decided that it is of utmost importance that we place the Japan-US relationship on a solid relationship of mutual trust, considering the current situation on the Korean peninsula and in Asia," he said. Washington argues that a strong US military presence is crucial for the defence of Japan and stability in the wider Asia-Pacific region. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in China on Monday, thanked Hatoyama for his "courage" and for "making the difficult but nevertheless correct decision to relocate the Futenma facility inside Okina
