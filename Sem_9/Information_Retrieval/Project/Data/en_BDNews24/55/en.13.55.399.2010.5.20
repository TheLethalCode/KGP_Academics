 Chittagong, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Newly resigned Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury filed his nomination papers on Thursday seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office in the June 17 city corporation elections. "People love me. This is my great achievement," he said. "The residents of Chittagong will evaluate my record." He went to the Chittagong Election Commission office at around 11am and submitted his nomination papers to returning officer Jasmine Tuli. Mohiuddin was accompanied by Chittagong metropolitan Awami League's general secretary Quazi Inamul Haque Danu, joint secretary Ibrahim Hossain Babul, vice-president KM Belayet and member secretary of Citizens Committee Mohammed Emdad. No Awami League MP was present. He has asked the EC if he can run the elections with the logo 'ship'. He won the last three polls with this logo, but the Commission has not allocated it this year. An hour earlier, he had submitted his resignation letter to the chief executive officer of Chittagong City Corporation. He has served as mayor for 16 years and five months in three tenures and was jailed for more than one year during the 2007-8 military-installed caretaker government. He handed over his job to panel mayor and ward councillor Zahirul Alam Dobhash. According to the law, a person cannot contest for the mayoral post while holding that position. The current tenure of CCC office bearers expires on June 25. The Awami League leader is contesting for the polls as a candidate of a Citizens Committee. Mohiuddin went to the Nagar Bhaban in his mayor's car shortly before 10am and left in a rented microbus without any protocol at around 10:30am. Speaking to awaiting reporters, the outgoing mayor said: "I have worked for a long time to build Chittagong as a non-communal and beautiful city. "I have worked to make Chittagong a full-fledged city corporation. I have worked for the poor and given special priority to the development of health and education sectors," he added. "Every candidate takes part in the election with the hope of winning. I hope people will elect me this time. Asked whether he had failed in his long career, he said, "Nobody admits his or her own failures." After submitting his resignation paper, Mohiuddin met the city corporation employees in the auditorium and expressed his gratitude to them. He also requested them to cooperate with the acting mayor. Mohiuddin has been elected mayor three times in a row. In the first and third elections held in 1994 and 2005 he beat BNP's Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin. In the second election held in 2001 he was elected uncontested. The CCC will be the only one of the six city corporations going to elections before the terms of the current office-bearers expires. According to the Local Government (City Corporation) Law2009, elections have to be held within 180 days after the date of tenure expires. bdn
