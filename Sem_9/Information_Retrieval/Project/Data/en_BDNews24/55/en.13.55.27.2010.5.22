 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Industries minister and Samyabadi Dal's general secretary Dilip Barua has said that war criminals cannot be saved despite BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's efforts. The minister urged all progressive democratic powers to join forces to thwart the conspiracies against the coalition government and democracy. He was speaking to party activists in a meeting at the party's office in Dhaka's Segunbagicha area on Saturday. Secretary of the party's metropolitan branch, Harun Chowdhury presided over the programme called in protest of BNP's hartal and demanding arrest and punishment of war criminals. Samyabadi Dal's politburo members Abu Hamid Sahabuddin and Dhiran Shingha, central leader Ferdous Kamal Masud, Suren Shingha, Haniful Kabir and other leaders spoke in the meeting. Dilip Barua has called for a procession and meeting at Muktanganon on June 6 at around 4pm. Following the meeting, Barua led a procession of his party around the city. Dilip said, "Conspiracies have been hatched to make the government fall into unstable situations as soon as we came to power." They had tried to make the government fall through barbarous killings at the BDR headquarters, but could not succeed, he alleged. "Sheikh Hasina saved the country from the crisis with her strong leadership but the conspiracy has started again." He said that war crimes trial is this government's electoral pledge. The whole country was united regarding this issue. Protesting BNP's hartal on June 27, the minister said, "BNP wanted to make legislation banning hartals when it was in power. But now they have gone against their own policy after losing the election." He said that the current government was working on an agenda implementing its electoral pledge. The fast development has turned Khaleda Zia's dream of coming to power into a nightmare. "The people will not vote for them. They have found out the true colours of BNP."
