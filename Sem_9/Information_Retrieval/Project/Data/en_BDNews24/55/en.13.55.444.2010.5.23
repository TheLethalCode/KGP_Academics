 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury on Sunday blamed the government for failing to rehabilitate Aila victims even after one year. He blamed the government officials of the coastal areas and lack of coordination between the government and non-government agencies for the prolonged sufferings of the victims, who are still forced to stay in the makeshift houses built on the embankment. "The government has not yet succeeded to tackle the aftermath of the disaster (Aila). However, it is still working to mitigate the problems", The AL MP said at a discussion meeting on the impacts of climate change at the capital's BRAC Centre. Chowdhury, who is also the president of all-party parliamentary committee on climate change, slammed the local administration for not providing sufficient information on the Aila victims. About 23 people died on May 25, 2009 after the devastating cyclone battered the country's southwest coast. Most of the coastal embankments of Koyra and Dakop sub-districts in Khulna were damaged by Aila and villages were completely submerged. Since the dykes are yet to be rebuilt and repaired, people have to live amid inundation twice every 24 hours due to the tides. State minister for forests Hasan Mahmud, who was the chief guest, told the discussion that the least developed countries were promised a $30 billion-fund between 2010 and 2012 in the Copenhagen Climate Conference 2010. However, Bangladesh has not received a penny of that fund yet, Mahmud added. He also said that Bangladesh is pressing to include climate change in the upcoming United Nations' refugee convention. The discussion meeting was organised jointly by International Organisation for Migration and BRAC Development Institute. bdn
