<TITLE> HC says no to Jamuna </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com) The High Court has upheld a government order to stop transmission of private Jamuna Television. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Gobinda Chandra Thakur gave the order on Thursday on a petition filed by the television station on Nov 22 last year. The Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission shut down the test transmission of Jamuna, owned by Jamuna Group head Nurul Islam Babul, on Nov 19, just 35 days after it had launched the transmission, on the ground that the channel did not obtain the 'no-objection' certificate before going on air. It had said Jamuna TV applied for a 'no-objection' certificate on Oct 8 last year, but started transmission illegally while the matter was under consideration. Jamuna Group managing director Shamim Islam filed the petition following suspension of the transmission. Jamuna TV had launched the test transmission on Oct 15 after long legal battles during BNP-led alliance and caretaker governments. Earlier, Babul claimed that the channel secured a 'no objection' certificate on terrestrial and satellite transmission on Feb 5, 2002. The court in its order said the BTRC had seized equipment for suspending the transmission of the channel. The court does not consider it illegal, the ruling said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the ruling that the transmission of Jamuna TV was illegal, which was why the information ministry asked BTRC to cancel the channel's frequency and stopped the transmission. He also said the court asked the government for a quick resolution of another application filed by the channel but did not ask for awarding licence. The court said that the petition was not filed in a transparent manner. "That's why it did not give any order on allowing licence," Alam added. It also ordered the government for a quick disposal of another application on 'no-objection' certificate submitted by the channel. The telecoms watchdog cancelled the licence of the television channel on instruction of the information ministry, the court said. The channel started transmission without broadcasting licence and its frequency was cancelled due to legal reasons. The BTRC has the legal responsibility to stop such illegal transmission, the court observed. The ruling also said Jamuna TV was awarded the no-objection certificate on Feb 5, 2002 and the licence expired on Feb 4, 2007. The channel applied for satellite transmission again on Oct 8, 2009. It is up to the administrative authorities to resolve the matter, according to the ruling. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque argued for the petitioner. bdnew
