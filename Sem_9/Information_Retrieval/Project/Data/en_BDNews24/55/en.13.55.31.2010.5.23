 Chittagong, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury said on Sunday that he would not make any election pledge for the June 17 city corporation polls. Also Chittagong city Awami League president, Mohiuddin said that his strategy this year would be different. He said in the previous elections he had only sought the blessings of his electorate. Seeking an unprecedented fourth time, Mohiuddin was speaking to reporters after securing endorsement of the ruling Awami League formally. "I won't make pledges this time," he said adding that he respected electoral laws. Mohiuddin said he would reveal the strategy during the formal campaign. The full planning had already been completed, he said. He also warned that the party high command would take action against Reazul Karim Chowdhury, organising secretary of the city AL, who also submitted nomination papers for the mayoral position. On Saturday night, the AL central working committee at a meeting expressed its support for Mohiuddin for the election. Earlier, Reazul, known as Mohiuddin's rival, submitted his nomination. He is yet to withdraw his nomination. Announcing that there would be no election camp, he said, "I'd seek votes through door to door campaign." "I think the people will vote me in light of my previous record." Regarding his rivals, Mohiuddin said, "I don't think anyone is weak." Meanwhile, Reazul said that he would withdraw his candidature in respect to the party decision. He told bdnews24.com: "The party decision on mayoral election means that it is the party chief's decision." "I cannot breach party discipline as a party member," he said. The deadline for withdrawing nomination is June 1. bdnew
