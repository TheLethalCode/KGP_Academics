<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Police and RAB have been directed to work together and resolve their differences over who killed SI Gautam Kumar Roy. The two law-enforcement agencies have been at loggerheads over who actually killed Bangshal police station's sub-inspector Gautam Roy last month as RAB and police made separate arrests in connection with the murder. They both claim to have arrested the 'actual' murderers of Roy, who was shot dead on Apr 20, when he stopped on his way home purportedly to question three suspected criminals on the road. After a two hour meeting between the police and RAB, the Inspector General of Police told reporters that both the Police and the RAB had been asked to work together to remove any confusion over the matter. The meeting between the two prime law enforcement agencies started at around 11am at the office of inspector general of police Noor Mohammad. Mohammad said, "Agencies always consider the incidents from their own viewpoints, and mistakes can happen when they are trying to claim credit for arrests." As a sensational case, the SI Gautam murder case is at present listed with the home ministry monitoring cell, said the police chief. The monitoring cell will decide the fate of the case now, he added. Present at the meeting on Sunday were, RAB chief Hasan Mahmud Khandaker, RAB-10 commander SM Kamal Hossain, police's Criminal Investigation Department chief Syed Shah Jamal Raj, Dhaka Metropolitan police commissioner SM Shahidul Haque and Dhaka metropolitan detective police high commissioner Mahbubur Rahman. Mona Miah, a witness to the murder, has also been summoned to attend the meeting. Police arrested Haider and Zakir on Apr 23 and Apr 28 respectively, claiming them to be Gautam's killers. However, RAB also arrested two men with same names on Apr 25 and claimed them as the killers. Police headquarters formed a five-member committee led by CID chief Shah Zamal Raj to settle the confusion. The committee is yet to submit its report. bdnews24.
