 Dinajpur, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Mining at the Maddhyapara Granite Mining Company has stopped due to an indefinite strike, organised by the Labour Worker Union, which started on sunday. The LWU president Maminul Haque and general secretary Mostafijur Rahman told bdnews24.com that 266 workers who had joined the mine since Apr 8, 2004, had not been made permanent and were working under contractors. "It was promised during the training period that they will be appointed permanently. But the promise was not kept. "Although we contacted the MGMCL authorities about the appointments, they have taken no notice. So we are being forced to start the indefinite abstention from work from Sunday," they said. They also claimed that April payments were still due. The total number of workers managed by MGMCL is 292. The managing director of MGMCL Faruk Ahmed told bdnews24.com that in line with specific governmental directions and guidelines, the workers were employed by a contractor who was chosen through tender. They are currently employed by Bustar Services  and the workers have until now been working and receiving payments regularly, he said An average 16.5 tonnes of granite is mined yearly at the mine  and the stone is used in constructing embankments, bridges and roads. b
