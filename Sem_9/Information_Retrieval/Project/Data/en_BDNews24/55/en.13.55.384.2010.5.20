 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)--BNP leader Nazrul Islam Khan has claimed that they have called for hartal to pressure the government into conceding to 'people's demands'. Khan, who coordinated the Paltan rally on Wednesday from where opposition chief Khaleda Zia called for the countrywide general strike for June 27, said "The government has failed to provide any solution to the people [faced with utilities crises]. "For example, they are now raising power prices after failing to provide adequate supply," he said at a press briefing at the party's Naya Paltan office on Thursday. The BNP standing committee member said that the government has been given a month before the strike to meet the public demands. "If the demands are met within the period, the hartal won't be needed," Khan added. "Our leader has called the strike to realise the people's demands. The government has been given 16 months during which we did not give any programmes," Khan said, answering a query. The hartal aims to protest the utilities crisis, tender-grabbing and extortion, and demand dissolution of the Election Commission and cancellation of treaties with India. Khan also vented his frustration over the attacks on 'hundreds of party members' on their way to the grand rally on Wednesday. He said, "Party members from Munshiganj were attacked at Sadarghat launch terminal. The body of Munshiganj's Mirkadim Juba Dal's organising secretary Akbar Hossain was fished out of Buriganga river on Thursday." He also termed the ruling Awami League's warning to thwart the general strike 'undemocratic' and pointed out that the AL had enforced 173 days of hartal during the previous BNP-led coalition government's term. BNP vice chairperson Abdullah Al Noman, advisory council member Mir Mohammed Nasiruddin, senior joint secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir also attended the briefing. The funeral prayers of Akbar Hossain was held following the press meet and attended by central leaders and workers. BNP claims Akbar was the organising general secretary of Munshiganj's Mir Kadim municipality Juba Dal. bdn
