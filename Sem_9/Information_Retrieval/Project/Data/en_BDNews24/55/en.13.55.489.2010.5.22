 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced that another 1000MW of electricity will be added to the national grid by the year end. She made the announcement at the inauguration of Texbangla Fair at Sheraton Hotel organised by Bangladesh Textile Mills Association on Saturday. "Our government has given a top priority to the power sector". She blamed the previous governments for the present power crisis. "We have not created the problem. "If our projects were implemented then power production would have reached 6,000 MW in 2009," she claimed. "Although power demand rose by eight percent every year, not a single megawatt of electricity was added to the national grid in the last seven years," she said. However, BNP, which was in government between 2001 and 2006 strongly denied this allegation. Former prime minister and BNP chairperson, Khaleda Zia has said numerous times that during the last AL tenure (1996-2001) no electricity was added to the national grid. Saying that the government is working on solving the power and gas crisis, Hasina urged businessmen and industrialists to keep patience. "We failed to come to power in 2001 as we did not sell gas. This is the reality," said the prime minister indicating there was foreign pressure for the exporting of natural gas. She reassured the businessmen, saying, "The government is ready to give all kinds of facilities for the development of the textile sector. "I believe, if entrepreneurs of all the sub-sectors of the textile sector take a comprehensive programme then everyone will be benefited," said Hasina. Minister for textile Abdul Latif Siddiqui and commerce minister Faruk Khan were present at the programme. Former president of the BTMA, Salman F Rahman, gave a power point presentation on the development of the industry since independence. bdnews
