<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)--State minister for law Qamrul Islam has alleged that late president Ziaur Rahman was a spy for Pakistan in 1971. Islam also challenged anyone who opposed his opinion to face him in a talk show. The Awami League leader was speaking on Friday at a discussion meeting, arranged by Biswa Kabita Kantha Parishad at the National Press Club demanding speedy trial of the war criminals. The state minister said even though General Zia had fought the war of independence of 1971 "he did all kinds of things that went against the liberation war after coming to power following the murder of [independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]." Qamrul said, "No one could change their thinking, belief and mentality 180 degrees in three and a half years." "This would not be possible for anybody, but Ziaur Rahman did just that." The state minister also alleged that continuing the legacy of her husband, opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia was obstructing the trial of war criminals. He said the trial would be held within the tenure of the current government, no matter how many impediments they faced, stressing that the trial would reflect the people's expectations. Qamrul indicated that the government was emphasising the organisers of war crimes in Dhaka, rather than in Chittagong and Rajshahi, and urged to all to support the trial with relevant information. bdnews
