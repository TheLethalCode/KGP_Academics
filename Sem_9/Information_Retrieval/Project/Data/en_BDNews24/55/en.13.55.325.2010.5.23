<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  After several rejections, BNP chief Khaleda Zia's application to change the court dealing with her appeal against the government decision to vacate her cantonment house has finally been granted. On Sunday, the opposition chief's petition challenging the government order was shifted to another High Court bench. The petition hearing was removed from Monday's agenda of the bench of justices Md Imman Ali and Obaidul Hasan, deputy attorney general Motahar Hossain, who was on duty at the bench, told bdnews24.com. He said the hearing has been shifted to the bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif. However, he could not confirm the date of the next hearing. Quoting an official of justice Imman Ali's bench, Motahar said the decision to withdraw the petition from the bench was revealed by the chief justice's personal secretary around 5pm on Sunday. The record of the writ petition was forwarded to the bench of justices Sultana and Arif for further hearings. Earlier on May 17, the hearing was adjourned until May 24 by the order of the former bench following an application for time extension by Khaleda's lawyers. Lawyer Moudud Ahmed had told the judges that the hearing should be deferred for two weeks since an application for another bench to hear the case was now with the chief justice. On May 11, acting chief justice Md Abdul Matin had directed the BNP leader's counsel to place the application before chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim on his return from abroad. Earlier, the bench of justices Ali and Hasan had rejected an application to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and had twice rejected subsequent applications that the case be heard before another bench. bdne
