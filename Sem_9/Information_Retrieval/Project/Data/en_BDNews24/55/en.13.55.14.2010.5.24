<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Workers at the Maddhyapara Granite Mining Company Limited (MGMCL) continued with their indefinite strike for the second day on Monday. The Labour Worker Union enforced the strike from midnight on Sunday demanding that the workers be made permanent employees and that their arrears be paid. Union president Mominul Haque said they would continue with their strike until their demands were met. However they would sit with the authorities if any initiatives were taken to settle the matter. Haque alleged that authorities had summoned them twice for discussions on Sunday but later did not hold the meetings. However, MGMCL Managing Director Engr. Faruque Hossain, denied the allegations. The workers lied, he said. "We invited a few eminent people of the locality to the meeting but the workers did not agree to sit with them," Hossain told bdnews24.com . He said they had invited a third party to the meeting because earlier they had seen that when a decision was made in the meeting, the workers later argued that a different decision had been made. "That's why we summoned some local people to the meeting," the official said. The General Secretary of the union, Mostafizur Rahman, earlier on Sunday claimed that 266 workers who had joined the mine since Apr 8, 2004, had not been made permanent and were still working as contract workers. The workers say that they were promised during the training period that they would be appointed a permanent employees but the promise was not kept. The April payments were still due, said the general secretary. A total of 292 workers are managed by MGMCL. An average 16.5 tonnes of granite is mined annually  and the stone is used in the construction of embankments, bridges and roads. bdne
