He made these comments on Saturday, in a press briefing organised at the National Press Club in Dhaka. Haque also said, "Some media had spread the news that the High Court had rejected Jamuna's appeal on May, 20, which is not true." He said that the court had actually asked the private channel, Jamuna Television, to resolve the problem with the channel's application for a 'no objection certificate' (NOC). Haque said, "I don't want to comment on a sub judice matter." He said that the attorney general's allegation that Jamuna TV's NOC had expired was not correct. "If the validity of the no objection letter from 2007 had expired, then why did BTRC allocate the channel broadcast frequency in November 2008?" "BTRC never allocates frequency without the NOC", he added. He also claimed that such no objection letters were not limited by a certain period of validity. Haque later told bdnews24.com that the channel would take further steps after getting a copy of the High Court ruling. b
