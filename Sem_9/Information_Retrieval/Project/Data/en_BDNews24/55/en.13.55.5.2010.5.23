 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League has asked the opposition to withdraw its country-wide general strike on June 27 and shift towards more peaceful programmes. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Saturday said: "I'm asking [BNP] to withdraw the hartal." "I hope they will lift the strike and announce a peaceful programme," AL general secretary Ashraful told a press conference after attending the central working committee meeting at Bangabhaban Saturday night. Besides, he also claimed that the country's socio-economic and political situation did not justify a strike. Referring to a number of criminal activities that had marred the tenure of the BNP-led government Ashraf said, "No one was killed in any attacks like those on Shah AMS Kibria or Ahsanullah Master." Kibria and Master were both sitting MPs. He also referred to the grenade attack on an Awami League rally and said there had been no incidents like 'August 21 or the 10-truck arms haul over the last few months'. Ashraf mentioned that Khaleda, when in power, vowed not to go for strike if she were in the opposition. "But she has violated that pledge." When asked about measures in case of an unstable situation due to the general strike, Ashraful said that the Awami League was not in charge of such measures. "The law enforcing agencies will decide on that." He claimed that the country was safe under the leadership of prime minster Sheikh Hasina. Regarding the Chhatra League members involved in tender-grabbing, Ashraf said, "Measures are being taken against those involved with crimes. Their political identity is not considered here." On BNP's claims on the presence of war criminals in the AL, Ashraf said, "It'd be better if they don't deliver such confusing information." AL IS STRONG The AL general secretary claimed that the party's organisational position was strong. He said that the membership recruitment programme, aiming at 10 million new members, was underway and had sold membership forms worth Tk 60 lakh. The AL are aiming to add women and the young generation into the party, he added. The ALCWC on Saturday also approved the suspension of Noakhali district AL president professor Mohammad Hanif for acting against the party and breaching organisational discipline. Besides recruitment, renewal and other organisational issues, the meeting also decided to hand over land, owned by the Bangabandhu Foundation, to the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust for the construction of a hospital and a nursing institute. Saturday's meeting also finalised the programmes marking the birth anniversary of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on May 25. The year-long programmes to observe the foundation anniversary of the party will begin on June 23, Ashraf added. bdn
