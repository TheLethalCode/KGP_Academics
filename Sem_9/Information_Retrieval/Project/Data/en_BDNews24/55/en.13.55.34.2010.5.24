 Dhaka May 24 (bdnews24.com)  All specialist physicians in Dhaka closed their private chambers to public from Monday evening protesting assault on a colleague. Bangladesh Society of Medicine president M A Jalil Chowdhury said the strike came as a protest against an assault on A K M Rafik Uddin. Rafik was apparently also threatened that he would be kidnapped. Jalil said the Bangladesh Medical Association also endorsed the programme. Rafik was assaulted at his private chamber in Dhanmondi on May 9. The chamber was also vandalised. A case was also filed with the Dhanmondi police. Jalil said, "No one has been arrested till now," adding that the doctors were under security threat. A human chain was held on Sunday to press for the doctors' demand, he added. Home minister Sahara Khatun had sought for more time to address the issue, he said. Further programmes would be finalised after a meeting Monday night, Jalil added. bdn
