 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has urged candidates of Chittagong City Corporation election not to launch formal electioneering until June 2 when the polls logos will be assigned. But there is no restriction on door-to-door campaigns as the deadline for filing nominations have expired, election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain said Thursday. Nomination papers will be scrutinised on May 23 and May 24 with the deadline for withdrawing candidature being on June 1. Symbols will be allocated to the candidates on June 2. Shakhawat said, "No formal publicity will be allowed until symbols are allocated. There is restriction on processions and public rallies in the June 17 CCC polls including writing graffiti and sticking up coloured posters. The EC has already warned ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, M Manzurul Alam and MP Abdul Latif for allegedly launching election campaigns before submitting nomination papers. Sakhawat said strict actions would be taken against those violating the electoral law. The deployment of executive magistrates in each ward, who will be available from June 3 to June 18 to see if law is breached, was underway, the commissioner said. They will be empowered to sentence any violator to six months in jail and fine them Tk 50,000, or both. The EC will also take actions against government officials and employees responsible for irregularities, he said. The official urged the candidates not to involve people who are not voters of that area in publicity campaigns. He said polling agents must be voters of that particular area as well. Complaints must be communicated in writing to the presiding officer or other officials in charge, he added. Shakhawat said, "The city corporation election, though a non-party poll, is a political election." But since party symbols are not allocated, it can be termed as a non-party election, he said. No candidate, even those backed by political parties, will be allowed to use party slogans in the name of party leaders, he warned. bdn
