 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, May 21(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban militants strapped explosives to two men accused of being US spies and blew than up at a public execution in northwest Pakistan, intelligence officials and residents said on Friday.

Many militants took refuge in North Waziristan, officials said. The United States wants Pakistan to extend its offensive to North Waziristan and go after militants there, particularly Afghan Taliban, who launch cross-border attacks on Western forces in Afghanistan.
