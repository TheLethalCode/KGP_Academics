<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has said that it has no role in the appointment or removal of an acting mayor. Responding to a request from Chittagong metropolitan BNP unit's president demanding removal of the acting mayor, an election commissioner said the commission could not do anything about it. "This is not the task of the Election Commission," election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com Saturday night. BNP leader Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, who is acting as the chief election agent for Manzur Alam, made the demand in a letter to the EC on Saturday alleging that the acting mayor, Zahirul Alam Dobhash, was not neutral. Dobhash, the first panel mayor and councillor of ward 33, was made the acting mayor on Thursday, when the outgoing mayor, ABM Mohiuddin, quit his position before filing his nomination papers seeking to run for the mayor's office. Dobhash is also a ward councillor candidate. Khosru in his letter claimed that the ruling Awami League had appointed Dobhash, an Awami Leaguer, as the acting mayor, and demanded that someone neutral should be appointed, adding that, "BNP would not object if the government appoints someone from the administration." Khosru in the letter said, "We have a lack of confidence on the current Election Commission." "But we hope that (EC) will change the acting mayor." In response, Shakhawat said, "The local government has directives regarding the handing over of power after the city corporation mayor resigns. "It must be done in line with the Local Government (City Corporation) Law-2009." On appointing a neutral person, Shakhawat questioned, "Didn't any of them go through the law? Why is the question of removal or neutrality coming now? "Transfer of charge should take place in line with the law." he said. Local government ministry on May 19 directed CCC mayor ABM Mohiduddin Chowdhury to resign and hand over the charge to the senior most member of the mayor panel. The local government division gave its reply three days after Mohiuddin had written to it twice seeking its directive. The law stipulates that the councillors will select a three-member mayor panel with one from a reserved seat. The CCC mayor panel includes Firingibazar ward 2 councillor Zahirul Alam Dobhash, ward 5 (reserved) councillor Monwara Begum Moni and Jalalabad ward 2 councillor Mobassher Ahmed Hashemi. The law has the provision of handing over the charge in presence of the chief executive official of the city corporation. bdnews24.
