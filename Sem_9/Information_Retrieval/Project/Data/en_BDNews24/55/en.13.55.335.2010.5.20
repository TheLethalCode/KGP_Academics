 Brahmanbaria, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A dispute over a cow's eating habits led to a clash between two factions of villagers in Brahmanbaria on Thursday, leaving about 50 people injured. The altercation started when at 9am a cow owned by Shamsu Mia, a resident of Khathata, entered the paddy field of Abdur Rahim, a resident of Kottapara, and started eating. The local dispute quickly escalated and soon hundreds of people from both villages  one in Khathata upazila and the other in Shorail upazila - began fighting each other across the Dhaka-Sylhet highway, using local weapons. Local people said the two groups were brought together for the clash by an announcement over the microphone. Sadar Police Station officer in charge C Hamidul Islam, and Shorail Police Station officer in charge Subhash Chandra Saha told bdnews24.com that all vehicular movement was suspended on the highway for about an hour. On hearing about the incident, police from both police stations arrived at the spot and brought the situation under control at around 12pm, Islam said. Police fired 20 blank shots and lobbed a few teargas shells into the air to bring the situation under control, he added. By early afternoon, police had not arrested anyone, Islam said. However, the area remains tense and some riot police remain in the area to keep the peace. Police told bdnews24.com that the injured, who were taken to different hospitals and village clinics for medical attention, have not yet been identified. bdnews
