 Bagerhat, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The brother of a BDR soldier claimed that the body, recovered from Rayenda of Bagerhat on Monday, was of his brother who had been absconding after the BDR rebellion in Peelkhana on Feb 25-26 in 2009. The police on Monday evening recovered an unidentified body from the Balesshar River of Sharankhola upazila in Bagerhat. The legs, hands and eyes of the body were tied. A cement sack filled with mud was tied to the body attired in black trousers and striped navy blue shirt. Sharankhola police chief Md Nizam Uddin told bdnews24.com on Saturday that one Giasuddin had come to the police station on Friday and claimed that the body was of his brother Nazrul Islam Mallik. The police asked him to bring evidence to the police station as he did not have any proof. Anjuman Mafidul Islam has already buried the body as there were no claimants. Gias claimed the body as his brother's after seeing a photograph. When contacted, Gias told bdnews24.com that he had gone to Sharankhola seeing the news published in various dailies and identified the body looking at its photo. Gias said that Nazrul was a health assistant of Peelkhana BDR headquarters. He went into hiding following the rebellion and worked at the Madhumati Diagnostic Centre in Gopalganj's Kotalibari under a fake identity. Around 4000 BDR members faced trial for the February rebellion that left 74 people dead. Nazrul was one of the fugitive BDR soldiers. Nazrul's wife told journalists that her husband had been missing from Kotalipara since Mar 15. Nazrul was of Kandapasha village of Nalchiti upazila in Jhalokati. bdne
