 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)--Over one crore people carry potentially deadly hepatitis B or C virus in the country, health experts say. The figure was disclosed at a discussion marking 'World Hepatitis Day' at Shaheed Dr Milon Auditorium at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University on Wednesday. The Association for the Study of the Liver and Viral Hepatitis Foundation jointly hosted the discussion. This year's theme of the day is 'Am I number 12?' State minister for health Mujibar Rahman Fakir said, "One in every 12 people is afflicted with either hepatitis 'B' or 'C' in the world." "Two to four percent people of the country are infected with hepatitis B while 1-3 percent is attacked by hepatitis C," the junior minister said. He said there was no arrangement for diagnosing hepatitis B or C in the country. "The government has taken measures to administer preventive vaccine to children aged between 1 and 1.6 years. Around 92 percent children have been vaccinated," he said. Expressing the desire to manufacture the preventive vaccine in the country, he said, "Some pharmaceutical companies are working on that." "A conference will be held on June 12-14 in Singapore which delegates of our manufacturing companies will join to get the technology and other benefits," Fakir said. Bangladesh Medical Association and Bangladesh Gastroenterology Association president Dr Mahmud Hasan delivered Bumbarg Lecture, named after inventor of hepatitis virus American physician Baruch Blumberand introduced this year. Hasan said over one crore people are afflicted with hepatitis B or C. He said, "Hepatitis is a disease that affectsliver. Its virus spreads from the mother to the new born during birth, taking drug through injection or by sexual intercourse." General secretary of Association for the Study of the Liver Dr Mamun Al Mahtab said, "According to WHO, currently around 35 crore people are afflicted with hepatitis B and 17-20 crore with hepatitis C in the world." "Over one crore people in Bangladesh have the two virus," he said. People die of jaundice, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure due to the two viruses, Mahtab said. The programme was also attended, among others, by labour minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and BSMMU vice-chancellor Dr Pran Gopal Datta.
