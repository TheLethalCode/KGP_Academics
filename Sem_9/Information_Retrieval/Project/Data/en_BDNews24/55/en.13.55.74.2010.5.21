 MILAN, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Penpix of Inter Milan's squad for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in Madrid on Saturday: Goalkeepers: 12-Julio Cesar 03.09.1979. The Brazilian is the undisputed number one with one of the safest pairs of hands in the game. A great shotstopper, he can very occasionally be caught out by crosses. 1-Francesco Toldo 02.12.1971. A long Inter servant, he has been happy acting as deputy but has looked short of sharpness when called upon this season. Defenders: 4-Javier Zanetti 10.08.1973. The captain, at Inter since 1995, never stops running despite his 36 years and can play right back, left back or midfield. Never has a bad game and is likely to be left back on Saturday. 6-Lucio 08.05.1978. The former Bayern centre back has been a rock in his first season at Inter and is eagerly looking forward to tackling his ex-team mates. The Brazilian is fallible though and has a rush of blood about once every 10 games. 13-Maicon 26.07.1981. The rampaging right back has not been as effective as last term but the Brazilian still offers immense power going forward or at the back. 23-Marco Materazzi 19.8.1973. One of the few Italians in the squad, error-prone Materazzi is rarely used but wears his Inter colours on his chest. 25-Walter Samuel 23.03.1978. Nicknamed "the Wall", the Argentine's central defensive partnership with Lucio has been key to Inter's success this term and the former Real Madrid man heads back to the Bernabeu in fine fettle. 26-Cristian Chivu 26.10.1980. The Romanian fractured his skull in January and has been wearing a protective cap since returning to action in March but has yet to rediscover his best form. Midfielders: 5-Dejan Stankovic 11.09.1978. Not as key to Inter's charge as he was last season, the Serbian still offers 100 percent commitment in the tackle and a decent goal threat. 7-Ricardo Quaresma 26.09.1983. Barely used again this season but a useful substitute to pump in late crosses. 10-Wesley Sneijder 09.06.1984. Another former Real Madrid man who has performed superbly in his first season at Inter, linking midfield and attack sublimely and impressing with free kicks. 11-Sulley Muntari 27.08.1984. Struggled to win over the San Siro faithful but adds useful bite to midfield even if creativity is lacking. 17-McDonald Mariga 04.04.1987. Kenyan signed from Parma in January who has yet to get a real taste of first-team action. 19-Esteban Cambiasso 18.08.1980. The Argentine is the beating heart of Inter's midfield with his tackling, neat distribution and goal threat. Another man making a return to the Bernabeu. Strikers 9-Samuel Eto'o 10.03.1981. A solid if unspectacular first season at Inter. The Cameroon striker has shown his versatility by drifting to the wing when asked. 22-Diego Milito 12.06.1979. Scoring 22 goals in his first Serie A season for Inter is some feat. The Argentine can rightfully claim to be among the world's best "fox-in-the-box" forwards. 27-Goran Pandev 27.07.1983. A useful addition to Inter's squad in January, the Macedonian can play wide and picks up handy positions between the midfield and attack. 45-Mario Balotelli 12.08.1990. An archetypal teenage rebel, the Italian of Ghanaian descent has clashed repeatedly with coach and team -ates but has calmed down in recent w
