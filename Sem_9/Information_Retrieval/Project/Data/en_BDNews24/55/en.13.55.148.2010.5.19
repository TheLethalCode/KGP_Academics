 Sylhet, May 19 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, also a close ally of the government, has expressed concern over law and order. Also a close ally of the ruling government, the former military dictator said that murders had become routine affair, and law and order situation had deteriorated to a dangerous level. "The country has become unliveable." He expressed the concern at a seminar on the provincial government system in Sylhet on Wednesday afternoon. "Corruption, terrorism, extortion, tender-grabbing, militancy and other crimes have gone out of control." The former president suspected that the youths are being involved in different crimes as they have no employment opportunities. Following the initiatives for decentralisation and constitutional amendments taken at different times after the liberation, he made a proposal to implement a provincial government system. The Jatiya Party chairman said that the current central government system was not appropriate to run the country properly. Ershad said that he had talked to the prime minister Sheikh Hasina to implement provincial government system. He said that he would bring the proposal to the parliament if needed. Chaired by Atikur Rahman, president of the proposed Jalalabad province implementation coordination committee, the seminar was attended by ABM Ruhul Amin Hawladar, general secretary of Jatiya party, former minister Mostafa Jamal Haider, president of province implementation national committee, and Sunil Shuva Roy, general secretary of the committee. bdnews
