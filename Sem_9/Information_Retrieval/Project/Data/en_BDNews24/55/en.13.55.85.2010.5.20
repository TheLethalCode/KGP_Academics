 BANGKOK, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peace returned to Bangkok on Thursday after some of the worst rioting in modern Thai history erupted in the aftermath of military actino to disperse a fortified protest encampment in central Bangkok. Wednesday's rioting capped a nine-week standoff between authorities and protesters opposed to the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva who largely support ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatrawant and want immediate elections. The crisis broadly pits the rural poor and urban working class against what they call an "establishment elite" of big business, military brass and the educated middle class. Here are some scenarios on how the crisis may unfold. RESISTANCE DIES DOWN, ELECTION PLAN AGREED. The curfew in Bangkok and affected provinces, with the military patrolling the streets, cools passions. With the "red shirt" leadership in custody, the movement is shattered. Under international pressure to heal Thailand's wounds, Abhisit puts his "roadmap of reconciliation" back on the table. The red shirts and their allies, the Puea Thai party, agree to a November election. Thaksin endorses it, knowing that parties allied to him have won every election in the past decade. This is quite plausible. MARKET IMPACT: Stocks and the baht have mostly decoupled from the political chaos by now, after foreign investors sold off half the shares they bought this year. Stocks actually rose slightly on Wednesday, albeit on thin volume, even as the Stock Exchange was set afire. Peace would allow Thai stocks, now among the cheapest in Asia at 10.5 times 2010 earnings, to surge. Bond yields would fall and credit default swap spreads would narrow. Yields have been closely correlated to violence during the crisis as investors flee to safety. Spreads on Thailand's five-year CDS , used to insure against sovereign debt default, have risen steadily since the protests turned violent on April 10 -- significantly higher than the Asia ex-Japan index for that period. "The market is clearly pricing the political risks. But on its own, if you look at the economic fundamentals of Thailand, they're perfectly fine," said Joseph Tan, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Singapore. GUERRILLA WARFARE INTENSIFIES IN COUNTRYSIDE Red shirts shrug off their leader's plea to stop rioting [ID:nSGE64J0C5] and mobilise local insurrections, as on Wednesday when they set three townhalls ablaze. They attack banks, department stores and other symbols of wealth and power. Economic targets, such as airports and seaports, are also attacked. Blockades delay distribution and shipments. Some 3,000 tonnes of white sugar shipments were delayed on Tuesday because of anti-government protests near Bangkok's main port. Foreign investors, particularly just-in-time manufacturers, should start thinking about locating inventories offshore if the violence continues, said Steve Vickers, president of risk consultancy FTI-International. MARKET/ECONOMIC IMPACT The impact on growth would be severe. The protests have already decimated the tourism industry and hit domestic consumption, which accounts for more than half of GDP. Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij said the unrest had already cut growth by half a percentage point and it would be two points if the problem continued all year. A source at the state planning agency put the impact of the turmoil af $3 billion, or about one percentage point of gross domestic product. "What we need to see is how long it will take to regain the confidence of foreign tourists and investors," said the official, who declined to be identified. Tourism accounts for 6 percent of GDP and employs 15 percent of the workforce. This scenario is also quite plausible. ABHISIT IS DUMPED, CARETAKER GOVERNMENT INSTALLED The coming days could determine whether Abhisit is viewed as the man who restored law and order to Bangkok and began healing wounds, or as the hapless intellectual who failed to do the job. Analysts say the military wants to keep his government in power until it completes an annual reshuffle of top posts, as it involves power, prestige and control of army-linked firms. If the military-backed coalition thinks Abhisit needs to be abandoned, he will be dumped, but his roadmap to reconciliation might survive. This involves early elections and reforms to heal wounds. An acceptable figure would be named as a caretaker prime minister until fresh elections, not due until December 2011. It is unclear if Abhsit's offer of elections by year-end is still on the table. Much of the debate ahead would be about election rules and who would be eligible, with many politicians accused of various crimes. That could prove problematic. The longer polls are delayed, the less likely it is Thailand will get the reforms it needs to cure a widening income gap and economic disparities that underly political divisions. This is yet another plausible scenario. MARKET/ECONOMIC IMPACT Markets won't mind a short-term caretaker government as long as it keeps the peace. The economy would benefit if it stopped the economically debilitating protests, as in the first scenario. ABHISIT DUMPED, NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT INSTALLED Talks with civil society groups yield agreement to form a caretaker government comprised of figures from the current government, the opposition, and technocrats. This government would oversee elections to be held by the end of the year. While possible, this seems unlikely. The military wants nothing to hinder the reshuffle and a government with Thaksin supporters would be inconvenient. A national unity government might ensure fair election rules, but would almost certainly bring a pro-Thaksin government to power. MARKET/ECONOMIC IMPACT It would take time to form such a government and could delay the current 1.43 trillion baht ($44.2 billion) stimulus plan with its knock-on impact on growth and consumption. Foreign investors who have stuck it out might reconsider, given the political risks it could pose over policy. Even before the latest violence, the Board of Investment forecast foreign investment pledges this year could fall 15 percent. Stocks might climb, and bond yields could fall in the short term on the perception the current wave of violence has been controlled. But the potential for violence to resurface before or after a new election would keep many investors sidelined. GOVERNMENT CAN'T IMPOSE ORDER, ARMY LAUNCHES COUP Unrest spreads in the countryside. Abhisit's government is unable to maintain law and order in the capital, as a police force largely sympathetic to red shirts and loyal to Thaksin, a former policeman, fails to control the protests. Red shirts regroup in smaller numbers, but at more locations in the capital, hold rallies and block roads. Unrest spreads in the countryside. The public virtually pleads for the military to act. And so it does. For the 78th time since a constitutional monarchy was created in 1932, a coup (or an attempt) is launched in Thailand. Martial law is declared. The army sweeps through Bangkok and an uneasy order is restored. The military chiefs install a compliant government. This is unlikely. The military would much prefer to wield influence than to try to govern itself. It wants to keep this government in power until it completes the September reshuffle. MARKET IMPACT: A coup would cause stocks to plunge, and the baht to slide. Concerns about fiscal mismanagement, poor governance, and a public backlash -- even civil war -- would curtail long-term investment. Thailand's credit ratings would be downgraded. Bond yields would soar, and the CDS would probably set an all-time record for a basis-point jump. There could even be a contagion effect in Southeast Asian emerging mark
