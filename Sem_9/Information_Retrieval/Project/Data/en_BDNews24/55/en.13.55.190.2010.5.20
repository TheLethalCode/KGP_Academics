 HONG KONG, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong's leader on Thursday invited a democratic lawmaker to stage a rare television debate as pressure builds from Beijing to resolve a deadlock over political reforms aimed at realising universal suffrage. The surprise move by the Beijing-backed Hong Kong chief executive, Donald Tsang, comes just days after five pro-democracy lawmakers were re-elected in a by-election after resigning from the city's legislature in a radical bid to pressure China for deeper electoral reforms. The by-election was touted by democrats as a de facto "referendum" calling for the city's leader and entire legislature to be directly elected in 2012, but the turnout was a record low. With the thorny issue of constitutional reforms generating longstanding frictions between local democrats and Beijing since Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Tsang has been under growing pressure to find a solution. "This is now a time to narrow differences and to seek consensus," said the bowtie-wearing Tsang in a statement laying out his debate challenge to Audrey Eu, a member of the Civic Party who played a key role in the referendum movement. Late last year, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao referred pointedly to "deep-rooted contradictions" in Hong Kong. The one-hour television debate, touted for June 17, will be a one-off and will come before lawmakers vote on an key reform package that will lead to slightly more democratic elements to elections for the chief executive and legislators in 2012. The democrats have so far rejected the proposed package saying it lacks substance and fear Beijing will fudge its promise to allow a direct vote in 2017 at the earliest. "A one-hour debate in the midst of the World Cup may not be sufficient to focus public attention on a crucial ... issue which really is critical to Hong Kong's political development and democratic development," said Eu, who accepted Tsang's challenge. In recent weeks, momentum has also built for Beijing to re-establish formal talks with moderate democrats. The democrats have been treated with disdain by Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing, with local democrats helping fund and support the pro-democracy demonstrators. Many prominent democrats are still subject to longstanding travel bans to mainland Ch
