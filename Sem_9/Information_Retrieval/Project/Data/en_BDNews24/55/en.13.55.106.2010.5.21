 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned home in the early hours of Friday, ending a six-day visit to South Korea and Malaysia where she had held bilateral talks with top leaders. She flew back on Malaysian Airline flight from Kuala Lumpur at Shahjalal International Airport at 12:20am. The prime minister had left Dhaka for South Korean capital Seoul, on the first leg of her two-nation tour, on May 15. Deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury, LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam, textile and jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui, information minister Abul Kalam Azad, diplomats, and the chiefs of three services, among others, received her at the airport. According to diplomatic sources, Malaysian prime minister Mohamed Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak had assured Hasina that Malaysia would seriously consider the issue of legalising Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia. Some other long-standing issues between the two countries were also discussed during the meeting. In Seoul, Hasina attended inaugural ceremony of the 66th Session of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and held a meeting with the leaders of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI). She also held bilateral talks with Korean president Lee Myung-bak. Four deals were signed between Dhaka and Seoul on economic, energy and cultural cooperation.
