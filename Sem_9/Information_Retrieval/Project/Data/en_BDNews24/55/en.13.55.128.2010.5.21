It was formally inaugurated by deputy commissioner Abdul Mannan around 11am. The mill's president Joynal Abedin confirmed the change in name. More than a hundred years old, the mill was first set up by Mohini Mohan Chattarjee over 33 acres of land at the town's Milpara in 1908.

However, the mill was again shut down on Aug 15, 1990 due to mounting losses. The current government took initiatives to resume operations of the mill after coming to power.
