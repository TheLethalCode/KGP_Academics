<TEXT>
 Rangamati, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  Parbattya Chattagram Jana Shanghati Shamiti (PCJSS) has asked to stop the activities of the land commission alleging the autocratic of the commission chief. PCJSS made the demand in a statement on Wednesday. It reads that the commission chairman, retired justice Khademul Islam Chowdhury, will be responsible for any complication, confusion or stranding situation regarding resolution of land disputes. The statement, undersigned by PCJSS assistant information and publicity secretary Sajib Chakma, alleged that the chairman's activities were against the law, impractical and ill-motivated. Khademul had created new complications with the last dispute issue. His activities had raised questiones about the commission's activities, the statement added. PCJSS demands a meeting with the commission members. The Shamiti has expressed its concern over the commission sitting only once, on Jan 27 this year. The commission declared a land survey and asked applications on finalising the land disputes without conducting a meeting, which is against the Peace Accord, the statement added. PCJSS says that the commission chairman, without meeting the members, is organising meetings and processions frequently with the government officials and others from the three hill districts. bdne
