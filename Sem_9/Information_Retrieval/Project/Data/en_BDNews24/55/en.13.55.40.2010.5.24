<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 24 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque secured bail on Monday from a Chittagong court in a case accusing him of defaming the prime minister's son. BNP MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie was also granted bail in the case. Judicial magistrate M Ibrahim Mia gave the order after the two leaders appeared before the court and appealed for bail. Lawyer Dirghatam Barua, a supporter of the ruling Awami League, filed the case on Mar 25 against Farroque and Annie for allegedly defaming Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, by stating in parliament and elsewhere that Wazed was involved in illegal VoIP operations. Some 21 cases have so far been lodged against the opposition chief whip across the country. Farroque has secured bail from a number of other courts in defamation cases filed against him over the same allegations. Scores of Chittagong BNP leaders including the party's central vice chairman Abdullah Al Noman were present at the court premises on Monday.
