 JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African World Cup hopeful Andile Jali is being sent to see experts in America after tests discovered the midfielder has a heart condition. Jali, who is only 20 and made his international debut earlier this year, had a mild cardiovascular condition detected in routine tests of players in the 30-man preliminary World Cup squad, the South African Football Association (SAFA) said. Jali was tested twice after a routine assessment found a possible heart problem and a second medical opinion was sought. The second test, communicated to the association last Monday, confirmed the initial findings. "SAFA is heeding a doctor's recommendation that Jali travel to the University of Florida Gainsville Medical Centre in the United States as this facility has a track record of dealing with athletes in this area of medicine," an SAFA statement said. "It is envisaged that Jali's tests will be performed in time for him to be available for the finalisation of the squad." Jali will leave Johannesburg for the US on Saturday. South African coach Carlos Alberto Parreira intends on naming the final 23-man squad for the June 11-July 11 World Cup on Mo
