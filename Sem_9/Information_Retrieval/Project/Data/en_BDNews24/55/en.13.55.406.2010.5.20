 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday asked a national committee to chalk out programmes for celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore jointly with Bangladesh. In his opening remarks at the first meeting of India's National Committee for Commemoration of 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath; Singh recalled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January this year. "We agreed that the prime ministers of India and Bangladesh would oversee the joint celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore in 2011 in a manner befitting his vision and spirit. The Committee will have to consider how we could fulfill this commitment and how to associate Tagore's many followers in Bangladesh in the commemoration events," he said. Besides Singh, ruling Congress party president Sonia Gandhi, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, external affairs minister S M Krishna and culture minister Ambika Soni and other members of the committee were present in the meeting. Mukherjee said that the Indian government had decided "to lay special emphasis on joint Indo-Bangladesh celebrations". During a meeting in New Delhi in January, Hasina and Singh had recalled the shared legacy of the great poet, who had penned the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh. Singh on Thursday said that Tagore had travelled to the farthest corners of the globe and was remembered with reverence and affection in many countries. He emphasised on the need to pay special attention to the University of Tagore's dreams, the Viswa Bharati, in Shantiniketan. He referred to the suggestions of the high-level committee set up by Indian government for rejuvenation of the univarsity under the leadership of former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. "The Government of India has released funds for the implementation of the recommendations. But we should go further and I would like the Committee to use its knowledge and experience to see how we can revive this historic institution and restore it to its former glory," he said. On May 9, Indian Railways launched a special exhibition train called Sanskriti Express at Howrah Station in West Bengal. The exhibition train has coaches christened as Jeevan Smriti, Gitanjali, Muktadhara and Chitralekha. The Jiban Smriti provides a glimpse of Tagore's life through photographs, while his songs, poems and letters were put on display in Gitanjali. Muktadhara takes visitors on a journey through his novels, essays and plays. Chitralekha depicts his paintings, while the fifth coach depicts the last journey of Tagore. The Sanskriti Express is likely to travel through India before returning to Howrah before May 8 next year. The Indian railway minister Mamata Banerjee is believed to be keen to send the exhibition train to Dhaka too. Indian government is also contemplating to create a coveted award in honour of Gurudev Rabindranath and set up an Asian Research Centre to reaffirm the bonds with Asian countries that Tagore had created.
