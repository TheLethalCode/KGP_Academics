 DUBAI, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US-born militant cleric has urged Muslims to kill US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to step up attacks against the US military, according to a videotape released on Sunday. Anwar al-Awlaki, wanted dead or alive by US authorities, is a leading figure linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. He is believed to be on the run in the impoverished Gulf Arab state.

US officials said in April that President Barack Obama's administration had authorised operations to capture or kill Awlaki. Yemen has said it will not hand over Awlaki, whose family is well-known in Yemen, but instead put him on trial if he is arrested. Born in New Mexico, Awlaki led prayers at US mosques. He returned to Yemen in 2004 where he taught at a university before he was arrested and imprisoned in 2006 for suspected links to al Qaeda and involvement in attacks. He was released in late 2007. Western countries fear that al Qaeda's resurgent regional wing is exploiting instability in Yemen, which borders oil giant Saudi Arabia, to launch attacks in the region and bey
