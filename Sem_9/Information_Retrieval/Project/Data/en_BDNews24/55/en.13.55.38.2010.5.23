<TITLE> Submarine cable repair to slow down internet </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is set to experience problematic internet connection as repair work began on its fibre optic backbone on Sunday. Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd public relations officer Mir Mohammed Morshed told bdnews24.com: "The interruption has started after the arrival of a ship to repair the cable." "It will be fixed by May 31." Due to prior information about maintenance, users of BTCL and several other internet providers were better prepared to handle the problem. But clients of some internet service providers (ISPs) might face interruptions, Morshed said. The work is underway at a connection point of the trans-national SEA-ME-WE 4 submarine cable in the Indian Ocean near Sri Lanka. The optical fibre line connects Bangladesh to the information superhighway and serves as the backbone of international communication, while satellite services act as backup with limited bandwidth. During the repair, Bangladesh will conduct its international communication via Singapore. bdnews2
