 Gazipur, May 23 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated Ahsan Ullah Master Flyover in Tongi on Sunday afternoon. She unveiled the plaque at the west part of the flyover shortly before 4pm. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, the prime minister's adviser HT Imam and MPs AKM Mozammel Haque, Zahid Ahsan Russel and Meher Afroze Chumki were present during the inauguration. The construction of the flyover at Tongi's station road started on March 16 in 2006. The flyover has two 7.5-metre wide lanes. It also has two footpaths, each 0.6 metres wide. Gazipur roads and highways executive engineer Fakir Abdur Rab said on Saturday that the cost of building the 350-metre flyover, along with 200 metres of connecting roads on two sides, was Tk 237.8 million. Vehicles from Dhaka and northern Bengal will be able to reach Narshingdi, Bhairab, Sylhet and Kishoreganj in a shorter time using the flyover, reducing pressure on Dhaka and the Kanchpur Bridge, he said. Following the inauguration, the prime minister is expected to attend a public meeting at the local Telephone Shilpa Shangstha ground. bd
