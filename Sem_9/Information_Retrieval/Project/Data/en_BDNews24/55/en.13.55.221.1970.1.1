<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, May 24 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Jamaica's prime minister vowed tough action against a frenzy of gang violence in Kingston, imposing a state of emergency to curb armed supporters of an alleged druglord sought by the United States. Premier Bruce Golding said that criminals "will not be allowed to triumph", as gang members rampaged through the capital, clashing with police and burning a police station to the ground. At least one death was reported. Gunmen from various communities across the Caribbean nation of 2.8 million had joined with criminal elements, police said, in a bid to protect reputed gang leader Christopher "Dudus" Coke, who faces a US extradition request. "The criminal element who have placed the society under siege will not be allowed to triumph," Golding said late Sunday in an address to the nation. Golding said the state of emergency in Kingston "will be a turning point for us as a nation to confront the powers of evil that have penalized the society and earned us the unenviable label as one of the murder capitals of the world. "We must confront this criminal element with determination and unqualified resolve," he said. A police officer and a civilian were wounded by gunfire in street clashes and four police stations came under attack, police said. One police station was set ablaze after police abandoned it having run out of bullets, they added. People were urged to move out of the roughest neighbourhoods and sections of Kingston came under siege as armed men roamed the city, taking on policemen who attempted to clear roadblocks that were popping up at various points. At least one man has been reported dead after he was shot in a van in front of one of the police stations, Fletcher's Land, which came under sustained gunfire. A police officer was also shot in the hand while a patrol car, which was fired on to force its occupants to run for cover, was stolen. Police said gangs had stockpiled a large cache of weapons, including big-gauge rifles, all apparently to protect Coke and stop his extradition on drug and gun trafficking charges that could put him away for life. Coke, 42, is the reputed leader of the Shower Posse gang with branches all over the United States. He also heads the Tivoli Gardens community, which Prime Minister Golding represents in the Jamaican Parliament. The United States accuses Shower Posse members, under Coke's direction, of having sold marijuana and crack cocaine in New York City and other areas of the United States, funneling profits back to him. Amid the fury of Coke's supporters, the state of emergency was slapped on Kingston and St. Andrew after Golding held an emergency meeting of his cabinet earlier Sunday and will last for at least a month. "The threats that have emerged to the safety and security of our people will be repelled with strong and decisive action," Golding promised in his address. "Tonight, I appeal to all law-abiding citizens to remain calm and support these necessary measures," he said. "My government is determined that Jamaica must be a land of peace, order and security, without this we will never achieve the happiness and prosperity that we seek". Though Golding signed the extradition request for Coke, reversing an earlier decision, the petition is pending a final court decision before which Coke is required to attend a hearing. For local Kingston residents, Coke is more like a godfather. Thousands marched through the city Thursday chanting, "Leave Dudus alone, leave Dudus alone." "He is next to God," one demonstrator said. "Just like how Jesus died on the cross for us, we are willing to die for Dudus," said anoth
