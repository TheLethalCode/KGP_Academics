 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina says the 2007-8 military-backed interim government was run by Khaleda ZIa's hand-picked people and asks the opposition chief, "Why kick yourself now?" The prime minister was responding to the opposition chief's criticism of the caretakers at a rally at Gazipur after inaugurating a flyover on Sunday. She spoke at length addressing Khaleda's repeated and constant criticism of the two Ahmeds who led the two-year interim regimeFakhruddin Ahmed as the chief adviser and Moeen Uddin Ahmed as the army chief. Hasina elaborated how BNP chairperson Khaleda had installed Moeen as the army chief of staff superseding nine officers. The prime minister also mentioned that Khaleda had hand-picked World Bank employee Fakhruddin Ahmed, 'who had never lived in Bangladesh', as the Bangladesh Bank's governor. She said, "It was only to aid Khaleda Zia and her sons to siphon off money from Bangladesh." She criticised Khaleda for failing to mention the third Ahmed - Iajuddin Ahmed. As president during the two years of the state of emergency, he was known for his submissive role. Hasina said Khaleda had picked these men thinking they would serve her own evil designs. "You had picked them. You had installed them. They were your people." But since the interim government had not 'cooperated' with the BNP in securing the national elections, Hasina said, "What good will it do to kick yourself now?" The prime minister, while citing an example of Khaleda's 'lies', said, "[Khaleda] has four to five birthdays. She wondered whether Khaleda had been born four or five times then. "From head to toe, she is full of lies." Regarding the war crimes trial, and alluding to the general strike and anti-government campaign called by Khaleda, she said, "Movements cannot save the war criminals." "The trial of war criminals is a popular demand." They will be tried as well as those who committed crimes against humanity during the BNP-led government, she added. "Criminals, whoever they are, will be put on trial," she said, stressing that the Awami League believed in that philosophy. Hasina also claimed that people's standard of living had developed during the AL's previous term between 1996 and 2001. She claimed that the price of rice was reduced to Tk 18 per kg after her government came to power. "But the price was gradually increased in farmers' interest." Hasina claimed that the four-party alliance government, led by the BNP, had aided and abetted militancy. On the spread of drug abuse, Hasina once again pointed her finger at Khaleda. "Ask the opposition leader and her family members if you want to know who brought drugs into the country," she told the rally of thousands. The prime minister also asked the guardians, administration, party leaders and the law-enforcing agencies to be strict and stop drug abuse. Regarding Khaleda's criticism of the unsolicited power deals, also called quick rentals, aiming to add 1000MW-1200MW, she said, "She doesn't want to let the people have a better life." "People want electricity, but she urges government officials not to sign the files." Hasina also said that under a government project, unemployed youths would be able to get loans of up to Tk 50,000 without any collateral. The project was underway, she added. Citing the countrywide bomb attack of Aug 17, 2005, she said, "No one can set off bombs at five hundred places simultaneously without government backing." She also declared the construction of an elevated expressway between Gazipur and Narayanganj. As part of building a technology-based country, she said computers and laptops would be distributed at unions, upazilas and districts. bdnews24.co
