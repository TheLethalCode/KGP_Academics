 Sirajganj, May 21 (bdnews24.com)-- Continued erosion would threaten the guide embankment of Bangabandhu bridge on the Jamuna river and the site for the proposed industrial park nearby, a top Water Development Board official says. According to WDB director general Md Habibur Rahman, a permanent protection arrangement needs to be ensured seven kilometres upstream from the bridge to stop the erosion. He was talking to reporters on Friday after visiting the repairs of Sirajganj town protection embankment. Rahman said the erosion has already reached Gonapara under the Sadar Upazila. He said a technical team recently visited the erosion area and suggested immediate protection arrangement.
