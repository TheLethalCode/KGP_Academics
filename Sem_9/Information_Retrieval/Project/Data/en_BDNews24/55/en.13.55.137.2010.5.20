 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)-- Government agencies are not obtaining environmental certificates from the department of environment before constructing buildings, a parliamentary watchdog has observed. To bring this non-compliance to an end, the parliamentary standing committee on environment and forest ministry has proposed holding a joint meeting with the parliamentary watchdog on housing and public works ministry. "The committee has observed that the government agencies are not obtaining environmental clearance certificates from the department of environment before building construction," Abdul Momin Talukder, chairman of the standing committee on environment, told reporters Thursday after its meeting at the parliament building. Talukder, an MP from the main opposition BNP, said the private builders were complying with the rule, so there was no reason why the government agencies shuld not do the same. The parliamentary body discussed the issue following a series of media reports that the government agencies were cutting thousands of trees and filling up marshy land to build offices. Besides, it observed that the tiny country with over 160 million people has been experiencing huge conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural ones, posing a serious threat to Bangladesh's food security. The watchdog also discussed the administration of the multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. "We have formed a five-member sub-committee, headed by ruling party MP Ekabbar Hossain, for monitoring the multi-donor trust fund," said the chairman. In September 2008, Bangladesh and the UK formed the multi-donor trust fund while adopting the national climate change strategy and action plan. The fund was created in London with Great Britain contributing 75 million pounds for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. Denmark, the Netherlands and other countries promised to contribute to the fund, but no money has come yet. The London conference authorised the World Bank to manage the funds. But the Awami League government decided it should manage the fund and not the World Bank. In an effort to resolve the dispute, it has now been decided that the Bank will only provide technical assistance to the multi-donor fund and it will be managed by the government.
