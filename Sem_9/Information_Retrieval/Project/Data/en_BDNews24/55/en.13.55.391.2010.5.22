 Chittagong, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  A senior BNP leader from Chittagong has demanded removal of the city's acting mayor. Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, who is acting as the chief election agent for Manzur Alam, on Saturday issued a letter to the returning officer of the June 17 city corporation polls demanding the mayor's removal. Khosru said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon, "The appointment was made to influence the election." The first panel mayor and councillor of ward 33, Zahirul Alam Dobhash, was made the acting mayor on Thursday, when the outgoing mayor, ABM Mohiuddin, quit his position before filing his nomination papers. Dobhash is also a ward councillor candidate. Khosru in his letter claimed that the ruling Awami League had appointed Dobhash, who is their party man. He urged that a neutral person be selected for the position. The BNP leader demanded removal of Dobhash terming the appointment illegal, one that would impede fair election. Replying to a query from the reporters, Khosru said, "We have a lack of confidence over the current Election Commission." "But we hope that (EC) will change the acting mayor." The commission lost its standing during the general election and Bhola-3 by polls, Khosru said. The CCC election was the one opportunity to prove its neutrality, he added. Khosru suggested that someone neutral and not contesting the polls could be appointed. "BNP would not object if the government appoints someone from the administration," he added. bdnew
