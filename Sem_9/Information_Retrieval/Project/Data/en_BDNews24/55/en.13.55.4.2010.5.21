<TEXT>
 BANDUNG, Indonesia, May 21(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For a clue as to who might be running Indonesia after the next election, look to the West Java city of Bandung. Thousands of cadres from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Democrat Party, the biggest party in parliament, will descend on Bandung from Friday until Sunday to vote for a new party leader. The Democrat Party served as Yudhoyono's election vehicle when he ran for president in 2004, and he remains its figurehead. Analysts say the winner of the leadership contest will be in a good position to run as president or vice president in the 2014 election, when Yudhoyono completes his second -- and, under Indonesian law, final -- term. "This will give us an eye on who might emerge as a future leader for the party and therefore potentially the country," said Kevin Evans, a Jakarta-based analyst with election monitoring group Pemilu Asia. "It's also an important test of whether this organisation is heading toward being a real political party and therefore has a future beyond its current patron, Yudhoyono, or whether it will continue to be a fan club that will wither away from the next election," he said. The two contenders vying for party leadership are both likely to continue Yudhoyono's economic platform but are split on whether or not it should evolve beyond Yudhoyono. In one corner is Andi Mallarangeng, 47, the media-friendly and moustachioed former presidential spokesman and current youth and sports minister, who wants to keep Yudhoyono as the central party figure. "Some people say to modernise the Democrat Party we need to separate SBY and the party," he told reporters recently, referring to the president by his initials. "My position is totally different. To modernise the party, we have to institutionalise the ideas of the founder to be the foundation of the party." In the rival camp is Anas Urbaningrum, 41, a bespectacled party number-cruncher, who wants to reshape the party as a cadre-based organisation with strong branches all over Indonesia. "We need not only a platform but also a concrete action plan for how to achieve it," he told Reuters in a recent interview, citing an inefficient civil service as Indonesia's most pressing problem. Both candidates have denied having presidential ambitions, which is not surprising as such early declarations would be seen as terribly ambitious in a country where pushiness is frowned on. "Anas has better support at the grassroots level and, from what I can see, will probably be the winner," in the party leadership vote on Sunday, Evans said. As a native of Sulawesi, Mallarangeng may struggle to appeal to voters in the main island of Java, which tends to determine election outcomes. Since both candidates are relatively young, they may be angling for the vice presidency in 2014 with an eye to the top job five years later, Evans said. In that case, they may team up with a presidential candidate from another party such as Golkar. Certainly some analysts have wondered whether Yudhoyono is particularly keen to smooth over troubled relations with Golkar leader Aburizal Bakrie, given that Golkar is the second-largest party in parliament and a member of Yudhoyono's coalition. Bakrie, a wealthy businessman with interests in coal mining, property and telecoms, also harbours presidential ambitions. But others see Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the former finance minister and reformer who has clashed repeatedly with old guard politicians including Bakrie, as a possible candidate for 2014. "There is a groundswell of support among young people and professionals" for Indrawati, said political commentator Wimar Witoelar, adding that at this stage, the field is wide o
