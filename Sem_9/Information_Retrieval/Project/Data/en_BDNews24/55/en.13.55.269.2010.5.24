<TEXT>
 Sylhet, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  A transport strike in Sylhet paralysed the district's communications on Monday. Sylhet District Road Transport Labour Union called a day-long strike pressing for their demand to arrest the murderers who rented a microbus from Sylhet and killed its driver and an assistant in Gazipur on April 26. No inter-city and long distance buses ran from the district city from Monday morning leaving many passengers stranded. The transport union president Selim Ahmed Falik told journalists that they had gone to the district administration to urge the arrest of the murderers and recovery of the microbus. The transport union then called the strike since there were no steps in that direction. Human haulers, trucks and CNG auto-rickshaws except buses plied the city roads during the strike. bdnew
