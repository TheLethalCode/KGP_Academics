<TITLE> Iran outlines nuclear fuel swap deal to UN watchdog </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran outlined to the UN nuclear watchdog on Monday a deal to give up some of its enriched uranium, calling it major progress towards defusing international tensions over its atomic aspirations. But Western powers see the deal, reflecting one Iran backed out of six months ago, as overtaken by events including escalating enrichment by Tehran and, along with Russia and China, have drafted broader sanctions against the Islamic state. Iran has threatened to ditch the plan if it gets hit with a fourth UN sanctions resolution, envisaged for adoption next month, suggesting Tehran's gesture may be too little, too late. The proposal to swap low-enriched uranium (LEU) for fuel to run an Iranian medical research reactor, aimed at allaying fears Iran is trying to amass fissile material for nuclear weapons, was forged last week by Tehran with Turkey and Brazil. A letter signed by Iranian nuclear programme chief Ali Akbar Salehi was handed over to International Atomic Energy Agency director-general Yukiya Amano at a 45-minute meeting in Vienna, an Iranian diplomat told reporters. He gave no details. Iran's Arabic-language al-Alam state television quoted Salehi's letter as saying the deal was "a major step forward" towards defusing tensions over its nuclear energy programme. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said the letter "will be the beginning of more detailed negotiations on the fuel swap through the signing of a written agreement". "We expect that the agency will let the Vienna Group know the contents of this letter and reflect a positive response of the Vienna Group to us," the letter said, according to Fars. The Vienna Group comprises Iran, Russia, France and the United States -- parties to the original fuel swap pact brokered by Amano's predecessor Mohamed ElBaradei last October but which stumbled on subsequent Iranian demands for sweeping amendments. As in October, Iran has agreed to transfer 1,200 kg (2,646 lb) of LEU -- enough for an atom bomb if enriched to high purity -- abroad in return for special fuel rods to replenish the stocks of its medical isotope reactor. TURKEY AS MIDDLEMAN IN FUEL SWAP But this time, Iran's LEU would be kept in a third country -- Turkey -- under IAEA supervision, still officially Iranian property, until Tehran received the fuel rods. Previously the LEU was to be sent to Russia and France for processing, with the fuel rods provided to Iran around a year later. World powers voiced doubt about the value of the new offer since 1,200 kg no longer represents the bulk of a stockpile that has grown significantly since then. That means Iran could still be left with enough for a nuclear warhead. Iran has also started refining uranium to a higher level, a move diplomats have said would pre-empt any fuel swap accord. Iran's envoy to the IAEA made clear this deal would not restrict uranium enrichment in Iran in any way. "This is not the issue," Ali Asghar Soltanieh told Reuters. "We expect (this offer) to be realized as soon as possible," he said in a message to France, Russia and the United States. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Tehran had accepted the swap to show good faith, and reiterated that Iran sought only peaceful uses for nuclear energy. "Iran accepted the conditions in order to create an atmosphere based on trust and cooperation," Mehmanparast told a news conference during a visit to Istanbul. "A possible agreement with the Vienna group ... will provide a peaceful and constructive solution for the whole world." But the five world powers who are permanent members of the UN Security Council have brushed off Iran's gesture, agreeing a draft resolution on a new set of sanctions against Iran that Washington handed to the Security Council last week. The new, extended sanctions would target Iranian banks and call for inspection of vessels suspected of carrying cargo related to Iran's nuclear or missile programmes. Turkey and Brazil -- both currently non-permanent members of the Security Council -- and Iran have urged a halt to talk of further sanctions because of the deal. But Western powers see it now as just Iranian stalling to derail more biting sanctions. Iran has been under sanctions since 2006 over its refusal to suspend enrichment -- technology with civilian or military applications -- and open up entirely to IAEA investigati
