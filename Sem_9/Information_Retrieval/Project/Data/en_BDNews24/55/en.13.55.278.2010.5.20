 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)BNP chief Khaleda Zia has called for a dawn-to-dusk general strike on June 27 to protest what she calls Awami League misrule. This will be the first countrywide hartal during the tenure of the current government since January 2009. The BNP chairperson made the call on Wednesday at a rally in Dhaka to protest the utilities crisis, tender-grabbing, extortion and demand dissolution of the Election Commission and cancellation of treaties with India. She also announced a mass sit-in at the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh on June 9 protesting 'government interference into the judicial system'. The opposition chief alleged that the government has made the parliament ineffective. Clearly hinting that she thought it was time for the government to quit, Khaleda said, "An effective parliament can only come through a general election dissolving the present one." She criticised the salary hike of the prime minister, president and ministers, saying that the people were suffering because of high prices of essential commodities. "Salaries of the ministers and MPs were increased as essentials prices are going up." "I would not have any objection if people could have three square meals a day." Khaleda claimed that the ninth general election under the military-backed caretaker government was not free and fair. She said, "We participated in the election to remove an 'illegal' government which had taken power under the stewardship of the army." "But we never had any entente with illegal governments, not even with that of (H M) Ershad." Without mentioning any name but clearly indicating Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, Khaleda said, "One had promised ratification of the emergency government before going abroad." Thus insinuating that Hasina had entered into an illicit alliance with the interim regime, Khaleda said, "She knew that she would come to power." The Election Commission, assisted by the caretaker government, tried to break the BNP up, she said. "(The Commission) tried to make someone else chairperson of the BNP. They had also selected a secretary general." But they failed because of BNP leaders and supporters, she added. She also said her sonsTarique Rahman and Arafat Rahmanwere sent to jail to restrain them from waging a movement. "Tarique was well before going to jail, but his spine was broken because of brutal torture," she claimed. Khaleda blamed the incumbent government for the nagging power crisis and said, "They did not do much to develop the sector in the last 16 months." "They created the crisis only to be able to award power projects without floating tenders." She asked the government officials for not signing or approving those projects. "These projects will be investigated when BNP returns to power and those who are guilty will be punished," she warned. The former prime minister claimed that 1,500 megawatts (MW) were added during her five-year term. "But the present government could not generate even 1 megawatt." According to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), plants with a capacity of 1346.45MW came into operation during BNP's tenure, when the public sector added 667MW and the private operators added 679.45MW. And 571MW has already been added to the national grid since Jan 2009. Citing the people's sufferings, Khaleda mentioned deteriorating law and order, prices of essentials, gas, water and power crises, torture of journalists, harassment on women, and nepotism were going out of hand. "They cannot control their party cadres." She said that everyone in the government, from the number one at the top to the bottom, seems to want to have it all. "Whereas the people of the country have nothing." She claimed that people were in peace during her regime. Khaleda also criticised Hasina's travels abroad. "She is visiting other countries frequently despite the country's miserable situation. What has she brought back?" "Our prime minister can only give, but cannot bring anything for the country," the opposition leader said alluding to Hasina's India visit. She reiterated her stance against allowing transit facilities to the neighbouring country and letting it use Chittagong and Mongla ports. Khaleda alleged that the ruling party members were grabbing lands of minority Hindu and Christian communities. Regarding the government's interference in the judiciary, she said, "People are not getting justice these days due to the government's interference. "It will not bring any good in future." She gave an example: "Being a ruling party member, Mokbul Hossain was granted bail after two days from hospital." "On the other hand, the wife of Mirza Abbas was not freed even after getting bail and having a one-month sentence." Khaleda accused that the attorney general had barred the High Court bail. bdne
