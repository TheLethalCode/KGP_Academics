 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The reappointment of 85 Election Commission officers, who three days ago were reinstated to their job having been stripped of their jobs three years earlier, was stayed by the High Court on Thursday. The reinstated upazila election officers had joined their posts on May 17 after an appeals tribunal on April 12 this year had ruled in their favour. The stay order will remain in effect for one month. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain also ordered the secretaries to the establishment and law ministries, the Election Commission and the chairman of Bangladesh Public Service Commission to explain within two weeks why their reinstatement should not be declared illegal. The court order followed a petition filed by Matiur Rahman Hawladar of Bakerganj, Barisal which argued that their appointments were made under political consideration and that their reinstatement would compromise the neutrality of the commission. In Sept 2005, the Public Service Commission had temporarily appointed 327 people as upazilla election officers. Reports published in several newspapers at the time said that those appointments were directed by the Hawa Bhaban, an office which was said to be run by Tarique Rahman and widely believed to be the power centre of the then BNP government. The caretaker government in 2007 conducted an examination to re-consider their appointments. The 85 in question failed the exams and were not made permanent. bdnews24.
