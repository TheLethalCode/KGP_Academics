 KABUL, May 20 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Afghan and NATO rescuers have located the tail of a passenger plane that crashed in mountains near Kabul with 43 people on board, including three Britons and an American, an official said Thursday. "The international force brought us photographs of the tail of the plane. It was found in the Shakar Dara mountains," Nangyalai Qalatwal, a transport ministry spokesman said. The area is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Kabul. "We have found the tail with the logo of Pamir (Airways) on it. It was found on the side of the mountain," he said.

The aircraft disappeared from radio contact 37 minutes after taking off on a return journey to the capital -- normally around an hour's flight -- on Monday morning. Rescuers originally believed the plane had come down on the northern side of Salang, in Khinjan Baghlan province, and grief-stricken relatives of passengers have been gathering in the area waiting for news. NATO's International Security Assistance Force, deployed in Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, dispatched a plane and two helicopters to the area.

The British embassy said three Britons were on the plane and the US State Department said there was one Ameri
