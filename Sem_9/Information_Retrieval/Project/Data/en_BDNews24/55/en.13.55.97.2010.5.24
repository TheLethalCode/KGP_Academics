 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The police on Sunday night arrested an Indian national with 480 starred tortoises, a rare species, from Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. The airport police arrested the Malaysia-bound passenger from a Malaysian Airlines counter at the airport's departure lounge around 11pm. Airport detective Md Mostafa Kamal handed over the tortoises, two-four inches in length, to forest department official Md Fazlul Haque on Monday morning. Chief conservator of forests Tapan Kumar Dey told bdnews24.com the passenger, Pir Mohammad, 42, had been smuggling the tortoises to Malaysia. Dey said these tortoises were popular across the world for keeping them in aquariums. The seized tortoises will be set free at the Bangabandhu Safari Park in Cox's Bazar on Tuesday. The starred tortoises have a maximum length of about 11 inches and weigh up to 2kgs. These tortoises are called starred tortoises as they have yellow star-like shapes on the back. The tortoises are generally found in the coastal areas of India's Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They have become extinct from the coastal areas of Bangladesh a long time ago. The forests department said the police also seized 1,600 starred baby tortoises from Rajshahi's Boalia in 2006. These baby tortoises were set free at the Dulhazra (currently Bangabandhu) Safari Park and almost half of them are still alive. bdne
