 Rajshahi, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Within a week of interns going on strike at Faridpur, Rajshahi Medical College Hospital interns called an indefinite strike from Sunday midnight for the same reasons. The strike was called after a patient's attendant assaulted a doctor, Shah Alam Siddique, also the president of the intern doctors association. Siddique was on duty at ward eight and all the on duty interns took out a procession in protest that night. The agitated interns also assaulted a patient's attendant named Rubel during their demonstrations. Their four-point demands, including withdrawal of the institution's director, deployment of additional police to ensure safety and a proper probe and trial of the incident were called for in a meeting around midnight. The attendant who assaulted the doctor was detained by the police after the interns called the strike. In a press conference around Monday noon at the doctors' club of the hospital, the interns vowed to continue their work stoppage until their demands were met. Shah Alam Siddique, the assaulted intern and association president of their association, said that quarrel over poor treatment were common. He also alleged that the hospital's director was asked to take necessary steps. However, he did not do so. The hospital's director, Brigadier Abdul Latif, was not available for comments as he was on leave. Acting director Dr Daim Uddin told bdnews24.com that steps to meet the interns' demands were being taken through discussion with the college professors. "Already extra police have been deployed. However, removal of the director is not our matter." He said that the hospital's services were running as usual and that the staff members at different wards were asked to carry on with their duties. The acting director said that they were preparing for discussion with the interns about ending the strike. bdnews24.
