 Munshiganj, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP is enforcing a dawn-to-dusk general strike in Munshiganj on Sunday, though businesses and offices are operating as usual. No clashes have been reported in the district in the morning. Bus communication with Dhaka remained stopped and no traffic except rickshaws were seen on the roads. Launch operations, however, were normal. The district BNP called the strike on Friday, a day after the recovery of a body from the Buriganga River which the party claimed was of a Juba Dal leader. Local BNP leaders and activists took out a procession at 9am, led by district BNP president Abdul Hai. Pro-strike pickets were not seen inside the town but took positions in Muktarpur, outside the town, and stopped bus services on the Munshiganj-Dhaka highway. Munshiganj superintendent of police M Shafiqul Islam said traffic movement is stable on all the roads, including Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Maoa highways. Additional police have been deployed at the important places of the district town.
