 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  President of the ruling party's student wing, Chhatra League, has been assaulted. On Thursday, BCL Mymensingh unit's president candidate Akhtaruzzaman Khan Akhter and central president Mahmud Hassan Ripon sat in a meeting at a Dhanmondi restaurant to settle the unresolved district committee. But at one stage, they got into an altercation and Ripon was assaulted physically by the men accompanying Akhter. Akhter told bdnews24.com: "Ripon assaulted me first. My people reacted later." Several sources of the BCL said the district council held on Apr 13 ended without formation of a committee, which was later declared on Wednesday. Being ignored in the committee, Akhter came to Dhaka for explanation from the organisation's chief. Akhter further said: "We were eight candidates in the district, but six of them were disqualified for having fake certificates. The other person, Tipu Sultan, agreed to accept me as the president in the council. So I was supposed to be the president without contesting." "But Ripon declared the committee naming another person as president. He betrayed me." When contacted, the central president did not receive the phone call. Ripon has been assaulted several times by the BCL leaders and activists previously. b
