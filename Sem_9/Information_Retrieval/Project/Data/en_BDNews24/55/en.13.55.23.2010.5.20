<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com) -- A parliamentary watchdog has backed the education minister over the prime minister's advisor, to finalise the list of educational institutions for the monthly payment order, popularly known as MPO. The parliamentary standing committee on education ministry at its meeting on Thursday recommended selecting the educational bodies for MPOs in seven days before the current fiscal year ends on June 30. Rashed Khan Menon, the committee chairman, told reporters that education minister Nurul Islam Nahid had admitted that there were some problems while preparing the list of the institutions for the MPO. "This is our (standing committee's) unanimous position that the ministry will finalise the educational bodies for MPO," Menon told journalists after the meeting at parliament building. "We have full trust in the minister in this respect," he said. The education ministry last week prepared a list of schools, colleges and madrasas which would receive the MPO  with the government paying 100 percent of the teachers salaries But MPs raised allegations that the ministry officials resorted to irregularities in selecting the educational bodies. There are allegations that the ruling party leaders and MPs obtain money from the private educational bodies in their constituencies promising to secure MPOs for their institutions. It is thought that the MPs raised concerns only when they found that their educational institutions were not in the list. "There were some irregularities in the MPO process and the minister himself has admitted this at the meeting," said Menon. "The minister has told us that he will investigate the matter," he said. The problems with the MPO selection was caused as the ministry used the computer automated generation system for selecting the institutions, the chairman quoted the education minister as saying. "I will not speak on this issue right now. The chairman will talk," education minister Nurul Islam Nahid told bdnews24.com Thursday after the meeting. Following the MPs allegations, prime minister Sheikh Hasina tasked her education advisor Alauddin Ahmed for reviewing the list and preparing a fresh list incorporating institutions recommended by the MPs. Education minister sent the list and necessary papers to the advisor for reviewing the same. Media reports suggest that the minister had some disagreements over the MPO selection. "We have made strong recommendation that the list for MPO-receiving institutes should be finalised in seven days. Otherwise, the finance ministry will take Tk 122.35 crore back after the expiry of the current fiscal (on June 30)," said Menon. He said any failure in this regard would leave some 13,000 institutions with uncertainty. Menon also blamed the finance ministry for blocking a smooth MPO selection process. "The finance ministry has instructed the education ministry to select up to 1000 educational institutions for MPO this fiscal. Again, it refused to include the third teachers (known as demonstrators in colleges) for the MPO," he said. "On the other hand, the national university will not include any degree college without having third teachers," said the chairman. Menon said the finance ministry had also proposed forming an inter-ministerial committee for the MPO. "Then what will the education ministry do," he aske
