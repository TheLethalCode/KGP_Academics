<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Law-enforcement agencies are still at loggerheads over who actually killed sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy last month as RAB and police made two separate arrests in connection with the murder. Both Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police's Detective Branch (DB) claim to have arrested the 'actual' murderers of Bangshal police station's sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy. He was shot dead on Apr 20, when he stopped on his way home to question three suspected miscreants on the road. Police arrested Haider and Zakir on Apr 23 and Apr 28 respectively, claiming them to be Gautam's killers. However, RAB also arrested two men with same names on Apr 25 and claimed them as the killers. Police headquarters formed a five-member committee led by CID chief Shah Zamanraj to settle the confusion. The committee is yet to submit its report. However, police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque, on Friday told a press conference that the duo arrested by RAB are not the actual killers, quoting the two as saying in the remand that they confessed to RAB "out of fear". He also said that the police have no dispute with RAB over the matter and that RAB was cooperating in the investigations at the primary stages of the probe into the killing. However, RAB's legal and media wing's director M Sohail contradicted his claim. Sohail told bdnews24.com, "There is a dispute over the matter. A probe committee has been formed to settle the issue. Holding a press conference before the committee report's publication is not professionalism and illogical." In his reference to the committee, the police commissioner said, "We have only portrayed the truth that we have discovered." Police's story During Friday's press conference, police commissioner Haque said that Zakir (aka Kailya Zakir), Zaman Mollik, and Ahmed Haider Hadi were present during the killing. Police has already arrested four men including these three. The other arrested man is Abdur Rouf Bhuiyan Sohel, who, though not involved in the killing, used to lend his car to the three detained men, the police official said. Quoting Mollick's statement, he also said that the killing was not a planned incident as they shot the officer suspecting him of being the member of a rival group. On Apr 23, the police arrested Ahmed Ali Haider from Sutrapur's Bhajahari street in this connection. Later on Apr 28, DB officials arrested Zakir Hossain (aka Kailya Zakir). What RAB says However, on Apr 25, RAB officials arrested two, Zakir Hossain alias Kailya Zakir, 25, and Ali Haider from the city's Jatrabari and Lalmohan Saha street areas. The two men, who were brought before journalists at a RAB press conference at its headquarters at Kurmitola on Apr 25, each blamed the other for the killing. Zakir told reporters: "Haider called me out that night asking for work. As we came on the street at Dholaikhal, Gautam Roy intercepted us and frisked our friend Manik. When he (Gautam) attempted to search me, Zakir shot him. Later, I fled to Comilla." On the other hand, Haider said: "Zakir came to my house and told me to go with him. He was accompanied by Manik. When we came to Lalmohan Saha Street, Goutam searched us. At that point Zakir shot him. And we all fled the scene." However, night guard Mona, 60, witness to Gautam's murder, who was present at the RAB press conference, identified Zakir as the killer. "Kailya Zakir shot Gautam. He shot three rounds of bullet... And Haider fled the scene," he said. But, the night guard said, "Gautam sir intercepted Haider and Manik as soon as they came on the street. He started frisking the two. Then Zakir came out and shot him." Mona said he had heard that Shamim, who was accompanying Gautam at the time of incident, was shot at, but he did not see him being shot. Haider told journalists that Zakir had a meeting with Shamim four days before the incident and he gave Shamim Tk 10,000. But Haider did not say anything about what was said at the meeting. A senior RAB official said the killer had meetings with Shamim on Apr 15 and 17. RAB advised police to arrest Gautam's friends Shamim and Azam, who also accompanied the police officer when he was shot
