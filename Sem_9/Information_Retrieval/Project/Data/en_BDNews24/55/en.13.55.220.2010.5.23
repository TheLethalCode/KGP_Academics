<TITLE> 'MPs must submit wealth statement' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has recommended that the government make it mandatory for MPs and other elected representatives to their wealth and income statement from the next fiscal year. It also suggested that the ministry enact a law authorising the National Board of Revenue to confiscate wealth if it finds any anomalies in their tax return statements. The parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry at Sunday's meeting requested the ministry to increase its tax revenues. "We have recommended to the finance ministry that it makes it mandatory for all MPs, mayors and commissioners of all city corporations and [municipalities] and upazila chairmen to submit their income tax returns from the next budget," A H M Mustafa Kamal, the committee chairman, said. The chairman told reporters at the parliament building that submitting a tax return did not mean that they must pay tax. The standing committee made the recommendation three days after the leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia alleged that the ruling Awami League had ditched its election pledge of making ministers and MPs submit wealth statements. On tax receipts, Mustafa Kamal said the government should be able to collect at least Tk 1,20,000 crore in tax instead of Tk 61,000 crore, the current target. With its GDP currently at Tk 750,000 crore, the tax-GDP ratio in Bangladesh is one of the lowest in the world and it is totally unacceptable, he said. "We have also recommended that the government should widen the tax net to cover more potential tax payers," said the chairman. "But", he said, "the government should not increase the burden of tax on the people". The chairman said many people who should be paying tax do not pay taxes, while many honest people regularly pay them. "This creates an imbalance in society and makes honest tax payers feel frustrated," he said. The parliamentary committee stressed the need to strengthen the NBR and recommended ways for giving the board more power in tax collection-including forming an 'enforcement wing' at the NBR. The proposed body, according to the committee, would have the authority to ask for statements on all moveable and immovable properties from those people it considered to be capable of paying taxes. "If the enforcement wing considers that some people have concealed wealth information, it should have the power to confiscate the additional wealth," said Kamal, a businessman-turned-politician. He, however, said the government must pass a law in parliament to create the wing. UNDISCLOSED MONEY The parliamentary panel chief said he was against the policy of giving people an opportunity to 'whiten' undisclosed money. "But the committee thinks the government should be allowed to do it if they invest the money in a productive sector," said Kamal. He said that in such a case investors must give a guarantee to continue the enterprise for at least five years. "But the committee would not have any objection if the ministry does not implement this particular recommendation on whitening undisclosed money," said the chairman. Ahead of the 2010-11 budget, the standing committee has had six meetings with different groups of professionals and has now finalised its recommendations for the finance minister. b
