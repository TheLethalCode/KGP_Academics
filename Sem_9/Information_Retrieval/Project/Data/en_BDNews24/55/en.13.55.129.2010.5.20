 MILAN, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Italy will have to pull off an even bigger surprise than four years ago if the Azzurri are to successfully defend their World Cup title in South Africa. Marcello Lippi's side were unbeaten in qualifying but failed to consistently shine, with ageing World Cup winners struggling to live up to their billing. Good young players in Serie A are few and far between, meaning Lippi has had difficulty finding the right mix between experience and youthful energy and that could count against them during the June 11-July 11 tournament.

Alberto Gilardino, the top scorer in qualifying, is set to lead the line but his partner up front has yet to be decided.

Italy's displays in qualifying were dominated by slow buildup play and recent friendlies have bored sparse crowds. On the other hand a relatively easy Group F with Paraguay, New Zealand and Slovakia suggests they should make the knockout stages where their international pedigree will be very useful.
