<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League MP Moslem Uddin on Thursday filed a defamation case against complainant Jalal Uddin, who had accused him of 1971 war crimes, after his acquittal on May 9. He asked for Tk 50 crore in damages in a defamation suit with Mymensingh Joint District Judges' Court. He filed another defamation suit with Mymensingh Judicial Magistrate's Court. Moslem claimed that the complainant Jalal Uddin of village Jorbaria at Fulbaria Upazila in Mymensingh had filed the war crimes case against him with the judicial magistrates' court on Apr 6 just to belittle him, which was later found to be false. The court then ordered the Fulbaria police chief to investigate the charge. The police chief and case investigation officer accordingly submitted the report on May 3. The report showed that the police had found any authenticity of the charges against four freedom fighters, including Moslem. The court quashed the charges on May 9. He claimed that Jalal, being provoked by Freedom Party workers, had filed the case against him. Moslem, along with 12 others, was named and 20-25 unnamed persons were made accused in the case. bdne
