 MADRID, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho was unusually subdued on Friday and his only brash prediction was that he and Bayern Munich boss Louis van Gaal would both one day lift a second Champions League title no matter who wins Saturday's final. Mourinho claimed Europe's top club trophy with Porto in 2004 and Van Gaal achieved the feat with Ajax in 1995 with the pair now battling to become only the third man after Ernst Happel and Ottmar Hitzfeld to win the Champions League with a second club. "Me and Louis will carry on in our jobs. The one that doesn't do it tomorrow will do it in the future," Mourinho told a news conference on Friday which included journalists from as far away as Russia, Africa and China. The outspoken coach was otherwise reserved on the eve of what could be his greatest triumph given Inter are also on the brink of a treble, just like Bayern.

"This story of Madrid...I've always said it is not a problem for me. Someone who plays a Champions League final can't think about anything else," he said. "Tomorrow when the game finishes, I can't say it's my last game." There was humour when a Russian journalist handed the Portuguese a crown and the coach gave him his Inter jacket in return, but in truth Van Gaal's pre-match news conference had more of the panache which had been Mourinho's trademark. In fact, Mourinho pointed out one example where he thought Bayern were being far more arrogant than the usual king of confidence. "Bayern have organised celebration T-shirts. Bayern have organised an open-top bus. Bayer have planned a party. Us...nothing," he said before wandering out to a flash of cameras for perhaps the penultimate time as Inter c
