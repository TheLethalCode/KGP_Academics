 Chittagong, May 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Chittagong City Corporation mayor candidate M Manzur Alam visited BNP leader Abdullah Al Noman's residence on Sunday night in an apparent attempt to heal a rift developing in the local BNP party about who should have been selected as the party's Mayoral candidate. A former minister, Noman's name had emerged as a potential mayoral candidate before the BNP backed Manzur as its candidate to run for the June 17 CCC polls. Noman has a long term dispute with Chittagong metropolitan BNP's president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, the chief polling agent for Manzur. The influential leader of Chittagong BNP and vice chairman of central BNP had indicated that he would contest in the elections if the party decided to choose him as a candidate. Manzur went to Noman's Kazir Dewri residence in the port city shortly before 12 midnight. They embraced; exchanged greetings and Noman took Manzur inside his house. Manzur also exchanged greetings with some BNP activists, who are followers of Noman. He also urged them to extend cooperation in the polls. Manzur's personal assistant Abdur Rahim told bdnews24.com Manzur went to Noman's residence to meet the central leaders of the party ahead of the polls. He spent half an hour in the house - though nothing could be known about the meeting. Earlier on Saturday Manzur went to metropolitan BNP vice president Dastagir Chowdhury, who is also a mayoral candidate. Ward councillor Manzur was once associated with BNP's main political rival the ruling Awami League and has been a long time confidant of his current rival, Mohiuddin Chowdhury who is seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure. A section of Chittagong metropolitan BNP leaders and workers had expressed strong reservations initially when he was given the party's blessings. But BNP's district and city leaders accompanied him when he filed his nomination papers.
