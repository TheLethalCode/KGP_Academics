 PARIS, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Roger Federer is looking forward to facing his great rival for the French Open crown a year after Rafael Nadal missed their rendezvous in the final. With usual contenders Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro having pulled out injured, the road looks clearer for another Roger versus Rafa classic.

"It was a bit nerve-wrecking in some ways. But I'm used to pressure situations, so it was moderate. It was fine." The pressure will get stronger by the day for the defending champion, who could meet France's Gael Monfils in the fourth round before a possible quarter-final clash with Swede Robin Soderling who he beat in last year's final. "Fourteen days down the road and six matches for each of (us) to get into the final. (It) is not my priority to play Rafa," said Fed
