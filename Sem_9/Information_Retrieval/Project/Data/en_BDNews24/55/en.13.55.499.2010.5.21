 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh on Friday signed a framework agreement with Russia for hi-tech cooperation for the first-ever nuclear power plant. The foreign ministry in a statement said state minister for science Yafes Osman signed the framework agreement on peaceful use of nuclear technologies with director general of Russia's State Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom, Sergei Kiriyenko in Moscow. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, now on a visit to Moscow, witnessed the signing of the deal which officials in Dhaka said would kick off the detailed discussion on Russian assistance for Rooppur nuclear power plant in Pabna. The cabinet on April 13 approved a draft deal on establishing a 2000 MW nuclear power plant with Russia in Pabna's Rooppur. Last week, Osman said the agreement on the construction of the power plant will be signed in September when the prime minister tours that country. Russia is ready to help Bangladesh make use of nuclear technologies in peaceful purposes, Sergei Kiriyenko, the head of Russia's State-Run Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom, said after the signing. Russia is building many nuclear facilities both inside the country and abroad and is "ready to share its experience with Bangladesh," Kiriyenko said. "The agreement's goal is to lay down reliable legal basis for cooperation between Russia and Bangladesh in the peaceful atom area." The agreement covers a wide range of possible areas of cooperation, such as siting, designing, building and operating power and research nuclear reactors, desalination plants and particle accelerators. The agreement also provides for cooperation in the areas of prospecting and developing uranium and thorium deposits, nuclear fuel cycle services, including supplies of nuclear fuel to power and research reactors. The document regulates issues of disposal of Russian nuclear fuel waste, handling radioactive waste and maintaining nuclear and radiation safety. Russia and Bangladesh will cooperate in the area of physical protection of nuclear materials and will take joint emergencies actions. Apart from it, under the agreement, Rosatom will help Bangladesh set up a national regulatory authority and train its nuclear physics experts and nuclear engineers in Russia. To implement the agreement, the sides will set up a joint coordinating committee that will include representatives nominated by Rosatom and the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology, and those appointed by BAEC and sicence ministry . The committee will hold its meetings on an as-needed basis in Russia and Bangladesh alternatively. The agreement was signed for the term of five years with possible tacit extension every five years. "We are working fast to achieve our goals  only a year ago we signed a memorandum, and now we are signing the agreement. I am confident that we will continue to work as fast and efficiently as now," Kiriyenko said during the signing ceremony.
