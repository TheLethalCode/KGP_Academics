 BUENOS AIRES, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Diego Milito will have the same chance as Argentina's other in-form strikers to earn a place in their World Cup side, coach Diego Maradona said on Sunday. Milito, one of six strikers in Maradona's 23-man squad, reached the heights of European football by scoring both goals in Inter Milan's 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in Saturday's Champions League final in Madrid. "I'm not surprised by Milito. He's had a spectacular season, but then so have the others, Lio (Messi), (Carlos) Tevez, 'Kun' (Sergio Aguero)," Maradona told a news conference.

"I want to have them all sharp... We can give anyone a good fight, a footballing fight, because we have a good game and good players. This squad are similar to that of '86 because they have hunger for glory." Argentina face Nigeria, South Korea and Greece in Group B at the finals in South Africa. Maradona, who had criticised Inter coach Jose Mourinho for his side's ultra-defensive performance in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final away to Barcelona, said he would not give up on attack come what may. "Not at any price. If I renounced attack it would be a sin with the players I have," he said. "I think that if we play the way we should we'll do w
