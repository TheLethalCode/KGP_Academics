<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Three days after lamenting his agency's 20-year legacy, the PKSF chief said on Sunday that new initiatives were necessary to do away with the adverse impacts of micro-credit. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, chairman of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), a major micro-finance agency in the country, however, would not term the new initiatives as an 'exit plan'. "We have to rid micro-credit of its bad impacts and of its bad name." Ahmad was speaking at a roundtable discussion meeting attended by a number of MPs, government officials and NGO representatives. While unveiling a new initiative on Thursday, he said that PKSF had taken the wrong path for the last 20 years since its inception by becoming a micro-credit agency instead of taking up initiatives to generate rural employment as the agency's Bengali name suggests. Ahmad heavily criticised micro-credit and questioned its potency, although the small loan scheme is lauded across the world for its phenomenal recovery and rate of return. When asked if the PKSF might face external pressure in implementing its new scheme targeting household development with increased emphasis on education and health, Kholiquzzaman said it would not. THE NEW INITIATIVE The new approach - 'Total House Hold Development: One Union One Partner Organisation' - is based on the idea of assisting families so that they can be put on a sustainable path to socio-economic progress. Under the new project, an estimated 55,000 households in 21 unions would be encouraged and facilitated to build assets. The project's beneficiaries will deposit Tk 300 fortnightly in a bank savings account. They will not be able to withdraw money from the account for two years ensuring build up of personal funds. In the following the two years, the accumulated funds of the households plus up to Tk 20,000 assistance from PKSF will be used for acquiring physical assets or undertaking productive activities. Under the pilot programme, three unions from Barisal division, three from Chittagong, six from Dhaka, three from Khulna, four from Rajshahi and two from Sylhet have been included. ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION Details of the new schemes were discussed at a meeting on Sunday participated by several parliament members, government and NGO officials. Rashed Khan Menon MP said, "There is a conflict between local government organisations and NGOs. Avoiding such conflicts is critical for this programme's implementation." Referring to the prevailing debate on micro-credit's actual role in sustainable development, he said that the pilot programme is a "good initiative". Former Bangladesh bank governor Mohammed Farashuddin said, "The poor people who need financial assistance and cannot get bank loans or micro-credit, fall prey to usurers. This programme can break this vicious practice." He also emphasised the importance of resources in sustainable development and praised the PKSF initiative, saying that "Resource generation is important, which the Grameen Bank's housing programme has demonstrated. Pointing to the fact that people who have taken micro-credit have been found to be taking loans throughout their life, M A Baki Khalili, professor of economics at the Dhaka University, said, "Point to point analysis shows that the loan receivers fail to come out of poverty." Former advisor of the caretaker government Rasheda K Chowdhury stressed the need for to avoid controversies for proper implementation of the project by saying, "Selection of the families in the union level should not give rise to new debate" Referring to the recent debate over the MPO inclusion, she also voiced her concern that similar kind of debate might arise in this programme also. "There should be a monitoring mechanism in place and the local government should be given an important role in conducting the programme," she added. Parliament member Zunaid Ahmed Polk underlined the importance of inclusion of social development issues like "tree plantation" as requirements on the part of beneficiaries. He also said that conditions related to population control should also be included in the programme. MM Akash, an economics professor at Dhaka University, put emphasis on including local government bodies, such as the union councils in the programme. Hannana Begum, vice president of Bangladesh Economic Association said that an emphasis on the inclusion of women in the new initiative would yield more positive result. Responding to a query about whether the partner organisations would be as keen as PKSF in implementing the project, the organisation chief Kholiquzzaman Ahmad told bdnews24.com "These NGOs are keen on ridding their bad reputation regarding their micro-credit programmes and are willing participators in this new initiative." bdnews24.com
