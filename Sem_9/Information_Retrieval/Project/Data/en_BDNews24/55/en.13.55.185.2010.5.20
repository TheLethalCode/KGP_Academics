 MILAN, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Luigi Del Neri, who quit as Sampdoria coach just a day after leading them to the Champions League, was tasked with turning around the fortunes of faltering Juventus on Wednesday. The much-travelled 59-year-old with trademark glasses and prominent chin has signed a two-year contract to coach Juve, the Italian Serie A club said in a statement. Twice European champions Juve, Italy's best supported club and most successful domestically, endured a horror season and could only finish seventh in the league in one of their worst top-flight performances. A large rebuilding job is needed after Ciro Ferrara was sacked in January and interim coach Alberto Zaccheroni failed to shore up a leaking defence or re-energise a lacklustre attack.

The decision of Del Neri and Marotta to leave flying Samp for floundering Juve is an example of the power the Juventus brand still holds in Italy despite their problems. A new ground will be completed on the site of the old detested Stadio delle Alpi for 2011, making Juve the first Italian team to own their stadium and gain extra revenue. Juventus had long been linked with Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez and the choice of Del Neri has prompted mixed reactions from Juve fans, especially given he famously left Porto in 2004 before managing a competitive game. Over in Genoa, bewildered Samp fans are wondering how they lost their coach and sporting director in their finest hour. No replacement for Del Neri has been named and supporters fear Juve's new boss will try to take their top players such as Giampaolo Pazzini with
