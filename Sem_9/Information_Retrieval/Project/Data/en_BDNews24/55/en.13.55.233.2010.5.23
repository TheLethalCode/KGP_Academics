 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Law minister Shafique Ahmed would not specify a date when war crimes charges would be framed although he claimed that the investigation was progressing smoothly. Regarding his prior pledge that charge-sheets would be lodged within May, he said on Sunday the deadline cannot be disclosed for the sake of the investigation. "I hope that charge-sheets will be given within the specific deadline," he told journalists following his monthly coordination meeting with the war crimes investigation agency and government prosecutors at the Secretariat to review progress of the trial. He said the preparatory work of the war crimes tribunal was making much headway and would conclude in time. "We hope that we will finish investigation within our deadline," Shafique said. He also said there should be no doubts about the trials starting in the present government's tenure. Home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister for law Qamrul Islam, state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku, investigation agency representative Abdur Rahim, and chief state prosecutor Golam Arif Tipu attended the meeting chaired by Shafique. Shafique told reporters that the investigation agency had sought more manpower and other assistance from the government. "The home ministry was working on it and the agency should have sufficient manpower and other assistance within a week," he said Stating that the investigation agency and state prosecutor's team would get more manpower if needed, the minister said, "This measure is to ensure that there is a proper investigation and trial process." He also said that some additional lawyers may be appointed to collect information on different issues, adding that it would facilitate the whole trial process. Referring to the rumour of investigation agency member Shamsul Arefin's resignation, the minister said, "The news was not authentic." The minister said, "He could not join work as he was ill for a long time. He reported for work on Sunday." Rejecting the opposition's allegation that the war crimes trial was being held on political grounds, the minister said that it was not politically motivated. Steps had been taken to try those associated with crimes against humanity to establish the rule of law, he said. He also added that it was the government's electoral pledge. A certain quarter was trying to create confusion over the issue, he said and reiterated his earlier stance that the trial is not linked with politics. bdnews2
