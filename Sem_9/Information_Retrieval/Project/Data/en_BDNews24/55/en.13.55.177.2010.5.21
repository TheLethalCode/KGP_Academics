<TITLE> Stocks continue to spiral </TITLE>

 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks continued to heat up as the key index rose to a new highfor the third time this week. Market players, however, question the sustainability of these new adjustments in a market where demand significantly outstrips supply of shares - also known as scrips - on trade. The benchmark general index or the DGEN ended at 5981.85 points on Thursday  a rise of 60 points or 1.01 percent from the previous day's closing, having gained on five consecutive sessions. This upswing trend in the market appears to have been triggered by finance ministry's green signal to convert face value of shares from Tk 100 to Tk 10 - a face value conversion that market experts and regulators have long been saying does not change the fundamentals of the listed companies. A top official of a merchant bank told bdnews24.com earlier in the week that "change in the share prices is only a psychological impact; it has nothing to do with the market fundamentals." The Securities and Exchange Commission has cautioned potential investors Wednesday, writing on its website, that any remarkable changes in price due to face value conversion are "not logical." Market analysts too have viewed the spiraling of the key index of the bourse as an alarming trend. "The sustainability of this rise is questionable, especially when it's on the news of face value conversion," economist Abu Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Thursday. The market index has increased by 4.08 percent or 234 points through the week. Such a "bull run" is alarming, given the size of this market, Ahmed added. Market participators are also skeptical about the rise. A fund manager, asking not to be named as the market regulator had recently directed them not to speak to the press on market trends, told bdnews24.com that he too "doubt(s) the sustainability" of this current trend and that a price correction is imminent. "We only hope it would be a soft one so that it does not hit the small investors too hard," he said. An SEC spokesperson informed the media Thursday that the regulator was monitoring the market behaviour closely and would take appropriate measures to guard against a disaster. bdne
