 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)Police claim the flat in Jurain, where ten grenades were recovered after an attack on policemen during a raid, was a hideout of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Bangladesh (HuJi). At least seven policemen were injured in the grenade attack on Sunday night. Kadamtali police chief Ayubur Rahman told reporters on Monday that Siddiqur Rahman, arrested from the house, was a member of military wing of the banned outfit. He said Siddique had rented the house six months ago as an employee of a private firm. Siddique and his wife, brother-in-law and his wife used to stay the house. Police recovered the hand-made grenades wrapped in a cloth under the bed. Three grenades were thrown at police on Sunday night, Rahman said. An injured policeman told reporters at Dhaka Medical College Hospital that a woman had opened the doors and it was dark inside the house. She saw the policemen switching on the light and then the grenades were hurled. Police officer Rahman said a special police team on combating militants, led by additional superintendent of police Jannatul Hasan, went to raid the flat at Commissioner Road around 11pm. The Kadamtali police assisted the special team, he added. As the team went to the second floor, a bomb was thrown at them from inside the house injuring policemen in front of the door and on the stairs, Rahman said. Four others were also injured during the raid - including one of the alleged militants, the house owner and two local people. The injured have been admitted to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and the Rajarbagh Police Lines Hospital. State minister for home Shamsul Hoque Tuku, who visited the injured policemen at the hospital, claimed that BNP's call for hartal has links with militant activities. "I'm alarmed. The militants have sprung into action immediately after the declaration of the hartal." Main opposition BNP called for a countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike on June 27 to caution the government. bd
