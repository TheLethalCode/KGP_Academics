 LAHORE, May 22 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- A retired judge on Saturday adjourned until next week and next month appeals lodged by former cricket captain Shoaib Malik and all-rounder Rana Naved-ul-Hasan against a one-year ban and hefty fines. "Malik's lawyer completed his arguments and the lawyer for the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) wanted time for some legal matters so the appeal has been adjourned for May 29," Irfan Qadir, the one-man arbitrator, told AFP.

Except Yousuf, who retired in protest, all six players appealed. Appeals by Afridi, Kamran and Umar will be heard later. Qadir said the proceedings were kept secret only in the interest of players and Pakistan cricket. "In my personal opinion the proceedings should be open but on the request of players and the PCB we have not made it open. For transparency we are keeping video recordings of the proceedings," said Qadir. Younis and his lawyer last week showed frustration over the delay in arbitration, demanding a suspension of the ban to allow the former captain to play for Pakistan. Pakistan is due to take part in Asia Cup in Sri Lanka from June 15-24.
