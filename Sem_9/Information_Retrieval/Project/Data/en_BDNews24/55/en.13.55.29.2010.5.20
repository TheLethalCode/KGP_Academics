 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)Similar to India, Bangladesh is considering to allow Nepal and Bhutan use its ports. State minister for environment Hasan Mahmud told reporters at his office on Thursday the government was keen to let Nepal and Bhutan use its ports besides India. He pointed out that it was essential to introduce specific regulations regarding this issue. Earlier in the morning, Indian high commissioner in Bangladesh Rajeet Mitter had a meeting with the state minister. About the south-western mangrove forest Sundarbans, the minister said that it fell within the territory of both Bangladesh and India. "Both governments will take up joint projects to save the world's largest mangrove forest." The Sundarbans Eco-System Forum, a joint initiative by Bangladesh and India, aims to protect and preserve the forest from the adverse impacts of climate change. Mahmud said they talked about the two cultural issues and said that Bangladesh would soon set up a common platform with India.
