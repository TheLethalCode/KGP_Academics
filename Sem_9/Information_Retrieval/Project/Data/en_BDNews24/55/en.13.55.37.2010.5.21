 Rajshahi, May 21 (bdnews24.com) City police's detective branch (DB) on Friday arrested two Rajshahi University students for harassing school girls. They were, however, later released after they signed a bond promising not to indulge in this kind of activities in future. Rajshahi DB police's deputy commissioner Mahfuzur Rahman said that Mahbub Hossain and Arif Hossain, 3rd year students of the university's sociology department and the department of finance and banking department, used to take classes at the city's Sun Dial Coaching Centre. They collected cell phone numbers of their female students and used to harass them over phone. The police official said that the duo were arrested from the coaching centre and freed later on after signing the bond. Rahman also said that they have identified 25 locations where females are being harassed by eve teasers and are "conducting drives"against the perpetrators. bdn
