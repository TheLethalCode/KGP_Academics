<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government to explain why extra-judicial punishment in the name of fatwa and Islami Sharia would not be declared illegal and inhuman. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Gobinda Chandra Thakur in a ruling on Monday also asked the government to explain why the educational institutions should not be directed to include texts that will discourage such kinds of punishment beyond the law of the land. The secretaries to home, law, religion and culture, police chief, the deputy commissioner of Brahmanbaria and police chief of Bancharampur of the district, where a girl was reportedly caned following a religious edict, were asked to answer the rule in the next two weeks. The court issued the rule nisi, or show-cause notice, upon a petition by lawyers Mahbub Shafiq, KM Hafizul Alam and Imranul Hai Sachib. The Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo published a report on May 22 that four people were arrested after a young girl at Bancharampur was lashed 101 times. The Brahmanbaria DC has been asked by the court to report on the incident in seven days. It also ordered the district police superintendent and the Bancharampur police chief to produce the victim and her parents before the court on Jun 2. The media have been asked by the court not to publish the names of the girl and her guardians. bdne
