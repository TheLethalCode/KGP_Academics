 Jahangirnagar University, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The probe committee looking into sexual harassment allegations against a chairman of international relations department at Jahangirnagar University has pleaded for an extension. The deadline of 28 working days to investigate the allegation filed by a female teacher of the same department expired Saturday. The seven member probe committee was formed in line with the High Court directives after the complaint was lodged Apr 15. When asked about the extension, probe committee convenor professor Khurshida Begum said, "We've sought extension of deadline as the investigation process has not been completed within the stipulated time." The victim brought the allegations against Abdullah Hel Kafi verbally on Apr 1 and in writing on Apr 15. She said that she had given her statements to the probe committee in two phaseson May 3 and May 10. However, different students' organisations allege that the administration was influencing the investigation. On the matter, the complainant teacher told bdnews24.com: "As he [Kafi] is very powerful, the administration might have influenced the investigation process." "But I can't say anything for not having any evidence," she added. On the allegation, vice chancellor Sharif Enamul Kabir told bdnews24.com that appropriate and exemplary measures would follow up on the probe committee report. Any sort of relaxation or obstruction would not be tolerated, he said. bdne
