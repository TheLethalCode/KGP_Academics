 JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- South African police will ensure the safety of all foreign visitors and teams participating in the World Cup finals, deputy police minister Fikile Mbalula said on Wednesday.

Security and crime have been one of the biggest issues ahead of the World Cup because of South Africa's high rate of violent crimes -- it has 50 murders a day, almost the same rate as the United States with six times the population. The safety pledge comes on the day the Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry said it is preparing a "terror threat" warning for the tournament after learning of a plan to attack Dutch soccer fans or players. A spokesman for the ministry said it had an updated concept for its travel advice for South Africa, which was due to be published soon, in response to the arrest made in Iraq.
