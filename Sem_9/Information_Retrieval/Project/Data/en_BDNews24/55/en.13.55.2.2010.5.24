 TOKYO, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Want to spend a night with Michael Jackson's possessions? The Japanese promoter of a collection of his belongings on display in Tokyo can make that dream come true on the first anniversary of the pop icon's death. Starting Sunday, fans in Japan are expected to line up for the chance to spend one night inside the Neverland Collection at the Tokyo Tower, which to many is a shrine to the sacred memory of their idol.

"I have been to this exhibition more than eight times already and each time I feel more connected to Michael's legacy." Guests will pay up to $1,000 for the one-time opportunity to sleep on the floor among Michael's belongings. "Michael Jackson fans religiously visited daily, and many stay inside the venue for six hours or more," said Matt Taylor, producer of the exhibition. "Many Japanese fans become overwhelmed with emotion when in the presence of so many things precious to Michael and iconic to the rest of the world.
