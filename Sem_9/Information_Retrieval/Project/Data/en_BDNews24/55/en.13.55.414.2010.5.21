 KARACHI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal has dismissed allegations of having links with bookmakers and that he deliberately under-performed on the tour of Australia at the start of this year.

"I have always played for my country and I have already told the PCB about my performances in Australia. Whoever is now making allegations is free to do so but must also prove them," Akmal added.

On his return from the attending the tournament in the West Indies, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt told reporters that the board had informed the ICC they had found no evidence of match-fixing by any player on the Australian tour.
