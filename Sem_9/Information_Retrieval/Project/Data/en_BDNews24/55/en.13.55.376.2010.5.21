 LONDON, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top shares fell early on Friday, down for a third day as fears about the sovereign debt crisis and worries that stricter financial regulations could dampen global growth grew, with banks and oil stocks hit hard. By 9:15 a.m., the FTSE 100 fell 18.08 points or 0.3 percent to 5,055.26 after falling 1.7 percent on Thursday. The index has lost 13.4 percent since fears escalated about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis in mid-April and is down 6.8 percent this year. Banks continued their slide from the previous session, with Barclays , HSBC , Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered down 0.5 to 1.1 percent.

BG Group and BP slipped 1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. However, the mining sector was given a boost by a positive note from HSBC. The broker reiterated its "overweight" position on Rio Tinto and Anglo American which gained 0.5 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. Xstrata rose 2.1 percent after it was upgraded to "neutral" from "underweight." United Utilities gained 1.6 percent after the group reported underlying operating profit up 3 percent and Evolution Securities upgraded its recommendation on the stock, citing defensive qualities. British Airways was given a boost and gained 0.3 percent after it predicted a return to breakeven next year, helped by recovering business-class traffic, after it posted a record 531 million pound full-year loss, hit by strikes and winter s
