 MADRID, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Enigmatic Jose Mourinho, with a smile on his face but a tear in his eye, looks poised to quit Inter Milan after sealing his place as a truly great manager with a second Champions League title on Saturday. Inter completed an unprecedented Italian treble after Diego Milito's double downed Bayern Munich 2-0 at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium, where the Portuguese could be coaching next season. "Should I change teams my career won't change. Next year I could face Inter. If I go to play at the San Siro, I go to play at home," he told a news conference having earlier given conflicting signals on his future to television stations. "I'm coach of Inter not Real Madrid. I'm very proud now of being Inter coach. If I become Real coach it's because the club (Real) wants the same as me," he added.

As if to say goodbye, he embraced club president Massimo Moratti after his side lifted the trophy to a huge firework display and an equally spectacular flash of camera bulbs. "It was an unstoppable hug. More than the words it was the hug. It was an incredible wedding between us. He wanted me a few years ago when I was at Chelsea. He tried again and I went and maybe he had a feeling I could give him his dream," he said. His players certainly believe Mourinho is moving on with captain Javier Zanetti saying he had told them he was leaving. Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder summed up the mood best. "We'll lose the architect of the team," he told reporters. Brash Mourinho always likes the last word, however, and he is plotting more Champions League success if he signs for Real. "Few have the privilege of winning it. It's an even bigger privilege winning it twice. I can win a third, a fourth, a fifth time but I don't think the feelings will be different," he said. "The feelings are joy and happiness and a tear if I le
