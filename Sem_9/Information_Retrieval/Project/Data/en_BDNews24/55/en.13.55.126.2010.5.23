 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24)BNP will constitute a 'national mass-probe commission' to prosecute former caretaker government head Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief general Moeen U Ahmed and former home adviser major gen MA Matin and three others, a senior leader has said. The commission will investigate the 'illegal activities' of the 2007-8 military-installed interim government, Moudud Ahmed told reporters at his office in Motijheel in the city on Sunday. The three others, who would be put on 'symbolic' trial, are former army officer and now high commissioner to Australia, Lt Gen Masud Uddin Chowdhury, retired Maj Gen ATM Amin and Brig Gen Fazlul Bari, Moudud said. The opposition MP said the lawyers' rally held at the Supreme Court premises on May 8 decided to form the probe commission. The commission will not be formed under any party umbrella, rather professionals from all walks of life would be included there, Moudud, member of the highest policymaking body of BNP, said. "I'm an initiator of the commission as a lawyer. That illegal government should be brought to justice as they had violated the constitution." The terms of reference of the commission would be outlined after discussion with the professionals, which the BNP leader hoped, will happen 'very soon'. The former law minister slammed the Awami League-led government for breaching its election pledge by not publishing a white paper on the last interim government's activities. "This government came to power as a beneficiary of the caretakers. This is why they do not want to try 'Fakhruddin-Moinuddin'," the opposition leader said. Answering a query, he said, "The commission will decide on the process of the trial. It'll also identify their associates." He said that only a few army officials were involved with the Jan 1, 2007 changeover, not the entire armed forces. bd
