 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  No more television channels will be shut, post and telecommunications minister Raziuddin Raju has assured. Regarding a rumour of closing the TV channels, which achieved licenses during the term of BNP-led government, he said, "This is not true." "No TV channels were shut due to political reasons," Raju told reporters at a press conference at the telecommunications building on Thursday. When asked about such further moves, the minister said, "No more TV channels will be shut down." During the previous BNP government, eight licenses were issued to private TV channels, mostly owned by BNP-leaning businessmen and political leaders. The then opposition, Awami League, protested those moves as partisanship. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) on Apr 27 closed transmission of Channel One for violating laws. Giasuddin Al Mamun, an aide of BNP senior vice president Tarique Rahman, had acquired the license. The reason for the closure said: "The channel has broken the rules of frequency allocation. They could not provide proper replies to the several notices sent to them. So a decision was made to close the channel in line with the Telecommunications Act 2001." Earlier, BTRC had also stopped test transmission of Jamuna TV on Nov 19 last year for not having a 'no objection' certificate. bdne
