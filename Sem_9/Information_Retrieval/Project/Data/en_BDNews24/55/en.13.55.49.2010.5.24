<TITLE> Two Koreas snarl at each other, tensions rise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL/BEIJING, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The two Koreas raised their war-like rhetoric on Monday, threatening conflict if the other side pushes too far in escalating tension after Seoul accused Pyongyang of torpedoing one of its naval ships. The United States, which has 28,000 troops on the peninsula, threw its full support behind South Korea and said it was working hard to stop the escalation getting out of hand. With US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Beijing, Washington pressed North Korea's only major ally, China, to rein in the hermit state. The increasingly vitriolic comments across the heavily defended Cold War border are rattling investors and niggling at diplomatic relations in the economically powerful region. Few analysts believe either Korea would dare go to war. The North's military is no match for the technically superior South Korean and US forces. And for the South, conflict would send investors scurrying out of the country. The mounting tension follows last week's findings by international investigators who accused North Korea of torpedoing the Cheonan corvette in March, killing 46 sailors in one of the deadliest clashes between the two since the 1950-53 Korean War. "I solemnly urge the authorities of North Korea ... to apologise immediately to the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the international community," South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said in a nationally televised address. Lee said he would take the issue to the UN Security Council, whose past sanctions are already sapping what little energy the ruined North Korean economy has left. His government also banned all trade, investment and visits with North Korea. The won fell more than two percent to an eight-month low in early trading, partly driven down by the North Korea concerns. It later recovered a little with traders seeing the rhetoric as falling well short of actual war. WHITE HOUSE BACKING The White House called South Korea's measures to punish the North entirely appropriate and told Pyongyang to stop its "belligerent and threatening behaviour" as tensions on the peninsula escalated to their highest in years. Clinton laid the blame at North Korea's door and said the United States was working hard to avoid an escalation of the "highly precarious" situation on the Korean peninsula. But she avoided answering a question on whether Washington would support additional U.N. sanctions against North Korea. China is very unlikely to support more U.N. sanctions. Japan's prime minister instructed his cabinet to consider what form of sanctions could be taken against North Korea over the sinking. An angry North Korea threatened to fire at equipment the South said it would put up to broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and was ready to take stronger measures if the South escalated tension. It also issued a statement repeating its position that it had the right to expand its nuclear deterrent. "North Korea's goal is to instigate division and conflict," said Lee, speaking from the country's war memorial in the capital Seoul. "It is now time for the North Korean regime to change." In what may alarm Pyongyang as much as anything, its wealthy neighbour said it plans to reduce the number of workers in a joint factory park just inside the North which has long been an important source of income for the North Korean leadership. FOCUS ON CHINA Much of the diplomatic focus will be on China, the only major power to support North Korea and which earlier this month -- to the annoyance of the South -- hosted a rare overseas visit by the North's sickly looking leader Kim Jong-il. Beijing has so far avoided joining in the blame of Pyongyang, saying it will make its own assessment of why the ship sank. Analysts say China's leaders are terrified of any action that might cause the already shaky North to collapse, sending chaos across into its territory and, perhaps even more worrying, leading to US troops moving up the peninsula right to its border. A South Korean government report said the North's foreign sanctions-hit trade fell 10 percent last year and could fall further this year, forcing it to depend even more on China to prop up its economy. Lee said the South reserved the right to defend itself if Pyongyang wages aggression. The North said much the same to its neighbour last week when it denied involvement in the sinking. Local financial markets took some relief from Lee's comments which steered clear of any suggestion of military retaliation. "South, North tension is certainly not positive, but given historical trends, losses that markets suffer over this will be brief, unless a drastic situation takes hold. By drastic, I mean war. I do not think war is likely though," said Kwak Joong-bo, a market analyst at Hana Daetoo Securit
