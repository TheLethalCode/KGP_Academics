 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  The railway authorities have restored the Dhaka-Chittagong train line which was snapped for about four hours on Sunday morning. M Akhteruzzaman, an additional director general of the railway, told bdnews24.com that a relief train cleared the rail line at around 1.20 pm. "The train movement has now been restored," he said. The movement of trains between Dhaka and Chittagong remained halted from around 9.30 am Sunday after a freight train headed for Dhaka from Chittagong went off the track near Sadar Rasulpur in Comilla. Ibrahim Khalil, the divisional railway manager of the railway's eastern zone, told bdnews24.com that the derailment of the cargo train had not caused any major disruption in the movement of trains. He said the Dhaka bound Subarna Express, stranded in Comilla due to the derailment, might reach Dhaka about two hours later than its scheduled time at 1.00 pm. The Subarana express train had left Comilla station, said Akhteruzzaman
