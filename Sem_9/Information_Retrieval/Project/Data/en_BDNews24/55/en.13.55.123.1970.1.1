 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  Hamida Begum, who lives on a char in Gaibandha, had lost everything after her seven bighas of land went under water. Jahanara Begum of Sunamganj too lost her crops to flooding. Her family now finds it difficult to survive. Both Hamida and Jahanara blamed the adverse impact of climate change for their plight. The victims of cyclone Aila and the recent flooding in haor area were sharing their experiences in a climate hearing on Saturday. Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods (CSRL) and Oxfam jointly organised the programme at the National Press Club ahead of the first anniversary of the Aila, which hit southern Bangladesh on May 25, 2009. The affected people and other participants in the hearing urged rich countries to reduce pollution, which is they said was the key cause for climatic change, demanding immediate compensation. Speakers at the hearing also urged the Bangladeshi government to give their best effort to that end. Sarbanu Khatun, a climate witness, who took part in London's Commonwealth parliament, Asia-Pacific climate poverty hearing in Bangkok and international climate poverty hearing in Copenhagen last year, attended Saturday's programme. Sharing her experiences Khatun said: "The big leaders have no headache about our sufferings." Khatun, a resident of Satkhira's Gabura union, said they lost everything to the fury of Aila and were still living on embankment. CSRL convener Dr Ahsanuddin Ahmed said the Copenhagen summit had failed to yield an expected outcome. Victims of Bangladesh still face the impact of climate change, he said. "The Aila-hit people couldn't return to their homes yet. The developed countries have no right to deprive us of our right to live." Ahmed said these countries should reduce their pollutions and give compensations to affected countries like Bangladesh. CSRL and Oxfam arranged 60 hearing sessions last year in Bangladesh ahead of the Copenhagen summit last year. Over 1 lakh people took part in the hearings. The aim of the hearings was to draw attention of the world leaders to the plights and miseries of the victims of climate change so that they strike a deal in favour of the risk-prone countries like Bangladesh.
