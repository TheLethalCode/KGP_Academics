<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuter) - An alleged al Qaeda militant arrested recently in Iraq said he had suggested an attack on the Danish and Dutch teams at the World Cup soccer tournament to avenge insults against the Prophet Mohammad. Abdullah Azzam al-Qahtani, who Iraqi authorities said was a Saudi national, said in an interview televised on Wednesday on US-funded al-Hurra television that the attack was an "idea." Iraqi security officials offered no details of the alleged plot when they announced Qahtani's arrest on Monday. "If the Danish and Dutch qualify for the World Cup, we can attack them, or during qualification," Qahtani, seen in a red prison uniform, said in a brief excerpt of the interview shown on al-Hurra. "It was an idea of a plot. There were no details because we didn't know what would happen on the ground. We could use bombs or weapons to attack the fans of the Danish and Dutch teams," he said. Al-Hurra reported that Qahtani said the plot was meant to avenge insults against the prophet. Cartoons published in a Danish newspaper, one showing the Prophet Mohammad wearing a turban resembling a bomb, touched off riots, protests and attacks on Danish embassies in some Muslim countries in 2006. In the Netherlands, anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders has been accused of inciting hatred after saying that the Koran causes violence. South African police said on Wednesday they would ensure the safety of all foreign visitors and teams at the World Cup, scheduled for June 11 to July 11. The Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry said it was preparing a "terror threat" warning for the tournament after learning of the alleged plot. "TERRORIST ACT" Baghdad security spokesman Major General Qassim al-Moussawi offered no evidence or details of the alleged plot when he announced the May 3 arrest of Qahtani on Monday. He described Qahtani as a former Saudi army lieutenant and said he was also planning to bomb shrines in the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Kerbala. "He was planning a terrorist act in South Africa during the World Cup based on plans issued by the central al Qaeda terrorist organisation in coordination with Osama bin Laden's first assistant, Ayman al-Zawahri," Moussawi said at the time. A spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry said it could not confirm that the man arrested in Iraq was a Saudi. "Our records show that a person by the same name and who was a member of the army left the kingdom six years ago for a holiday and never returned. But we cannot confirm that it is the same man held by Iraqi authorities," the spokesman, Mansour al-Turki, said. "We are waiting for concrete elements to verify the identity of this man and see whether these elements match what we have on the Saudi national who has disappeared." Al-Hurra television reported security forces had found documents and notes written by Qahtani that described the World Cup plot in the same house where two top leaders of al Qaeda were killed, and that Qahtani was waiting for final approval from the al Qaeda chain of command, particularly Zawahri. The leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the purported head of its local affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq, were killed in a raid north of Baghdad last mo
