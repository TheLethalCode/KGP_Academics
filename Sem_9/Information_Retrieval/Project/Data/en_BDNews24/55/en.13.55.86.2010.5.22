<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters AlertNet) - Tens of thousands of people need emergency aid after cyclone Laila battered the eastern coast, inundating villages, smashing mud and thatch homes and wiping out vital cash crops, aid workers and government officials say. Reaching wind speeds of up to 95 kmph (59 mph) and accompanied by high tidal waves and heavy rains, Laila slammed the coast of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday afternoon, killing at least 17 people. Officials and aid workers say that while the cyclone was less severe than expected, up to 70,000 villagers evacuated from low-lying coastal areas will need aid for the next few days. "We have appealed to people in relief camps not to return home unless the cyclone warning is withdrawn," said Dharmana Prasada Rao, state minister for disaster management. "The damage to crops and civic infrastructure has been extensive. It will take some time before the exact damages are known." Laila has now weakened from a severe cyclone to a deep depression as it heads towards neighbouring Orissa, which has been hit by heavy downpours. Authorities say they remain on alert in case it strengthens again. INITIAL DAMAGE Preliminary assessments suggest that 1,500 villages - home to more than a million people - have in some way been affected, mainly in the worst-hit districts of Krishna, Prakasam, West and East Godavari, Guntur and Vishakapatnam. Aid workers say heavy rains submerged several villages and gale force winds toppled trees, disrupted power and communication lines and ripped through mud and thatch roof homes. Poor fishing communities have borne the brunt of the disaster, say aid workers, with homes damaged or destroyed and fishing boats, nets and engines washed out to sea. Aid workers and officials report that thousands of hectares of cash crops such as mango, banana and betel nut have also been destroyed, leaving many farming communities vulnerable. "It's difficult to assess the full extent of the damage. We will have to wait for water levels to recede to get a full picture," said Vikas Gora from Sphere India, an emergency response coordination body of government, U.N. and aid agencies. "I believe the state authorities will start a damage assessment on Monday." POSSIBLE GAPS? Aid workers applauded the state's disaster preparedness ahead of the cyclone. More than 70,000 coast-dwellers were evacuated to some 300 relief camps, while fishing operations were suspended, trains and flights were cancelled and the army was deployed for search and rescue. Andhra Pradesh is no stranger to natural disasters, said aid workers, attributing its effective early warning preparations to long experience in dealing with cyclones and floods. There have been 60 cyclones over the past century, with their regularity increasing in the last few decades to one almost every three years. The deadliest cyclone in November 1977 killed about 10,000 people. But some aid workers say while authorities are good at preparing for disasters, they may struggle to deal with the aftermath as needs will be high and resources limited. "I think additional support from the international NGOs will be required as there will be gaps in delivery which we can help the government with," said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, regional emergency manager for Christian Aid. "Some of those who were evacuated will need to stay in relief shelters for up to five days as they may have nothing to go back to. Others will have to wait for water levels to recede in their villages before returning, so a lot of emergency aid is needed." High on the list of needs are dry food rations, water purification tablets, tarpaulins and ropes, clothes and cooking utensils, along with basic temporary toilets to prevent disease in the aftermath of the disaster, aid workers s
