 Rangamati, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  A prominent tribal leader has accused all the governments that have been in power since the CHT peace accord was signed 13 years ago of betraying the indigenous peoples in the hill tracks. The accusation was made by Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council (CHTRC) chairman Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, also known as Shantu Larma, at the 21st foundation day of Pahari Chhatra Parishad (PCP) and inaugural ceremony of 15th council in Rangamamti on Thursday. The failure to implement the accord is continuing the violence and bloodshed in the hills, he said. "The tribals of CHT are still living in fear and insecurity. The terrorism of UPDF and the different ploys of the government have made the situation in the CHT worse." He warned that there would be a combined movement of the students and public if these ploys are not stopped. He termed the actions of the Land Commission as 'deceptive'. "Every government is playing the same old game so that the peace accord is not implemented", said Shantu. He thinks that the actions of the land commission would increase the disputes rather than settling them. The chairman of the Land Commission Justice Khademul Islam is doing politics instead of following the law, he claimed. The Jana Sanghati Samity (JSS) chairman accused the anti-peace accord United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF) of terrorism and demanded that they be banned. In the ceremony presided over by PCP central president Udayan Tripura, the dean of social sciences faculty of Chittagong University Dr. Gazi Mohammad Salahuddin, JSS central leader KS Mong Marma and other leaders spoke. bdnews24
