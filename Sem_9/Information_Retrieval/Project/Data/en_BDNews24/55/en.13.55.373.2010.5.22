<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has termed the opposition BNP's comments on the government and war crimes trial 'conspiratorial' and 'ill-motivated'. "Those who committed crimes against humanity in 1971 must face trials. There's no question about it," the minister told reporters after attending a seminar in the capital on Saturday. "But the speeches of different BNP leaders on this issue are conspiratorial and ill-motivated," he said. Senior BNP leader Goyeshwar Chandra Roy on Friday and senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Saturday commented that the government was raising the war crimes trail issue to hide its failures. Mentioning the steps taken to try the war criminals of 1971, the law minister said, "There is no scope politicise this issue. There has been a lot of development." "The trial will start after the investigation committee submits its report," the minister said. Shafique said the report would be submitted "within a few days." He said, "This trial cannot be stopped by speeches. Trial of (war criminals) will certainly happen no matter what the BNP says." Regarding the resignation of a probe committee member, the minister said, "The report of ASM Shamsul Arefin's resignation is not true." "He did not resign. He was merely taken ill." bdnew
