 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP's Chittagong mayor candidate M Manzurul Alam submitted his nomination paper on Thursday. He submitted his nomination to returning officer Jasmine Tuli around 3:30pm. Manzur was flanked by Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, general secretary Shahdat Hossain and Chittagong south district BNP president Zafrul Islam Chowdhury. He is contesting the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation polls as a candidate of Chittagong Unnyan Andolan, an organisation of pro-BNP professionals. Former acting mayor and long-time councilor of Chittagong City Corporation, Manzur got the green light from the main opposition party on May 17. Thursday was the last date for nomination submission. Mayor aspirants who previously submitted nomination papers were Awami League's ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Jamaat-e-Islami's Afsaruddin Chowdhury and Jatiya Party's Solaiman Alam Sheth. The Election Commission on Wednesday warned Manzur for violating the electoral code of conduct. Manzur, involved with Awami League politics for a long time, is the councillor of CCC ward number 10. He filled in for mayor Mohiuddin after the latter was arrested by the joint forces during the 2007-8 military-controlled interim government. He ran in the ninth parliament polls as an independent candidate from a Chittagong seat and finished third.
