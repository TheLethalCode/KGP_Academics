<TITLE> Okinawa governor says US base plan tough to accept </TITLE>

 TOKYO, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The governor of Japan's Okinawa said on Sunday it would be tough to accept a US-Japan plan to keep a controversial US air base on the island, dealing a blow to the government ahead of a mid-year election. Voter perception that Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has mishandled the Futenma air base row has eroded government support, threatening the ruling Democratic Party's chances in the upper house election, which it must win to avoid policy deadlock. Hatoyama has set himself a deadline of the end of May to resolve the problem, which has also frayed ties with Tokyo's key security ally Washington as they confront security challenges such as an unpredictable North Korea and a rising China. "Concerns and anger that people in Okinawa have are understandable," Hatoyama told Okinawa Governor Hirokazu Nakaima in a meeting at the Okinawa prefecture office, as a crowd of protesters stood outside carrying signs opposing the plan and shouting "Go home". "But as shown in recent developments in the Korean peninsula, uncertainty remains over security in East Asia and we cannot let the deterrence of U.S. military forces in Japan decline. "It is a heart-rending decision for me," Hatoyama added, and apologised to the people of Okinawa. In a brief visit on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said North Korea's sinking of a South Korean navy ship had underscored the importance of the alliance. But the governor of Okinawa, host to about half the U.S. forces in Japan, said it would be hard to win local support for the plan to move the base to the Henoko area of the northern city of Nago -- largely in line with a 2006 deal between Washington and Tokyo. "The idea of moving the base to Henoko is quite regrettable and (accepting it) is extremely tough," Nakaima told Hatoyama in the meeting, aired live on nationwide TV. LOCAL ANGER In the campaign that swept his party to power last year, Hatoyama had raised hopes that the U.S. Marines' base could be moved off Okinawa, but Washington has sought to stick to the 2006 deal to move the facility to Nago. Hatoyama later shifted gears, saying some Marines had to stay to deter threats, a move that has outraged many Okinawans and upset a small ruling party, the Social Democrats. "We will meet with the prime minister later, but the chapter's stance remains (that the base should be moved) outside the prefecture or the country," a representative of the ruling Democratic Party's Okinawa local chapter told TV Asahi. Hatoyama will meet business leaders and local town leaders in Okinawa later in the day, but faces a tough road ahead. Details of the new deal with Washington, including the exact location of a new runway and the construction method, are to be worked out before U.S. President Barack Obama visits Japan in November for an Asia-Pacific leaders summit, Japanese media said. Hatoyama said the government would continue to negotiate with the United States to lessen the burden on Okinawa, where residents have long resented bearing what they feel is an unfair burden for maintaining the security alliance. "I don't consider this as the en
