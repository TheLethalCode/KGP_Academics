 NORTH SOUND, Antigua, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa eased to a 66-run victory over West Indies thanks to centuries by Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers and some aggressive bowling in the first one-day international on Saturday. West Indies' batsmen wilted to 215 all out from 44.1 overs as they chased the tourists' total of 280-7 from 48 overs which was powered by Amla and de Villiers who both scored 102. Amla registered his second career ODI century while de Villiers struck his third ODI ton on the trot as they put on 129 for the third wicket to lay the foundation for a big total. Amla struck eight fours at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Grounds from 109 deliveries while de Villiers hit five fours and two sixes off 101 balls. All-rounder Dwayne Bravo bowled with control to finish with figures of three for 40 from 10 overs. In the run chase Chris Gayle top scored for the hosts with 45 from 39 balls including eight powerful fours while Kieron Pollard blasted 44 from 37 deliveries with five fours and a six. Their efforts were not nearly adequate enough to threaten South Africa's total as lanky pacer Morne Morkel captured three for 40 from eight overs. He was supported by Dale Steyn and Ryan McLaren (both two for 37) and Johan Botha (two for 47). The second game in the five-match series will take place on Monday at the same venue before the teams move to Dominica for a double header and Jamaica for the final
