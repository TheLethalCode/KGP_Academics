 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnwews24.com)Bangladesh and Russia have agreed to strengthen their ties in the areas of defence and energy including the oil and gas sector. The two countries discussed the possible areas of cooperation on Friday at the talks between foreign minister Dipu Moni and her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. The two ministers witnessed the signing of a framework agreement on implementing a 2000 megawatts nuclear power plant in Pabna with Russian assistance. State minister for science and ICT Yafes Osman and director general of Russia's atomic energy cooperation 'Rosatom' Sergei Kiriyenko signed the deal on peaceful use of nuclear technology. "The two ministers concurred on intensifying traditional cooperation in the areas of education and defense between the two friendly countries," said a foreign ministry press statement issued on Friday. Foreign ministry sources say Dipu Moni is in Russia to prepare the grounds for talks on possible areas of cooperation ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Russia visit, which may take place in December or January next year. The two foreign ministers emphasised working together in oil and gas exploration and development of the sector, said the statement. Delegations of Russian state company, Gazprom, will visit Bangladesh for assessment and conclusion of an memorandum of understanding, it added. The Soviet experts helped Bangladesh built its major power stations in early 1970s. Bangladesh's oil and gas sector is mainly dominated by the US and other western companies. The Awami League government awarded three offshore blocks to the US and an Irish company for exploration in the Bay of Bengal. Dhaka also agreed to work with China and India to improve its domestic power situation during the present government's tenure, which would expire on January 24, 2014. The press statement also said Dipu Moni recalled with fondness the enormous contributions made by the former Soviet Union to the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 as well as to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war ravaged country
