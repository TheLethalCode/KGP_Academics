 Chittagong, May 20 (bdnews24.com) In a surprise development, Reazul Karim, organising secretary of Chittagong metropolitan Awami League, has thrown himself in the race for the mayor's office. Earlier on Thursday , former mayor and Chittagong AL president ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury had submitted his papers, after resigning from his office in the morning. Thursday is the last date for submitting the nomination papers for the election. Reazul said he had submitted his nomination papers as no one had yet been selected from the party bosses in Dhaka. He said he would contest independently and that there was no question of him stepping back now. The main opposition BNP has supported ward councilor M Manzurul Alam, former acting mayor and long-time councilor of the CCC and an AL activist. He is contesting the June 17 polls as a candidate of Chittagong Development Council, an organisation of pro-BNP professionals. Solaiman Alam Sheikh of Jatiya Party, an ally of the ruling Awami League, and Afsar Uddin Chowdhury, of Jamaat-e-Islami, have also submitted their nomination papers. Chittagong metropolitan Jamaat chief M Shamsul Islam, speaking to reporters on behalf of Afsar, had said on Tuesday that since the party did not get any response from the BNP, a major partner of the four-party opposition alliance, Jamaat has decided to put up its own candidate. Islam also claimed that seven parties were supporting Jamaat in the election, namely National Democratic Party, Islami Oikyo Jote, Khelafat Majlish, Bangladesh Jatiya Party, Jatiya Party (Manju) and National People's Party. Meanwhile, ward councilors and women ward councilors have been submitting their nomination papers to the election commission office since the morning. bdnews24.
