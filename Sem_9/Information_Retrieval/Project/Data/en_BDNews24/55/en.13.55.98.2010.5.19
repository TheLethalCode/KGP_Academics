 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said on Wednesday that the Anti-corruption Commission officials would not get away for their repressive behaviour. She said ACC officials behaved in that fashion only with opposition party leaders and activists. Khaleda alleged that the ACC had been turned into a silent subservient agency of the political government and thus did not find corruption among the ruling government officials. The ACC recently quizzed a few standing committee members of the BNP for alleged corruption. bdnew
