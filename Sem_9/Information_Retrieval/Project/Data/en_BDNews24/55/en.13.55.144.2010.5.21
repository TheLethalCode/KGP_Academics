<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has asked the government to behave democratically when she condemned the killing of Juba Dal leader Akbar Hossain. The main opposition party claims Hossain, 35, was killed on his way to attend the BNP's rally on Wednesday. In a statement, the former prime minister blamed the ruling Awami League activists for the killing. Khaleda said, "The brutal killing of Akbar, obstruction to the political programme of the opposition, naked attacks on journalists, intellectuals and columnists were the manifestation of the fascist BAKSAL character of the Awami League." The opposition chief demanded immediate arrest of the murderers of Akbar, whose body was recovered from the Buriganga River and is believed to have been killed by pro-government activists on his way to Wednesday's BNP rally at Paltan ground in Dhaka. Condemning the 'terrorist' activities of the ruling Awami Leaguye, Khaleda said, "Since this government does not believe in democracy, it lets loose its party cadres on the oppositition activists to suppress their fundamental rights. "Tender-grabbing, extortion, occupation and rape have become a part of their regular activities," Khaleda said. In the statement, she also mentioned people's sufferings from the unchecked rise in the prices of essentials. bdnew
