 MADRID, May 23 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Jose Mourinho, fresh from guiding Inter Milan to Champions League glory, will sign a four-year deal with Real Madrid worth 10 million euros a year, Spanish newspapers reported on Sunday. AS claimed the Portuguese coach had come to an agreement with Real president Florentino Perez on Friday, the day before Mourinho's Inter Milan side beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in the Champions League final in Madrid.
