 ADDIS ABABA. May 23 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Ethiopians voted Sunday in legislative elections widely predicted to return the ruling regime to power but key opposition leaders cried foul within hours of the polls opening. They accused Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's ruling EPRDF party of barring opposition observers from polling stations and rigging the ballot. "It doesn't look like an election, even by African standards," said Merara Gudina, one of the top leaders of the opposition coalition Medrek, adding that ballot boxes had been stuffed in some areas. The election commission said it had no evidence of fraud and that its officers were on the ground to ensure the vote was running smoothly. The last polls in 2005 saw the opposition record its best ever showing but led to violence that killed 200 people and triggered a government crackdown that left the regime's main challengers jailed, exiled or greatly weakened. With the country's most charismatic opposition figure in prison and what rights groups have criticised as shrinking political freedom during the campaign, Meles seems guaranteed to keep his job. Merara cited several cases of suspected fraud in the southern opposition stronghold of Oromiya, particularly in the town of Ambo. "As of now, 80 percent of all the polling stations of this whole area around Ambo, are without our observers," Merara told AFP in Guder, another town in Oromiya, a region home to Ethiopia's largest tribe. "In some areas, we even heard that ballot boxes were opened and stuffed before the arrival of our people," he said. "There is no law that forces us to accept any result. We'll review our assessment regarding the elections tomorrow. But one thing is for sure, all this cheating was done with millions of witnesses," Merara added. Negasso Gidada, another opposition leader and former Ethiopian president, also alleged that supporters of Meles' Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front had been accompanying voters into polling booths to influence their decision. "There is the question of the voting booths and whether the secrecy of the voting process is properly protected," he said. "We are not yet sure, it is an impression we have." Adissu Buebre Egziabher, the vice chairman of the electoral board, denied the fraud allegations and insisted all of the opposition parties' demands on the voting process had been met. "This is totally absurd. They are complaining without any evidence. Our officers are on the ground and making sure that everything is going well," he told AFP. Polling stations started opening at 6:00 am (0300 GMT) for the vast Horn of Africa nation's 32 million registered voters to elect the 547-strong lower House of Representatives, as well as regional councillors who in turn will pick the upper chamber of parliament. Meles cast his ballot in his native town in the northern region of Tigray, where the ex-rebel leader faces unprecedented opposition from some former comrades-in-arms who are disenchanted with what they say is an increasingly dictatorial rule. Human Rights Watch has charged that Meles has taken tough measures to avoid a repeat of the "mistakes" that nearly cost him victory in 2005. It accused the government of "waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents, journalists, and rights activists" in the run-up to the polls. Birtukan Mideksa, the 36-year-old woman who emerged from the 2005 electoral chaos as Ethiopia's most inspirational opposition figure, is serving a life sentence in jail. She has often been dubbed "the Ethiopian Aung San Suu Kyi", in reference to Myanmar's detained pro-democracy activist. Observers say that the rest of the opposition, despite joining forces under the Medrek umbrella, remains weak and divided and has not recovered from the repression that followed the 2005 post-electoral unrest. Despite his poor rights record, Meles is steering ambitious development programmes and rapid economic growth that earn him solid support at home and abroad. Foreign criticism of the regime's authoritarianism has been all the more muted as Meles -- whose country borders Eritrea and Somalia -- remains a key US and Western ally in the fight against Islamic extremism. "It's a great thing if there are several opposition parties, but when it comes to the long-term stability of the country and the region, Meles is still your best bet," one Addis-based diplomat s
