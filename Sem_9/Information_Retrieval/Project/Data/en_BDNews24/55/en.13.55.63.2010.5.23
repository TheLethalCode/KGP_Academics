<TITLE> Euro crisis means UK must act on debt: Clegg </TITLE>

"I don't think we anticipated ... quite how sharply the economic conditions in the euro zone would have deteriorated and the need to show that we need to get to grips with this suddenly became much greater," Clegg told BBC television. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition will Monday announce details of 6 billions pounds of savings to be made by government departments this year -- a move intended to reassure markets about the future path of borrowing. Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, had fought the election campaign arguing that Britain's post-recession economy was too fragile to cut government spending this year. Britain's budget deficit is running above 11 percent of gross domestic product and will require painful and prolonged cuts to government spending and tax rises to bring it under control.
