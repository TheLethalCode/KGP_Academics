 MUNICH, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Penpix of Bayern Munich's squad for the Champions League final against Inter Milan in Madrid on Saturday. Goalkeepers: 22-Hans-Joerg Butt 28.05.1974. The veteran won the starting spot late last year and has consolidated his position with solid performances throughout the season that also earned him a Germany call-up. Cool and composed under pressure. 1-Michael Rensing 14.05.1984. Lost number one spot to Butt and will be leaving at the end of the season. Has problems with high balls, set pieces. 35-Thomas Kraft 22.07.1988. Third choice this season, Kraft will be number two behind Butt from next term. Defenders: 5-Daniel van Buyten 07.02.1978. The powerful Belgian has lost some speed and edge this season though he is still a strong player and a danger up front who likes to score with headers from set pieces. 6-Martin Demichelis 20.12.1980. The Argentine has committed the odd howler this season but on a good day he is in complete command of the central defence. 21-Philipp Lahm 11.11.1983. Hailed as one of the world's best right backs, Lahm can be equally effective on the other side as well as pouring forward. 26-Diego Contento 01.05.1990. A revelation this season, has grabbed every chance he was given and is challenging for a starting spot. 28-Holger Badstuber 13.03.1989. The left-footer with a fierce free kick has developed into one of Germany' most solid defenders and has also been called up for the World Cup squad. Midfielders: 8-Hamit Altintop 08.12.1982. Will most likely step in for the suspended Franck Ribery. A defensive-minded midfielder who also possesses a powerful right foot. 10-Arjen Robben 23.01.1984. Bayern's inspirational winger, Robben can turn a match with one instinctive move. His trademark move is to cut in from the right and release a powerful left-footed shot. 17-Mark van Bommel 22.04.1977. Experienced midfielder who won the Champions League with Barcelona. Hard-working and hard-tackling. Reckless challenges have often seen him sent off. 23-Danijel Pranjic 02.12.1981. The Croat has improved during the season and has been a reliable option on the left wing. Can also be used in a defensive role and has a good long-range shot. 31-Bastian Schweinsteiger 01.08.1984. Has matured this season as Bayern's playmaker in midfield with almost every offensive move passing through him. 44-Anatoliy Tymoshchuk 30.03.1979. The Ukrainian holding midfielder has been unhappy with the little playing time he has been given since joining last year. Has a powerful right foot. Strikers 11-Ivica Olic 14.09.1979. A real workhorse up front, the Croat has scored many crucial goals this season and is always a threat. Does not need much space to score. 18-Miroslav Klose 09.06.1978. With only three goals in the league this season, the Germany international has been reduced to a bench role. 25-Thomas Mueller 13.09.1989. A Bayern youth team product, Mueller has been outstanding in his first full season with the first team. Is equally comfortable whipping crosses from the wings as he is in the role of a centre forward. 33-Mario Gomez 10.07.1985. Has failed to win a starting spot in his first season following his Bundesliga record transfer. Always dangerous in the
