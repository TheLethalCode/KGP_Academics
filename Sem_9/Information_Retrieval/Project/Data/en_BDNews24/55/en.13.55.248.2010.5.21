 New Delhi, May 20 (bdnews24.com) Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday asked a national committee to chalk out programs for celebrating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore jointly with Bangladesh. In his opening remarks at the first meeting of India's National Committee for Commemoration of 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath, Singh recalled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January this year. "We agreed that the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh would oversee the joint celebrations of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore in 2011 in a manner befitting his vision and spirit. The Committee will have to consider how we could fulfill this commitment and how to associate Tagore's many followers in Bangladesh in the commemoration events," he said. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee who was also present, said that the Indian Government had decided "to lay special emphasis on joint Indo-Bangladesh celebrations". During a meeting in New Delhi on January 11, Hasina and Singh had recalled the shared legacy of the great Nobel Laureate poet, who had penned the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh. Singh on Thursday said that Tagore had travelled to the farthest corners of the globe and was remembered with reverence and affection in many countries. He stressed that Indian Embassies in different countries should be involved in "rekindling interest in Tagore and to build on the historic cultural links". He emphasized the need to pay special attention to the dreams of University of Tagore, the Visva Bharati, in Shantiniketan in eastern Indian state of West Bengal. Referring to the suggestions of the high-level committee set up by the Indian Government for rejuvenation of the varsity under the leadership of former governor of the state Gopalkrishna Gandhi, he said, "The Government of India has released funds for the implementation of the recommendations. But we should go further and I would like the Committee to use its knowledge and experience to see how we can revive this historic institution and restore it to its former glory." On May 9, Indian Railways launched a special exhibition train called Sanskriti Express at Howrah Station in West Bengal. The exhibition train has coaches named Jiban Smriti, Gitanjali, Muktadhara and Chitralekha. The Jiban Smriti provides a glimpse of Tagore's life through photographs, while his songs, poems and letters were put on display in Gitanjali. Muktadhara takes visitors on a journey through his novels, essays and plays, and Chitralekha depicts his paintings, while the fifth coach depicts the last journey of Tagore. The Sanskriti Express is likely to travel through India before returning to Howrah before May 8 in 2011. The Indian Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee is believed to be keen to send the exhibition train to Dhaka too. The Indian Government is also contemplating creating a coveted award in the honour of Gurudev Rabindranath and set up an Asian Research Centre to reaffirm the bonds with Asian countries that Tagore had created. Apart from the Prime Minister; the President of India's ruling Congress party Sonia Gandhi, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, External Affairs Minister S M Krishna Culture Minister Ambika Soni, Human Resource Development Minister and other members of the committee were present in the meeting. The committee was set up by India's Union Government to oversee celebrations of Tagore's 150th birth anniversary.
