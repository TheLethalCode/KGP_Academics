<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Saturday sent Zakir, one of the main accused in the SI Gautam Kumar Roy murder case, for a further two-day remand under DB custody in a weapons case. Metropolitan magistrate Muhammad Munimul Hasan gave the order after the police's Detective Branch sought five-day remand. At the same time, the court rejected his bail petition. The remand appeal stated that according to information divulged by Zakir during the grilling for the murder case, a foreign made pistol was recovered from a dump near shanties at Sutrapur's Bhajhari Street. It also stated that the weapon might have been used in the murder of Gautam. The case's invesitigating officer Sub-Inspector (SI) Giasuddin had earlier appealed to question Zakir for seven days on Monday. The court granted four. Zakir was presented to court on Monday by Gautam murder case's IO DB sub-inspector Ruhul Amin, after a 14-day grilling session. Metropolitan magistrate Nazrul Islam ordered Zakir to prison for the murder case and at the same time granted four days of questioning to the DB in the weapons case. Law-enforcement agencies are still at loggerheads over who actually killed sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy last month as RAB and police made two separate arrests in connection with the murder. Both Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police's Detective Branch (DB) claim to have arrested the 'actual' murderers of Bangshal police station's sub-inspector Gautam Kumar Roy. He was shot dead on Apr 20, when he stopped on his way home to question three suspected miscreants on the road. Police arrested Haider and Zakir on Apr 23 and Apr 28 respectively, claiming them to be Gautam's killers. However, RAB also arrested two men with same names on Apr 25 and claimed them as the killers. Police headquarters formed a five-member committee led by CID chief Shah Zamanraj to settle the confusion. The committee is yet to submit its report. b
