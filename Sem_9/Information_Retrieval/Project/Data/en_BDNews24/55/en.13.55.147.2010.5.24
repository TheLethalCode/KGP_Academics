<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, May 24(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Billionaire brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani know how to spring a surprise -- from squabbling over their sprawling business interests to launching audacious takeover bids. And they've done it again -- by choosing a quiet Sunday afternoon to announce they were patching up their differences and ending a non-compete agreement, moving towards reconciliation in their long-running feud and giving a timely boost to the local stock market. Under the non-compete deal, neither brother was free to do what he wanted. Ending that agreement normalises the way they can do business. They can now compete on each other's turf, with the exception of gas-fired power plants, removing a source of friction between Mukesh's Reliance Industries and the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group.

They split a business empire inherited from their father Dhirubhai Ambani in a 2005 deal brokered by their mother, Kokilaben, and some of India's top bankers. The brothers' feud and their grip on corporate India has been a hot topic for years among the country's executives, politicians and the wealthy Gujarati community to which they belong. Mukesh, 53, owns a cricket franchise in India, and spearheaded textile major Reliance Industries' foray into petrochemicals, refining, and oil and gas exploration and production. A chemical engineer by training, Mukesh dropped out of an MBA programme at Stanford University where he was a classmate of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and joined Reliance in 1981. The rift between the two brothers broke into the open soon after Dhirubhai, a schoolteacher's son, died in July 2002. Since then, they have fought over business interests from energy and retail to telecoms, financial services and infrastructure. The two were seen together at their mother's birthday last year, raising hopes of a reconciliation. A brief handshake at an awards function sparked a media frenzy.
