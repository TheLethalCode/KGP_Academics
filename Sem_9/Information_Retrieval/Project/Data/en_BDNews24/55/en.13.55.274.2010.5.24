 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Shamsul Hoque Tuku has claimed that BNP's call for hartal has links with militants activities. He referred to the grenade attack on the police in Jurain in Dhaka on Sunday night and said,"I'm alarmed. The militants have sprung into action immediately after the hartal announcement." Main opposition BNP called for a countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike on June 27 to 'caution' the government. Seven police members received injuries in the attack while raiding a hideout of militants at Jurain on Sunday night. Four others were also injured during the raid-including one of the alleged militants, the house owner and two local people, police said. Tuku went to see the injured at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Monday, accompanied by police chief Nur Mohammad. "The militants launched the attack prepared," the junior minister said. Kodamtali police chief Ayubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that militants threw bombs at them during a raid on an apartment at Commissioner Road. The assailants were members of the banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Bangladesh, police said and added that one of injured confessed to being a member of the outlawed party. He said additional superintendent of police Jannatul Hasan, aided by Kodomtali police, led the operation by a team of antimilitancy unit of Special Branch of Police. As the team went to the second floor, a bomb was thrown at them from inside the house, leaving policemen standing in front of the door and on the stairs injured, Rahman said. A wounded policeman told reporters at the hospital that they had come under the bomb attack after a woman opened the doors, switched on the lights and saw the police. b
