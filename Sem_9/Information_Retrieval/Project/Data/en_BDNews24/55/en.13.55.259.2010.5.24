 Chittagong, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Only a day after claiming that Chittagong BNP was united and fully behind him, mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam said that he would complain to Khaleda Zia for the lack of support from some party members. Manzur Alam, having secured BNP's endorsement for the June 17 city corporation polls, said this when exchanging views with the port city's Juba Dal activists at his residence in Kattali on Sunday. City Juba Dal secretary Kazi Belal had led his activists from 41 wards of the city to Manzur's residence. However, the youth wing's president Abu Hashem Bakar along with his associates, loyal to BNP's vice president Abdullah Al Noman, were missing. Manzur said to those who were present, "Many have come while many others have not." Referring to Khaleda Zia in the way she is generally addressed by her party men, Manzur said that, 'Madam would be informed about it'. Addressing the Juba Dal activists, Manzur said that the time for disappointments and rifts were over. "A committee is being formed to conduct the election." He also said, "Juba Dal and Chhatra Dal activists will have to go from door to door to bring voters to the polling centres." "They will have to watch the polling centres so that the voters can cast votes peacefully," Manzur added. On Sunday noon, the pro-BNP mayor candidate Manzur told journalists at his Dewanhat office that he aims to meet the people's demands. When asked about the election campaign strategy, he said that an election management committee would determine it. Earlier on Saturday, Manzur had claimed that the rumours of a rift within the BNP were being spread to weaken the party's campaign, after attending a meeting of Chittagong metropolitan (North) BNP's working committee. Chittagong North BNP president Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury also affirmed that there was no conflict over Manzur Alam's nomination for the mayoral election. The formal campaign for the June 17 election is yet to begin. Meanwhile the candidates are carrying out their individual campaigns. BNP has backed the Chittagong Unnayan Andolan candidate Manzur Alam in the CCC polls. Ward councillor Manzur was once associated with BNP's main political rival the ruling Awami League and has been a long time confidant of his current rival, Mohiuddin Chowdhury who is seeking an unprecedented fourth tenure. Manzur came third in the last parliamentary election where he contended as an independent candidate from a Chittagong constituency. A section of Chittagong metropolitan BNP leaders and workers had expressed strong reservations initially when he was given the party's blessings. But BNP's district and city leaders accompanied him when he filed his nomination papers. Chittagong city BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury is acting as Manzur's chief polling agent. bdnews24.com/a
