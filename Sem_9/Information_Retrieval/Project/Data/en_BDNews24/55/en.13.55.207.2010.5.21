<TITLE> PKSF chief bucks micro-credit legacy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)PKSF has admitted that the organisation was wrong to focus in the last twenty years on only giving micro-credit it when it was set up to assist rural job generation. Whilst introducing a new initiative on rural employment generation, Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, chairman of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) questioned the potency of micro-credit Kholiquzzaman said, "For the last 20 years, PKSF has deviated from its true path and concentrated on micro-credit only." The organisation has had a long practice of disbursing micro-credit through selected organisations since its creation in 1990. The PKSF chief, also a noted economist, said it was high time to evaluate whether the foundation's main goal had been achieved, regardless of the phenomenal loan recovery rate of 99 percent. The new initiative, ENRICH  short for Enhancing Resources and Increasing Capacities of Poor Housholds Towards Elimination of their Poverty  targets 55,000 families. "We have now taken steps towards combined household-based development," said Kholiquzzaman, explaining that this new initiative would put much emphasis on education and healthcare. This project titled 'Total Household Development' started on May 3 and will be implemented at 21 union councils at first, through 21 partner agencies. Kholiquzzaman said, "No family or country can progress, based on loans alone." PKSF initiatives would target 'asset creation' and enhancing individual capabilities for sustainable poverty eradication, he explained Until now, the foundation has enlisted 1.05 crore families under its loan programmes, of which 83 lakh beneficiaries have received loans. Kholiquzzaman also said the foundation was undertaking research to find answers to four questions  whether interest rate of micro-credit is more than the actual service charge, whether loans helped create employment, what is the health and educational status of the beneficiaries and their children, and whether the beneficiaries will keep on taking loans throughout their lives. Elaborating on the reasons behind these queries, he highlighted PKSF's prime objective of implementing countrywide poverty reduction programmes through employment generation. "We need to have a re-evaluation to see how much we have achieved." He said that the new initiative would make optimum use of assets and capabilities of the target households. Although the foundation would be taking a different course it would still continue to disburse loans. He, however, refused to call it micro-credit, preferring the term 'development loans', meant for genuine poverty reduction. Taking a swipe at traditional micro-credit, Kholiquzzaman said the development loans would not make poor farmers even poorer. "Instead, it will generate employment and enhance skills." The Dishari project will be primarily test-run at 21 unions. "We think that it will be possible to expand the programme to 150 unions within the next one and a half years," the PKSF chief said.. bdnews2
