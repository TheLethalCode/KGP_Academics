 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com) -- The cabinet on Monday approved a draft law for launching an expatriates welfare bank that will give loan to would-be expats. A regular meeting of the cabinet, headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, approved the Expatriates' Welfare Bank Act, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters later. Finance minister AMA Muhith last week sent the draft law with recommendation from Bangladesh Bank to the Cabinet Division. Azad said the debtors can repay their loan in foreign currency. The bank will have a capital of Tk 500 crore and Tk 100 crore of it will be paid-up capital, of which the government will provide five percent while the remainder will come from Wage Earners Welfare Fund. "This bank is being set up on the orders of the prime minister considering the trials and tribulations of expatriate workers. The government will give loans to run the bank, if needed." "The prime minister has said it is not to be seen if the bank makes profit or not. The main role of the bank will be ensuring hundred percent welfare of the expatriates." He also said if necessary, this bank may run operations as a commercial or scheduled bank on the approval of Bangladesh Bank. NOn-resident Bangladeshis sent home over Tk 73,000 crore in 2009. The foreign ministry, labour ministry, and expatriates welfare and overseas employment ministry will be on the board of the bank's directors. A proposal to sign the 'Rules of Origin' of the 'Trade Preferential System among the member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference' and the offer list for the countries under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) were approved, he added. The cabinet also approved Bangladesh Textile University Act 2010. It decided to annul the amendments on the Women and Child Repression Prevention Act 2000. The previous caretaker government made the change. Moreover, draft of the Dhaka Mass Transit Authority (DMTA) Act 2010 was placed before the meeting. The meeting, however, insisted on further amendments and asked for its resubmission after necessary changes. The cabinet was also informed of the 16th SAARC Conference, visit of the state minister for the environment to the United Kingdom, his participation in a seminar at Calcutta and Biodiversity National Assessment and Programme of Action 2020, the press secretary added
