 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP claims that the man from Munshiganj whose body the police recovered from Buriganga River was its activist. It alleged that Akbar Hossain, 35, had been killed by pro-government activists on his way to Wednesday's BNP rally at Paltan ground. South Keraniganj Police recovered the body from the river near Sadarghat floating dock 10 around 1:30pm. BNP leaders claimed that the ruling Awami League-backed Sramik League activists had attacked and killed Akbar when he had arrived at Sadarghat on a launch from Munsiganj to join the rally. Munshiganj's Juba Dal president Moniruzzaman Monir identified the body and told journalists that two more of their activists had gone missing following the clash with the pro-government workers wing at the dock. The police confirmed the clash between Sramik League and BNP activists at Sadarghat on Wednesday. Sadarghat police sub-inspector Mozammel Haque told journalists that there had been a 'minor clash' between the opposing groups. Keraniganj police sub-inspector Monirul Islam told bdnews24.com that Akbar's body bore a wound in the forehead. However, the police official could not confirm whether the wound was caused by a weapon or by an accident. Dhaka City Corporation mayor and BNP vice-president Sadeque Hossain Khoka went to see the corpse at Mitford Hospital in the afternoon where it was sent for autopsy. Khoka claimed Sadarghat's Sramik League killed the BNP activist and dumped the body in the river. "If the government does not take proper steps to arrest the pertpetrators, BNP will take steps on its own and give reply to the attack." Juba Dal leader Monir said, "Sramik League activists barred us from docking the launch at the terminal when we had reached Sadarghat to join the rally at Paltan ground." The pro-BNP leader also said that around 1,500 BNP activists led by Munshiganj BNP president Abdul Hai came to Dhaka by a launch. Monir alleged that the pro-government activists also pushed some of their men into the river from the terminal. "We pulled them up and headed for the rally. Later, we realised that three were missing." Juba Dal's central committee vice-president Abdus Salam Azad told journalists that Joynal, 32, of Juba Dal and Kamal, 28, of BNP were still missing. Akbar was the organising general secretary of Munsiganj's Mir Kadim municipality Juba Dal, added Azad. Munsiganj Chatra Dal president Aminul Islam Jashim said that Akbar was the eldest among the seven sons and one daughter of his parents. bdnews24.
