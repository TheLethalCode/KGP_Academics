 Sylhet, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Imports and exports on Monday resumed at Tamabil land port of Goainghat Upazila in Sylhet after being closed for six days. Tamabil land port superintendent Aminul Islam said that the port was first closed for three days from May 18 because Indian workers called a three-day Bandh (strike) on May 18 following a clash the previous day between Khasia and Nepali tribals at Shilong in India. The strike ended on May 20. This was then followed by three days of government holidays on either the Bangladesh or India side, Islam said on Monday.
