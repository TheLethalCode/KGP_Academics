<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)-Ferry operations have been severely hampered at Mawa-Kaurakandi pier after four docks sank under water on Friday because of the sudden surge in the water levels of the Padma River over the last two days. Two ferries have also gone out of order. Docks 1 and 3 of Kaurakandi pier at Madaripur's Shibchar went underwater. On the other side of the river, Dock 2 of Munshiganj's Mawa pier also sank. The day before, the RORO ferry floating dock number 3 was also submerged. bdnews24.com Munshiganj and Madaripur correspondents said that the halt in operations have caused huge traffic congestion with hundreds of vehicles being stuck on both sides. BIWTA's manager at Mawa pier Sirajul Haque said the sudden four-feet rise in Padma waters has caused the docks to sink. However, the situation was somewhat tackled by raising two docks at Mawa and one at Kaurakandi. He also said, "Ferry operations have been stopped as the floating dock number 3 for Roll off and Roll on (RORO) ferries has gone out of order at Kaurakandi. Repairs are ongoing." BIWTA said it was trying to relocate docks 1 and 3 of Keurakandi to bring them back into operation. The other three docks are also at risk. Of the 12 ferries, five are out of operations. Two K-type ferries have gone out of order and three RORO ferries cannot operate due to a lack of docks. Even though seven small K-type ferries are in operation, problems are being faced during loading and unloading of vehicles, it added. BIWTA assistant general manager Ashiquzzaman said two piers of Kaurakandi went out of operation on Thursday evening. He said they expected the two ports to be relocated by Friday night or Saturday morning. bdnews24.co
