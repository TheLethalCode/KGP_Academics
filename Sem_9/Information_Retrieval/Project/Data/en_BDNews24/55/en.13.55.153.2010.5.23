<TITLE> Jewellers' margins squeezed </TITLE>

 Vicenza, May 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Some of Italy's smaller jewellers are working hand-to-mouth to navigate their way out of the downturn in fortunes created by a rocky global economic backdrop, the industry-funded World Gold Council said on Saturday. Daniela Invernizzi, the WGC's Italian representative, said manufacturers reported encouraging signs for the first three months of 2010, with some of their key target markets returning to purchase after working through inventories.

'What they see now is unfortunately the orders are being placed in smaller quantities,' Invernizzi said. 'They are unable to work on a long plan. This reduces the margin and gives uncertainty to the industry.'

"They have had to reduce their workforces." Designers are also facing the challenge of matching purchasing power with design as the impact of high gold prices forces price consciousness among buyers. Many new designs contain a lower proportion of gold, as prices of the metal remain elevated after hitting record levels near US$1,250 (S$1,757) per ounce on the back of an investment
