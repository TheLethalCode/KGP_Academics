 Jahanginagar University, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Four days after the Jahangirnagar University unit of the pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League established a new committee, rival factions within the BCL attacked each other leaving vice president Rashed Reza Dicken and at least seven others injured. Witnesses say on Monday the BCL group led by Dicken was attacked at Bhasani Hall by Md Asgar Ali and his supporters. Dicken told journalists that he was asleep at the time. The injured were sent to the National Orthopaedic Hospital in Dhaka. After the incident, the university BCL committee expelled its joint secretary Asgar for an indefinite period, according to a notice signed by JU BCL president M Rashedul Islam Shafin. A new committee of the BCL unit was formed on May 20 after the old one was dissolved last year following rampant clashes over establishing supremacy on the campus after the Awami League government assumed power. This is the first inter-party clash at JU after the declaration of the new committee. According to the witnesses, at around 3:30am Asgar, Suman, Sohan, Samrat, Ferdous, Raj and their supporters attacked Dicken and his followers. They beat up Dicken, Mahbub Munna, Ujjal Hossain, Arafat Zaman, Mostafa Sadik, Al Amin, Mahmud and Sanjir with machetes and iron rods, seriously injuring them. Most of the injured had their legs and hands broken, witnesses said. They were given first aid at the campus medical centre, but soon transferred to the Orthopaedic Hospital in Dhaka. JU BCL has submitted a memorandum to the vice chancellor demanding punishment of Asgar and his followers within 24 hours. University Pro-vice chancellor Farhad Hossain (administration) and the proctor visited the injured at the campus medical centre. "Asgar and Suman attacked me and my supporters while we were sleeping," Dicken told the journalists. Asgar and Suman could not be reached for their their version of the incident. bdnews24.com/
