 NEW DELHI, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) An Air India Express passenger plane from Dubai crashed outside an airport in southern India on Saturday, killing 158 people when it burst into flames after overshooting the runway and ploughing into a forest. There were only eight survivors after the Boeing 737-800, with 166 people on board including crew, appeared to have skidded off the runway in rain at Mangalore airport in Karnataka state, Air India director Anup Srivastava said. All the passengers were Indian nationals, an Air India official in Dubai said. 19 children are reported to have been on board The accident occurred when the plane overshot the runway of the airport serving the city of Mangalore in Karnataka. Indian airlines has confirmed that the flight was coming in from Dubai with a majority of the passengers coming from Kerela. "The plane apparently overshot the runway and has crashed. We have news that the plane caught fire after crashing," Rohit Katiyar, a top airport security official, told Reuters. NDTV is reporting that the plane is said to have overshot the runaway, hit the instrument landing system at the end of the runway, veered, and fell over the cliff and broke into pieces in the valley below. It is thought that when the plane broke up some people were able to escape NDTV reports that weather does not appear to have been a factor with there only having been light rain. Visibility is reported to have been fine. There are unconfirmed reports of a tyre bursting when the plane landed. TV images showed the plane struck a forested area. Flames were seen blazing from the wreckage as rescue workers fought to bring the fire under control. "The plane had broken into two. I jumped out of the plane after it crashed. I saw two other people also come out," Abdullah, a survivor from the plane, told local channel TV9 from hospital. "There was a tyre-burst kind of noise. I tried to get out of the front but saw that there was a big fire. So I went back again and jumped out from there." Indian Airlines said that the plane was due to land at 6.30 am but in fact landed half an hour earlier. The plane was between four to six years old. The pilot, a Serbian, is reported to have been experienced and had landed at the airport many times. There was no distress signal given by the pilot prior to his landing, and the plane was seen to land normally by ari traffic controllers. Air India said that the plane was between 4 to 6 years old NDTV is also reporting that Prime minister Manmohan SIngh has announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of those killed in the crash and Rs 50,000 for the injured from the PM's National Relief Fund. Air India Express is the budget arm of the loss making state-run carrier Air India, which has been fending off growing competition from private airlines. First indications are that the crash was an accident, officials say. It was India's first major crash in more than a decade, which has seen a boom in private carriers amid growing demand from India's middle class. A series of near misses at major airports, including Delhi and Mumbai, have sparked debate about how India's creaking infrastructure was failing to keep pace with an economic boom. CHARRED BODIES One television channel showed a fireman carrying what seemed to be the remains of a child. Charred bodies lay in the forested terrain. "The flight had already landed. There was slight rain. The flight skidded off," witness Mohiuddin Bava told CNN-IBN channel. "After that it caught fire. Villagers, everyone there, came to rescue." The last major crash in India was in July, 2000, when an Alliance Air Boeing 737-200 crashed into a residential area during a second landing attempt in the eastern city of Patna, killing at least 50 people. With growing competition from private carriers, the Indian government agreed to infuse $1.1 billion (760.4 million pounds) into loss-making Air India if the ailing state-run carrier found the same amount in cost cuts and extra revenue. The airline lost $875 million in the fiscal year ended March 2009. Hundreds of Air India pilots went on strike in September 2009 to protest management plans to cut pay incentives. The strike was called off when aviation minister Praful Patel said the grievances would be dealt with. Rescue operation was hampered by the thick smoke that engulfed the plane, airport authorities said. The prime minister is reported to be monitoring rescue operation
