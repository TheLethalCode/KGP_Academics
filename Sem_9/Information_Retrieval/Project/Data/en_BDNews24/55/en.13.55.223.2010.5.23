<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Police and RAB officials sat in a meeting on Sunday morning to try and resolve the differences between the two law enforcement agencies over the identities of the actual killers of SI Gautam Kumar Roy. The meeting started at around 11am at the office of inspector general of police Noor Mohammad. Law-enforcement agencies have been at loggerheads over who actually killed Bangshal police station's sub-inspector Gautam Roy last month as RAB and police made separate arrests in connection with the murder. Both Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police's Detective Branch (DB) claim to have arrested the 'actual' murderers of Roy, who was shot dead on Apr 20, when he stopped on his way home purportedly to question three suspected criminals on the road. Mona Miah, a witness to the murder, has also been summoned to Sunday's meeting. Police arrested Haider and Zakir on Apr 23 and Apr 28 respectively, claiming them to be Gautam's killers. However, RAB also arrested two men with same names on Apr 25 and claimed them as the killers. Among others present at the meeting were, RAB chief Hasan Mahmud Khandaker, RAB-10 commander SM Kamal Hossain, police's Criminal Investigation Department chief Syed Shah Jamal Raj, Dhaka Metropolitan police commissioner SM Shahidul Haque and Dhaka metropolitan detective police high commissioner Mahbubur Rahman. Police headquarters formed a five-member committee led by CID chief Shah Zamal Raj to settle the confusion. The committee is yet to submit its report. bdne
