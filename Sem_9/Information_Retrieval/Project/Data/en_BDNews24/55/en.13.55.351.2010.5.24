<TEXT>
 Sylhet, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Monday saw a court give the 30th probe extension of a former finance minister's murder. A Sylhet court granted this extension to the CID police to submit its probe report on Shah AMS Kibria's murder 'to ensure fair probe'. Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal judge Muhammad Mahbub-ul-Islam on Monday set June 6 for the submission. The previous deadline set on May 17 expired on Monday. Investigation officer in the case Md Rafiqul Islam, while talking to bdnews24.com, repeated the same reasons for seeking extension: "Preparations to finalise the further probe report has made good progress." "But several suspects in the case have not been arrested yet." "The report will be submitted after their arrest," said Rafiqul, also a senior ASP of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Kishore Kumar Roy, state counsel and special public prosecutor, said the extension was sought to identify the real culprits. The court granted the plea to ensure a fair probe into the murder case. Former finance minister Kibria and four others were killed in a grenade attack in Habiganj on Jan 27, 2005. Local Awami League leader Abdul Majid filed the case with the Habiganj Police Station against unidentified people. But on Sep 22, 2008, the case proceedings were stopped following a request from the plaintiff. The CID officer was then asked to carry out further investigation. bdne
