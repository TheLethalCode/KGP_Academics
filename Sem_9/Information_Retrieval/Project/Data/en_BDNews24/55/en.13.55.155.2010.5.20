<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam has said that BNP's hartal was to obstruct the war crimes trial. "Begum Khaleda Zia has called for the general strike so that the war criminals don't face trials," said Ashraf, who is also the local government and rural development minister. He was speaking at a protest rally held on Thursday to reply to the opposition party chief's speech of the day before. Juba League, the youth wing of the ruling Awami League, organised the rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. He said, "Make your stance clear. Say that you want the trial of war criminals and those who committed crimes against humanity if you really want it." Khaleda had called for a dawn-to-dusk strike on June 27 from a grand rally at Paltan Maidan. Speakers from AL's city unit and Juba League said that the general strike would be countered on the streets. Ashraf read through a written speech at Thursday's rally replying to Khaleda Zia's allegations. Regarding the ruling party's corruption, he said, "How can a prime minister, who has whitened money with fines and speaks in its favour, have the audacity to accuse the government of loot and plunder?" Saying that her sonsTarique Rahman and Arafat Rahmanwere involved in corruption, Ashraf said, "They've siphoned off thousands of crores of taka." "Even a US Federal Court verdict reveals an incident of bribery where Khaleda Zia's two sons were involved." He quoted a former state minister for energy Anwarul Kabir, who had famously said before his resignation that the Hawa Bhaban, BNP's political headquarters, during the BNP regime, had looted thousands of crores. Citing killings, torture and militancy during the BNP government, he said, "There has been no militant attack after the present government came to power." "The government has taken control of law and order." Ashraf said that there was no chance of such attacks without the entente of Khaleda Zia and her allies. AL presidium leader Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said, "I've heard that she (Khaleda Zia) received funds from Pakistan." "She was pushed hard to protest against the war crimes trial. So she called this hartal," the acting AL president added. On BNP's strike on June 27, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said, "You've called a hartal, that's good. It's your democratic right. But the people know what they have to do." "People will take care of the general strike." The minister also said, "We must do something as the government when people suffer." Apparently replying to Khaleda's comments on reinvestigation of the BDR mutiny trial, Matia said, "You too were involved with the BDR plot." Matia said the grand alliance government would certainly provide the statement of assets of its parliament members. In reply to the allegations of not withdrawing cases against the opposition leaders, state minister for law Quamrul Islam said, "No corruption case will be withdrawn if it is filed with specific allegations." bd
