 Jahangirnagar University, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  A section of teachers severely criticised a sexual harassment probe committee's delay in producing a report. Following High Court directives, the committee was charged with investigating sexual harassment complaint against the university's chairman of international relations department, Abdullah Hel Kafi. JU teachers opposed to sexual harassment criticised the administration's attitude in this regard and demanded explanation for the delay in report submission. The teachers made the statements on Sunday at 2.30pm at a press briefing. The administration failed to complete the investigation with 30 days as directed by the High Court and extended it to 60 days, the briefing was told. The university administration did not give any explanation for this delay, which raises uncertainty about the justice. The teachers against harassment showed strong resentment and asked the administration to explain the delay. Dr Abdullah Hel Kafi has been accused of harassing a female teacher of the same department. The female teacher verbally informed this matter to the vice-chancellor, and later, when there was no action, in writing. The harassment still went on and then, she, along with 29 female teachers submitted a letter to the VC on April 15. The VC then assured the teachers that action would be taken by the High Court directed probe committee. May 22 was the last day of the committee's stipulated 30 days. The investigation deadline was extended to 60 days. The probe committee chief, Professor Khurshida Begum, admitted to the time extension. She said since the investigation had not been completed within the deadline, it was being extended. But she refused to elaborate on the progress of the investigation apparently for the 'sake of investigation'. Nasim Akhter Hossain from government and politics department said that the administration will have to explain about this delay. bd
