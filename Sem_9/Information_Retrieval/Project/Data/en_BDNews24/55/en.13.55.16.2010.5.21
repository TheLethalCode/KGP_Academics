 NEW DELHI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical cyclone Laila hammered India's southern coast on Thursday, affecting port operations, but it was less intense than initially feared and was far from oil and gas facilities, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Authorities were prepared for damage to homes, flooding of coastal areas and damage to power and telephone lines. The storm, which has frequently changed course and speed, forced energy company Reliance Industries to suspend drilling and shut an oil and gas field as a precaution. "Our east coast facilities remain shut. We are monitoring the situation," a Reliance official said. The storm lashed the coast with winds of 120 km (75 miles) an hour, a slightly lower speed and hours later than initially forecast. Pranav Choudhary, chief financial officer of Gangavaram Port in Andhra Pradesh state said operations were stopped before the storm hit the coast. "Port operations have been suspended since morning. Tomorrow by noon we will take a call (on resuming operations) depending on wind speeds. We had one vessel with coal that we asked to move to anchorage," he said. Regarding delays in arrival of vessels, he said: "We will know in the next few says as vessels may have reduced their speed or may have been holding where they are. But there should not be any major delays." The weather office said the cyclone was expected to move towards Orissa, north of Andhra Pradesh, and then towards Bangladesh. "The severe cyclonic storm is likely to weaken gradually and move initially in a northerly direction and then recurve in north easterly direction towards Orissa," the weather office said
