 MADRID, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Far more unites Bayern Munich manager Louis Van Gaal and his Inter Milan counterpart Jose Mourinho than their mutual desire to win the Champions League final on Saturday.

Van Gaal guided Ajax Amsterdam to victory over AC Milan in 1995, while Mourinho took Porto to the pinnacle of the European game with their 3-0 victory over Monaco. Only Ernst Happel (Feyenoord 1970 and SV Hamburg 1983) and Ottmar Hitzfeld (Borussia Dortmund 1997 and Bayern Munich 2001) have achieved the
