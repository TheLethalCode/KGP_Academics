<TEXT>
 Pirojpur, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  A school girl committed suicide at Nazirpur upazila after being harassed on the streets. She was identified as Shaila Akhter Tuli, 15, a class IX student of Barabunia High School. Locals told bdnews24.com that Mamun Sheikh and Magfar Sheikh, residents of the next village harassed her using abusive language. They said that the two constantly made indecent proposals to her. Like every other day, as Shaila's was on her way from school, the two men blocked her road and started forcing her to agree to their proposal. When she refused, Mamun slapped her and Magfar snatched and took away her orna (a long piece of cloth women are expected to wear to hide their modesty). She did not disclose what had happened fearing further problems at home and took sleeping pills on Saturday night. When Shaila did not respond to her mother on Sunday morning, she cried out aloud. The neighbours came and took her to the Nazirpur hospital and the doctors pronounced her dead. Shaila's mother Salak Begum said that the two culprits had been harassing her every single day and threatening to kidnap her from home. Their parents were informed several times but to no avail and in fact the harassment increased subsequently. Nazirpur OC Mizanur Rahman admitted the allegation and said, the body was sent to the morgue for post mortem. For now, an unnatural death case has been filed. bdn
