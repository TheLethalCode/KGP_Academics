 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)  Land minister Rezaul Karim Hira has expressed his dissatisfaction as the government has frequently been losing cases on lands due to the indifference of officials. As a result, government land was being lost, the minister said in a meeting at his office on Thursday. Hira ordered the deputy commissioners and the solicitor section of the law ministry to immediately prepare and submit the list of long-awaiting cases to the ministry. Around 91,500 such cases are pending at various courts in the country, of which 25,000 are with the Supreme Court and another 50,000 at the district courts. Moreover, 10,000 cases at the land ministry and another 6,500 under the solicitor section are awaiting decisions. He said the government counsellors could not conduct the cases properly as the officials of district, sub-district and union land offices do not provide adequate information to the courts, experts and the concerned authorities regarding the cases. Besides, the divisional commissioners were asked to provide proper information related to the cases to the courts and state counsellors. The meeting was attended by state minister Mustafizur Rahman, land secretary Ataharul Islam, and representatives from different ministries, agencies and district and divisional land offices. bdnews
