 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has urged the people to make the general strike on June 27 a success. Khaleda said, "People have no faith in this government anymore. So the people, being united, must make the movement successful to remove the government." The opposition leader last week announced a three-day programme, protesting the government's activities and failures to govern, including a dawn-to-dusk general strike. The former prime minister made the statement while expressing her condolence at the death of a BNP leader, Zakir Hossain, at her Gulshan office Saturday night. Zakir, joint secretary of Garidah union BNP under Bogra's Sherpur upazila, was killed by AL activists on his way to join the party's Rajshahi rally on May 5, the BNP claims. She consoled Zakir's mother Arjan Bibi and his wife Razia Sultana. She also handed them cheques of Tk 1.25 lakh and Tk 2.5 lakh respectively. Alleging that the government had barred people from joining the rallies in Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Dhaka, Khaleda said, "The government failed to stop the people even after many attempts." "People's presence, despite bad weather, proved that they did not trust the government." She also asked the people to be conscious about the government's hasty moves to implement the treaties recently signed with India. Addressing the government, Khaleda said, "The people and the country's solidarity are not safe in their hands." "So the anti-government movement will have to be successful by uniting the people." The opposition leader also said, "AL has taken the country to such a state that the people are frustrated. Their lives have become burdened with tender-grabbing, extortion and crimes by Awami League activists." "People want relief," she added. Khaleda also criticised the Indian high commissioner's proposal to bring security personnel from India and said that the government was failing to provide security to anyone. She alleged that the ruling party did not come to power through the people's votes, rather through the sympathy of an unconstitutional caretaker government. Standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman, Jamiruddin Sircar, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and other senior leaders were present at the time. bd
