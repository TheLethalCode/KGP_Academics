 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The Speedy Trial Tribunal has sent back the Ramna Batamul murder case to the previous court, having failed to complete the trial within the deadline. Judge Kaniz Akhter Nasrina Khanam transferred the case to the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judges Court on Monday as the case could not be disposed of within stipulated 135 working days. The tribunal could record statements of only 50 witnesses among the 84. No witnesses were present at the court on Monday. This case will now be treated like the other cases, Aminul Gani Titu, lawyer for Arif Hasan Suman, a suspect in the case, told bdnews24.com. Mahbubur Rahman, special public prosecutor of the tribunal, however, said the sensitive blast case would soon be transferred to another speedy trial tribunal through a government notification. At least 10 people were killed and 50 others injured when militants carried out the bomb attack on April 14, 2001 as thousands of people gathered at Ramna Batamul in the capital to celebrate Pahela Baishakh, the Bengali New Year's Day.
