 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court relieved five teachers including the acting National University vice-chancellor Tofail Ahmad Chowdhury from contempt of court charges after they sought pardon. A bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain gave the order on Sunday. The other four to be relieved, are the university's dean SM Abu Raihan, registrar Firoze Ahmed, college inspector Anwar Hossain and examinations controller Bodruddoza. The five went to court on Sunday and stood for 15 minutes before the court allowed them to sit. The court relieved them after they sought clemency. At that time it asked them to implement a previous court order within 10 days. The High Court on Apr 7, based on three petitions by Bogra's Monayem Hossain BEd College, TH BP Ed college and Bogra Science and Technology College; asked the university to allow the colleges for MPO renewal, issuing of registration cards for students, admission and participation in examinations. However, the National University did not comply with the order and ordered the colleges on Apr 20 to pay Tk 2,100 per student as late fees. The colleges claimed that the five teachers had disobeyed a court order through this action. Barristers AKM Nazrul Islam and Ruhul Kuddus Kajal argued for the colleges. Advocate Mejbahuddin stood in for the NU officials. b
