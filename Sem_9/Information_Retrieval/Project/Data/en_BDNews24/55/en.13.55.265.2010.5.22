 Chittagong, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong City Corporation mayor candidate M Manzur Alam claimed that Chittagong BNP was united and was fully backing him. He said that the rumours of a rift within the BNP were being spread to weaken the party's campaign. The mayor hopeful attended a meeting of the party's working committee at the office of Chittagong metropolitan (North) BNP in Nasiman Bhaban on Saturday. Chittagong North BNP president Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury said there was no conflict over Manzur Alam's nomination for the mayoral election. Formal campaign for the June 17 election is yet to begin. Meanwhile the candidates are carrying out their individual campaigns. BNP has backed the Chittagong Unnayan Andolan candidate Manzur Alam in the CCC polls. Ward councillor Manzur was once associated with BNP's main political rival the ruling Awami League. Manzu came third in the last parliamentary election where he contended as an independent candidate from a Chittagong constituency. A section of Chittagong metropolitan BNP leaders and workers had expressed strong reservations initially when he was given the party's blessings. But BNP's district and city leaders accompanied him when he filed his nomination papers. At the meeting Manzu said, "Rumour of conflict is being spread which is baseless. Khaleda Zia has supported me." So there is room for conflict over my nomination within the local BNP, he said As a probable BNP mayor candidate the names of party central leader Abdullah Al Noman, metropolitan vice-president Dastagir Chowdhury and secretary Shahadat were widely discussed. Manzur said, "I met Mr Dastagir who accepted me heartily. Noman also promised cooperation." "I'll win if we work with full belief in the Almighty," he said. ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, backed by the ruling Awami League, is expected to be Manzur's main rival in the mayoral race. Mohiuddin, is seeking an unprecedented fourth time in office. Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury said, "We know Mohiuddin Chowdhury very well. He is a rogue and a hypocrite. He sheds tears and makes a show of respect when it serves his interest." 300 volunteers of Chittagong North BNP will work for Manzur round the clock, Giasuddin said. Chittagong North BNP secretary Aslam Chowdhury and other leaders attended the meeting. bdnews2
