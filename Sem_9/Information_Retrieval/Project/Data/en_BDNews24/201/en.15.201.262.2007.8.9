 BOSTON, August 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dell Inc said on Tuesday it has decided to expand sales of consumer personal computers loaded with the Linux operating system to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and China.

Every PC that is sold with Linux installed on it instead of Windows means one less license fee payment from a PC maker. Microsoft and PC makers don't disclose the size of those license fees. Retail versions of Windows Vista generally sell for $200 to $400. On Monday No 3 PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd said it would introduce a broad line of Linux laptops, the strongest endorsement to date of the open-source software by a major PC maker.

The company did not say when those will go on sale. Dell made the announcement in San Francisco at the annual LinuxWorld conventio
