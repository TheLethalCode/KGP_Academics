 PARIS, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French authorities stepped up security on trains in eastern France after receiving indications of a "terrorist threat", an official said on Wednesday. Police and personnel from French rail operator SNCF conducted checks on several trains going to and from Luxembourg and at railway stations throughout the day, an official at the prefecture of the Haut Rhin department in eastern France said. Authorities "received information that there may be actions related to terrorist threats," the official said. He said the action was still underway at 6.00 p.m. (1600 GMT) but added that with France's antiterrorism stance already at "red", its second highest level, such security alerts were not uncommon. No comment was immediately available from the Ministry of the Interior
