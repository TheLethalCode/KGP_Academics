 WASHINGTON 12 August 2007-(bdnews24.com/reuters/khaleejtimes)-- US President George W Bush met French President Nicolas Sarkozy for lunch Saturday at the Bush family's oceanside private estate, eager to underscore a thaw in relations between Washington and Paris. Bush made plain that smoothing divisions over the Iraq war was one aim of the meeting, the third between the two presidents since Sarkozy took office in May. Bush said they would discuss other issues including Iran. "We've had disagreement on Iraq in particular. I've never allowed disagreements to not to find other ways to work together," Bush told reporters at his parents' summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Sarkozy's visit was billed as a casual get-together over hot dogs and hamburgers - and the French leader fit the bill, turning up in jeans and an open-necked shirt. Bush's parents, former president George H W Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, were on hand to greet Sarkozy. Bush emphasized the informality of the meeting, discussing plans for boating and noting the presence of his own siblings and daughters at the family compound. He called Sarkozy a "friend" and promised a "heart-to-heart talk." "He's bringing a good brain, good vision and goodwill," Bush said. "This is a complicated world with a lot of opportunities to bring peace, and no question, when America and France work together we can get a lot of important things done." A conservative who has pledged close ties with the US, Sarkozy is spending his first summer holiday as president nearby, at an upscale resort in the state of New Hampshire, which borders Maine. He invoked the shared history of their two countries, recalling both the Marquis de Lafayette, a French officer who fought with the colonials in the US War for Independence, and the "cemeteries with small white crosses on the French coast ... young Americans who came to die for us." "And that is a lot more important than Mr Sarkozy or Mr Bush, because after Mr Bush, after Mr Sarkozy, we'll continue to be friends of the Americans," Sarkozy said. He interrupted the holiday to attend Friday's Paris funeral of French Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger. Sarkozy then returned across the Atlantic in time to meet Bush for a scheduled 45 minutes Saturday. Sarkozy joked with reporters that after the whirlwind, trans- Atlantic roundtrip, "I know very well that the distance between the US and France is relatively small." The French president's wife and children, who had been expected at the lunch as well, did not come to Maine, suffering what Sarkozy said were sore throats. Sarkozy's approach toward the US marks a contrast with his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who feuded with Bush and helped lead international opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Days before Saturday's meeting, the White House said that the US and France appear to be "on the verge of a new era of relations." It was the second time in recent weeks that Bush used Kennebunkport to set an informal tone for talks with a European leader. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited him on July 1-2 at the Walker's Point estate. Next week, Bush will take some summer holidays at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. US first lady Laura Bush invited the Sarkozys to Kennebunkport when she met the French president's wife in June during the Group of Eight summit of rich-nation leaders in Germany. Sarkozy's holiday in lakeside Wolfeboro, New Hampshire - the town calls itself America's oldest summer resort - has made headlines in France, including reports that he tussled with two news photographers during a boat trip last weekend on Lake Winnipesaukee, climbing into their boat to tell them o
