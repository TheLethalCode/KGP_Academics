 Dhaka, August 9 (bdnews24.com)The government Thursday filed twin appeals against the High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina and a stay order on the efficacy of the Anticorruption Commission notice on her. The government filed another appeal against the HC bail to former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo. The government filed the appeals with the Appellate Division and the chamber judge will hear them Sunday. Advocate-on-record Md Kholiquzzaman told reporters that the hearing on the three appeals would be held Sunday, as chamber judge Justice Hasan Amin did not attend court. The HC Tuesday granted bail to the detained former prime minister in a Tk 5 crore extortion case filed by Noor Ali, a long-time pro-Awami League businessman. The same bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury stayed the efficacy of the ACC notice served on Hasina asking her to submit a wealth statement by the deadline. Joint forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in connection with a Tk 3 crore extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading. The HC on July 30 granted Hasina bail in the case and stayed the case proceedings. But the Appellate Division on August 2 stayed the HC order for bail until August 14, after the government had moved against the HC verdict. The ACC served notice on Hasina on July 17, asking her to submit a wealth statement. MINTOO CASE Joint forces arrested Mintoo on May 30 and the court awarded him detention Monday. The HC Tuesday granted bail to Mintoo and stayed his detention order after his lawyers filed a writ petition. The court also issued a rule on the government to explain in four weeks why he will not be produced before court to make sure he is not detained illegally. bdnews2
