 Golam Mortuja Antu bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)The waters had first entered the northwestern town of Sirajganj gently, but just days later the whole town had been ravaged. After yielding to the fury of the flood for at least nine days, the town is now slowly emerging againonly to face the crises of food, drinking water and medicine. The waters have receded from the town's main roads but many neighbourhoods are still either knee-deep or chest-deep in water. Thousands of people who have taken shelter at schools and higher grounds are still unable to return to their homes. Eighty out of 82 unions in the district had disappeared under the raging waters. Damaged roads were visible everywhere during a visit to the battered zone Tuesday. The surface of the roads has been erased and vehicles had to take greater than usual care to avoid accidents. A stretch of over 50 feet on the old Bogra road in the town's Shahednagar area has been entirely washed away. Torn-out bridges and culverts are all bearing the brunt of the monsoon's havoc that battered 38 districts throughout the country this year. "I don't know when the roads will be repaired. Please convey our message to the government so that we get the attention of the authorities," said Abu Tulha, who runs a small shop in Sirajganj. Many other traders across the town are cleaning out their shops of floodwater, silt and debris, to start their businesses afresh. Residents in the suburbs were struggling to fight the floodwaters as many low-lying areas are still submerged. Boats are the only way to reach some neighbourhoods, though authorities have had to warn people not to pilot boats under electric poles to avoid electrocution. In Sirajganj town, more than 100 families have taken shelter on the office premises of the deputy commissioner. Some of the victims said they arrived 10 days ago, but they have not received adequate relief from the government, and they have no work available as a means of livelihood. "I didn't receive enough food," says flood victim Tota Banu. "Twice I received only 10-kilogrammes of rice. Nobody came to me with food later," she said. She has been staying at the home of a local ward commissioner for nine days since her home is under water. Banu's daughter Mina Khatun said she is in a desperate situation with her four children. Her husband, who plies a rickshaw, has no income since shops are closed and the roads are not fit for travelling. She said they were depending only on relief. One Khatun's children have been suffering from diarrhoea. "After days of vomiting she is improving a little," she said, adding that she could not even manage oral saline for the baby. Ayub Ali Raju, who runs a medicine store at Shahidganj, said the sales of oral saline and medicines for diarrhoea have increased. Many others are coming with fevers, coughs and skin diseases, he said. Mohammad Sabuj, who is suffering from diarrhoea, said he received two packets of oral saline and some water purification tablets from relief workers. "But that's not enough. I need medicine," he said. He said his family could not get fresh water from the hand-pumped tube-well at his home since it disappeared underwater. They have no toilet facilities. "We're really struggling," he said. Sirajganj deputy commissioner Ibrahim Khalil said that nearly one million people from about 200,000 families have been directly affected by this year's flood. About 17,000 homes have been completely destroyed, and over 187,000 of hectares crops have been washed away, he said. "It's really tough to tackle such a huge devastation. Still we're trying to reach all the victims," he said. Khalil said they were currently focusing on medical services and facilities since the water-borne diseases are spreading fast. A total of 99 medical teams are working to prevent an epidemic, he said. He said the relief workers were ferrying water purification tablets among the flood victims and the local public health engineering department was raising the height of tub-wells. "We have enough stocks of oral saline," said the deputy commissioner. bdnews2
