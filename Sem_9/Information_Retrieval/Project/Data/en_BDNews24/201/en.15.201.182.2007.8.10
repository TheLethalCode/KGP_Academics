<TITLE> UK court upholds most Alzheimer drug restrictions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British court ruled on Friday that the country's drugs cost-effectiveness watchdog could restrict access to medicines for Alzheimer's disease to the neediest patients, after an appeal by drugmakers and charities. Although the court said the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) had breached its duties towards some patients, both sides in the case said this would only affect very few people. The agency that decides which medicines can be offered in the state health system sparked fury among drug companies and care groups by restricting access to some drugs to a minority of patients with moderate or severe forms of Alzheimer's disease. Japan's Eisai Co. Ltd., which markets top-selling Alzheimer's medicine Aricept with Pfizer Inc., and the Alzheimer's Society, representing patients and their carers, took NICE to court claiming it was being unfair. "The legal challenge to our recommendation that drugs for Alzheimer's disease should only be prescribed to those in the moderate stage of the disease has failed," NICE said in a statement. "Our guidance stands and the drugs continue to be recommended only for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease." Neil Hunt, Chief Executive of the Alzheimer's Society, said: "This is not satisfactory and the Society is considering whether to pursue an appeal." The court also ruled, however, that NICE had breached its duties by not offering specific advice for people with learning disabilities and people for whom English is not their first language. NICE said it had always been its intention to make sure such people had equal access from the National Health Service to the drugs in the moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease. "We will reissue our guidance to the NHS to make this crystal clear," NICE said in its statement. Anti-cholinesterase drugs such as Aricept can help but not cure some Alzheimer's patients. Other products affected by NICE's decision are Exelon from Novartis AG, Ebixa from Lundbeck A/S and Reminyl from Shire Plc, which is sold elsewhere by Johnson & Johnson as Razadyne. Such drugs are widely used in other countries, but experts from NICE calculate that their cost -- around 1,000 pounds ($2,023) per patient a year -- means they are not cost-effective for most patients. Britain's uniquely comprehensive National Health Service and its pioneering attempts to measure the value of drugs -- in addition to their safety and efficacy -- means British decisions are closely watched around the world.
