<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have picked three seam bowling all-rounders in a strong-looking 15-man squad for the ICC Twenty20 World Championship. Sri Lanka's selectors chose to keep faith with the core of the squad that lost the World Cup final to Australia in April, but added several utility players well suited to the shorter 20-over game. Left-hander Jehan Mubarak replaces Russel Arnold who retired after the World Cup. All-rounders Hasantha Fernando and Gayan Wijekoon were included in place of fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekera and former captain Marvan Atapattu, who has been released from his central contract. All-rounder Kaushal Lokuarachchi was preferred to leg spinner Malinga Bandara because of his greater batting qualities in addition to his ability to bowl leg spin. Sri Lanka are in Group C with New Zealand and Kenya in the 12-nation tournament that runs from Sept. 11-24. Sri Lanka squad: Mahela Jayawardene (capt), Sanath Jayasuriya, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Chaminda Vaas, Farveez Maharoof, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Hasantha Fernando, Gayan Wijekoon, Kaushal Lokuarrachchi, Jehan Mubarak
