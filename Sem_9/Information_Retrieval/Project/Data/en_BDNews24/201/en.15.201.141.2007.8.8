<TITLE> Friends defends merger, independent prospects </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Friends Provident sought to allay concerns over its future, saying it was confident in its planned merger with Resolution but was also a strong prospect alone, with excess capital and enough cash to grow. The future of Britain's smallest blue-chip life insurer has been in question since unlisted rival Pearl muscled in on its tie-up with Resolution, just a day after the deal was announced last month. Pearl has since built a key stake in Resolution and indicated it could consider a rival bid. Friends used presentations on first-half earnings on Wednesday to drive home the merits of the nil-premium deal -- and to reassure on its potential to survive alone. "There is no 'for sale' sign up," Friends Chief Executive Philip Moore said after the insurer confirmed a 7 percent rise in first-half underlying pretax profit. "In the unlikely event of this merger not happening, if another proposition comes along that adds equal value to shareholders, it would be our pleasure to present it to them. But in the event of that not coming along and this deal not happening, we have a perfectly viable independent future." But analysts, speaking after a bruising meeting with Friends' management, remained sceptical, questioning the merits of the merger and reviving worries over Friends' cashflow. "There is a lot of scepticism about the Resolution deal and about whether this is the endgame for Friends," analyst Raghu Hariharan at Fox-Pitt, Kelton said. "(Cashflow) is a problem they will have in the medium term. While they had growth it was not an issue, but with their growth stalling a little bit, cashflow problems become (more serious)." Friends, which has been burning cash to fund growth in key markets, said it had 1 billion pounds in excess capital and spent less cash to fund growth in the first half. But it also highlighted tough conditions in the key income protection market that are likely to torpedo its target of tripling UK new business profits by 2008. The insurer said in March that challenging markets could derail that objective. Pearl's move to build a stake in Resolution last month has fuelled frenzied speculation over rival bidders for Friends, with Old Mutual, Standard Life and Zurich Financial Services all named as possible suitors. All three have declined to comment, though sources close to the situation have said Friends held talks with both Old Mutual and Standard Life before striking a deal with Resolution. Moore declined to comment on whether the group had received bids, but told analysts that a suitor offering better value for shareholders should just step forward: "We'll receive it, we'll consider it, we'll do the right thing," he said. Shares in Friends were up 2.3 percent at 196.9 pence at midday on Wednesday, as takeover talk offset concerns over Friends' independent prospects. The stock has climbed almost 6 percent since it announced merger talks with Resolution last month but still trade at a discount to its 225 pence initial public offering price. Friends has long burned cash to grow in key areas like group pensions -- this was one of the key reasons for its merger with cash-generating Resolution -- but it said on Wednesday it had generated more cash in the first six months. The company said new business strain -- the cost of writing new business -- fell to 126 million pounds in the first half, down from 175 million, with the help of a change in sales mix. Finance Director Jim Smart said the insurer aimed to be cash-flow positive in its UK operations in three to four years, though it could take longer for the group. He confirmed that plans to issue 500 million pounds of debt to fund growth had been put on hold due to the merger. Friends confirmed on Wednesday headline results for the group first released along with its merger plans last month, with UK earnings helped by 11 percent growth in group pension sales, which offset slower 2 percent sales growth in protection. Friends confirmed the group's headline underlying profit before tax rose 7 percent to 264 million pounds on a European embedded-value basis, hit by a 7 million persistency charge. The cost of weaker persistency -- as customers cash in policies early -- is set to rise to 70 million pounds for the full year, the insurer sa
