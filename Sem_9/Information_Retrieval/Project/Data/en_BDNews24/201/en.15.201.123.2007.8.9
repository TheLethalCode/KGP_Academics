 TOKYO, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party wants to turn its newfound clout into legislation rather than simply create a deadlock in parliament that would force a snap election soon, its number-two leader said on Thursday. Yukio Hatoyama, secretary-general of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), said that would be the best way to convince voters that the party has what it takes to govern and bolster its chances of winning the next poll for the powerful lower house. In a stunning victory in a July 29 election, the DPJ and its smaller allies took control of parliament's upper house. Now, it is eyeing taking the reins of government in the next lower house election, which must be held by late 2009 and could come sooner. "Of course, it is an option to reject all major government bills, create a stalemate and force a snap election, but I don't think that is necessarily what the people want," Hatoyama told Reuters in an interview. "We should not just oppose everything, but try to realise policies that we think are desirable, and thus create a sense of confidence in the party." Embattled Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose public support ratings have sagged to close to 20 percent, did not have to step down after the defeat because his ruling camp has a huge majority in the more powerful lower house, which elects the premier. But the opposition victory has sown fears of policy paralysis and prompted predictions of an early lower house election. Bills rejected by the upper house can be returned to the lower house and enacted by the ruling parties' two-thirds majority, but that is a time-consuming process. Hatoyama said the next few months were crucial to demonstrate that the Democratic Party could win public trust. The party is an amalgam of former ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members, ex-socialists and hawkish younger lawmakers. "What we need to do is get people to place the confidence that until now they have given to the LDP in the Democratic Party," said Hatoyama, a soft-spoken fourth generation politician whose grandfather served as prime minister. "This will take time, so I think it is better not to make undue haste and merely try to force a snap election." Last month's election results, analysts have said, were less a vote of confidence in the Democrats than an expression of voter ire at Abe and his party after a series of scandals and gaffes by cabinet ministers and government bungling of pension records. "If the election is next year, I think there is a definite chance that we could take power," Hatoyama said. A short session of parliament is being held this week, primarily for procedural matters, and any real showdown between the ruling an opposition camps will come in an extra session that Japanese media say is likely to begin in September. The Democratic Party is already clashing with the government and close ally Washington over whether to extend support for US-led operations in Afghanistan, but Hatoyama said no final conclusion had been reached on the contentious matter. Abe wants to extend a law enabling Japan's navy to provide fuel for US-led coalition warships in the Indian Ocean. Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa told US ambassador Thomas Schieffer on Wednesday that the party opposed extending the law because the operation was not directly authorised by the United Nations. Some Democratic lawmakers disagree. Hatoyama said the party had not reached a final conclusion, but added that not only was a lack of UN authorisation a sticking point, but that it was questionable whether the US-led operation was really improving the situation in Afghanistan. He echoed Ozawa's suggestion that Japan might be able to take part in something like the UN-backed International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. "We are not opposing just for the sake of opposing. As much as possible, we want to present al
