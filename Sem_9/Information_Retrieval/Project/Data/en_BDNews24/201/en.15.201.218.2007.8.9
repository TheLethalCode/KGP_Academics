<TITLE> Woes of a flood-hit suburb </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Naimul Haq Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Rina wades through knee-deep muddy floodwater for about half a kilometre every day to collect drinking water from a broken tap in Trimohoni, a lowland suburb not far from Bashabo in the city. Rina's neighbour Shiuli also does the same every day since the time floodwater engulfed their homes some nine weeks ago. Abdur Rahim and neighbour Md Altab Hossain fetch pieces of wood and bamboo from a local shop to cook whatever they can. Poor people like Rahim and Hossain have had no earnings since the flood hit their neighbourhood. Both depend on fishing, but since floodwater entered the nearby lake most of the fish were washed away, washing away the two men's dreams of a good daily catch, as well. The inhabitants of Trimohoni, almost cut off from the city by floodwater are suffering, as relief, medical assistance and other basic necessities, are a far cry for them. "We have had no water, food, fuel for our stoves and medicines since the current flood intensified," said Sukkur Ali, standing in chest-deep water. Sukkur's neighbour Omar Ali Sheikh said, "We expected relief from the government, but there is no sign of it. People take it for granted that since Trimohoni is located near the capital, relief is easy to come by here. But in reality, we are completely ignored and forgotten." The only mode of communication with Trimohoni is by rickshaw. A narrow road connects the small neighbourhood that largely depends on fishing for a livelihood. The road is now under knee- deep water and country boats are hard to find. The nearest township, Nanipara is the only place where medical assistance is available, but due to its distance and lack of proper communication people hardly go there. In absence of safe drinking water, people of Trimohoni are forced to drink contaminated water, now an everyday phenomenon. "We live on the mercy of God," said Kakoli from her kitchen already submerged in the floodwater. She said, "Many of us became seriously sick (with diarrhoea and skin diseases), but eventually we got well. Water-borne diseases like diarrhoea are very common in the neighbourhood but people live with it. Only the severely ill patients are carried to hospital, but that has not been widely necessary except for a few cases. bd
