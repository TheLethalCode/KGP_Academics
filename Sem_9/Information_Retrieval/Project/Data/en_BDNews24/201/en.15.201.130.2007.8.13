"If you give us a week, the death toll should be 18. But retrieving the bodies is slow and dangerous work." The landslides started early on Saturday, when one struck sleeping villagers, burying their grass-thatched huts in a wave of mud. Another shortly after buried other people who had rushed to their rescue. Television footage showed helpless villagers looking on as rescue workers dug for the 13 more people thought to be buried beneath the thick brown mire which covered the remains of huts that had stood on steep hillsides. "We don't hold out any hope of finding survivors. This is just a retrieval operation now, and we expect to be still digging for remains in a week's time," Mwangi said.
