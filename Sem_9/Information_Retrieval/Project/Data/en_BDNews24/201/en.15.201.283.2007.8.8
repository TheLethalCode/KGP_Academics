<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush didn't watch and didn't call, but the White House offered his congratulations for Barry Bonds' record-breaking home run and also used the opportunity to condemn steroid use in sports. Bonds hit the 756th home run of his career to set a new Major League mark on Tuesday night, sparking wild celebrations among his hometown San Francisco fans and mixed reaction elsewhere because of past steroid use allegations against him.

"Kids worship athletes, and athletes who endanger themselves through the use of these drugs send not only a wrong message to the kids, but they also do damage to their own lives," Snow said.
