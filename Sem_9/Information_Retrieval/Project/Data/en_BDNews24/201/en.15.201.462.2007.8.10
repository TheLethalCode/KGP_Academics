 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com) Narail celebrates the 83rd birth anniversary of celebrity painter SM Sultan Friday. The cultural elite of the southwestern town have drawn up an elaborate programme for commemorating Sultan's birth through offering flowers at his grave and oraganising special prayers, children's painting competition at Sultan's Shishu Swarga Bhaban, rallies, discussions and prize distribution. The Narail residents used to organise a boat race in the Chitra river in the past, but they dropped the programme this year due to the countrywide flooding. Sultan was born in Masimdia village near Narail town in 1924. bdnews24.com/c
