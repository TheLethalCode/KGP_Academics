<TITLE> Kalashnikov maker takes aim at strong rouble policy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 IZHEVSK, Russia, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The maker of Kalashnikov rifles said it is losing millions of dollars because the rouble is too strong, a sign that Russia's defence industry is unhappy with the central bank's currency policy. The bank allows the rouble to appreciate to curb inflation, but this is leading to what economists call Dutch disease, when a strong currency results in a flood of cheap imports and hinders domestic industry, especially exporters. "For us exporters the strong rouble policy is causing massive losses, we are losing millions of dollars," said Vladimir Grodetsky, director general of the Izhmash plant in the city of Izhevsk in the Udmurtia region east of Moscow. "We are trying to argue against it and I hope someone will listen. I mentioned this to (Finance Minister Alexei) Kudrin and to (First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei) Ivanov," he added. Izhmash, founded in 1807, makes 95 percent of all Russian rifles. Its flagship product is the 100th series AK rifle, a more advanced version of the AK-47, the weapon of choice for many armies and guerilla groups. "When the Izhmash director complains about the exchange rate it means we have already caught the Dutch disease," Kudrin told Reuters in Izhevsk. About 90 percent of Izhmash production is exported. Venezuela, for example, recently bought 100,000 Kalashnikovs. Most contracts, arranged through state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, are priced in dollars. President Vladimir Putin has set plans for an industrial revival to curb the country's dependence on oil and gas exports. The effort stresses the role of the defence industry, one of the few Russian industries which is competitive on world markets. Russian arms sales are expected to rise to a record $7.5 billion this year from $6.4 billion in 2006, according to government estimates. Last year, a powerful industrial lobby asked Putin to stop the rouble appreciation policy to help domestic producers, but after a short break the rouble has resumed its upward march. The central bank argues the strong rouble allows factories to modernise by buying a lot of equipment cheaply abroad. But analysts say the bank overstates the volume of equipment imports as its statistical methods are flawed and count cars and home appliances as machinery imports. "This argument totally lacks logic. If I lose, say 20 percent in profit because of rouble appreciation I am not going to invest this money in buying equipment," Grodetsky said, adding that only 15 percent of Izhmash's equipment was imported. Izhmash's factory workers, mostly middle-aged women dressed in blue overalls, assemble rifles by hand from parts made on Soviet-era machinery, labelled with a pentagram, a Soviet mark of quality. "These machines have been here for as long as I can remember," said one female work
