 RIYADH, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi police this week detained 135 suspected sympathisers of Islamist militants in the holy city of Mecca, a Saudi newspaper said on Thursday. The men of different nationalities were picked up in a security sweep of the city, home to Islam's holiest site, the semi-official al-Riyadh daily said. Investigations were under way to establish if they had any links to wanted militants, it said. Since 2003 Saudi Arabia has been fighting a campaign by al Qaeda-allied militants to drive out Westerners and bring down the Saudi monarchy, which they view as un-Islamic for its close alliance with the United States. Authorities arrested 172 men earlier this year accused of forming militant cells around the vast desert country, which is the world's biggest oil exporter. Militants shot dead four French tourists in February
