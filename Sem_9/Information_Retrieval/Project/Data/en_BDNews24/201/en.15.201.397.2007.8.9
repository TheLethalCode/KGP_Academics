 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 8 (Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki has sacked his deputy health minister, who won praise from activists for speaking out about AIDS, South African radio reported on Wednesday. Public radio broadcaster SAFM quoted unnamed sources as saying Mbeki, whose government has been accused of dragging its feet on the AIDS crisis, had "relieved" Deputy Health Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge of her duties. No one at Madlala-Routledge's office could immediately be reached for comment and presidential spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga said he was not aware she had been sacked. "I have not been advised of that," he said. AIDS activists have lambasted South Africa's Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang for advocating natural remedies to treat AIDS, including garlic, beetroot and the African potato. They were delighted when Madlala-Routledge took the lead on AIDS policy when the health minister was forced to take time off due to illness and applauded her direct and proactive approach to the disease which affects one in nine South Africans. Newspapers reported this week that Madlala-Routledge travelled to Madrid with her son and a consultant at a cost of 160,000 rand to the taxpayer without seeking Mbeki's approval. That sparked speculation that she could face the axe from Mbeki, who has stuck by his controversial health minister despite international criticism over her AIDS policies. A health spokesman for the main opposition party Democratic Alliance told SAFM it looked as though Mbeki was siding with the health minister over her deputy, who he described as a "breath of fresh air" in her approach to HIV.
