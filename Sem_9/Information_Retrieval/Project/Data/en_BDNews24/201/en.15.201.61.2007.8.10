 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has moved closer to seal a deal to export eight million pieces of garments duty-free to India in a calendar year, the top commerce ministry official has said. Both sides have already agreed on a draft agreement, which will be placed before the Council of Advisers next week for approval, commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed said Thursday. "The proposal has already got the law ministry' vetting about two weeks ago," Ahmed said. Once the interim gives the all-clear, a memorandum of understanding will be signed in Dhaka, hopefully by August, officials said. The export, under the SAFTA framework, will be duty-free and without any conditionality of sourcing of fabrics or port restrictions, the draft says. The exports will be made on a quota basis and the Export Promotion Bureau will oversee for Bangladesh end of things. India's Textile Committee will monitor the quota at their end. In case of any dispute regarding the classification of any apparel, the decision of the jurisdictional customs authorities in India will be final. Other disputes will be settled through prompt bilateral consultations. The designated authorities in Bangladesh will give a monthly statistical statement by the 10th of the following month to their Indian counterparts. Bangladesh will have to give India by October 31 a break-up of the apparel articles to be exported next year, a provision the BGMEA president said would act as a barrier. "As far as I know, this restriction has been withdrawn," Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury, BGMEA president, told bdnews24.com. Chowdhury said initially the agreement will last for two years. The annual volume of trade between the two South Asian neighbours now is worth about $2.5 billion, which includes some $270 million exports from Bangladesh. According to the BGMEA chief, 8 million pieces of garments could fetch Bangladesh at least $32 million in annual earnings and may be more depending on the value-added items. Bangladeshi government and business leaders have long been blaming the gap largely on tariff and non-tariff barriers on exports imposed by India and the lack of market access to the country. bd
