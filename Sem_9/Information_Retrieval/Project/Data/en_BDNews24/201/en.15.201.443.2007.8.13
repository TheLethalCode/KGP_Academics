<TITLE> Big investors cut risk but see salvation in economy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Long-term investors have been scooping risk off the table quickly as US credit troubles spread more widely, but are still hanging on to the security blanket of a solid global economy to see them through the worst. They are generally positioned for a return to the risk-hungry patterns of the recent past under the assumption that current market ructions are a short-term glitch. Some have even suggested it is time to grab buying opportunities. The issue is whether a drumbeat of negative news -- such as BNP Paribas' problems with mortgage-linked funds and a shortage of cash in money markets which has forced central bank action -- will shake their convictions loose. "This is not a good time to take on big risk," said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at Italy's Generali Investments. "(It's) all very tentative." Flow data and polls show that the world's largest money managers have pulled money away from riskier assets as worries about liquidity and financial stability have swept markets. U.S. financial services giant State Street reported on Friday that big institutional investor clients who keep $13.04 trillion worth of assets with it as custodian had moved into what it called a "safety first" regime. Such a state of affairs is characterised by shifting from emerging market into developed market shares and quitting leveraged currency plays. Reuters latest asset allocation polls, meanwhile, showed 47 leading investment houses in the United States, Japan, Britain and continental Europe cut on average around 1 percentage point off their equity holdings in July. In a similar vein, fund researcher EPFR reported that investors moved a net $11.2 billion into money market funds in the first week of August. For many, however, it may be as much a chance to grab profits after a four-year equity market bull run as it is a flight to safety. The polls and flow data also show that the moves so far have contained risk exposure rather than removed it altogether. The Reuters polls, for example, showed the investment firms still held a near average 60 percent of their money in stocks. State Street noted that a "safety first" regime was not the most risk-averse condition. That is reserved for what it calls a "riot point" regime, characterised by indiscriminate equity selling. EPFR, meanwhile, reported that as investors were rushing into money markets they were also embracing selected equities. "The fact that investors were quick to move money into US equities to take advantage of the dips, and the solid flows we saw into global equity funds, suggests to me that investors continue to vacillate between the strong fundamentals in the global economy and a credit market meltdown," Brad Durham, EPFR's global managing director, said in a note. All this strongly suggests that investors have not given up on the bull equity market and could be ready to step back in when they want. Some are already making the call. Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at British wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, reckons falls on equity markets may have been overdone and bargains should be sought. "We have now got about a 10 percent correction in some of these markets," he said. Others are of a similar mind but reckon markets need more time to shake out first, particularly given the unknowns about hedge fund and investment bank exposure to creaky credit. "With these drops in prices, equities should become more attractively valued but we are not really bargain-hunting yet," said Joost van Leenders, senior economist at Dutch investors ABN AMRO Asset Management. "Volatility and uncertainty (are) so high that it may be worth waiting longer." What is mainly buoying long-term investors is a conviction that the global economy is in good shape and will allow market moves associated with such a condition to get back on track. "World economic growth has been strong and will probably stay strong," van Leenders said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week that the outlook for economic growth in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations was actually improving. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is forecasting global growth to expand by 5.2 percent both this year and next. "We continue to believe that the systemic consequences of the reassessment of credit risk that is taking place will be manageable. The fundamentals supporting strong global growth remain in place," the IMF said in a statement last week. These are soothing words to long-term investors who tend to look past what they hope will be short-term disturbances to their strategi
