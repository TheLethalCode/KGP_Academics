<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and India have placed different proposals despite reaching a consensus on the agreement for sharing waters of the river Teesta, a senior government official said Sunday. A technical committee drawn on officials and experts of the two countries has again been formed to settle the issue, water resources secretary Syed Mohammad Zobayer told reporters. The committee will meet in Dhaka in two months to try to thrash out the differences for the agreement to be signed. The proposal of the technical committee will be finalised at the ministerial meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission, scheduled in New Delhi for October or November, Zobayer said. The secretary briefed the media on the progress and results of the secretary-level talks held in New Delhi on Aug 7-8. JRC member Mir Sajjad Hossain, who had attended the Delhi meeting, was also present at the briefing. In the meeting, Bangladesh proposed sharing 80 percent of Teesta waters whereas India proposed sharing 70 percent of the water flow by the two countries. Questions swirled over the Indian proposal over how the water flowing through Bangladesh after Gajaldoba barrage in Indian territory would be shared or whether the water would be used only by Bangladesh. The secretary said a technical committee was formed to reach a consensus on the issue and it would sit in Dhaka in a month for a resolution. The JRC ministerial meeting would also discuss it. He said the New Delhi meeting also discussed the water flow of another seven rivers, protection of the banks of bordering rivers and dredging of the Ichhamati River. The seven rivers are the Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gomti, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Feni. If consensus is reached in the next meeting, agreements on these rivers would be signed on different dates, Zobayer said. The secretary said the meeting discussed protecting the banks of 41 Indian and 39 Bangladeshi rivers along the border. bdnew
