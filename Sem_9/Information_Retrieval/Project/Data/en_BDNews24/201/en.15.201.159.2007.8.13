 LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banks and commodity stocks led European shares 1.2 percent higher by midday on Monday as central banks assuaged investor fears over a liquidity crunch stemming from a crisis in US subprime mortgages. At 1019 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.24 percent at 1,497.75 points, taking it back to positive territory for the year to date and regaining part of the 4.8 percent lost on Thursday and Friday last week. Mining stocks were the best performing sector across Europe, with the DJ Stoxx European basic resources index gaining 3.4 percent, powered by higher metal prices and a brokerage upgrade for Kazakhmys. Kazakhmys gained 6.4 percent to be the top gainer in Europe, while Antofagasta climbed 6 percent, Anglo American rose 4.8 percent and Rio Tinto 4.6 percent. Central banks in North America, Europe and Asia late last week injected large sums in an effort to prevent money markets from seizing up after a number of financial institutions revealed exposure to subprime market turmoil. The European Central Bank on Monday injected 47.67 billion euros into the euro zone money markets on Monday, for a net drain of 13.39 billion euros in cash. Morgan Stanley said in a note that it was time to start buying shares, its first asset allocation shift since January. "The risk-reward of buying equities on a 6-12 month view is much better now that a few months ago," strategist Teun Draaisma wrote, changing the bank's view of equities to "overweight" from "neutral", downgrading cash and keeping bonds underweight. "Companies still have strong balance sheets, strategic M&A has further to go, sovereign wealth funds have significant amounts of cash to buy equities with, we see no recession coming, emerging markets are in great financial shape, the earnings yield/bond yield gap is still positive," he said. Draaisma said that the bank was going overweight on financial shares, and said that overall, he still preferred large caps to small and mid-caps. A 60-cent-per-barrel rise in the price of Brent crude lifted index-heavyweight oil stocks, with BP gaining 1.5 percent, Royal Dutch Shell advancing 2.2 percent and Total rising 1.3 percent. The airline sector also bounced back after last week's sell-off, with gains of 4.7 percent for British Airways, 1.8 percent for Air France KLM and 2.3 percent for Lufthansa. But fears over the extent of damage to Europe's financial system from exposure to the US subprime problem lurked. Shares in Germany's Postbank fell 2 percent after the bank said it had taken onto its own books 600 million euros in exposure to two investment vehicles run by crisis-hit German peer IKB. Other banks recovered some of last week's losses. BNP Paribas gained 1.7 percent, saying its exposure to U.S. lender HomeBanc, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, was small and entirely covered by collateral. BNP had spooked investors last week by announcing it had frozen three funds due to subprime-related problems. Deutsche Bank gained 1.3 percent, and Commerzbank rose 1.1 percent. Both banks are also among the creditors of HomeBanc. Shares in Germany's Siemens slipped more than 2 percent on a newspaper report that internal investigators have uncovered more than 1 billion euros of dubious payments at Siemens's telecoms and turbines divisions. Siemens declined to comment. "There might be a bounce in the coming days, given the general assessment that the central banks did what they had to do, but then it will depend on whether we get more bad news on the credit risks," said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Fortis Investments. "We'll see more funds closing for trading or more hedge funds blowing up. There is a lot of uncertainty on who owns a piece of the credit problems and who is affected by the liquidity dry-up," he said. Germany's DAX index was up 0.9 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 1.8 percent and France's CAC 40 up 1.1 perce
