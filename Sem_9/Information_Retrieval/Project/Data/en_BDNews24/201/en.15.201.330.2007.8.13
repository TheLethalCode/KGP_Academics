 Prodip Choudhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)- The huge door of the Special Judge's Court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises swung open, a bit more quickly Monday than usual. Awami League leader Salman F Rahman stood inside the lockup, separated by a wooden partition from the courtroom. On seeing him, BNP leader barrister Nazmul Huda almost ran and embraced him. A bit later, Huda informed uncle Salman that Sigma Huda was sitting in a wheelchair outside the lockup. For his part, Salman ran to enquire about his ill daughter-in-law, Sigma. Salman also kissed Huda's two daughters, Antara and Srabonti, on their foreheads. Though such scenes unfolded apart from the courtroom, a police constable outside said that in the past five years, Huda had not allowed Salman Rahman to visit Dohar, his own constituencynor even to hold his (Salman's) daughter's Qul Khwani in the area. Also seen in the court lockup was former BNP lawmaker Monjurul Ahsan Munshi, busy laying down his prayer mat. Salman Rahman, sporting a long beard, came up to help him. Awami League leader Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, sentenced to 13 years in jail for corruption, also joined them in prayers. Salman led the Asr prayers. Awami League leader Mohammad Nasim then appeared. Sechchhasebak League general secretary Pankaj Debnath and Munshi's wife Majeda Ahsan were also there. The three of them had snacks together. On witnessing the cordiality exhibited by people who were, not so long ago, poles apart, some people quipped if they had demonstrated such cordiality before October 28, they would have averted landing up here. The political leaders are detained on different charges. They were brought to the court for trial. At about 6pm all of them were taken back to jail. bdnew
