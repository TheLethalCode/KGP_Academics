<TITLE> Malaysia fancied for historic breakthrough </TITLE>

 KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts Malaysia look to their men's badminton squad to make history in the world championships starting on Monday and compensate for the poor showing of their soccer players at the recent Asian Cup. Malaysia have never won a title at the previous 15 world championships which date back to 1977. This time round, though, they have genuine gold prospects in former world number one Lee Chong Wei and the exciting doubles pair of Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong, the second seeds who won the All England title in Birmingham in March. The Malaysians face stiff opposition from the might of China and England's top doubles performers but with home advantage at the 15,000 capacity Putra stadium their chances look sound. Lee, seeded two, beat world champion Lin Dan of China in a Sudirman Cup match in Glasgow in June, does well on home territory and has a decent draw. In the doubles, Malaysian former great Jalani Sidek feels that if Koo and Tan can handle the pressure, they have every chance of gold. "My money is on them," he declared at the draw ceremony. China won four of the five titles at last year's championships in Madrid, including the men's singles with world number one Lin but he came under fire from coach Li Yongbo after his defeat by Lee in Glasgow and is no certainty despite success in the China Masters tournament last month. Former world champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, seeded eighth after a modest run, is due to meet his big rival Lin in the quarter-finals in what would be an enthralling affair. Top Dane Peter Gade is once again Europe's main hope and has a good record in Malaysia but could face an Asian too many in the sweltering conditions. The Chinese look good bets to win the women's singles with defending champion Xie Xingfang seeking a third successive crown and the women's doubles where Gao Ling and Huang Sui chase a fourth world title. In the mixed doubles champions Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms seek to retain their crown and give themselves a huge boost ahead of next year's Olympics in Beijing. Compatriot Anthony Clark, who improved hugely last season to feature in two world finals, could also have a say with Donna Kellogg in the mixed and Robert Blair in the men's doubles. Play starts on Monday though some of the big names have first-round byes and will not be in action until later in the week
