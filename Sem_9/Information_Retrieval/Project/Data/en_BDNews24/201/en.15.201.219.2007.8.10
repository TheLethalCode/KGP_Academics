 Chittagong, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Police and workers traded blames Friday, a day after they clashed violently, leaving one worker dead and over 50 others injured. . Police fired tear gas and charge batons to disperse workers Thursday who were demonstrating following a dispute with the management over arrears in wages. bdnews24.com's Chittagong correspondent reported that situation was returning to normal after visiting the factory and the workers' colony. Police and BDR personnel were posted at the main entrance to the mill Friday morning, with workers staying away from the premises. Several labour leaders told bdnews24.com Friday that police excesses drove an otherwise negligible conflict into a bloody battle. Both police and workers, however, agreed that outsiders had outnumbered factory workers in Thursday's clashes. The clashes spread throughout the day beyond the mill area to cover about two sq km. Mill workers of the colony told bdnews24.com the young man killed in the dispute was a colleague, while police claimed that the deceased was a passerby who had been caught up in the violence. Other witnesses said the man was fleeing the riot when he fell and was fatally injured. Arjun, a cleaner at the Chittagong Medical College Hospital morgue, said the unidentified body was kept at the morgue until 3 pm, but noone came to claim it. Golam Rasul, sub-inspector of Panchlaish Police Station, said eight of the 22 arrested during the clashes claimed to be mill worker while the rest were outsiders. Some 600 people were shown as accused in the case filed with the police station, Rasul said. The inspector confirmed the dead man remained unidentified as no relation of his came to claim his body. Workers who had been present claimed that police had beaten the young man to death. They said up to eight policemen beat the young man and dumped him near the mill gate. Workers carried him to Chittagong Medical College Hospital at around 11:45am. They alleged that police even entered a mosque and beat up a rickshaw-puller named Belal Hossain there. Abdus Sobhan and Abdul Khaleque, two former trade union leaders, said workers worried about their wages due on Thursday as they had not been paid the previous week. Word spread through the factory at around 10am that the authorities were not in a position to disburse the workers' salaries, which prompted some workers to put up a barricade on the road in front of the factory. Police intervened and soon they and the workers engaged in skirmishes. The ex-trade union leaders said the violence would not have spread if police had exercised a little restraint. They also blamed the intervention of outsiders for compounding the situation. bdnews24
