 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin said Saturday the Supreme Court would come forward to help save the country from any crisis. "The Supreme Court played a role in the past at the critical juncture of the nation. It is doing so at present and will do so in future," justice Amin said. For independence of the judiciary, those who are working in the department must be mentally independent first, the CJ said in his address to a seminar on "Judicial Reform and Independence of Judiciary" organised by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh at the Supreme Court Bar Association Building. "The Supreme Court gave an epoch-making verdict for the independence of the judiciary. The Constitution also speaks of the independence of the judiciary, but the judiciary has not been separated from the executive branch," he said. "It is the Supreme Court that again came forward to implement its verdict," Amin said. The chief justice said, "Though independence of the judges and a system for appointment of judges are necessary, first of all we need to change our culture. If those in the commission being proposed for appointment as judges are not neutral, the commission will not be fruitful. "Why did we backtrack on the glorious history we had in appointment of judges in the Supreme Court? It gave us nothing except a shame for the nation." He said everybody wanted that the judiciary work independently. "There was no cause for exception. However, no judge could be made to work independently through making laws. They would have to commit themselves to independence," Amin said. The chief justice said there were allegations that verdicts were taken unjustly, but judges only were not to blame for that. "The lawyers involved were also responsible." He said action was being taken after investigation into the incident of releasing accused persons through bail fraud. Amin said one of the main reasons for the spread of corruption was that many requests were received while proceedings were being conducted. On contempt of court, the chief justice said the aim of contempt of court should not be only for punishing somebody. "The Supreme Court applied the jurisdiction of the contempt of court to uphold discipline in court. Those who are involved with the judicial institution should respect it." "It is often said that judges are being offered allurements. If a judge works 'hoping for rewards' he should give up the judicial post. He is not only pushing the country toward a disaster, but also pushing himself to the same direction," he said. Former chief justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury, who attended the seminar, said the that tradition of consulting the chief justice in the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court would have to be maintained. The chief justice must have authority in the appointment of judges. He suggested that the provision in the 1972 constitution for effective consultation with the chief justice in appointing judges be revived to ensure independence of the judiciary. Justice Chowdhury said the provision for consultation with the chief justice was withdrawn through a "civil coup". "Now, the ministry gives a list to the chief justice and says that those on the list would have to be appointed. It has created scope for appointment of controversial persons as judges," he added. Justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury said it would be good for the judiciary and the country if the lawyers were united. He mentioned that the Supreme Court in Pakistan reinstated the chief justice following a united movement by the lawyers. He said that the judges should not deliver verdicts, influenced by intimidation. He proposed formation of a committee led by the chief justice for appointment of judges. The committee should include two judges each from the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the attorney general, he said. Justice Md Fazlul Karim urged all to be united for independence of the judiciary. He said that if the judiciary was not separated from the executive, fundamental rights of the people could not be ensured. Justice Amirul Kabir Choudhury said democracy would not sustain if the rule of law was not established. Stressing the appointment of judges on the basis of qualification and efficiency, he said the Supreme Court would have to play an important role in saving the nation. Dr Kamal Hossain said the independence of the judiciary was necessary for ensuring fundamental rights and security to life and property. He said unlimited firmness was required to check unbridled corruption. He said corruption and terrorism had no limits and that the constitution was violated. He said the rule of law had now returned. In his keynote paper, barrister M Amir-ul Islam said the lawyers and judges would have to work united to make up for the loss the higher court suffered for partisan appointment of judges. He demanded that the government formulate law as per the constitution and an independent commission for fixing the criteria of the appointment of judges. He recommended providing the judges with modern technology. Senior advocate Khandker Mahbub Hossain said the judges would have to have an independent mentality for independence of the judiciary. He recommended effective steps to stop misuse of law alongside amendment to the existing laws. Advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan said the judiciary suffered huge losses due to politicisation of the lawyers. He said: "This tendency should be abandoned for the future of the nation. Advocate Abdul Baset Majumder posed a question as to whether whatever independence the judiciary has was being upheld. Advocate Manjil Murshid said that the relation between the judges and the lawyers was being hampered due to politics. He said independence and reform of the judiciary were necessary for rule of law. bdnews24
