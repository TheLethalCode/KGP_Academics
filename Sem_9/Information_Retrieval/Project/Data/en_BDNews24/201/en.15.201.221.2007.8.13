 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  The low in the Bay of Bengal has turned into a land depression and is hovering over the Indian state of West Bengal and Bangladesh regions. "The low of the Bay of Bengal moved to the north-west side and has become a land-based depression. It is staying in the West Bengal and regions adjacent to Bangladesh," meteorologist Farah Diba told bdnews24.com Monday. "The depression will weaken to induce rainfalls," she said. The three maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar and Mongla have been also asked to raise local cautionary signal 3, Diba said. The river ports of Dhaka and southern regions have been told to show cautionary signal 2 and other river ports cautionary signal 1. The met office said light to medium and heavy rainfalls accompanied by gusty or squally wind were likely in most of the places of Dhaka, Khulna, Barisal and Rajshahi divisions. A few places of Chittagong and Sylhet divisions may have light to medium rainfalls and even heavy rains with gusty wind. Some places may see medium to heavy rainfalls as well. The highest temperature on Sunday in Dhaka was 29.5 degrees Celsius and the lowest 27 degrees Celsius.
