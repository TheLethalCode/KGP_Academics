<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com) - Authorities are planning to allow detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to meet her ailing husband Dr Wazed Miah outside the special jail without releasing her on parole. "The jail code does not allow taking any detained person out of jail to meet an ailing person," inspector general (IG) of prisons Md Zakir Hasan Friday told bdnews24.com. "However, the government can do so on humanitarian grounds under special arrangements if it thinks the situation is right." Hasan said the security of the Awami League chief was a headache since the government did not want anybody to face any embarrassment if and when she Hasina would out of the special jail. What could be done would be done secretly to get around the problem, he added. Deputy inspector general (DIG), prisons, Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqi Friday told bdnews24.com they were yet to hear from the home ministry about Hasina's application for permission to see her husband. He however said if the jail authorities wanted they could make arrangements for the meeting. A jail official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not brief the media, said a strategy was being worked out for the meeting. He said the issue of a written approval of the home ministry was not urgent. The official also said former prime minister Khaleda Zia had met her elder son Tarique Rahman without either of the two seeking permission for a meeting. He said Hasina could be taken to Square Hospital on the plea of getting a blood or any other test done and arrangements could be made for a meeting there. Or, he said, Dr Wazed could be moved to another hospital and Hasina could also be taken there. bdnews24
