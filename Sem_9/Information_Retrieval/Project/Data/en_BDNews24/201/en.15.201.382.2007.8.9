<TITLE> Govt trashes reports on 'bias' in DC appointments </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government has blown off as baseless allegations made in some newspapers of political bias in the appointment of deputy commissioners. Only 13 of the 64 deputy commissioners were appointed during the emergency government only after selection by a high-level secretary committee on the basis of competition, the government said in a statement Thursday. The other DCs have been working since the last political government's tenure. The appointment of DCs and other civil servants ranking above are based on evaluation of track-records during service and reports of governmental agencies on their honesty, efficiency and neutrality. "Which is why the allegation of politicisation is completely untrue," the statement said. "There is no scope, nor any reason for a non-party caretaker government to indulge in politicisation of the administration." The handout contended that media reports on evaluation and the list of secretaries, acting secretaries and additional secretaries are not based on facts. "Public officials are evaluated on the basis of existing policy and system. So the question of evaluation on any other standards, as reported by newspapers does not arise," the government said. The government said it believed top officials were working with efficiency, honesty, neutrality and sincerity and would continue to do so. The government hoped the newspapers would try to report impersonally and objectively and refrain from publishing what it said was misleading news. bd
