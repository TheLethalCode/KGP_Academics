<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The family members of Lutfor Rahman Mostafa Sumon, who was kidnapped and found murdered in June, have demanded death by hanging for his killers. They claim Major Rahimuzzaman Rabbani, now serving in Bangladesh Rifles, was responsible for the killing and allege that he hired killers to murder Sumon, who had been an information technology consultant to the government's Primary Education Development Programme. Sumon's family demanded the death penalty at a press conference held Saturday, in which Sumon's sister Nazma Sultana Usha read out a written statement to the media. Earlier, two people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in Sumon's kidnapping and killing. Following the arrests, Major Mahmud Hossain, a RAB deputy director, told the media: "Sumon was kidnapped from Sheorapara in Mirpur on June 11. He was taken to Chandina in Comilla on the same night, where he was killed. His body was dumped by the side of a road." Hossain said Thursday that evidence in the case led a RAB team to arrest Shamsul Islam Matin, 32, and Ahsan Habib, 30, from Bogra, who then confessed to the killing. On recovering the body, the police sent photographs of the deceased to the family who identified the body as Sumon's. At some point, however, the Chandina police cremated Sumon's body claiming they mistook him for a Hindu. Meanwhile, the two arrested men have also given a statement to police, confessing to the murder, in which they named Major Rabbani as responsible for the killing. Soon after Sumon's abduction his family had filed a case with Mirpur Police Station, on June 13. The investigation officer in the case, sub-inspector Ejazul Islam said: "Habib and Matin have given statements under section 164. They have confessed that they were involved in the killing." "In the statement they also mentioned that four more people including Major Rahimuzzaman Rabbani were involved in the incident. They said three of the six were directly involved in the killing, while three others provided necessary support including planning," he said. According to police information, Major Rabbani is now serving in the BDR on deputation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. RAB has informed their superiors of the accusations against Major Rabbani in the killing, Islam said. At Saturday's press conference Usha said: "We think Major Rabbani was behind the killing." She alleged that Rabbani, father Tofazzal Hossain and others bribed the Chandina police officer in charge of the investigation to cremate Sumon's body. She also said her brother had been circumcised and there was "no reason to burn him as a Hindu except through a conspiracy". Sumon's elder sister Kamrunnahar Lucky said Sumon had been friendly to Major Rabbani's wife Nipa from childhood and that they had studied together. "After Sumon's marriage in October last year he did not see much of Nipa," Lucky said. "But from the start of June somebody began to follow Sumon. He told me so several times," she claimed, adding that a stranger had come to Sumon to enquire about Nipa who had left her husband for another man. Lucky claimed that before he died, Sumon had told the family that Rabbani suspected him. "After Sumon went missing we have contacted Rabbani several times but he did not admit anything," she said. Chandina police chief Mostafa Kamal claims: "I was not here when his body was recovered. I joined here only three weeks ago. However, I have looked into the case." According to police records, Sumon's body was recovered as that of an unidentified man on the night of June 11, Kamal said. "He was identified as a Hindu by his body parts and local people were witness to this. Everybody present identified him as a Hindu," the OC said. On the accusation of a bribe he said: "The question does not arise at all. When the body was found police did not know anything about whose body it was and who killed him. From who would police take the bribe?" bdnews24.c
