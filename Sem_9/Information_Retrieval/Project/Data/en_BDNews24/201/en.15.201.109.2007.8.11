 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission started photographing people for a voter list in Rajshahi city Saturday after promulgation of an ordinance by president Iajuddin Ahmed. The election office in the area said that as many as 6,443 people had been photographed on the first day. Although the work of taking photographs started Saturday, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed would formally inaugurate the programme in the Rajshahi City Corporation area Tuesday. The president promulgated the Voter List Ordinance 2007 Thursday, including the issue of preparing a voter list with photographs. The new ordinance replaced the 1982 ordinance on voter listing. Work is going on in 37 centres, out of 110 set up in 30 wards of the city. The army Bogra zone area commander, major general Mohammad Shamim Chowdhury, inspected the project Saturday. Rajshahi district election officer Syed Mohammad Musa said they launched a campaign asking voters to come to the centre to be photographed in phases. "All voters will be photographed in phases," he said. With the work for 37 centres in the first phase over, work for other centres starts on Aug 17 and continues until Sept 4. bdnews2
