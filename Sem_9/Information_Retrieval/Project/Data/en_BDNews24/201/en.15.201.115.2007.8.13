<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Krishi Bank has moved to form a temporary unit for the prompt payment of loans to flood-affected farmers, the bank said in a statement Monday. The bank will assess the overall demand by collecting information on the number of affected individuals from unions and thanas through deputy commissioners' offices. The emergency loan payments will start on a priority basis with the newly formed special complaint and monitoring cell coordinating the process. A decision has also been taken to postpone by one year the loan repayments by individuals currently living in flood-ravaged areas. Krishi Bank will disburse Tk 3,550 crore in the July to June period of fiscal 2007-08, an increase of Tk 400 crore from the previous year. bd
