<TITLE> Bhuiyan calls for loans, Khaleda 'ready' to hit flood trail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday asked the government to immediately arrange loans for the flood-affected farmers amid word that Khaleda Zia would visit some areas to distribute relief. Bhuiyan, who is apparently maintaining a safe distance with the party chief, also said the government must distribute seeds and fertiliser free of cost among the farmers. He said the party was distributing relief to the flood victims with cooperation from the local level leaders and activists while many of the former lawmakers were leading the efforts in many places. Bhuiyan said the large farmers should get loans while the small and marginal ones should get priorities in getting seeds and fertiliser. He also asked the government to start vulnerable group feeding programme for hardcore poor to help them cope with the flood fallout. His statements came amid reports that waters were receding in many overflowed rivers that destroyed crops in thousands of farming villages across the country. His call, however, coincided with the announcement that Khaleda would be out to distribute relief despite an apparent squeeze by the emergency government. Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah separately said Friday the former prime minister was determined to stand by the flood victims. Shah, who surfaced as a spokesman for Khaleda in recent times, said the secretary general did not talk to the party chief about the relief activities, which meant Bhuiyan's call to the party workers was his own, not the party's. He claimed the party chief had asked him to arrange relief distribution among the stricken people from the party since Bhuiyan did not consult it with the leader. Shah said Khaleda would go to Sirajganj and Tangail to see the flood victims Saturday even if the government failed to provide her with security. "She wants to go there with her own security, if necessary," the leader said, as the government earlier said security was the main concern for not allowing her to visit flood victims. "The leader is mentally prepared to participate in relief distribution Saturday. "We are hopeful that the government will allow her to go to the flood-affected areas. If she goes there the flood-hit people will benefit, and the relief activities will get a momentum." He said Khaleda was eager to distribute relief at Sirajganj town, Kalihati and Bhuapur areas in Tangail. "All preparations are complete. The party workers with relief materials have already reached the areas," he said. However, there was no word about the plan from Bhuiyan. bdnews24
