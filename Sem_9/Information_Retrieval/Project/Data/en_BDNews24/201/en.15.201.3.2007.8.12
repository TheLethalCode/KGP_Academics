<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bvdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue will soon hold a meeting with the chief executives of banks to remove misgivings over a 10 percent tax on the interests of savings certificates. "Banks are taking taxes on savings certificates without properly understanding the NBR circular. It has created misgivings among depositors," NBR member Ali Ahmed told bdnews24.com Sunday. "We will hold a meeting in a few days with the CEOs or senior executives of banks to remove misunderstandings." Ahmed said the NBR circular spelled out that banks would take 10 percent off the interests on savings certificates with full maturity, effective from July 1, 2004. But the banks have deducted income tax on savings certificates at the rate of 10 percent, which had matured before the July 1, 2004 period, adding to confusion among people. The NBR circular also applies to the savings certificates that will mature after July 1, 2007, Ahmed said. bdnews24.
