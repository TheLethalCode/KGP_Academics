 LOS ANGELES, August 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As studios start focusing on next year's Academy Awards, organizers are encouraging them to reduce their mailings to voters. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences wants them to consolidate multiple mailings into a single mailing whenever possible or use e-mail instead. "We have been troubled in the past by the vast amount of surface mail that film companies generate in connection with their campaigns," Academy president Sid Ganis said.

In the case of screenplays, which companies are permitted to send to voters, new rules allow them to place downloadable versions on a Web site.

Academy Award nominations will be announced on January 22, with winners unveiled on February
