<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 08 (bdnews24.com)  The government is still to decide whether BNP chief Khaleda Zia can visit flood-hit people and distribute relief among them. At a press briefing at Bangladesh Secretariat Wednesday, disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury told reporters that BNP leader Hannan Shah had told him over phone that BNP leaders, led by Khaleda, wanted to distribute relief among flood victims in Sirajganj. "I welcomed their trip to help flood victims, but couldn't tell him (Hannan Shah) anything about Khaleda Zia's visit as it is closely linked to security," the adviser said. Tapan said he had asked Hannan Shah to talk to the home ministry about the matter. Md Mohsin, additional secretary of the home ministry, told reporters that the ministry had not had any talks on the issue. "I'll let you know after discussing the matter," he said. Earlier, Major Emdad of the Armed Forces Division briefed reporters on the condition of rivers and the flood situation. He said that the flood situation had improved in all districts other than in Dhaka. Water in the rivers receded. He hoped the situation might improve by Friday afternoon. He forecast that the situation in east Dhaka might deteriorate. On relief, Tapan said the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry had come up with relief materials for flood-affected people. Besides, the development partners have been carrying out their activities in 15 districts. Over a hundred non-governmental organisations under the NGO Federation launched a flood action programme. He said the US had given $2 million in relief aid. According to the government account, the flood so far has claimed at least 192 lives in the country. About one crore people are affected. A total of 1,601 shelters have been opened across the country. bdnews
