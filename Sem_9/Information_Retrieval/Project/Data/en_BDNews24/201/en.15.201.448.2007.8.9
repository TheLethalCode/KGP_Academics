 ANKARA, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition party said it would back the government's candidate for parliamentary speaker, virtually ensuring Koksal Toptan would be elected in a first round of voting due later on Thursday. The ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party nominated Toptan, a moderate conservative, for the key post on Wednesday in a conciliatory gesture towards Turkey's secular elite.
