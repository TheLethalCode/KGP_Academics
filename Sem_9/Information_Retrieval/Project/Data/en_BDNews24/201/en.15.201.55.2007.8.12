"Formulation of rules of engagement becomes complex when it relates to `Operations Other Than War' and combined or multinational operations, under the UN banner or any such coalitions," Masud said. He referred to the army personnel engaging and combating terrorism at home and abroad. Terrorism today transcends national boundaries and has become an issue of serious concern to the international community, he observed.
