 KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat cruised into the second round of the world badminton championships on Monday with an easy 21-13 21-7 win over unseeded Spaniard Jose Antonio Crespo. The Indonesian was barely stretched and sealed victory in less than 30 minutes. "That was comfortable," he told reporters. "But we will see what happens in the second round the day after tomorrow." Hidayat is seeking to regain the world title he last held in 2005 and his appearance on Monday morning was the highlight of an otherwise low-key start to the week-long tournament. The 15,000-capacity Putra stadium was virtually empty as Malaysians preferred to await the arrival of men's singles gold medal prospect Lee Chong Wei and exciting doubles pair Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong. Several leading seeds have byes in the first round and will not be in action until Wednesday. Hidayat, seeded only eight, had at one time been a doubt for the championships as his wife awaited the birth of their child. But baby daughter Natarina arrived 10 days ago. "I was more relaxed today," Hidayat said. If all goes to plan Hidayat will meet world number one and defending champion Lin Dan of China in the quarter-finals. Lin and second seed Lee begin their campaigns on Wednesday evening
