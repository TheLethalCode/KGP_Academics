 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) With eyes on the World Qualifying round, the Bangladesh national hockey team are gearing up for next month's 7th Asia Cup in India. The sixth finishers of the 11-nation Asia Cup will play the World Cup Qualifying round next year, apparently a tough job for Bangladesh who have to put at least one of the Asian giants -- India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, China and Malaysia  behind them to secure a place for the qualifying round. Bangladesh were drawn for the Pool B along with India, South Korea, China, Thailand and Sri Lanka and the Pool A included Pakistan, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. "Our target is to finish sixth in the Asia Cup in Chennai leaving Malaysia or China behind to secure a place in the World Cup Qualifying round," coach Mahabub Harun told bdnews24.com Sunday. "I know it is a tough task for us, but if the team, mostly comprised of young players, can play potentially, they would be able to overcome Malaysia or China in the place-deciding matches," said the former national stick-wielder when asked about the national team's awful performance in the last Asia Cup to finish last out of eight teams. The boys have been practicing for over a month at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium under the supervisions of Haroon and Abdullah Piru. The Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) in the last week of July reduced the 28-member preliminary squad to 18 for the Asia Cup. Five new players will wear the national shirts for the first time as seven key players, members of the seventh-placed Bangladesh in the last Asian Games, did not turn up for the national commitment on the plea of different problems. "Those players who have been called for the first time have the ability to fill the vacuum created by the players who did not join the camp. "They may feel psychological pressure when against the giants, but I think they will be able to overcome it through two warm-up matches, probably against Pakistan and Japan," said the former national midfielder, who led the national team for three years from 1993 to 1996 and played three editions of the Asia Cup from 1993 to 1999. Bangladesh's best result in the Asia Cup was at home in 1985 where they finished sixth out of 10 teams. Besides, they finished sixth twice in Japan in 1993 and in Malaysia in 1999 and the 4th Asia Cup at Hiroshima in Japan comprising nine teams and the 5th Asia Cup in Malaysia consisting 10 teams. On which areas he was focusing the training, Haroon said that he was working mostly not to concede any goal from the penalty corner as well as to convert the penalty corner against the opponents. "It is now usual that the big teams like India, Pakistan take lead converting the penalty corner instead of field goal and it makes difference between minnows and giants. I am working in this area so that the defenders can thwart the opponent's penalty corner attempts," explained Haroon. Haroon hoped that his boys would beat Sri Lanka and Thailand in line with 4-3-3 formation and would be able to put up good fights against India, Korea and China in the defensive 4-4-2 formation. Probable 11: Jahid Hossain/Mahabub Ullah Shakil (goalkeeper), Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Isa Mia and Yamin Hossain, Shamsuddin Tuhin/uncapped Imran Hossain Pintu (defenders), Khandokar Hasan Ahmed, Shahidullah Titu and uncapped Qumruzzaman Rana (midfielders), Russel Mahmud Jimy, Jahidul Islam Rajon and uncapped Iqbal Nader Prince (strikers). bdn
