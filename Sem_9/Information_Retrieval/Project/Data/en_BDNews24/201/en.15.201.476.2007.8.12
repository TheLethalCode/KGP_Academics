 SEOUL, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The South Korean government on Sunday declined to comment on a claim Afghanistan's Taliban had freed two South Korean hostages. On Saturday, Taliban insurgents who have held 21 Koreans captive for nearly a month said they had released two female hostages without any conditions, but Afghanistan government officials said they had no knowledge of such a release.
