<TITLE> Premier League ring the changes after Tevez affair </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier League transfer rules have been changed in a bid to avoid a repeat of Carlos Tevez's controversial first season in English football, British media reported on Thursday. A breach of the Premier League's rules on third-party ownership led to West Ham United being fined 5.5 million pounds ($11.20 million) in April for the terms of the Argentina striker's contract. Tevez's goals kept West Ham in the top flight last season but their survival led to a bitter row with Sheffield United, who were relegated, and prompted criticism of the Premier League's handling of the affair. "We cannot keep taking this blow to our reputation and the clubs recognise that," league chief executive Richard Scudamore was quoted as telling The Times on Thursday. "I think there is a feeling that we have to act differently to avoid this turmoil. "On the back of the Tevez situation we have changed the rules so that all documentation relating to player registration and employment has to be submitted in advance of signing the player. "Among West Ham United's defences was that they believed the third-party agreement did not have anything to do with the player's registration and that is why it was not shown to the Premier League. "Our policy now is 'let us be the judge'." OWNERSHIP ISSUE West Ham have since released Tevez's registration following a deal with his agent Kia Joorabchian, whose companies were at the centre of the third-party issue. The striker is now expected to complete a move to champions Manchester United, once the deal is cleared by the league. "We will look at the issue of third-party ownership," Scuadmore said. "It can never be stopped entirely -- banks have interests in players -- but at the moment these third parties are outside the regulatory tent." Other rule changes discussed at the league's annual general meeting in June are expected to be ratified next week with loan deals, notably for goalkeepers, on the agenda. "Under the old rules a club could technically have 19 goalkeepers out on loan, which would not be healthy," Scudamore said. "It would be like having a plant in the camp, so we are proposing that no more than one goalkeeper can be on loan from one club.
