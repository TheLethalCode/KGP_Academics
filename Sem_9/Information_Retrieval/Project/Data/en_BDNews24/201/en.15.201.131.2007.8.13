<TITLE> North Korea delays planning for summit with South </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, August 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has agreed to hold preparatory talks on Tuesday, a day later than scheduled, for the second summit with the South in more than 50 years. The two sides, still technically at war, have barely two weeks to prepare an agenda for the Aug. 28-30 meeting between South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in what will be the first such summit in seven years. "The North side sent a telephone message this morning to propose a preparatory meeting in the morning of the 14th at the Janamsan Inn," South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement on Monday. The venue for the session is in Kaesong, a South Korean industrial park just north of the 4-km (2.5 mile) wide buffer zone that has divided the two Koreas since their 1950-53 war. "We will be accepting the proposal," a ministry official said. The governments of the two Koreas hailed the summit as a chance to bring peace to the Cold War's last frontier, which is watched over by close to two million troops and batteries of artillery and missiles. But North Korea turned down Seoul's proposal for holding the first planning session on Monday, without offering an explanation, the ministry official said. It has also rejected South Korea's plans, set after the first summit, to hold the next leaders' meeting in Seoul. The summit has been greeted with a heavy dose of scepticism in the South, where the unpopular Roh -- who has six months left in office -- has been accused of quickly arranging the meeting for domestic politicking. Setting the agenda for the summit looks to be a formidable task and could include issues such as having North Korea live up to a six-country agreement to scrap its nuclear weapons and discussing a peace regime for the peninsula.
