 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Sunday announced two squads for this month's Merdeka Cup in Malaysia and Nehru Cup in India. "Keeping in mind the thinking of the SAF Championship in December, we have preferred to make the Nehru Cup squad strong rather than the Merdeka squad," said BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. "Those teams participating in the Nehru Cup are comparatively strong than the teams of Merdeka Cup .Coach Syed Naeemuddin also wanted to send a strong team to India where Syria, Kyrgyzstan, hosts India, Cambodia and Bangladesh will play league-basis matches," said Malu, who is also chairman of the team management committee. The 13-day Nehru Cup will start on August 17. "However, the Merdeka squad is by no means a weak team, which included a bunch of young players along with veterans Hasan Al Mamun, Parvez Babu, Mahmudul Hasan, Motiur Munna and Saifur Rahman Moni," said Malu. Bangladesh were drawn along with Myanmar, hosts Malaysia and Lesotho in Group B of the Merdeka Cup while the Group A consisted of Singapore, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Indonesia. The tournament will kick off on August 20 in Kuala Lumpur. It was tough for the BFF to form two squads due to shortage of players as veterans Alfaz Ahmed, Nazrul Islam, Firoz Mahmud Titu, Motiur Munna and Rajani Kanta Barman sought to go into retirement from the national fold. "I made some veteran players understand to play for the national side this time and they have agreed to play for the country," said Malu. The Nehru Cup squad comprises 20 players and five officials while the Merdeka Cup squad consists of 18 players and five officials.
