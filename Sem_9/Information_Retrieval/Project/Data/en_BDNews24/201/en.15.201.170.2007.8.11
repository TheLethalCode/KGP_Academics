 Washington, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central banks from Frankfurt to Sydney have injected more than US$300 billion in extra cash into banking systems to calm panicky credit markets in the last 48 hours. The following is a breakdown of their actions: US FEDERAL RESERVE The Fed added $38 billion into the US banking system on Friday through three separate repurchase agreements, its biggest single-day cash injection since Sept. 19, 2001. The repos brought down the federal funds rate, cost of overnight loans between banks, back to the Fed's rate target of 5.25 percent. EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK The ECB pumped 94.8 billion euros ($130.6 billion) in a one-day tender on Thursday, the largest amount ever. It followed with 61.05 billion euros ($83.61 billion) in a 3-day tender on Friday and said it continues to closely monitor conditions in the euro money market. The totals dwarfed the amounts that the ECB flooded into markets immediately after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. At that time, 69.3 billion euros in overnight money was allocated on Sept. 12, 2001, followed by 40.5 billion euros the next day. BANK OF CANADA The Bank of Canada injected C$1.64 billion ($1.55 billion), saying it was in contact with other central banks on the situation and stood ready to add money as needed. BANK OF JAPAN The BoJ supplied 1.0 trillion yen ($8.45 billion) at its regular money market operation on Friday after a slight rise in the benchmark overnight call rate. Traders said the amount was at the higher end of market expectations, but not a major surprise. THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA The RBA on Friday added more than twice the usual amount of money into the banking system, injecting A$4.95 billion ($4.19 billion) in its regular morning money market operation. SWISS NATIONAL BANK The SNB offered banks money at a below-market rate of 2.6 percent for the second day in a row on Friday. Traders estimated that 2-3 billion Swiss francs ($1.68-2.51 billion) was probably injected on Thursday, when the market rate was at 3 percent. CENTRAL BANKS OF MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES Traders said central banks in Asia intervened in foreign exchange markets on Friday to support their respective currencies by selling US dollars. BANK OF KOREA South Korea's central bank said on Friday it was ready to add funds to markets if needed. CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY The central bank said Thursday's loan of 45 billion crowns ($7.80 billion) gave ample liquidity to banks and it would continue to ensure orderly operations in the money market. bd
