 ZAGREB, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two people were killed and 40 were injured when a bus carrying Serbian tourists to the Croatian Adriatic coast overturned, local media reported on Friday. The accident took place near Karlovac, some 50 km (30 miles) south of Zagreb, on the highway linking the capital with southern Croatia. Police said the cause of the accident was not yet known. There were no life-threatening injuries, they added. The number of accidents with fatalities has increased on Croatia's roads in recent months after a large number of vehicles, many from abroad, swamped the country during the summer season. Police responded by deploying an increased number of traffic police, particularly during the weekends.
