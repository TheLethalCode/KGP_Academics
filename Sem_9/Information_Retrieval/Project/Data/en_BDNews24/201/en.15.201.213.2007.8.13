 LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wayne Rooney's broken foot has left England coach Steve McClaren with a mounting injury crisis ahead of next month's Euro 2008 qualifiers. McClaren, who is due to announce his squad on Friday to face Germany in a friendly at Wembley next week, has problems up front and in defence. Rooney suffered a hairline fracture of his left foot in Manchester United's 0-0 draw with Reading in the Premier League on Sunday, a club spokesman confirmed on Monday. The 21-year-old is expected to be out for at least six weeks after suffering his third foot injury in four years, but the first to his left foot. Another England striker, Newcastle United's Michael Owen, is still recovering from a thigh injury and appears to have little chance of facing Germany. England also have problems in central defence following injuries to captain John Terry of Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur's Ledley King and Middlesbrough's Jonathan Woodgate. King and Woodgate are recovering from knee operations while Terry is doubtful because of knee ligament damage. Manchester United right back Gary Neville and Chelsea left back Wayne Bridge are also out with ankle and hip problems respectively. In addition, McClaren knows former captain David Beckham has yet to play a full game for his new club Los Angeles Galaxy. "There is no doubt the manager has a lot of injuries to weigh up and there are more (league) games to play this week," an FA spokesman told Reuters. England play Germany on Aug. 22 before hosting Israel (Sept. 8) and Russia (Sept. 12) in two Euro 2008 qualifiers. McClaren's team are fourth in Group E with 14 points from seven games, behind Croatia (17), Israel (17) and Russia (15)
