 TOKYO, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US ambassador Thomas Schieffer pitched the case for Tokyo to extend its support for US-led operations in Afghanistan to Japan's main opposition party leader on Wednesday and said he remained hopeful despite a rebuff. Schieffer requested the meeting with Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa after his party's stunning victory in a July 29 election for parliament's upper house. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to extend a law enabling Japan's navy to provide fuel and goods for US-led coalition warships in the Indian Ocean as support for operations in Afghanistan. Ozawa has made clear he is opposed to that. "I hope that you will take note of the fact that the task force is there under United Nations authorisation and that authorisation was just renewed last spring," Schieffer told Ozawa in a 40-minute meeting that was open to the media. "We hope, we believe, that Japan can not only contribute to the international security of the world, but also to its own security," Schieffer said, noting that Japan relies on the Middle East for some 90 percent of its oil supplies. But Ozawa argued Japan should not take take part in the US-led operations in Afghanistan because they had not been sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. "The US-led operations in which Japan has been taking part are not directly authorised by the UN Security Council," Ozawa told Schieffer. "President (George W.) Bush said the Afghan war was an American war against terrorism, and the United States unilaterally fought the war without waiting for consensus from the international community." Ozawa said Japan could join in UN-backed peace-keeping operations similar to what had been carried out by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. "Unfortunately, if I were to take the position, Japan would not be able to take part in the US-operations, but Japan would actively take part in peace-keeping operations authorised by the United Nations." Schieffer repeatedly stressed the US operations in Afghanistan had been mandated by the United Nations. "But your indication that United Nations approval of this sort of mission would change your position gives me some hope." Schieffer said, arguing that a March 2007 U.N. resolution gave a UN stamp of approval to the operation. Ozawa noted the 1947 US-drafted constitution renounces Japan's right to wage war and the use or threat of force to settle international disputes. "We cannot take part in joint operations with the United States or other countries in areas that are not directly linked to Japan's peace and security," he said. Last week's election deprived the LDP and its junior partner of their majority in the upper house, meaning the Democrats and their allies can reject bills approved by the lower chamber. Bills rejected by the upper house can be returned to the lower house and enacted by the ruling parties' two-thirds majority, but that is a time-consuming process and the law enabling the Indian Ocean operation expires on November 1. Schieffer said Japan's participation was especially important because its ships supply high-grade fuel needed by Pakistani ships, as it was important to keep Pakistan involved as the only Muslim country taking pa
