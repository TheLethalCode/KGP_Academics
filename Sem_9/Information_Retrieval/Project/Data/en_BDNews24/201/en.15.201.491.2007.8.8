 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Development partners have agreed to provide about $4 million to help the government combat the ongoing floods, an official said Wednesday. The grant pledge was made at a meeting between the government and the donors working in Bangladesh Wednesday. Economic Relations Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan led the Bangladesh delegation while Xian Zhu, World Bank country director led the donors under the banner of Local Consultative Group (LCG). The meeting titled "LCG 'special plenary' meeting on the floods" was initiated by the LCG. "They (donors) have come to help Bangladesh spontaneously," Aminul Islam Bhuiyan told reporters after the meeting. Bhuiyan said: "Donors have already pledged to grant Bangladesh $4 million to aid the flood-affected people." The United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have already pledged. "Australia and Japan will tell us shortly," the ERD secretary said. Multi-lateral lending agencies, the WB and the Asian Development Bank have not made instant commitments, but have suggested that the government divert funds from the annual development programme (ADP), a highly placed meeting source, requesting anonymity, told bdnews24.com. Bhuiyan said that generally the WB did not help at this stage. UN agencies, including Unicef and the World Food Programme have already involved themselves in helping the flood victims. Government figures showed that 39 districts, 283 upazilas, 1,840 unions and pourashava and 2368,180 families had been affected by the floods. Xian Zhu, the co-chair of the meeting said that development partners had come to express their viewpoints on the process of their support. "They are very much willing to help Bangladesh," Zhu said. The WB made a presentation on the ongoing floods at the meeting. The WB said that this year's flood damage was still by far lower than that in the 2004 floods. Some 38 percent areas were inundated in the 2004 floods while it is only 15.5 percent, affected so far by this year's deluge. Replying to a query on economic losses, the ERD secretary said the matter was still to be assessed. According to a joint assessment by the WB and ADB, the 2004 floods had caused losses worth $2.2 billion. Assets worth $1.3 billion were damaged at the time. bd
