 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) The chamber judge of the Supreme Court Sunday did not stay the High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. The judge transferred the government's twin appeals to a regular bench for a full-court hearing on August 14. The court also kept in place the High Court stay order on the efficacy of the Anticorruption Commission's notice on the detained former prime minister. The ACC served notice on Hasina on July 17, a day after she was arrested, asking her to submit a wealth statement. The court did not stay the bail order for former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo either and set Aug 14 for hearing the government appeal filed for staying Mintoo's bail. The court of chamber judge, justice Hasan Amin, made the orders transferring the government appeals to the regular bench for hearing. BATTLES AHEAD The government Thursday filed the appeals against the High Court bail to Hasina and a stay order on the efficacy of the ACC notice. Two days earlier, the HC granted bail to Hasina on Aug 7 in the Tk 5 crore extortion case filed by Noor Ali, a long-time pro-Awami League businessman. The same bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury stayed the efficacy of the ACC notice served on Hasina asking her to submit a wealth statement by the deadline. Joint forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in connection with another extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading. The HC on July 30 granted Hasina bail in the case and stayed the case proceedings. But the Appellate Division on Aug 2 stayed the HC order for bail until Aug 14, after the government had moved against the HC verdict. MINTOO CASE Joint forces arrested Mintoo on May 30 and the court awarded him detention in jail. The HC on Aug 7 granted bail to Mintoo and stayed his detention order after his lawyers filed a writ petition. The court also issued a rule on the government to explain in four weeks' time why he will not be produced before court to make sure he is not detained illegally. bdnews24.co
