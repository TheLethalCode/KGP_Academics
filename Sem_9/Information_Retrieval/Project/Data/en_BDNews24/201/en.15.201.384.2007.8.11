 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Hundreds of diarrhoea patients Saturday continued to stream into Dhaka's cholera hospital amid reports that waters in many rivers that overflowed for weeks continued to fall. The latest death toll from floods and diarrhoea stood at 253. More than 1,000 patients, including many children, have been treated in the past 24 hours in the hospital run by the ICDDR,B, officials said. It was, however, a tiny portion compared with the total diarrhoea-affected people. The latest official figures say that a total of 72,914 people have been inflicted by various waterborne diseases since floods started battering the country weeks ago. The ICDDR, B officials said 600 to 1,000 diarrhoea patients are coming every day to the hospital that set up tents outside the main hospital building to cope with the increasing flow of patients. Dr Tahmeed Ahmed, who treated some severe patients Saturday, said that about 6,000 patients had received treatment at the hospital over the past week. He said the daily arrivals of patients have increased at least by four times from a week-ago rate. "It's a very critical situation we're passing through," Ahmed said. "But we have enough strength to deal with the situation." Authorities have set up about 500 makeshift beds outside the main hospital complex that accommodates 250 patients, said senior nurse Amena Khatun, who was busy at the emergency department to list new patients, mostly from poor families. She said most of the patients came from the capital's eastern and southern suburbs. "It's clear that most of the cases are related to floods," she said. Under the tents, some children were crying, as some attendants were busy treating patients with water to lower fever. The tents supported by bamboo poles have been pitched to rows of coconut trees while electric fans were moving overhead amid sweltering heat. Mothers of small children looked anxious. The beds were covered with plastic sheets where health workers were busy pushing intravenous fluid to most patients, especially the children, with severe dehydration. Many were seen vomiting. Emergency health workers rushed to the gate when a CNG autorickshaw arrived with a patient. Bags of intravenous saline piled up on wooden benches or tables while some health workers used megaphones to remind the attendants of giving oral saline to the patients or clean the beds. Josna Rani Das was crying holding her husband's hand, as their eight-month-old child was lying on a bedalmost lifeless. Nurses and attendants of other patients were shocked to see the baby's pale face and closed eyes. Mukti has been suffering from diarrhoea for five days, Josna said. On Saturday, Mukti became unconscious after she vomited three times since morning. "I hope she would improve by noon," Dr Ahmed said. "Initially I couldn't feel the pulse. I thought she was gone." Dr Ahmed said most of the severe cases happen just because of ignorance of the families about the simple solution to the disease. "They don't give enough liquid to their children," he aid, adding that the families were too late to take the patients to hospital. As he was speaking to this correspondent, a CNG autorickshaw pulled in near the gate of the makeshift tents with an unconscious man, about 30-year-old. The doctor rushed to the patient, eyes closed. Health workers raced the man to an empty bed where Dr Ahmed struggled for minutes to feel his pulse. "You see, this man was minutes away from death," he said. "If you stay here for an hour, I'm sure you'll get at least a dozen of such cases," he told this correspondent. "We're advising the patients to drink more liquid to keep them fit," he said. Relatives of the patients were waiting outside the hospital. Mofiza, 50, was sitting on a concrete basement outside. Her Gazipur home was flooded and their hand-pulled tubewell that provides drinking water remained inundated for about three weeks. She said her six-year-old grandchild, Nadia, has been suffering from diarrhoea for six days. "When we took her to the hospital she was unconscious," she said. "I don't know what will happen to her," she said. bd
