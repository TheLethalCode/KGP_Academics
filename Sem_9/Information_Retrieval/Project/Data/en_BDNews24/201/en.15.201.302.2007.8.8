 TBILISI, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A missile that landed in Georgia was ditched, not fired, by a Russian jet as it fled Georgian airspace, a Georgian official said on Wednesday as the United States and Europe urged the two powers to stay calm. The missile weighing about a ton landed -- but did not explode -- in a farmer's field about 65 km (40 miles) west of Tbilisi on Monday, sparking a slanging match between Georgia and Russia and re-igniting old tensions. Georgia initially said the missile had been fired by Russian jets. But a Georgian official told Reuters on Wednesday that the Russian pilot dumped the missile after coming under fire from separatist forces in South Ossetia, a Moscow-backed breakaway region of Georgia, in an apparent mix up. As Russia continued to deny any involvement in the incident, the United States and the European Union both appealed for the two sides to cool rhetoric and show restraint. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States had spoken to both sides and was analysing who might be responsible for the ioncident. "In the past we have encouraged Russia and Georgia to work out through political channels any differences that they may have so that you don't have an escalation of tensions," he told reporters. The European Union also called for restraint. A spokeswoman for the European Commmission in Brussels said the full facts of the missile incident were not yet known. "Number one we are calling on both sides to use restraint," Christiane Hohmann told a news briefing in Brussels. "We call on both sides, Georgia and Russia, to cooperate on this issue." Russia has denied its military had anything to do with the missile and instead suggested Georgia may have dropped the bomb itself to provoke a spat with Russia. In the new version of events, the Georgian official, who did not wish to be named, said the missile landed in Georgia as the result of a mix-up involving a Russian jet trespassing in Georgian airspace. An investigation suggested the pilot did not fire but jettisoned the missile and fled after friendly forces in South Ossetia -- which backs Russia -- mistakenly fired an anti-aircraft missile at his jet. "The pilot of the fighter jet decided to get rid of a guided missile he had on board," said the official, who did not want to be identified. "That explains why it did not explode." A spokesman for Russia's defence ministry dismissed that explanation. A spokeswoman for South Ossetia's separatist administration said it was "absurd," and that its forces in the area only had light weapons. Security watchdog the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is preparing a report which may shed light on the origin of the missile. Russia's foreign ministry issued a new statement on Wednesday pointing the finger at Georgia. "Moscow is extremely concerned about the incident," it said in a statement. "(It) sees it as an attempt to wreck the positive trends that have been noted in Russian-Georgian relations and also to complicate efforts for a settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict." Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili, a US-trained lawyer who has assertively pulled his country out of Moscow's orbit since coming to power four years ago, said Tbilisi's response to the missile would be calm and measured. But he also urged Western nations to condemn Moscow, saying the missile incident was part of a broader pattern of Russia bullying its pro-Western neigbou
