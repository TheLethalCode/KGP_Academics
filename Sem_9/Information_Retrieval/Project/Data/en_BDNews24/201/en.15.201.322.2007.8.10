 MADRID, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Spanish cruise ship has rescued 27 migrants from the sea near Malta after earlier spotting a boat carrying another 225 migrants, El Pais newspaper reported on its Web site on Friday. The cruise ship, belonging to tour group Vision Cruises, found the migrants wearing lifejackets and floating in the Mediterranean around 80 miles (130 km) off the Maltese coast. Staff are now looking after them on board in a makeshift hospital, El Pais said. Maltese authorities have given the ship permission to dock, but not for the migrants to disembark, the paper said. The same ship discovered a boat carrying 225 people off the coast of Malta two hours earlier. It had notified the Maltese authorities and kept guard over the boat until a patrol arrived. Nobody at Vision Cruises or the Spanish maritime rescue authority was available to comment. Malta and Spain are two of the most popular entry points for African migrants turning to Europe in search of a better life, and thousands die each year during perilous sea crossings.
