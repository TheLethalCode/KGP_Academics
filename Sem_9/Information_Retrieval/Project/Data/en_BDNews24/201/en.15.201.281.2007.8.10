 Dhaka, August 10 (bdnews24.com)  The daily average turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange fell for a second week, depressed by a regulatory move suspending financial adjustment facility for quality shares to rein in a lingering surge in stocks prices and liquidity flow. A strict surveillance over loan extension by merchant banks and the ongoing floods also influenced investor sentiment, market players said. Turnover on the bourse fell to Tk 1.28 billion last week from Tk l.47 billion the previous week, according to Dhaka Stock Exchange. The DSE witnessed the downturn in turnover since July 29 after the bourse withdrew the financial adjustment facility for B, G and N category shares. A Securities and Exchange Commission directive on July 30 suspending the financial adjustment facility for 'A' shares rubbed salt to the wound. The facility allowed investors to buy stocks with the sale proceeds immediately after completing a sale. The suspension now compels investors to wait four days until the final settlement of the transaction. The result a steady slide in turnover and prices of stocks. The daily average turnover, which reached an all-time high of Tk 2.23 billion in July 22-26 trading week, fell to Tk 1.47 billion the following week (July 29-August 2). "The suspension of financial adjustment facility and strict surveillance over margin loan extension by merchant banks pushed the market and the turnover down," said a stocks broker, who preferred to be unnamed. Stocks, recording a steady surge since early May, started losing steam amid the regulatory move to cool down the lingering surge in the prices of stocks and liquidity flow. A financial adjustment facility and unbridled margin loans by merchant banks contributed to the surge in the market, participants said. As part of the drive, the SEC, by end-July, also moved to rein in undisciplined margin loans extended by merchant banks. The SEC step, asking merchant banks to send details on how much loan they had extended to their clients, current and former employees, influenced sell-offs on the bourses. The main index DGEN or general index lost 91.92 points or 3.84 percent to close at Tk 2304.12. The DSE-20 blue chip index slumped 97.72 points or 4.53 percent to 2061.65. The DSI or all-share price index, however, narrowed down the losses at 58.07 points or 2.97 percent to 1897.88, due mainly to rise in Rupali Bank, one of the market heavyweights,. Ahmad Rashid Lali, vice president of the DSE, observed the market was chilling out just the way the SEC wanted it to be. "It was necessary to cool down the prices of some shares that were rising unusually. The market will be stable after the prices come down to a reasonable level. But there is nothing to worry. The SEC move is temporary," he said. bd
