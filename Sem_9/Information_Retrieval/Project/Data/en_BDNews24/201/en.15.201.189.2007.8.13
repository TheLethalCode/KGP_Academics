 Dhaka, August 13 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Monday said that it would be tough to control inflation without increasing farm output. "We have to cash in on the experience of the better yields we got after the 2004 floods. Our major concern is to increase production and encourage imports to curb inflation. We are working on it," the central bank governor told reporters after a meeting with the chief executives of non-bank financial institutions. The BB governor, chief of the monetary policy authority, expressed concern over 39 districts of the country being submerged resulting in the loss of about 300 lives and damage to crops on about 7 lakh acres, according to official data. In June, higher prices of food items coupled with an increase in non-food prices drove the country's month-to-month inflation to a historic height of 9.20 percent. Inflation in May was 8.05 percent. "We have asked every bank to open a separate cell to monitor overall agricultural loan disbursements," Ahmed said, referring to private banks setting a target of disbursing Tk 1,000 crore to agriculture. But banks should be careful about fixing interest rates against farm loans so that they remain tolerable for farmers, he said. Ahmed said the people's living standards depended largely on the growth and production of agricultural commodities. "The growth of agriculture facilitates the growth of other sectors. But a decline in farm output affects the living standards even if other sectors such as services and housing perform well," he said. The governor hoped that the flood would not affect country's economic growth prospects too much if proper measures for rehabilitation were taken. He stressed on the need for a congenial investment climate for growth. bdnews24.
