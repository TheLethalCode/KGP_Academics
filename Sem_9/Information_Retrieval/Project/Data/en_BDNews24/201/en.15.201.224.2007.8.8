 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British water company Severn Trent said on Wednesday that recent floods in the west of England could cost it up to 35 million pounds ($71 million), although the impact would be reduced by insurance cover. Severn Trent's Mythe Water Treatment Works near Tewkesbury, western England, flooded in July, leaving around 340,000 customers without running water for over a week. The damage and disruption is likely to cost the company between 25 million and 35 million pounds ($51-$72 million), it said in a statement. Between 10 million and 20 million pounds are likely to be covered by insurance, but estimates can change over the coming weeks, it added. "The size and scale of both this incident and the response are, we believe, unprecedented in the recent history of the UK Water Industry," Severn Trent said. "We believe we will have a fuller understanding of these costs by the time we provide our interim pre-close update in early October 2007." The wettest May-July period since records began in 1766 brought two bouts of flooding to parts of England, killing at least nine people, damaging houses and destroying crops. Insurers estimate the flood damage at about 3 billion pounds. Cazenove analysts said a net impact of 15 million pounds on Severn Trent would reduce its 2007-8 operating profit forecast by 3.3 percent to 437 million pounds. At 0825 GMT, Severn Trent shares were down 0.8 percent at 1,351 pence, valuing the business at about 3 billion pounds. By comparison, the a FTSE-100 index was up 0.6 percent. Severn Trent, which supplies more than 8 million customers in England and Wales with water and sewerage services, said it made over 50 million litres of bottled water available to flood victims and also deployed over 1,300 water bowsers, which were refilled up to three times a day by over 100 tankers. It also said it planned to donate 3.5 million pounds to support communities affected by the flooding and that this sum was included in its overall cost estima
