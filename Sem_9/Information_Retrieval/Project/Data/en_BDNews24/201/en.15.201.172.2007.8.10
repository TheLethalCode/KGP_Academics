<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government has blown off as baseless the allegations made in at least two Bangla-language newspapers of political bias in evaluating and appointing public servants. >>For more, click here "Some newspapers mentioned an evaluation report on secretaries, acting secretaries and additional secretaries. The news reports are not based on facts," the government said in a statement Thursday. The appointments of deputy commissioners and other civil servants ranked above are based on evaluations of service records, it asserted. The government has emphasised that the top officials are working with "skills, neutrality and honesty and will continue to do so". The statement did not name any newspaper in particular, but it was found that Nayadiganta and Amar Desh had run news items alleging an 'evaluation report' provided by an unnamed intelligence agency. The government said: "Public officials are evaluated on the basis of the existing policy and system. So the question of evaluation on any other standards, as reported by newspapers, does not arise." The government particularly pointed to appointments of deputy commissioners. "Only 13 of the 64 deputy commissioners were appointed during the emergency government only after selection by a high-level secretary committee," the statement said. The other DCs have been working since the last political government's tenure, it said, adding: "Which is why the allegation of politicisation is completely untrue." "There is no scope, nor any reason for a non-party caretaker government to indulge in politicisation of the administration," it said. The government hoped the newspapers would try to report impersonally and objectively and refrain from publishing what it said was misleading news. For more, read the story in Bangla bdnew
