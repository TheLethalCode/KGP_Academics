 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) Biman Bangladesh Airlines lost Tk 1,900 crore in 34 years to corruption and anomalies, Transparency International Bangladesh said in a report Wednesday. The corruption watchdog said that $45 million (Tk 308.81 crore) had been swindled in the name of leasing aircraft in the past five years. The TIB arranged a discussion at the Jatiya Press Club to release the report. TIB officials Akter Hossain, AM Shamsuddoula and Mohammad Nur-e Alam conducted the research. The report said aircraft maintenance and repairing costs in Biman's fleet soared to Tk 489 crore from Tk 215 crore in the last four years but the number of aircraft had dwindled to 13 from 17 in the same period. Flying time had also declined by 25 percent. Biman managing director MA Momen and former president of Bangladesh Airlines Pilots' Association retired captain Nasimul Haque took part in the discussion. The report said that a few firms having political influence had got almost all the aircraft repairing work. An estimated Tk 50 crore out of Tk 90 crore allocated for repairing went down the drain a year. Leasing of aircraft and purchasing of spare parts also witnessed political influence and irregularities. Due to corruption, major agencies did not show interest to do business with Biman. Momen said the TIB report was correct. The actual picture of corruption was worse, he added. He said Biman would have to stop anomalies and corruption to shrug off its losses. He stressed government initiatives to change this situation. He said that the managing director, and not a minister or the chairman of the board of directors, would have to be given absolute executive power. Momen said that Biman should be freed of liabilities as it had been turned into a public limited company. Biman would have to have a cost-effective policy, he said. Biman did not owe any remarkable amount of money to any foreign firm despite there being no investment in the last 15 years. Moreover, the airlines operated hajj flights every year despite heavy losses, Momen said. Although Singapore Airlines buys jet fuel at 45 cents a litre, Biman has to pay 68 cents for the same. He said Biman could make Tk 200 crore profit a year if the policy of selling fuel could be changed. The Biman managing director said Biman had moved a step forward towards turning profitable on becoming a PLC. He said that nobody would buy shares of a loss-making companythe reason the authorities had decided not to list Biman on the stock market. ($1=Tk 68.62) bdnew
