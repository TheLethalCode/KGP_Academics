 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) - The council of advisers' committee on economic affairs Monday rejected two proposalsenactment of an ordinance to save the ailing industry and declaring the tannery industrial park in Savar a special zone. The committee in a meeting at the secretariat however approved a proposal by a Malaysian construction company for low-cost housing in Bangladesh. Also, another proposal for floating shares of Jamuna and Meghna oil companies on the stock market was approved in the meeting. The housing and public works ministry placed a proposal, saying a Malaysian company will build 100,000 low-cost flats. The committee gave the green light to the proposal but said other companies, not only the Malaysian one, will take an open chance to compete in the tender for the scheme. Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam in a post-meeting briefing said the so-called sick industry had earlier received assistance from the government but there was no visible sign of improvement. "Rather, it had weakened other industries," Islam told reporters. The government will stand by those industries that became "sick" for external reasons, not for their own mismanagement and inefficiencies. But it is difficult to identify which industries become sick for their own failure, he said. "That's why we have rejected the proposal to make an ordinance to help the sick industry," he said. "Such industries will get benefit as per the Bangladesh Bank rules. No special assistance will be given." Islam said the committee did not approve the proposal for declaring the tannery industrial zone a special area since law does not permit it. He said the committee attached conditions to the low-cost housing scheme, saying local companies, not only the Malaysian one, should be given chances to compete in bidding. "We have put the conditions so that local companies are not left out," he said. He said the government would float 49 percent of shares of Jamuna and Meghna that operate under Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. The government will keep most shares in hand so that the state-owned companies remain under its control, the adviser said. Energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury and other members of the council of advisers, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder and other top officials attended the meeting. bdnew
