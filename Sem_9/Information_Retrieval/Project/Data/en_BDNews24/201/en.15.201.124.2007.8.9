 GUWAHATI, India, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected separatist rebels shot dead eight people in India's north-eastern state of Assam on Wednesday, police said, in spiralling violence ahead of the country's independence day celebrations. The victims -- including two children and three women -- were dragged out of their homes and shot in the remote hill district of Karbi Anglong. "We suspect the ULFA's hand," a senior police officer said, referring to the United Liberation Front of Asom, among the most powerful of a dozen separatist groups in the region. The dead were all Hindi-speaking migrants who are often accused by the ULFA of diluting local culture and targetted to bolster support for the group's flagging popularity, police say. In one of the biggest such attacks in January, more than 70 poor Hindi-speaking migrants were allegedly killed by the ULFA. The group denies it. More than 20,000 people have been killed since the ULFA took up arms in 1979, accusing the central government of taking the state's rich forest and mineral resources and giving back nothing in return. The group is fighting for an independent homeland for Assam's 27 million people. Police say rebel attacks increased ahead of August 15 independence day celebrations which the ULFA along with other rebels groups in the region traditionally boycott. On Wednesday morning, a blast in Assam's main city of Guwahati wounded two people, a day after a string of explosions killed three people across the state
