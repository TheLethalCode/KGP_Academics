 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has received more foreign contributions for the relief of flood victims this week from the UK, Australia and Germany. Prince Charles sent a personal message to the people of Bangladesh expressing his concern and sympathy for those affected by the flooding. "My wife and I were deeply distressed to hear of the shocking devastation caused by the recent floods in Bangladesh," said the Prince of Wales in the message to President Iajuddin Ahmed, released by the British High Commission in Dhaka. "Our hearts go out to all those who have lost their loved ones or have been displaced from their homes, and to the many who are battling to survive everyday." Prince Charles said: "Please know how deeply we feel for yourself and the people of Bangladesh for whom we have the greatest affection." Responding to the floods, the UK had earlier given $2.5 million through its Department for International Development, for immediate aid, providing food, water, shelter and medicines for 50,000 people. DFID is also supporting Bangladesh government's ongoing relief work by channeling another $1.8 million through UNDP.
