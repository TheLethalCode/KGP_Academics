<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Iraq coach Jorvan Vieira has rejected speculation he will return to work for the Asian Cup champions for their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. The Brazilian, who quit after steering the beleaguered team to last month's fairytale victory in Jakarta, said he was considering several new jobs, but Iraq was not one of them. "I will not be returning. When I quit, I said it was my final decision," he told Reuters by telephone from Amman. "Many people have asked me to stay, but I won't be doing that. I am still looking at my options." Media reports in the Middle East this week suggested Vieira may return to coach Iraq ahead of their opening World Cup qualifier with Pakistan on Oct 8. The 54-year-old has been linked with a number of clubs in Asia and the Middle East and says he has been in contact with Australia and South Korea with a view to taking over as national team coach
