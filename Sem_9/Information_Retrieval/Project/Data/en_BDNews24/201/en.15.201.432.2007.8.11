 NEW YORK, August 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - People who experience high levels of stress and anxiety appear to be more likely to develop irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following a severe gastric infection, UK and New Zealand researchers report A variety of studies have suggested that the cause of IBD has psychological and behavioral components, Dr Rona Moss-Morris of the University of Southampton and Dr Meagan J Spence of the University of Auckland point out in the medical journal Gut.

They were then checked 3 and 6 months later to see if they had developed IBS. The researcher found that 49 of the patients had the condition at both follow-up points. Depression and perfectionism were not significantly associated with the onset of IBS. However, a variety of other factors were. These included significantly higher levels of perceived stress and anxiety. IBS patients were also significantly less likely to rest in the face of their illness, and exhibited 'all-or-nothing' behavior by continuing their activities despite their symptoms until they were forced to stop.
