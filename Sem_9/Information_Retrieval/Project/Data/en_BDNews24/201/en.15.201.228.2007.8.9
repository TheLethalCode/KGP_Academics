<TITLE> Dhoni cameo blunts England's fading hopes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahendra Singh Dhoni cracked 92 from just 81 deliveries to put India on the verge of a first test series win in England for 21 years on the second day of the third and final test at The Oval on Friday. India went into tea on 559 for seven leaving little hope for England to force the victory they need to square the series and protect their unbeaten streak in test series at home since 2001. After India resumed after lunch on 429 for six, England were unable to take the quick wickets they required as Dhoni reached his sixth half-century in tests before setting about the toiling English bowlers. Dhoni, whose stubborn 76 not out helped India save the first test at Lord's, went to 92 in just 16 balls after reaching his half-century. He ended with nine boundaries and four sixes. His eventual downfall came in a dramatic over bowled by occasional off-spinner Kevin Pietersen. After striking sixes over long-on and square leg, Dhoni attempted a third consecutive maximum but was caught by Alastair Cook at deep midwicket. Perhaps most frustrating of all for England was their inability to remove number eight batsman Anil Kumble, who was 60 not out at tea after reaching his fifth test half-century. India's total is currently the highest in test history where no batsman has managed three figures. Sachin Tendulkar was out for 82 before lunch while opener Dinesh Karthik made 91 on Thursday
