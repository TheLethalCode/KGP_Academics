<TEXT>
 LUANDA, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition parties and foreign observers are questioning whether Angola's government will honour a delayed pledge to hold national elections next year and in 2009 as a massive voter registration campaign nears an end. Angolan authorities announced late last week that more than 7 million people -- the bulk of those eligible to vote in the 2008 parliamentary elections -- had been registered and that the remaining 500,000 would be added to voter lists by next month. But the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, has failed to set a date for the ballot and a presidential poll the following year, renewing fears they could be postponed again. Angola, sub-Saharan Africa's second largest oil producer, has not held a national election since a disastrous 1992 presidential race was aborted after the first round, leading to the resumption of a 27-year civil war. The ruling party has delayed the polls several times, citing the poor condition of roads and other infrastructure as reasons. "Some circles within the MPLA are willing to have elections, but others -- maybe those with the most influence -- are still hesitating," said Alcides Sakala, parliamentary president for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the main opposition party. "That's why we need to hear from the President," Sakala said. "Does he want to carry on in this uncertainty, or does he have a clear position on timing for elections?" Western diplomats and executives agreed that there were nagging doubts whether President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who was instrumental in placing Angola within the Communist orbit in the 1980s, would risk a free election. Dos Santos, who took power in 1979 and is widely expected to run for another term, and his officials have shied away from setting dates for the polls since committing to holding them in 2008 and 2009. Angolan government officials were not immediately available for comment this week. "Everyone wants to know when they will have elections," a Western executive in Luanda, Angola's booming capital, said on condition of anonymity. There are fears that the elections, if delayed yet again or seen to be illegitimate, could widen the political divide that has existed since the end of the conflict between the MPLA and UNITA rebels in 2002. Angola's last national election ended abruptly when UNITA and its then-leader Jonas Savimbi refused to accept first-round results showing dos Santos far ahead in the presidential race. UNITA returned to the bush and resumed the conflict that cost the lives of one million Angolans. Savimbi was killed in 2002, paving the way for peace. Although UNITA has transformed itself into a political party since laying down arms, it is sceptical of the election process and accuses the ruling party of using government coffers and state-run media to cement electoral advantages. Human rights groups and Western governments have also questioned the MPLA's democratic credentials. "Angola is seen as a rule breaker in international circles, so it's important for them to send the message that they respect democratic rules in general," a Western diplomat in Luanda said. "It's also important to show, now that the war is over, they are normalising the country." Angola's voter registration started slowly late last year, with officials complaining of difficulties reaching people in more remote parts of the southwestern African country, where roads are often unpassable and electricity scarce. The effort picked up steam recently, particularly during the dry winter months when road conditions typically impro
