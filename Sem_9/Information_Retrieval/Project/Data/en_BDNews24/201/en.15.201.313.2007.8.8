<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 8 (bdnews24.com)Stocks fell Wednesday after the central bank imposed an embargo on the transfer of shares of AB Bank and AB Bank Foundation in IFIC Bank. "The market is passing a correction phase," said Yawer Sayeed, CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages about Tk 700 million in funds. Sayeed also pointed to the central bank's order that barred the selling or buying of IFIC Bank shares held by AB Bank and AB Bank Foundation. The central bank has recently imposed the embargo citing that AB Bank and AB Bank Foundation retain over 18 percent of the IFIC Bank illegally. Both the institutions remained almost inactive Wednesday following the central bank directive, market participants said. AB Bank plunged 10.26 percent to Tk 1300. Heavyweights in bank, power and pharmaceuticals also closed lower amid sell-offs. The DGEN or general index shed 20.58 points or 0.88 percent to close at 2301.35.
