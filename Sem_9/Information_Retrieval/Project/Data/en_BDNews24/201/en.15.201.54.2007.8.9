<TEXT>
 Hyderabad, August 9 (NDTV/TIMES NOW.tv) -- An unruly crowd attacked controversial writer Taslima Nasreen at the Hyderabad Press club in India Thursday. Three MLAs of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen or MIM were among those who attacked her with bouquets, flowerpots and virtually anything they could lay their hands on. The MLAs were detained after the incident. Taslima was heckled and hemmed in by MIM activists who also sloganeered against her. No injuries have been reported so far. TIMES NOW spoke to Akhtar Khan, one of the MLAs of MIM who fiercely protected their move of attacking the author. "She is enemy of Islam, she is a black spot on Muslims," lashed out a defiant Khan. "We cannot bear anyone talking against Islam. She has written books against our government, Islam. We will not tolerate her in Hyderabad." Threatening to continue his tirade against Taslima, Khan said they would continue doing this if she was not thrown out of Hyderabad. When asked about his party's stand on the attack, Khan proudly said, "I am a Muslim first and then an MLA. My party is with me in this." Taslima, who was rescued by the police and other journalists present at the press club, is believed to have been escorted to a safer place. One of the organisers of the programme was also injured in the pandemonium that ensued. Three people have been detained by the police for questioning. Taslima has faced numerous death threats from Islamic fundamentalists. Recently, in March 2007, an Indian Muslim group offered a bounty of 500,000 rupees for her beheading. A former Muslim, Taslima has said she has become an atheist.
