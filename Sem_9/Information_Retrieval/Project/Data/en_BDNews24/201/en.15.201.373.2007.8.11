 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Former secretary and ambassador Abdul Momin, who had inspired freedom fighters by severing connections with the Pakistan government and turning his allegiance to Bangladesh in 1971, died Saturday at age 86. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said he was deeply saddened by the death of Momin. He visited his family in Gulshan Saturday morning. In a message, the adviser said Momin was one of the leading figures who had founded the foreign policy of Bangladesh on a firm footing. The nation will remember his contribution to the field of diplomacy, Chowdhury said. Momin was born on March 10, 1921 at Udrajpur in Dagonbhuyian in Feni. He joined the Bengal Civil Service in 1946 and then was taken into the Pakistan Foreign Service in 1950. He had served a number of missions in various capacities in Rangoon, Washington DC, Baghdad, Shillong, Brussels and Lisbon. He had been ambassador to Argentina since 1970. After expressing allegiance to Bangladesh in October 1971, Momin remained on assignments given by Bangladesh government in Mujibnagar until he undertook as permanent secretary of the foreign office of the new country. He had also served as Bangladesh high commissioner to Canada and ambassador to China and France. He left behind his wife, a daughter and friends to mourn his death. bdnew
