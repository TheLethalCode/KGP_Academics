<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Army chief Moeen U Ahmed has again hinted that troops have no intention to go to power. General Moeen was pressed to comment on the matter Sunday during a brief chatting with reporters after he visited the ICDDR,B in Mohakhali where hundreds of patients struck by diarrhoea were being treated. His comment came after reporters took the chance to ask him if talk of the army coming to power was true. "We had earlier clearly said the army has no intention to go to power." "If the question still arises (from public or elsewhere) I have to say that by dying, Kadambini had proved that she was not dead," the general said cutting a joke and referring to the character in Rabindranath Tagore's short story Living or Dead?. The army chief had earlier visited the hospital and talked to the patients and the hospital authorities. He said some grave cases could be sent to the Combined Military Hospital because of a huge pressure on the specialised hospital, ICDDR,B. Also, he said, opening a medical centre at the hajj camp in Uttara could be another option to ease the pressure as the ICDDR,B authorities were managing a huge influx of patients with flood waters receding and diseases spreading. He also said the army doctors would come forward, if necessary, to help treat the diarrhoea patients. "Troops are doing their jobs and helping the flood-affected people. The army will try its best wherever the agency's services are required," he said. Asked to comment on the Election Commission's statement that despite floods or any other big disaster national elections would be held by 2008, the army chief said, "Now the biggest task is to stand by the flood victims." bdnews24.
