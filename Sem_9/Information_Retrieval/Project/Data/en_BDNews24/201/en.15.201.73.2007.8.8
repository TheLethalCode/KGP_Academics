 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) - An emergency meeting of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Wednesday accepted the resignation of general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal and has given the responsibility to its deputy general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. "Keeping the tradition intact, I brought the matter in the executive committee meeting and the meeting accepted it," BFF president SA Sultan told reporters after emerging from the meeting at the BFF House in Motijheel Wednesday. Helal tendered his resignation on July 24, the BFF president made it public on August 6 and called an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss the matter. The members of the executive committee accorded a farewell to tearful Helal with flower wreaths. "I was with football and will also be with football in future," said the outgoing general secretary. Asked whether the meeting made any request to Helal for considering his resignation, Sultan said, "No comment." "The meeting did not request him (Helal) to consider his resignation as the president had earlier accepted his resignation and I have just come here to say him good luck," said BFF joint secretary Anwar Hossain Ujjal. Sultan said that Helal was the lone person who left the federation with due honour. "We are not thinking of holding an election to fulfil the vacant post as we are preparing for the BFF election in next 10 to 12 weeks," said Sultan, former lawmaker of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) . "The deferment of the BFF election in line with the FIFA guidelines was not a pleasant one for us, and we would not want any such deferment in future," Sultan said, adding "We will inform the FIFA about the federation's latest development." Acting secretary Malu did not think that the resignation of Helal would affect the activities of the federation. Malu said,"Every thing is going in the right direction though we felt bad after the resignation of Helal. "We earlier worked splitting the responsibilities, but from now on, I have to work a bit more." The acting secretary believed that he would be able to face any problem with his experience.
