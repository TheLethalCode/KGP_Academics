 HONG KONG, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's strike trio of Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and new signing Thierry Henry tore apart a select Hong Kong team on Saturday as the Catalans strolled to a 4-0 win to round off their pre-season tour of Asia. The trip, criticised by many in the Spanish media for unnecessarily tiring the players, was extended by a day after a tropical cyclone forced organisers to postpone the match against Hong Kong's Mission Hills XI. Henry, Eto'o and midfielder Xavi scored in a one-sided first half, before Mexican teenager Giovanni Dos Santos made sure he scored in each of Barcelona's three games in Asia. "They worked really well," coach Frank Rijkaard told a post-match press conference, while Hong Kong players queued in front of Barcelona's dressing room for photos with Ronaldinho. "If you don't work, it can give the opponents wings, and hope," he said. "So I was happy with the game, especially observing the organisation." Xavi scored after 22 minutes, slotting a side-foot shot inside the right post, after a neat Eto'o turn and a through ball by Andres Iniesta. Barcelona's front three then combined for the second on 28 minutes when Henry found Ronaldinho on the left, who cut the ball back for Eto'o to drive low into the corner. The 22,000 Hong Kong crowd, many huddled under umbrellas in the half-full stadium, had to wait only eight more minutes for a headed Henry goal from an Eto'o cross. The greasy surface frustrated Ronaldinho on a couple of occasions when he failed to control passes and slipped over. The Brazilian also hoisted a free kick over the bar and blasted another into the Hong Kong wall. Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdez had a close escape early in the second half when he tipped a skidding cross onto the bar. Even with a rash of second-half substitutions, the Catalans dominated possession and rounded-off the victory when Giovanni raced onto a through ball and calmly shot past the keeper for his third goal of the three-match Asian tour. As a Mexican wave rippled around the stadium, Mission Hills goalkeeper Wang Zhen Peng kept the score down in the last minutes, parrying a shot onto the post, and tipping another onto the top of the crossbar. Barcelona were due to fly back to Spain on Saturday night to prepare for a match against Bayern Munich on Aug. 15
