<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Land ports on Bangladesh-India border will resolve export, import problems on their own from now. A bilateral meeting of the customs officials held in New Delhi on July 25-26 made the decision. No high-level meetings will be required to resolve such nitty-gritty regarding the trans-border trade and commerce, said Dr Rashid-Ul Ahsan Chowdhury, member (customs), National Board of Revenue Sunday. Chowdhury led the Bangladesh delegation to the fourth in a series of meetings in the Indian capital in July. "A number of policy decisions were taken at the meeting. The decision of locally resolving local problems by the local officials was a unique one," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. Any dispute or disagreement surfacing at any land port will be sorted out locally by the customs officials of the two countries present at the port, he said quoting the meeting decision. "Ports would often shut down over negligible disputes in the past. As a result, the two countries suffered losses as import-export activities used to be suspended over paltry issues. "We discussed the infrastructural development at the land ports in details. India has acceded to Bangladesh's demand that warehouses are to be built at ports which lack in such facilities," Chowdhury said. "The Indian government also agreed to cooperate in maintaining Banglabandha port at Panchagarh-Tentulia as a bustling hub," he said. "The delegates also agreed that customs officials would meet every six months and the truck transportation hours be extended." "Bangladesh demanded that India open Tegamukhi land port in Rangamati to allow access of Bangladeshi commodities to the Indian state of Mizoram." "Because of Mizoram's geographical location, it takes a long time for Indian goods to reach there; whereas, Bangladesh is its closest neighbour. "Therefore, importing Bangladeshi commodities would be economic for Mizoram, benefiting Bangladesh at the same time," Chowdhury observed. bdnews
