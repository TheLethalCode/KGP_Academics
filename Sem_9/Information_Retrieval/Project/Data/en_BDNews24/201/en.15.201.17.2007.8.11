<TITLE> NASA to take close look at shuttle shield damage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HOUSTON, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA said it will take a close look at a small but worrisome gouge in the heat shield of space shuttle Endeavour, discovered in photographs taken as the orbiter arrived on Friday at the International Space Station. The US space agency said ice may have developed on the shuttle's fuel tank that may have struck the ship's underside during Wednesday's launch from Florida, so a damage inspection using sensors on a robot arm will be performed on Sunday. Spacewalking astronauts will patch it up if NASA decides the three-inch gash threatens Endeavour's safety during its fiery return to Earth, said mission management team chairman John Shannon in a briefing at Johnson Space Center. He said other shuttles have returned safely with worse damage than this appears to be. "In the past, we didn't even know we had damage and we flew back home," he said. But that was before shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to Earth in 2003 due to heat shield damage that occurred during launch but went undetected. Its wing was struck by insulation foam that flew off the fuel tank. The seven astronauts on board died in the accident. Since then NASA has incorporated three damage inspections into each flight, including one from photographs taken of the shuttle's belly as it approaches the space station. Those photos by the station crew were transmitted to NASA, where officials spotted the gouge. Videos taken at launch had shown a spray of debris in that area of the shuttle, they said. After a two-day chase through space, the shuttle linked up with the station 214 miles (344 km) above Earth, bringing with it the next-to-last support beam to be installed on the unfinished space complex. "Welcome on board," said station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin as a ship's bell on the station was rung to signal the shuttle's arrival, copying a naval tradition. After checking for leaks, hatches between the shuttle and station were pushed aside and one by one the Endeavour astronauts floated aboard. Teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan, who boarded next to last, was given a rock-star welcome, with camera-wielding crew mates jockeying for position like paparazzi. Morgan, 55, gave up teaching to become an astronaut and fulfill a commitment she made after the 1986 Challenger accident, which claimed the life of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe. Morgan served as McAuliffe's backup. Once on board the station, the shuttle crew began preparing for the mission's first spacewalk on Saturday when the new piece of the station's truss will be locked into place. NASA needs to fly 11 more construction missions to finish building the station in 2010 when the shuttles are set to retire. It also plans two resupply flights to the station and a final mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. bd
