 MANILA, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine troops shelled Muslim rebel positions and raked them with helicopter fire overnight on the southern island of Jolo after a day of intense fighting in which at least 54 people, including 26 troops, were killed. The fighting which broke out on Thursday morning is the heaviest in the volatile Philippine south for almost three years, but the military said it suspended operations at daybreak on Friday following a request from the provincial governor. "We got a call from Governor Abdusakur Tan to suspend operations because of the Muslim holiday," said Major-General Ruben Rafael, the local military commander. "We have agreed." The military said the rebels were from the Abu Sayyaf, which is linked to al Qaeda, but the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which signed a peace deal with the government in 1996, said its cadres were involved. Local officials said Jolo had been tense because the military had begun collecting unlicenced firearms from villagers. The Tausug tribe that dominates the local population prizes weapons. Discontent has also been simmering among MNLF cadres because the government is close to signing a deal with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), another rebel group. The MNLF says the government should first fulfill obligations due to it from the 1996 agreement. MNLF leaders said matters came to a head when some of its members were killed by troops in a gunbattle on Wednesday. "It was the military's fault," Hatimil Hassan, the deputy chairman of the MNLF, said on local TV. "They started it all." Gunmen ambushed a group of soldiers on Thursday morning when they were on their way to a market in Maimbung town to buy food, the military's Rafael said. Ten soldiers were killed and one was wounded. Reinforcements were rushed to the area and troops began pursuing the rebels, officials said. In a gunbattle later in the day, at least 10 soldiers were killed, said Major Eugene Batara, a spokesman in the city of Zamboanga, the headquarters of the Philippines' Western Mindanao military command. Fighting continued into the night and at least six more soldiers were killed, Batara said. At least 27 rebels were killed and 10 wounded, he said. One boy was killed in crossfire. The army has said about 100 rebels from the Abu Sayyaf and a rogue faction of the MNLF were believed to be involved in the fighting. Due to family ties on Jolo and Basilan, there are close links between the Abu Sayyaf, the MNLF and the MILF and sometimes an overlap in membership. Despite an ongoing peace process, members of the MILF, the country's largest Muslim separatist group, killed 14 Marines in an attack on the nearby island of Basilan last month. Ten of the soldiers were beheaded but the MILF has denied its members mutilated the troops. The islands of the southern Philippines, especially Jolo and Basilan, are hotbeds of extremism. They are also home to bandit and pirate gangs that prey on shipping in the South China Sea. About 13,000 Philippine troops are on the islands to contain about 2,000 rebels. About 100 US special forces are also on Jolo to help train the Philippine military but they are forbidden from fighting under Philippine law.
