<TITLE> Spotlight on Hidayat on day one of world championships </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat should have the singles limelight largely to himself on the opening day of the world badminton championships. Any lingering doubts that he might not start his quest on Monday to regain his world title look resolved. The Indonesian's wife is heavily pregnant and he had previously indicated he might stay at home, although he later said he would be present at the championships. When the official schedule was published for Monday's first round play, Hidayat, seeded only eighth, was listed, as planned, as playing unseeded Spaniard Jose Antonio Crespo. The former world titleholder is the biggest international name on parade on day one of the week-long championships. Leading seeds in the various competitions will not enter the fray until the second round on Wednesday. They include defending champion Lin Dan of China and Lee Chong Wei, who will be battling to become Malaysia's first world champion since the tournament was inaugurated in 1977. Teams wrapped up final practice at the 15,000-capacity Putra Stadium on Sunday ahead of what could be a tumultuous week. Malaysian men's doubles pairing Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong are also serious title contenders along with Chong Wei. Double gold in a week's time would help offset the poor showing of the soccer team at the Asian Cup and serve as a sporting fillip as Malaysia celebrates its 50th year of independence at the end of the month
