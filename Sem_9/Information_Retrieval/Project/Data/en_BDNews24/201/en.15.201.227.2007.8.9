<TITLE> Muslim militants kill 9 Philippine troops in ambush </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine military suffered heavy casualties on Thursday after Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf ambushed a convoy on the remote southern island of Jolo. Major-General Ruben Rafael said nine soldiers were killed and two were wounded on their way to a public market at about 7:30 am [2330 GMT] when they were attacked by dozens of rebels. "We've sent reinforcement to evacuate our casualties," Rafael told reporters as helicopters flew to the scene of the fighting to ferry troops and bring back the wounded. The tropical isle, a base for Muslim militants in the largely Catholic country, has seen an escalation in violence after the army started collecting unlicenced guns from civilians. It was the second deadly ambush in as many months in the south and marked a further deterioration of the situation on Jolo. Earlier this year, hopes were high that a military ground offensive, backed by U.S. arms and advice, had put Abu Sayyaf on the run. But those hopes were soon dashed. In July, members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), killed 14 Marines in an attack on the nearby island of Basilan. Ten of the soldiers were beheaded but the MILF, which is meant to be talking peace with Manila, has denied its members mutilated the troops. The military also blames members of the Abu Sayyaf for the decapitations. Due to family ties on Jolo and Basilan, there are close links between the Abu Sayyaf and the MILF and sometimes an overlap in membership. The Philippine government wants to seal a peace deal with the MILF, the country's largest Muslim separatist group, but has sworn to crush the Abu Sayyaf, which is blamed for the Philippines' worst terror attack -- a ferry bombing that killed more than 100 people in 2004
