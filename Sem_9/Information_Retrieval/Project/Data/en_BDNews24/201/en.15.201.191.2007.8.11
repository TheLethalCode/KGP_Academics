<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anil Kumble paid tribute to India's lower-order batsmen after hitting his maiden test century on the second day of the third and final test against England at the Oval on Friday. Kumble's 110 not out helped the visitors amass a first-innings total of 664, their highest against England. The home team reached the close on 24 for one. India's number eight batsman shared stands of 91 with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, 62 with Zaheer Khan and 73 with last man Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. "I always believe it (a century) is possible every time I go out there," Kumble told reporters. "I came close in 1996 (when making 88) and I never thought I would have to wait until my 117th test match. "The support I got from Sree, Dhoni and Zaheer was very important. Sree kept saying 'You deserve a hundred and I will hang around'. "It felt very special." UNUSUAL STYLE The player famed more for his leg-spin bowling than his batting reached three figures in unusual style, bottom edging part-time bowler Kevin Pietersen through the wicketkeeper's legs for four. Kumble marked the first hundred by an Indian in the series with a rare show of emotion, pumping the air with a clenched fist. "We had a team meeting a couple of days back and I mentioned that I thought it was about time our batters scored a hundred," Kumble said. "I never thought it would be me out there doing it." England, already 1-0 down, appear to have an impossible task of squaring the series but coach Peter Moores said all three results were still possible. "They (India) played very well and put themselves in a fantastic position," Moores said. "We have to dust ourselves down and come back tomorrow and fight it out. "We have to just bat and see where the game takes us. I would never say we have lost the match because that is not a very good mental place to put yourself with three days to go.
