 Dhaka, August 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission weighs its predecessor's approval for an ICB mutual fund prospectus declaring stock dividends against one of its close-end funds, an official said Thursday. The Controller of Capital Issues (CCI), which was replaced by the SEC in 1993, approved the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh's 1st mutual fund, which was floated in 1980. The regulator had earlier sought explanation from the ICB regarding declaration of stock dividends against its mutual fund. It had initially observed that the ICB MF, a close-end fund, could not issue stock dividends, which would increase its approved paid-up capital. The SEC faced the dilemma it after the ICB, an investment bank, said it had issued the stock dividends against the fund based on the prospectus approved by the CCI. "It appears that they (ICB) have announced the dividends based on the prospectus approved by the CCI. So primarily it's quite all right," Mansur Alam, member of the SEC, told bdnews24.com. "We are examining the issue," Alam said, referring to the ICB response on the issue. Alam said the CCI was the regulator of the securities market before the formation of the SEC. "We are the inheritor of the CCI and we should follow the earlier approval," he added. The ICB MF listed on the stock exchange in 1980 as a close-end fund with a paid-up capital of Tk 5 million. The book value of each share of the fund was fixed at Tk 100. The fund, on July 31, posted 190 percent cash and 50 percent stock dividends for fiscal 2006-07. A closed-end fund is a collective investment scheme with a limited number of shares. New shares are rarely issued once the fund is launched. bd
