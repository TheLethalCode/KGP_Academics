<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) - All-rounder Alok Kapali made a cut in the national fold after one year when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Thursday announced a 15-member squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. The selection committee also picked four new faces for the exciting 20 overs a side game and pinned their hopes on the experience campaigners except opener Shahriar Nafees and spinner Mohammad Rafique. "We have picked the squad considering the conditions in South Africa and it would be wonderful if the team could secure a second-round place in South Africa like the World Cup in the West Indies," chief selector Faruque Ahmed said at a news conference Thursday. The 13-day inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup will begin on September 11 at the Wanderers, Johannesburg. About the exclusion of Nafees and Rafique, the former national skipper said, "Their performances were not satisfactory during the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka in June-July and so they have been dropped from the side." The uncapped players are opener Junaid Imroz Siddique, first centurion of the country's first-ever Twenty20 tournament, batsmen Nadif Chowdhury and Nazimuddin and paceman Ziaur Rahman. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Alok Kapali, Abdur Razzak, Aftab Ahmed, Syed Rasel, Farhad Reza, Saqib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah Riad, Junaid Imroz Siddique, Nazimuddin, Nadif Chowdhury and Ziaur Rahman. bdn
