 LONDON, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champions Manchester United had to settle for a 0-0 draw with 10-man Reading while rivals Chelsea earned a record-breaking 3-2 win over Birmingham City as their Premier League seasons got underway on Sunday. United had all the possession at Old Trafford but failed to make it count against a Reading side who had substitute striker Dave Kitson red-carded in the 72nd minute, less than a minute after coming on, for a reckless tackle on Patrice Evra. Chelsea, looking to wrest the title back from United this season, took the points with a second-half strike from Ghana midfielder Michael Essien. Victory was made even sweeter at Stamford Bridge by Chelsea setting an unbeaten home record in the top flight of 64 games. The run dates back to February 2004 and eclipses the previous mark set by Liverpool from February 1978 to January 1981. In the day's first match, Arsenal snatched a late 2-1 victory at home to Fulham. Dutch striker Robin van Persie converted an 83rd minute penalty and Belarus midfielder Alexander Hleb struck a 90th minute winner
