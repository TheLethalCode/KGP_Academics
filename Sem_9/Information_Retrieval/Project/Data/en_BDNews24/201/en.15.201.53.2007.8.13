 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Two warring BNP leaders managed to put their differences aside, at least for the moment, after the death of Ashraf Hossain's wife Monima Ashraf. BNP 'traditionalist' Hannan Shah shook hands with his sparring partner and party 'reformist' Ashraf Hossain, as he passed on his condolences. Monima Ashraf died at age 63 from kidney failure at home early Monday. Shah, a staunch supporter of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, went to commiserate his political rival at his home in the afternoon. The former whip of the Jatiya Sangsad had an emotional exchange with Shah at his apartment gate for about five minutes. A relative of the bereaved family, Maksud Ali, told bdnews24.com that Khaleda had telephoned Asharaf after his wife's death to extend her sympathies. Monima was buried at the Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard in Mirpur. She is survived by her husband, two sons and a daughter. bdn
