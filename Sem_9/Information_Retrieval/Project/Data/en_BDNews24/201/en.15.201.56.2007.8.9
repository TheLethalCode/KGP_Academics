 WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush on Thursday urged Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to hold free and fair elections as he struggles to hold on to power. "My focus in terms of the domestic scene there is that he have a free and fair election, and that's what we've been talking to him about and hopeful they will," Bush said at a White House news conference. Musharraf's government earlier on Thursday rejected calls to declare emergency powers and wants elections to take place in Pakistan, a spokesman said after widespread reports that he would instead opt for authoritarian rule.
