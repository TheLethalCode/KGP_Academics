<TITLE> German rail drivers put strikes on hold </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German train drivers have suspended plans to hold the first nationwide rail strikes in 15 years after a court banned the stoppages but the pay dispute with rail operator Deutsche Bahn continues and the prospect of industrial action still looms. Following are some facts about the dispute. The 34,000-member GDL train drivers' union wants a pay rise of up to 31 percent, saying current salaries do not reflect train drivers' high level of responsibility. The Transnet and GDBA unions, which represent 134,000 other rail workers, ended their strikes in July and settled for a 4.5 percent pay increase, after originally calling for a seven percent raise. But the GDL wants its own deal. Deutsche Bahn chief executive Harmut Mehdorn says a separate deal would create a "two-class system". GDL says a 25-year-old driver with two years' experience earns between 1,438 euros ($1,984) and 1,588 euros per month. That is 840 euros less than an equivalent driver in France, 1,210 euros less than in Spain, and 1,775 euros less than in Switzerland. GDL has said any strike would hit freight services first and German companies stand to lose millions of euros if they are forced to halt production due to lack of supplies. Deutsche Bahn is expecting 5 million customers and 28,000 passenger trains a day to be affected if a strike takes place. DB says emergency plans will allow 60 percent of long distance and 50 percent of local services to continue running. The Berlin-based DIW economic research institute estimates a strike would cost the German economy 500 million euros a day. If no trains were to run, the DIW institute calculates daily losses for Deutsche Bahn of 42 million eur
