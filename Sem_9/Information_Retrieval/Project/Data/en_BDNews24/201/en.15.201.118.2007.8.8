 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reassuring words from the Federal Reserve about the US economy put global worries about a credit crunch on the backburner on Wednesday, driving money into stocks and emerging market debt from safer havens. Wall Street looked set for an upbeat start, adding to gains the previous session, while the Japanese yen fell as investors returned to popular currency borrowing trades. The Fed, after leaving interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent on Tuesday, warned that downside risks to growth were increasing and that credit conditions had become tighter. But it also soothed immediate fears among investors about the state of things to come. "The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy," it said. The tone was enough to bring jittery players back into riskier assets. MSCI's main world index was up 0.7 percentt and its riskier, emerging market counterpart gained more than 2 percent. Spreads on emerging market sovereign debt narrowed to below 200 basis points over U.S. Treasuries for the first time since July 26 when its rise signalled widespread investor flight from risk. "Very neatly, the Fed took a step towards neutrality in terms of the risks, but did not quite go all the way to the centre," HSBC said in a note. "Overall, this is a pretty clever, market-savvy, statement. It achieves the required balance of acknowledging that some things have changed, but that some other things have not." Investors have been rattled over the past month by troubles in the U.S. subprime, or risky, mortgage sector, fearing a spill over into other lending that would dry up global liquidity. The MSCI world index, for example, remains more than 5 percent from a record high hit some 2-1/2 weeks ago. European stocks jumped sharply. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.2 percent. Strong corporate results were also boosting sentiment, with insurer Royal & Sun Alliance climbing 4.9 percent after first-half profits beat forecasts, and peers Standard Life, AXA and Allianz all rising between by between 3 percent and 6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.9 percent, Germany's DAX up 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 up around 1.2 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.64 percent or 107.51 points to 17,029.28. The broader TOPIX index added 0.53 percent to 1,669.04. The low-yielding yen fell against the dollar and euro. The yen is a key funding currency ing the "carry" trade when investors borrow low-yielders to invest in assets in more high-yielding currencies.. The trade has been unwinding as credit worries have increased. The dollar was up half a percent at 119.35 yen, more than two yen up from this week's four-month low. The euro was up 0.7 percent at 164.36 yen and up 0.1 percent at $1.3761. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, was unchanged on the day, having hit a 15-year low on Monday. Euro zone government bond yields rose sharply as investor left their safe haven. The yield on the 10-year Bund, the benchmark for euro zone bonds, rose to its highest level in two weeks. It was 9 basis points higher at 4.426 percent. The two-year Schatz yield, which is sensitive to interest rate expectations, was up 7.2 basis points at 4.380 percent. "The equity market looks fairly solid as people overall react to what's going on in the the US," said Marc Ostwald, bond analyst at Insinger de Beaufort in London. He added that bonds had priced in much of the worries about global credit and were also subject to worries about higher interest rat
