 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's abattoirs look set to start laying off workers on Wednesday with a ban on livestock movement linked to foot and mouth disease lifted in Scotland but remaining in place south of the border, industry sources said. "I think this will be the final nail in the coffin for a lot of places like us if they don't allow us to start killing before the end of the week," said Roger Carr, owner of Simply Halal abattoir near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. "We've got people with mortgages that are worried to death this morning," he added. A ban of livestock movement was imposed after an outbreak of foot and mouth disease was confirmed at a farm in southern England on Friday. Abattoirs have been calling for movement to be resumed under special license direct from farms to abattoirs, a step taken on Tuesday by Scotland's devolved government. Carr first visited an abattoir when he was six or seven years old and entered the business when he was 15. "I will be laying people off if they don't let us have livestock direct from farmers. I don't know if I would reopen," he said. Hopes were raised, however, on Wednesday afternoon with media reporting that the government may be about to announce the lifting of some restrictions on animal movement. "I can't confirm it at this stage. We may have an announcement on that later," a spokeswoman for Defra, Britain's farm and environment ministry. She said the status of restrictions was under constant review. Defra is scheduled to give an update on the foot and mouth outbreak later on Wednesday. Norman Bagley, policy director for the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, said he had met with the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) on Tuesday expecting to be told that abattoirs could be up and running by Thursday. "The handling of the disease has been okay but the handling of abattoirs getting back up and running has been deplorable. I no longer have any expectation of how the CVO is going to handle this," Bagley said. Britain confirmed a second outbreak of the disease in a herd in southern England and movement restrictions are one of the measures designed to prevent a repeat of the devastation caused by an epidemic in 2001. Bagley said, however, there was "virtual zero risk" in transporting animals direct from farms to abattoirs and it might help with early detection. "It would provide improved disease surveillance. It is hard to detect in the early stages, particularly in sheep, but there are vets in there (abattoirs) the whole of the time. I am pretty upset by the way this has been delivered," he said. Alasdair Cox, spokesman for Grampian Country Food Group, said the company was managing to get its abattoirs in Scotland up and running with livestock moving under license. He added he was hoping movement would soon resume under license in England and Wales where it is still halted. Cox said there was no reason why the meat produced in Scotland could not be shipped south into England although he would not comment on whether his company had any plans to do so. The British Meat Processors Association said on Monday that if the slaughter did not resume it would become increasingly difficult to source British product within a week. "Many members will be losing tens of thousands of pounds for each day they cannot source UK livestock for slaughter," BMPA said in a stateme
