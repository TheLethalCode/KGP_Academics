 ZURICH, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man suspected of abducting a 5-year-old girl in Switzerland last week may have been involved in the murder of several other young people in the 1980s, a police investigator was quoted as saying on Wednesday. The body of Urs Hans Von Aesch, 67, was found on Aug. 1 near the town of Appenzell, hours after little Ylenia Lenhard went missing in the town. Police believe Von Aesch shot another man, who survived, before committing suicide. Christof Kipfer, head of a commission that coordinates investigations of missing children, told Zurich's Tages Anzeiger newspaper that police were now trying to establish whether Von Aesch had a hand in other abductions. Police were reexamining the cases of 8 young people, ranging in age from 5 to 16, who were either found murdered or disappeared without trace between 1982 and 1986, for possible links to Von Aesch, Kipfer told the newspaper. Von Aesch recently returned to Switzerland after living in Spain for 17 years. "All the children and adolescents disappeared from open streets, they are either still missing or were found dead. We can only see a rough pattern," Kipfer told the newspaper. "The cantonal police are trying to clarify if there are more parallels and if Von Aesch was also responsible for these crimes," said Kipfer. More than 100 troops were brought in on Wednesday to help in the search for Ylenia. Police have been combing woods outside Appenzell but have so far found no trace of the girl who was last seen on August 1 by her mother. Kipfer said Swiss authorities had been in touch with police investigating the disappearance in May of British 4-year-old Madeleine McCann, while on holiday with her family in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz, but did not elaborate. A police spokesman in the Swiss town of St. Gallen declined to comment on British media reports that investigators in Portugal were checking whether Von Aesch may have been in the area of Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappear
