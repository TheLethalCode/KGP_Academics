 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Saturday alleged that the government did not allow her to stand by flood victims despite her willingness. "I wanted to stand by flood victims as I did before. But the government did not allow me to do so," the former prime minister said in a teleconference with leaders and workers of the BNP and front organisations in Sirajganj. Local BNP leaders and workers took part in the 20-minute teleconference from the home of Sirajganj district BNP general secretary Humayun Islam Khan near Russell Park. Khaleda asked party leaders and workers to continue relief work. "I have sent Hannan Shah to the spot as I could not come. I thank you all for doing relief work in coordination." She called for the leaders and workers to stay united. Asked why BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan did not join relief work and whether it was a sign of an internal split, Khaleda said: "I don't want any division in the party. So I have sent Hannan Shah." Earlier at 11am, BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah reached Sirajganj, received by more than 50 party leaders and workers near the Jamuna Bridge carrying portraits of the party chief. He distributed relief among flood victims in Chouhali, Belkuchi and Shahjadpur upazilas. While distributing relief among flood victims at Russell Memorial Park, Hannan Shah told reporters, "I could not get permission for Khaleda Zia to come to Sirajganj. I tried for five days to get the permission." "She wanted to stand by flood victims as she did in 1988. There are some problems with us. A conspiracy is on to split the party. But people of Bangladesh will never allow it to happen. We unseated Ershad from power. We won't allow any conspiracy to succeed." Khaleda was scheduled to distribute relief in some flood-affected areas in Sirajganj and Tangail, but she did not get permission from the home ministry for "security reasons". No central leaders of the BNP were with Hannan Shah during relief distribution. Only former lawmaker Kamruddin Yahiya Khan Majlish, district BNP vice-president Abdus Salam Talukder and general secretary for Sirajganj district BNP Humayun Islam Khan accompanied him. bdnews24.c
