 PRISTINA,Sat Aug 11, Serbia (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo stressed on Saturday it expected independence from Serbia by the end of 2007 after the West and Russia launched a last-ditch bid for compromise over the fate of the breakaway province. A "troika" of envoys from Russia, the United States and the European Union met leaders of the 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority after arriving from Belgrade, where they started their diplomatic mission on Friday. The Albanians told the envoys bluntly that statehood was non-negotiable and they expected to achieve it within months. "I am working for the recognition of the independence of Kosovo, in its current borders ... this year," said Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, according to a statement from his office. "This is not a starting point for negotiation. This is not an offer for discussion. "I do not want to waste the next 120 days talking about things that will not be possible." The envoys took on the mission last month after a Western-backed resolution calling for statehood under EU supervision was blocked at the United Nations by Serbia's ally Russia. The U.N. impasse followed 13 months of fruitless Serb-Albanian dialogue led by U.N. envoy Martti Ahtisaari. Western diplomats admit the latest round of diplomacy and talks stand little chance of success, and might only buy time before Kosovo's 2 million Albanians declare independence unilaterally and seek recognition from the major Western powers. "We will agree to whatever the parties agree to," US envoy Frank Wisner told reporters. "We have a sense of urgency." The troika is due to report back to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by December 10. Washington says it will not negotiate beyond that date and has indicated it would recognize Kosovo even without a UN resolution. Russia insists talks should be open-ended. Moscow's envoy, Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko, said it was essential the process "stay within the U.N. framework", an apparent hint at Kosovo Albanian threats to take matters into their own hands. Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombed for 11 weeks to drive out Serb forces and halt the killing and expulsion of Albanian civilians in a war against separatist Albanian guerrillas. Washington wanted a resolution last year. Russia has threatened to veto independence at the U.N. Security Council. There is no hint of concession from Serbs or Albanians on the bottom line -- Kosovo's independence. Serbia has offered autonomy but no suggestion of how it would reintegrate 2 million hostile Albanians. If there is no UN mandate, to which Russia holds the key, then the unity of the 27-member EU could crack, with half a dozen members refusing to recognize Kosovo. NATO powers leading 16,000 troops in Kosovo fear unrest if independence is deni
