 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission Thursday filed four separate cases against former health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Orion Group chairman Obaidul Karim and Janakantha editor Atiqullah Khan Masud. A case was filed against Mosharraf with Dhanmondi Police Station while a second case was filed against Obaidul Karim with Tejgaon Police Station and two others against Masud with Motijheel Police Station. Tejgaon police sub-inspector Momtazul Islam said ACC deputy director Abdul Karim filed the case against Obaidul Karim. Mohammad Sayedul Haque, former BNP lawmaker from Brahmanbaria-1 constituency, is also accused in the case. According to the case details, Haque imported an Infiniti car from the US on duty free quota at a cost of Tk 42.75 lakh. But he sold the car to Karim violating rules, which means the government had been deprived of more than Tk 85 lakh in taxes. Motijheel police sub-inspector Golam Kibria said ACC assistant director Mahmud Hasan filed two cases against Masud. In one of the cases Rajuk engineer SM Asaduzzaman and Rajuk inspector Abdul Latif have also been accused. According to the case details, a 10-storey building was built at Malibagh without Rajuk approval. In another case Rajuk engineer Md Kamaruzzaman has also been accused. It was alleged that another 10-storey building was constructed at Mirpur Road through a change to the approved design. Dhanmondi police sub-inspector Moni Akter said ACC assistant director Shafiul Alam filed the case against eight people, including former health minister Mosharraf and wife Bilkis Akter. According to the case details, the accused allegedly manipulated a tender and sold 7.5 katha of land and other infrastructure of Kakoli High School through misuse of power in 2006. bdnews
