<TITLE> Political divide threatens national security: Iajuddin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) Sharp differences among the political elite over fundamental national issues, and parochial rivalry among different political and social forces pose a threat to national security, said president Iajuddin Ahmed Sunday. The president called for capable, honest, transparent and accountable administration as well as responsible, accountable and patriotic political leaders who would lead the country to the right direction. Speaking at a conference on democracy and governance, he said the two are "intimately entwined". Without strengthening the democratic institutions, the function of democracy and its gradual maturity would remain unaccomplished, he said, at the inaugural ceremony of a five-day international workshop on 'Democracy, Governance and Security Reforms' at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Iajuddin also said a large segment of the politically conscious public has remained aloof from the political arena in the face of violent political conflict. "Civil society has been fragmented and, consequentially, weakened," he said. "In these circumstances, we have to find a way of proper functioning of democratic norms and values, establishing of rule of law and good governance for the well-being of the country as well as the nation." The president also added that the process of socio-economic and politico-cultural development was very difficult for developing countries. Owing to reasons such colonial legacy and inherent weaknesses, most developing nations have hardly been prepared to deal with these issues. The workshop was jointly organised by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies and the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies. bdn
