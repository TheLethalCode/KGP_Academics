<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group Plc posted first-half profits on Wednesday that were above market expectations and said its cost-cutting programme was ahead of schedule. Britain's second-largest commercial insurer, RSA made a group operating profit of 403 million pounds ($816.9 million), compared with an average forecast of 349.7 million in a Reuters poll of six analysts. The company announced a dividend of 2.48 pence per share, above an average forecast of 2.46p. Royal & Sun shares jumped more than 5 percent to stand at 143 pence at 0835 GMT. The shares lost one-fifth of their value between May 21 and Tuesday's close on fears about falling prices in the competitive UK market and the effect of heavy floods in Britain. "These numbers are very good," said ING analyst Kevin Ryan. "I view them as over-delivering. They've done more than it says on the tin." The company also delivered an optimistic outlook, saying it expected to continue to maintain the profit performance it had delivered over the past few years, despite prices falling in several sectors of its business. "The outlook statement is very positive," said Ryan. "It's the strongest I've seen from an insurer in a long time." RSA said it had identified a further 70 million pounds in cost cuts by the middle of 2008, having achieved its annualised savings target of 130 million pounds ahead of schedule. The fresh savings would involve 700 job losses, 500 of which will come in its UK business, Chief Executive Andy Haste told reporters. Earnings were helped by 175 million pounds released during the first two quarters from reserves that were no longer needed to pay claims. That figure is more than double the amount released during the same period last year, but the company said it continues to reserve prudently and that reserves were stronger at the mid-year point than they were at the start of the year. Improved performance in its international division, which posted an underwriting profit of 95 million pounds, up 25 percent, was offset by claims from the floods in Britain, which dragged overall underwriting profit down to 144 million pounds from 171 million. RSA said these claims would cost it a total of 120 million pounds. Of this, 65 million pounds -- from the July floods -- will fall in the second half. The floods meant RSA would not hit its target of a combined ratio -- a key operating benchmark -- of 95 percent or better for the year. It said it now expected to have a combined ratio of 96 percent. The combined ratio measures claims and costs as a percentage of premiums, and a figure below 100 denotes an underwriting profit. But RSA said it did not plan to raise prices across the board as the result of the floods. Rival Norwich Union, part of Aviva, warned last week that it will push prices up by an average of 10 percent, partly due to heavy flood claims. "We don't see the floods as being an event to trigger blanket rate increases," said Haste. "It's possible some people's rates will go up, but it's not inevitabl
