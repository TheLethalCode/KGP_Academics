<TITLE> Huda argues emergency rules not in force </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Former minister Nazmul Huda Monday said the state of emergency was no more in force since the constitutionally-mandated 120 days after emergency rules were clamped had gone by. He said the constitution stipulated that the emergency powers and rules must be approved in parliament within 30 days of its formation. But the government had not taken the approval, the detained former BNP communications minister said at the Special Judge's Court-2, housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Huda and wife Sigma Huda are standing trial on charges of taking Tk 2.4 crore in bribe from a contracting firm. Huda, a barrister, told judge Amar Kumar Roy that the emergency government had filed "false" cases against some politicians to bar them from the upcoming elections. He said he was a victim of the "Minus Two Formula", referring to an alleged move by the military-backed emergency government to exile former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia from politics. "The present government has filed the case against me to prove me a corrupt person to stop me participating in the election," he said. bdnew
