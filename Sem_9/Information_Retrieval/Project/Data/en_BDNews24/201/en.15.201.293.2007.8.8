<TITLE> Worker dies in fall from Rangs Bhaban </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)A worker, who was splitting Rangs Bhaban, died after he fell off the building Wednesday, police and witnesses said. Sohrab Hossain was working on the 12th floor of the building on Bijoy Sarani, tearing down an inner partition. Officials tied to Rangs Group of Industries said it happened because the city development agency, Rajuk, did not take adequate safety measures for the workers engaged in demolishing the top 16 storeys of the 22-storey building. But Rajuk magistrate Emdadud Dastagir saw it as a mere accident. The worker fell when he was working with others at 2:30pm to pull down an inner partition of the floor. A chunk of a broken wall came flying over Sohrab, causing him to fall off the floor, co-worker Aminul Islam told bdnews24.com. Islam said he saw the entire scene. Monowar Hossain, head of construction for Rangs Properties Ltd, said they had been complaining that the way Rajuk was conducting the demolition was risky. A security cordon with a safety belt for the workers is mandatory in such a case, he said. Rajuk also lacks expertise in doing such a job, he said. But Dastagir, although it was not clear if he has any background of engineering, disputed Monowar's observations. Dastagir said such safety measures were not necessary since the workers were just removing the inner walls of the building. The city developer seeks bidders to bring down the outer frames. Safety measures will be taken after a firm is appointed to finish the rest of the demolition work, Dastagir said. Tejgaon police sub-inspector Ashrafuzzaman said a case was filed and the body was sent for an autopsy. bdnews2
