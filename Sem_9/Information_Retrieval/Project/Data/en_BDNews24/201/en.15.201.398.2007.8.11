 ROME, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified assailants attacked an Islamic cultural centre in northern Italy overnight, police said on Friday, prompting Muslim community leaders to express concern that hostility in Italy towards their faith may be growing. Two petrol bombs were hurled at the building in Abbiategrasso, on the outskirts of Milan, and a pipe bomb, which did not explode, was left outside. No-one was injured and the building was undamaged. The incident came just days after an imam in Milan said vandals had set fire to his car while it was parked outside a suburban mosque. Although police did not connect the two, very unusual, incidents, Muslim community leaders expressed concern. "There is worry among Muslims about ... Islamophobia," said Omar Camiletti, an adviser to the Muslim World League in Italy. Camiletti said he had spoken to other community leaders and knew of no additional security measures being taken at mosques in Italy. Last month, police arrested an imam in northern Italy on suspicion of leading a terrorism "training school" in his mosque in Perugia, and said another imam was under investigation. Police captain Paolo Palazzo said Friday's incident was the second in two weeks at the Abbiategrasso centre, which is run by an Egyptian. A previous petrol bomb attack also caused no injuries or damage to the centre, Palazzo said.
