<TITLE> Flood donations to CA's fund are tax-free: NBR </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Only those flood donations made to the chief adviser's relief fund will be made tax-free, said the chairman of the National Board of Revenue Thursday. An individual or organisation donating any amount of money to the chief adviser's relief fund will be able to do so untaxed, NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told reporters in his office. Earlier in the week, calls from the business community to allow all money for donated for relief to be made tax-free, had been ignored by the government. NBR officials had said the same tax-free ceiling of Tk 250,000 would apply to flood relief as to any other charitable donation, as per the Income Tax Ordinance. However, citing an SRO issued by the NBR in 1991, Rahman said Thursday: "Money donated to the relief fund of the prime minister or the chief adviser may be exempted from tax." "If someone wishes to donate Tk 50 crore or even more to this fund, the amount would be considered tax-free," he said. However, the NBR chairman said there was nothing in the SRO regarding general donations to other funds for flood relief. He added that the SRO was still in force as none had been issued in relation to this issue after 1992. bdnews2
