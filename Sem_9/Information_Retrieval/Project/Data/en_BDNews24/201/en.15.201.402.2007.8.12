 KABUL, August 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf arrived in Afghanistan on Sunday to address the closing session of a gathering of Afghan and Pakistani politicians and tribesmen discussing ways to combat al Qaeda and Taliban attacks. Musharraf had pulled out of an original commitment to attend the beginning of the four-day joint jirga, or council, on Thursday, citing pressing engagements at home. His absence was seen as a blow to the meeting, already hit by a boycott by some Pakistani tribal elders. Musharraf and Afghan President Hamid Karzai are to address the jirga, held in a large tent in the Afghan capital Kabul, and hold a joint news conference afterwards, a jirga spokesman said. "The Afghan side is committed to the jirga and it is going to respect the decisions made and we expect the same from our Pakistani counterparts," said Afghan presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada. "We are looking for a positive outcome." The two presidents agreed to hold the meeting last year at a meeting in Washington as a way to bring together the two often feuding, but important U.S. allies to seek a common strategy against al Qaeda and the Taliban. Afghan officials frequently accuse Pakistan of harboring Taliban and al Qaeda fighters in order to keep its neighbor weak. Pakistan denies the charge. Analysts and diplomats warned against expecting too much from the jirga, saying it was only a first step towards a unified approach to combating militants who threaten security in both countries. A second jirga to be held in Pakistan at an unspecified date may yield firmer results, they said. A jirga is a traditional meeting among the Pashtun tribes that live on both sides of the border, where elders use consensus to try to peacefully settle disputes.
