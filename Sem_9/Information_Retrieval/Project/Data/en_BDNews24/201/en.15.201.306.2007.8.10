 Dhaka, August 10 (bdnews24.com)  The insurance industry regulator is set to slap Tk 1 lakh penalty on 22 insurance companies for not starting the process of credit rating. "We are seriously considering penalising the non-compliant companies that have yet to start the process of their credit rating," Dr Mahfuzul Haque, chief controller of insurance, told bdnews24.com Thursday. In a move first of its kind, the watchdog asked the companies to go for credit rating to ensure transparency in the ailing insurance industry and help insurers identify better-performing companies. The controller in early March directed all 62 general and life insurance companies to complete their credit ratings by June this year. General insurance companies were asked to carry out their ratings every year while life insurance companies every two years. A former chairman of Bangladesh Insurance Association, wishing to be unnamed, said it was difficult for all the companies to complete their ratings in such a short notice. "We demanded time extension, as it is difficult for small companies to complete their ratings in such a short period," he said. Only four companies have done ratings, 27 signed agreements with the rating agencies and nine companies applied for time extension. But the remaining 22 companies have kept mum about complying with the directive, according to the statistics. The general insurance companies yet to respond to the calling are Agrani Insurance, Bangladesh Co-operatives Insurance, Crystal Insurance, Desh General Insurance, Eastern Insurance, Express Insurance, Janata Insurance, Meghna Insurance, Paramount Insurance, Prime Insurance, Provati Insurance, Purabi General Insurance, Sadharan Bima Corporation, Sonar Bangla Insurance and Union Insurance. The non-compliant life insurance companies are Baira Life Insurance, Fareast Islami Life Insurance, Golden Life Insurance, Pragati Life Insurance, Rupali Life Insurance, Jivon Bima Corporation and Sunlife Insurance Company. "These companies will have to face a fine of Tk 1 lakh each for non-compliance," Haque, the chief controller of insurance said. "We are going to impose the fine within a short time." Haque however congratulated the companies that had complied with the directive of credit rating. These are American Life Insurance (AA2), Pragati Insurance (AA2), Pioneer Insurance (A) and Bangladesh General Insurance Company (BBB1). The companies that have applied for time extension are Asia Insurance, Asia Pacific General Insurance, Bangladesh National Insurance, Global Insurance, Islami Insurance Bangladesh, Mercantile Insurance, South Asia Insurance, Standard Insurance and National Life Insurance. Central Insurance, City General Insurance, Continental Insurance, Dhaka Insurance, Eastland Insurance, Federal Insurance, Green Delta Insurance, Islami Commercial Insurance, Karnaphuli Insurance, Nitol Insurance, Northern General Insurance, Peoples Insurance, Phoenix Insurance, Reliance Insurance, Republic Insurance, Rupali Insurance, Takaful Islami Insurance and United Insurance signed agreements with rating agencies to complete their ratings. Delta Life Insurance, Homeland Life Insurance, Meghna Life Insurance, Padma Life Insurance, Popular Life Insurance, Prime Islami Life Insurance, Progressive Life Insurance, Shandhani Life Insurance and Sunflower Life Insurance also signed contracts with the rating firms. The regulator hoped all the companies would complete their ratings by the end of the year. bd
