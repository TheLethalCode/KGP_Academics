<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's parliament elected the ruling AK Party's candidate Koksal Toptan as its new speaker on Thursday in a first round of voting after he secured backing from the main opposition party, lawmakers said. The Islamist-rooted AK Party nominated Toptan on Wednesday in a conciliatory move towards Turkey's powerful secular elite, including the army generals. Toptan, a moderate conservative, does not have an Islamist past and his wife does not wear the Muslim headscarf.
