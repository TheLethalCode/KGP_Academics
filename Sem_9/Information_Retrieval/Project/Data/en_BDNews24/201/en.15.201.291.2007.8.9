 Chittagong, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  At least one worker died and another 50 were injured in Chittagong Thursday as police teargassed and beat hundreds of jute mill workers who took to the streets demanding arrears. Police arrested 22 workers on the scene. Two policemen were among the injured. The violence erupted after the workers of the state-owned Amin Jute Mills Ltd in the port city came to receive their overdue salary from the mill authorities, the mill's general manager Aminur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The workers demanded salary for two weeks but the authorities said they were able to pay them for one week, he said. The authorities' failure in going by the workers' demand sparked resentment among the workers. Panchlaish zone assistant police commissioner Mizanur Rahman said their action came after the workers put up barricades on a nearby road and started throwing stones at them. Members of RAB and troops later joined police to take the situation under control at about 3.30pm. The jute mill reopened at 5.15pm with strict vigilance of law enforcers. In the evening only last week's wages were given to the workers. Police sub-inspector Zahir Ahmed, who was on duty at the police checkpoint on the Chittagong Medical College Hospital premises, confirmed to bdnews24.com that one worker died after he was rushed to hospital. Abdul Khaleque, a former trade union leader of the mill, said the situation turned extremely fierce after the news of the worker's death spread fast. Khaleque said police fiercely charged batons and fired teargas to take the situation under control. The mill's GM had earlier said that Thursday was the day to clear the workers' weekly payment. The authorities arranged for one week but the workers demanded for two weeks, he said. The authorities of the cash-strapped mill were not in a position to meet their demand, he said. He said the workers stopped their work abruptly at 10:00am and started protesting that later turned violent. The GM said the amount the workers were demanding remained unpaid for long, and the mill was not capable of clearing the dues at the moment. He admitted that the workers were entitled to get wages for 10 weeks. Meanwhile, the authorities formed a three-member committee to probe the incident, the GM said. The committee is to submit its report in three days. Witnesses said the workers used stones and sticks to attack the security officials during the violence that lasted for about six hours. Shops were closed. Heightened security in the wake of the violence failed to convince the traders to open their outlets in the troubled area. The GM claimed that they had opened two units of the troubled mill in the evening and 50 percent workers joined their work. Assistant police commissioner (detective) Ashiqur Rahman Bhuiyan said they held a meeting to review the matter with the mill officials, the district administration and law enforcement agencies. The injured police members were admitted to a local police hospital while five injured workers were taken to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital. Later four of the workers fled the hospital, apparently to avert any police action. bdnews24.
