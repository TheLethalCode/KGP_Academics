<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  The training under the Bangladesh Army will especially help the Bangladeshi cricketers to strengthen their batting ability, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Sunday. "This type of training will help the cricketers a lot as climbing up the building and mountain as well as getting down from those spots will strengthen the cricketers' shoulders," BCB cricket operations chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu told bdnews24.com by telephone. "To accomplish these tasks, a good combination of hands, legs and eyes, which are equally important in cricket, is needed. "The combination of hands, legs and eyes is a precondition of well batting and the players would certainly be benefited though the training." The Tigers trained for a second day Sunday under a special warfare wing at the School of Infantry and Tactics at Jalalabad Cantonment in Sylhet. The Day 2 training included a 3-km run carrying a weight of 10 pounds, rappelling, building climbing, mountain climbing, snorkelling, self-criticism and counselling. Lipu, the former Bangladesh captain, was delighted to see the performance of Mohammad Ashraful in the training camp, popularly know as boot-camp. "Ashraful is here leading the side from the front by setting examples for others and it has amused me," said Lipu, who left the cantonment Sunday evening after staying there for two days. Except Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Aftab Ahmed, 13 members of the Tigers reached Sylhet Friday for a six-day special conditioning camp under a unit of the Bangladesh Army in a bid to increase their mental and physical strength ahead of next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. "Some of them were scared at first to climb the building and mountain, but they shrugged off the fear after completing the task successfully," said Lipu, adding that all members were "extremely enjoying" the camp. Lipu said the army had taken adequate measurers to avoid any accident. There were ambulance escort, foam on the floor when the cricketers would scale the building and security cord during mountain climbing. The team returns to Dhaka on August 16 and will get a two-day break before beginning cricket practice. The Tigers are expected to fly to Nairobi on August 29 for a triangular tournament involving Pakistan and the hosts before leaving for South Africa. bdnew
