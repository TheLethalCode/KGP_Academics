<TITLE> A patent in the hand is worth nothing to the Bush </TITLE>

 London, August 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Qualcomm's hopes of a presidential intervention that would solve its bitter licence fee dispute with rival Broadcom turned to dust and ashes when George W Bush signally declined to take the opportunity unilaterally to quash a court ruling made by the US International Trade Commission (ITC). Qualcomm had been betting a lot on a last throw of the dice, gambling that President Bush would come to its aid. In the event the administration upheld the ITC ruling that bans the importation into the US of new 3G mobile handsets based on EV-DO and WCDMA technologies and standards that have Qualcomm chips embedded in them. Qualcomm's gamble has always been a long shot. Successive US administrations have overruled and reversed ITC decisions a mere five times in the past 50 years, most recently in 1987. Commenting on the upholding of the ITC ruling in this case, US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said, "It is a long-established practice to decline to overrule the ITC unless conditions are extraordinary. They are not in this instance." It was in June that the ITC prohibited the importation of handsets fitted with Qualcomm microprocessors. This raised fears that carriers such as Sprint Nextel would be left unable to introduce new models and would suffer commercially as a result. Manufacturers embedding Qualcomm chips in their mobile devices include Samsung of Korea and LG of Taiwan. The basis of Qualcomm's argument against the ban was that the ITC ruling would result in a blanket prohibition on the importation of millions of new handsets that use the battery conservation and power control technology patented by Broadcom. However, in the end this cut little ice with the Bush Administration. In further comment Schwab noted that since the ban was imposed two of the biggest US mobile carriers have started paying licensing fees to Broadcom for the use of that company's technology, and are thus free to import new 3G handsets into the country. One of these is known to be Verizon. The other is being coy and won't "come out" in public but there are strong suspicions that it is AT&T. The US Trade representative also pointed out that Broadcom says it will provide royalty-free licences to US public safety organisation, thus effectively skippering on of Qualcomm's main arguments against the ban. Qualcomm had been claiming that by demanding licensing fees from such bodies Broadcom was placing public safety in jeopardy but Ms. Schwab says that a review she had requested and that had been carried out by the US Department of Homeland Security had come to the conclusion that there is "insufficient justification" for rescinding the ban on the grounds that a possible deterioration of public safety might be the result of its continuation. The ruling is undoubtedly a big setback for San Diego, California-headquartered Qualcomm and, in a statement, the company says said it will petition the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to put the import prohibition on hold whilst the appeal is being considered. Qualcomm's CEO, Paul Jacobs, whilst thanking the Bush administration for taking the time to review the ban, confessed himself to be "disappointed" at the outcome and said and that the company will pursue "all legal and technical options available" to limit the impact of the ban. The trouble is that although Qualcom is now using other software quickly written to skirt around the patents issue, indications are that Broadcom may well come back again with another law suit alleging that the new code is another infringement of its patents. That wasn't the only bad news Qualcomm got yesterday. A federal judge sitting in the company's home town and adjudicating on a separate matter ruled that the company had de facto and by its own actions waived its rights in respect to two patents relating to high-definition video compression technology. In a scathing summation the judge said responsibility for the failure of its claim lay fairly and squarely with Qualcomm, not least because the company had deliberately concealed the existence of the patents from the body responsible for determining the H264 video standard. bdn
