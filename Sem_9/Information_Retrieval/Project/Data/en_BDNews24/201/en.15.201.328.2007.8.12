<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has said it will not sit for talks with the Election Commission on electoral law reform before the ban on indoor politics is lifted. Speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home Sunday, acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said: "I want to say on behalf of my party, we may go for discussion if our party is officially invited." But until then, the party decision has to be accepted, he said. "The ban on parlour politics has to be withdrawn. We cannot go if we are invited this way." Election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain told reporters Thursday that the EC would begin discussions with political parties next month on election law reform as per the commission's roadmap. Although the ban on indoor politics will remain in effect, the draft of the new law will be sent to the political parties this month. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Sunday that the national elections would be held by 2008. Welcoming the statement, Zillur said: "Even then, we think the election can be held earlier." The AL leader also welcomed the chief justice's statement Saturday that the Supreme Court would come forward to save the nation at a critical juncture. bdnews24.c
