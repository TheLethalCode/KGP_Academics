 TOKYO, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan marked the 62nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki with prayers and ceremony on Thursday as the city's mayor warned that the world faced a crisis of nuclear proliferation. Thousands of children, elderly survivors and dignitaries in Nagasaki's Peace Park bowed their heads in a minute of silence at 11:02 am (0202 GMT), the time the bomb was dropped, in memory of the more than 140,000 who ultimately died. Nagasaki mayor Tomihisa Taue vowed to carry on the fight to eliminate nuclear arms long spearheaded by his predecessor, Itcho Ito, who was gunned down by a gangster in April. "Instead of progress in nuclear disarmament, we are facing a crisis in terms of the breakdown of the very structure of nuclear non-proliferation," Taue told the crowd. Noting that long-term nuclear powers have been joined by others such as India, Pakistan and North Korea, which last October conducted a nuclear test, and that Iran is suspected of nuclear development, Taue said the danger was greater than ever. "With the appearance of new nuclear weapons states comes increased danger of actual use, as well as the leakage of nuclear-related technology," he said. Nagasaki was bombed by the United States on August 9, 1945, three days after the western city of Hiroshima. On August 15, Japan surrendered. About 27,000 of the city's estimated 200,000 population died instantly, and about 70,000 had died by the end of 1945. The toll is updated every year as more victims die of radiation illness, and 3,069 names were added to the list of the dead this year, bringing the official death toll to 143,124. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the first premier born after World War Two, laid a wreath at the ceremony and repeated that he would abide by Japan's decades-old non-nuclear policy. Controversy erupted last year when a senior ruling party lawmaker said Japan should discuss acquiring nuclear weapons after North Korea's test. Taue alluded to this, saying that Japan's three non-nuclear principles -- banning the possession, production and import of nuclear arms -- should be acted into law. "The use of nuclear weapons can never be permitted or considered acceptable, for any reason whatsoever," he said. This year's anniversary followed outrage by local residents over remarks by Japan's former defence minister, Fumio Kyuma, that had appeared to condone the bombings. Kyuma, who hails from a Nagasaki district, had said the bombings "couldn't be helped" because they brought World War Two to an end. He resigned over the remarks. Abe apologised for Kyuma's remarks, telling reporters: "We will make every effort for denuclearisation, so that there will never again be another atomic bombing.
