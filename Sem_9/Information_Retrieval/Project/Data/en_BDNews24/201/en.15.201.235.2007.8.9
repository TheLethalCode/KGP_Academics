 LONDON, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles has been forced to retire at the age of 34, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed on Thursday. Giles, who had undergone three hip operations in 18 months, said in a statement: "Following guidance from my hip surgeon, Marc Philippon, I am very sorry to announce that I am retiring from all forms of cricket with immediate effect. "I had hoped to make a full recovery and return to playing over the next few months but the advice I have received means that there is no chance of me returning to cricket at any level," added Giles, whose most recent surgery had been in April. Giles missed a whole year of cricket before returning to play in the first two tests of last year's Ashes series. However, he flew home from Australia after the second test for family reasons and his hip problem returned at the start of the English season in April. The Warwickshire player took 143 wickets in 54 tests for England following his debut against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1998. In 2005 he was named as one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year following England's Ashes triumph over Australia. "I dreamt of playing cricket for England and winning the Ashes as a child and so to be part of that magical summer of 2005 was truly a dream realised," added Giles. England captain Michael Vaughan said: "Ashley's retirement is very sad news and everyone in the England dressing room will miss his professionalism and, of course, his sense of humour. "He was a key member of the England test side which won six successive test series and I know how much his team mates valued his contributions to our success.
