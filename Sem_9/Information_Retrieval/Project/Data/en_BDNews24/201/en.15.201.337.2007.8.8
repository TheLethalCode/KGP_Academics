 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Thursday announces a 15-member national squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. "We are going to select the squad keeping the South African conditions in mind and all- rounders especially the pace-blowing all- rounders would be given the highest priority," Chief selector Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "We are also thinking in the area of fielding, which is very important in the 20-over-a-side affair," added the Bangladesh former captain. The three-member selection committee submits their squad Thursday noon and the board makes it public after approval at the board meeting. "A few new faces are being considered and a number of them might secure the final place in the squad," said Faruque adding that they would have to focus on the national team players first and then go for other options. Many believe that Junaed Imroz Siddique, first centurion in the country's first-ever Twenty20 tournament, Nazmul Hossain Milon, known as sixer boy, and Nadif Chowdhury, known as a big hitter, may get places in the national squad. Considering the spinning all-round performances, Saqib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak and Mahmudullah Riad are likely to get room along with talented opener Tamim Iqbal, top orders Mohammad Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed. Pace spearheads Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain are being considered for their international experiences while pacer Tapash Kumar Baishya, who can also bat well, may get room if he overcomes the fitness test Thursday morning. Considering his World Cup experience in South Africa in 2003, middle order batsman-cum-leg spinner Alok Kapali may replace off-form Tushar Imran. One-day wicket keeper Mushfiqur Rahim might be the automatic choice along with medium pacer and middle order batsman Farhad Reza. 15 probables : Mohammad Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Saqib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Farhad Reza, Mahmudullah Riad, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Tapash Kumar Baishya, Alok Kapali, Junaed Imroz, Nazmul Hossain and Nadif Chowdhury. bdn
