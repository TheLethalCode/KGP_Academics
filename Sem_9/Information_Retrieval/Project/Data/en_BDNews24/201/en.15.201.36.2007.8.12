<TITLE> WFP warns of food crisis in flood aftermath </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) - The World Food Programme chief in Bangladesh Douglas Broderick has expressed concern about a possible food crisis due to crop damage in flood-affected areas. "We are quite concerned over the significant damage to crops in the flood-affected areas," Broderick told reporters Sunday after a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. He said WFP wanted to work with partners, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation, to help Bangladesh in the aftermath of the flood. Impact assessments, carried out by WFP as part of their emergency assistance for flood victims, have indicated the extent of current food shortages, said the WFP chief. "We want to distribute high energy biscuits to about 200,000 people in the most affected areas," he said. The WFP will also begin distribution of 1,500-2,000 tonnes of rice. This is an initial response to the flood-affected regions of the country, but as "needs increase we would also increase the distribution", said Broderick. He also told reporters that WFP was assessing the short- and long-term needs after the floods in Bangladesh, and that they are closely working with their UN partners, Unicef and WHO, in making the emergency provisions available. In his brief to reporters after the meeting, the foreign adviser said: "We are continuing consultations with our partners." He said there were no major obstacles in the task of relief work. On spread of water-borne diseases, Chowdhury said: "The health ministry has already made special arrangements to open special diarrhoea clinics in all state-run and private hospitals." "Fears of any widespread disease can thus be tackled effectively," he said. He said the government would look into the total crop damage in the country and begin crop rehabilitation programmes by the end of August. bdn
