<TITLE> Germany warned India of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination plot: ex-spy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) Germany had warned India of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination plot, but intelligence agents had ignored it, says B Raman, one of India's best-known spies. Raman makes the revelation about the former Indian prime minister in his new book "The Kaoboys of RAW". Raman, who worked with India's external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing until mid-1990s and retired as the deputy chief writes that there were warnings from Germany about Gandhi's assassination. He says the warnings were completely ignored when RAW passed them on to the Intelligence Bureau, India's internal security agency. He blames the Intelligence Bureau for ignoring a crucial input from German intelligence agents about a Sri Lankan explosive expert repeatedly visiting Chennai before Gandhi's assassination. "No-one was prepared to admit that there were any deficiencies. I suggested that we should look into the way in which the report from the German Intelligence about the visit of an LTTE sympathiser, reputed to be an explosive expert to Chennai, was verified before it was rejected," he writes. The former spy also claims that even routine verification of the input was not carried out. "The main contributory factor was the lax physical security. German Intelligence could have helped in getting an idea of the LTTE sleeper cells," he adds. "Everybody in Delhiin the intelligence community, in the Army headquarters, the MEA and the PMOhad convinced themselves that the Sri Lankan Tamils would never harm Rajiv Gandhi because he and his mother (Indira Gandhi) has done more to help the Tamil community than anybody else," Raman says. bdn
