<TEXT>
 Shaugat Ali Sagor North America Correspondent Toronto, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) Sheikh Hasina's Montreal-based lawyer, Dr Payam Akhavan is working to involve the international community and the United Nations in particular to free the former prime minister from jail. The Canadian law professor of Iranian origin has already submitted details of Hasina's case to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. On having been appointed Hasina's lawyer overseas, Akhavan told bdnews24.com's North America correspondent Shawgat Ali Sagar Thursday that one of his main tasks was to involve the UN in the legal battle. The prominent human rights lawyer said: "The extortion case filed against former Bangladeshi premier has an international dimension. It is not merely a case to protect an individual, or it is not just a question of getting justice or protecting human rights of Sheikh Hasina. The question of the future of democracy in Bangladesh is also involved with this case." Dr Akhavan, now in London, said this in an exclusive telephone interview with bdnews24.com about his assignment in Dhaka. "I have accepted the case to contribute to the democratic process of Bangladesh. An interim government is running the country towards a free and fair election to hand over the power to the people's representative of the country. "Whether there will be any internationally accepted free and fair election in the country is also involved with this case. That's why I have decided to join the legal fight as a counsel for Sheikh Hasina. To me, this is a legal battle to ensure the democracy and voting right of the people of Bangladesh." Akhavan is not joining the lawyer's panel fighting a legal battle in Dhaka's court. "It will depend on how this trial proceeds. At the moment a group of talented and expert lawyers is battling in the court with the government of Bangladesh to free Sheikh Hasina. "I'm in close touch with them. I'm watching the legal process and studying every document. I'll be there at the right time to join the battling team in Bangladesh if situation demands. Akhavan, a professor of law at McGill University in Montreal, teaches and researches in the areas of public international law, international criminal law and transitional justice, with a particular interest in human rights and multiculturalism, war crimes prosecutions, UN reform and the prevention of genocide. Replying to a question about the possibility of getting justice for Hasina, Akhavan said: "I hope to do my best to get justice for Sheikh Hasina. Bangladesh is a member of the United Nations and signatory to UN Convention on Human Rights. "So the government of Bangladesh is obliged to follow the international standard of justice set by the UN. "I will try to ensure that the Bangladesh government is following international standard of justice. The government of Bangladesh is obliged to follow the due legal process set by the UN convention; they are obliged not to politicise the judiciary and not to influence the verdict of the trial court. "Trial of the former prime minister is not merely an internal issue of Bangladesh. It has become an international issue and the trial itself has an international dimension. All the international community is watching the situation of Bangladesh very closely. "I want to give a clear message to the government of Bangladesh and people of the country that the international community around the globe is closely watching the development related to the case against Sheikh Hasina and other political leaders. "International community wants to see a free and fair election to restore the democracy in the country. They want to be convinced that government is not excluding anybody from the electoral process by convicting anybody in a politicised and biased judiciary process." Akhavan said the main evidence against Hasina came from a confession by her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, who, he alleged, was "subject to serious physical and mental abuse". "The government cannot just use confession of a detained person to victimise national political leaders, what they have done in the case of Sheikh Hasina. "Sheikh Selim is in detention and there is an allegation that the security person has forced him to give a statement against political leaders like Sheikh Hasina. "The government is now using the alleged statements against Sheikh Hasina to penalise her. International standards of justice do not allow this type of activities." Replying to a question about the presence of international observers for the trial of Hasina the law expert said: "It may be helpful. But the case by its own merit has drawn an international attention. "So a different international community, groups are already observing the process of the trial of the former prime minister of Bangladesh. "Especially those who want to see strong and effective democracy in this region are monitoring the situation in Bangladesh." Akhavan was the first legal advisor to the prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and played a key role in the development of its foundational jurisprudence. Akhavan has considerable experience in post-conflict peace-building and international dispute settlement, having advised the UN on transitional justice, appearing as counsel before international courts and tribunals on behalf of sovereigns, and serving on the board of directors of human rights NGOs, including the Iran Human Rights Documentation Centre in New Haven, of which he is also the president and co-founder. His work has been featured in the New York Times and, in recognition of his contributions to promoting accountability for human rights violations. He was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader in 2005. bdnews24.c
