 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks incurred biggest losses Sunday due to heavy sell-offs from retail and institutional investors as the regulator continued its strict vigilance over loan extension from merchant banks. The fall of the Dhaka benchmark index, DGEN, is the highest in the five months to Sunday, as indices opened downbeat and continued to fall until the day's close amid sell-pressure. CEO of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Salahuddin Ahmed Khan said the decline was not linked to global shares that plunged into the red, setting off panic among investors in the US and Europe and leaving a fallout in Asian markets. Suspension of financial adjustment facilities also depressed investors here, said a senior official with the DSE, preferring anonymity. "It's because of the SEC move to control credit extension by merchant banks. Merchant banks initiated sell-offs to adjust loans in their investor portfolio accounts amid the regulator's threat of actions," the official said. The Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30 suspended financial adjustment facilities for quality or 'A' shares to rein in a lingering surge in stocks prices and liquidity flow. The facility that had earlier allowed investors to buy stocks with immediate proceeds from a sale now compelled them to wait for four days to buy new stocks. "It appears to be the losses from profit. We have intervened in the market to narrow the investor losses. If we had allowed the surge to continue, small investors would have been faced huge losses when correction starts," said a senior official with the SEC, seeking anonymity. "We cannot allow the market to continue surging when the supply of securities is lower," the official said. The benchmark DGEN or general index slumped 49.64 points or 2.15 percent 2254.56, the highest ever loss since March 11. The index fell 60 points on March 11. The DSI or all-share price index lost 27.76 points or 1.46 percent to 1870.11. The DSE-20 blue chip index plunged 60.22 points or 2.92 percent to 2001.42. Losers beat gainers 130 to 62. Some 16 issues held steady. Square Pharma, the biggest issue by market capitalisation, guided the fall in pharmaceuticals stocks. Square dipped 1.74 percent to Tk 4888. Lafarge Surma and Heidelberg Cement led the decline in the cement sector. Lafarge and Heidelberg dropped 0.63 percent and 2.91 percent to Tk 390.75 and Tk 1033.5. Power stocks finished mixed. A market major, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, ended at Tk 532.75, down 3.22 percent from the previous day. DESCO lost 4.51 percent to Tk 883.25. But Summit Power that secured the day's highest turnover added 2.61 percent to Tk 1273. Heavy sell-offs pushed almost all the banking issues down. BRAC Bank lost 3.12 percent to Tk 899. Southeast Bank slumped 5.87 percent to Tk 508.5. Turnover on the DSE increased slightly to Tk 1.09 billion from Thursday's Tk 1.08 billion. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange finished lower as all major sectors slumped. Of the issues traded, 20 gained, 72 declined and six remained unchanged. Turnover however rose to Tk 111.81 million from Tk 107.50 million. bd
