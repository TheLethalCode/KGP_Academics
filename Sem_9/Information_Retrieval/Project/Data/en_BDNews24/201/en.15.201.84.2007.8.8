<TITLE> Polish PM sacks minister as polls loom </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski fired his interior minister on Wednesday over a botched corruption investigation at the heart of a political crisis that threatens to topple the government. Kaczynski said he had fired Janusz Kaczmarek, a close ally, blaming him for a leak that exposed the probe before it had gathered conclusive evidence against Andrzej Lepper, a former farm minister. Lepper heads the Self-Defence party, a junior coaltion party. Kaczynski, a social conservative who won 2005 elections promising to rid Poland of sleaze, sacked Lepper a month ago, triggering a crisis and raising the prospect of early elections in the biggest ex-communist European Union newcomer. Kaczynski reiterated that early polls might be the only way forward unless Lepper's Self-Defence and the third coalition partner, a small far-right party, fell into line ahead of the next parliamentary session on Aug 22. "I'm personally in favour of snap polls," Kaczynski told a news conference. He did not link the sacking of the minister to any scenario for how the political crisis might end. Analysts said the move was meant as a message to voters that Law and Justice was tough on corruption even in its own ranks.
