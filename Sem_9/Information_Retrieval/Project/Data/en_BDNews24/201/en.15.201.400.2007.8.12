 CANBERRA, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister John Howard faces a crushing electoral defeat which could see him lose his own Sydney-based seat, a poll showed on Sunday. Howard, 11 years in power and facing re-election in a national vote tipped for November 10, trailed high-profile former television presenter Maxine McKew, 46 percent to 53 when votes were distributed to the two major parties, a Galaxy poll for The Sunday Telegraph newspaper and SBS television showed. McKew, recruited to the rival Labor Party to take on the conservative Howard, was also level with the veteran prime minister when voters were asked who would do the best job for the seat of Bennelong, held by Howard since 1974.

Senior Labor lawmaker Bob McMullan cautioned it would be hard to unseat Howard regardless of poll indications. "We're very near the end of this three-year term and people are open to the idea of change. But I think their voting intention isn't set in concrete at all, it's quite fluid," he told Australian television. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Howard's wisdom and experience would carry him over the line and youthful opposition leader Kevin Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, lacked a plan for Australia's future. "There's always controversy about the record of the incumbent and so on, it happens everywhere," Downer said. "I don't always want to seem Pollyanna-ish. I'm a person though who's pretty relaxed about the struggle that lies ahea
