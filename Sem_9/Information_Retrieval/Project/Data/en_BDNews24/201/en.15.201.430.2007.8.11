 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have left batsman Jacques Kallis out of the squad for next month's Twenty20 world championship they are hosting, it was announced on Saturday. Kallis, South Africa's leading run-scorer in tests and one-day internationals, has been criticised in the past for slow scoring in limited-overs matches. The 15-man squad includes several other all rounders in Shaun Pollock, Johan van der Wath, Albie Morkel, Justin Kemp and young prospect Vernon Philander. Top-order batsman Gulam Bodi is the only player in the squad with no senior international experience. "The squad announced today provides the coach and captain with various options in all departments," convenor of selectors Joubert Strydom said in a statement. "There is a good blend of experience and youth in the squad." The Twenty20 world championship runs from Sept. 11 to 14. Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Gulam Bodi, Loots Bosman, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Justin Kemp, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Vernon Philander, Shaun Pollock, Thandi Tshabalala, Johan van der Wath
