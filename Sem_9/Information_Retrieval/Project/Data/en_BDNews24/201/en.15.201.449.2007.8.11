<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central banks came to the aid of investors on Friday by pumping extra cash into the world's financial systems, helping temper fears of a liquidity crisis that helped the major US stock indexes sharply cut losses. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 31.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to end an exceptionally volatile day at 13,239.54. Earlier, the Dow lost more than 200 points to plunge to a session low at 13,057.86. But the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index managed to eke out a gain of 0.55 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to finish at 1,453.64. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 11.60 points, or 0.45 percent, to close at 2,544.89. The central banks' aid came too late for bourses in Asia and Europe where stock prices fell sharply. In New York, U.S. crude oil prices recovered some lost ground, finishing the day lower but still above $71 a barrel. Gold prices held onto sizable gains. Worldwide, central banks have injected at least $326 billion into their financial systems in the past 48 hours in an effort to prevent a global liquidity crunch that has its roots in the riskiest end of the U.S. mortgage market. Credit concerns have buffeted world financial markets as the fallout hits banks globally, squeezes once ample liquidity, and threatens to damage world economic growth. The flight of cash to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries was prevalent in early activity, but by the end of the day, it reversed course and that market closed lower. "It's a confidence thing. If equities and risk assets can stabilize here, Treasuries have (already) done their job of a flight-to-quality safe haven," said George Goncalves, chief Treasury/TIPS and agency strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York. In its biggest single day of temporary open market operations in nearly six years, the U.S. Federal Reserve added $38 billion in reserves in three moves, the first coming before U.S. stock markets began trading. The European Central Bank added 61.05 billion euros ($83.6 billion) on Friday, less than its record-setting sum of 94.841 billion on Thursday. Asian authorities also added cash to their financial systems on Thursday and Friday. After a week of wild gyrations, the Dow average was up 0.44 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.44 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.34 percent. "People want to see how deep are these mortgage losses and how many creditors are really affected," said Andrew Kanaly, chairman of Kanaly Trust Co., an investment advisory firm based in Houston, Texas. Emergency action by central banks underlined the risk that a global liquidity crunch was more serious than anticipated. "What we have at the moment is just an all-round sense of panic," said Marc Ostwald, bond analyst at Insinger de Beaufort in London. "Quite clearly there's a lot of deep-seated fear out there and it's going to take a while to resolve this." Volatility across markets is hitting banks and corporations, as they have a harder time accessing the financing essential in making takeover deals. The CBOE Volatility Index , often called Wall Street's fear gauge, shot up 10 percent during the session to 29.84, its highest level since April 2003. By the close, the VIX was at 28.30, still up 6.9 percent. The MSCI main world equity index fell to a four-month low, off 1.91 percent, which followed a 2.0 percent drop on Thursday. The MSCI Emerging Markets stock index fell 3.18 percent, an eight-week low. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended down 3.04 percent, its biggest one-day slump since May 2003. The index is now in negative territory for the year. European and Asian bourses did not fare as well as the US stock market because they were closed before the Fed took action. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.37 percent, off 1.27 percent for the week, while London's FTSE 100 index lost 3.71 percent, down 3.0 percent for the week. High-yielding currencies, such as the New Zealand dollar, fell 0.59 percent against the U.S. dollar. The euro gained against both the greenback and yen, trading at $1.3693 and 162.14 yen, respectively. The dollar gained 0.19 percent against the yen to 118.41 from 118.18 yen late on Thursday. "To some degree, you've got people saying things are still pretty good. We're not going into a recession," said Rick Campagna, portfolio manager at Provident Investment Council in Pasadena, California. "But there is still an incredible amount of fear in the market, and rumors every hour it seems," he said. World stock markets have shed nearly 8 percent since they hit record highs only a month ago. As a result, investors rushed to buy safe-haven government bonds, unwind yen-financed carry trades, and moved to scale back expectations for interest-rate rises by some major central banks this year. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note gave up early gains to end down 5/32 of a point in price, pushing the yield up to 4.80 percent from 4.78 percent late on Thursday. The benchmark JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus showed yield spreads tighter by 1 basis point to 202 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. US regulators are scrutinizing the books of some top Wall Street brokers and investment banks for subprime mortgage losses, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Investors cut bets on ECB interest-rate rise expectations in the face of market uncertainty. The market prices in a 50 percent chance of the ECB raising rates to 4.25 percent in September, compared with nearly 100 percent last week. There is also a 98 percent chance of a Fed rate cut priced in by end-September. "Should the central banks fail in their efforts and short-term refinancing pressures remain, then it won't be many days before we are likely to see the Fed respond with an outright easing in the price at which it extends credit," JP Morgan said in a note. US crude oil for September delivery fell 12 cents to settle at $71.47 a barrel. COMEX most-active gold for December delivery jumped $8.80, or 1.3 percent, to end at $681.60 an oun
