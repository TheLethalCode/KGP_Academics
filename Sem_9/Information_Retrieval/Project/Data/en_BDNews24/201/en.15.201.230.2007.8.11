<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked party leaders and workers to stand by flood-affected people as they did in 1998 without waiting for anyone's order, her lawyer said Saturday. The detained former prime minister was also quoted as urging people to have patience in times of crisis. Hasina's lawyers barrister Fazle Noor Tapash and Khandaker Moniruzzaman briefed reporters on their visit to Hasina at the special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. For the first time since her arrest on July 16, Hasina was allowed to receive two visitors together. The lawyers told reporters that they had discussed legal processes of handling different cases against her and submitting her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. "Sheikh Hasina has sought blessings from people and prayed for flood victims," Tapash said. "All the cases filed against Sheikh Hasina are false. She is concerned that she may not get justice. She, however, believes that she will gain freedom through a legal process," he said. Asked whether Hasina knew barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud had not agreed to fight her case, Tapash said she was "upset about it". "At the same time, she was happy to know that many lawyers were willing to fight a court battle for her," he said. On whether Hasina would meet husband Wazed Miah, Tapash said: "She is worried about her husband's illness. The authorities told Sheikh Hasina to go at night to see her husband. But she did not agreefor security reasons. "Talks with the authorities are going on. She will go to see Wazed Miah from between 7am and 8am in a day or two." Hasina's tax lawyer Khandaker Moniruzzaman told the newsmen: "The wealth statement she was going to submit to the Anticorruption Commission needs some changes." bdnews24.c
