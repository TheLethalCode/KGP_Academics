<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin Saturday said the Supreme Court would come forward to save the country from any crisis. "The Supreme Court played a role in the past at the critical juncture of the nation. It is doing so at present and will do so in future," Amin said. For independence of the judiciary, those who are working in the department must be mentally independent first, the CJ said in his address to a seminar on "Judicial Reform and Independence of Judiciary" organised by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh at the Supreme Court Bar Association Building. "The Supreme Court gave an epoch-making verdict for the independence of the judiciary. The constitution also spoke of the independence of the judiciary, but the judiciary has not been separated from the executive branch," he said. "It is the Supreme Court that again came forward to implement its verdict," Amin said. "It is often said that judges are being offered allurements. If a judge works hoping for rewards he should give up the judicial post. He is not only pushing the country toward a disaster but also pushing himself to the same direction," he said. Former chief justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury, who attended the seminar, suggested that the 1972 constitution should be revived to ensure independence of the judiciary. He proposed formation of a committee led by the chief justice on appointment of judges. The committee should include two judges form the Appellate Division and the High Court Division each, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the attorney general, he said. bdnew
