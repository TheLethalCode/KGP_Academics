 HOUSTON, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Space shuttle Endeavour looked to be in good shape on Thursday as it headed toward the International Space Station with a crew that includes a former school teacher who waited 22 years to fly. A damage inspection of the orbiter found no obvious problems, but the teacher, Barbara Morgan, said her first trip to space was a bit discombobulating. "All of yesterday ... I felt like I was upside down the whole time," she told Mission Control in Houston. Endeavour was scheduled to dock on Friday with the space station, where astronauts will install a two-tonne metal beam in another step toward completion of the $100 billion international project. The shuttle crew, using a sensor-laden robot arm, scanned Endeavour's wings and nosecap for any damage that might have occurred during Wednesday's launch from Florida. Inspections have become standard second-day procedure for shuttle crews since Columbia broke apart while returning to Earth in 2003, doomed by flying debris at launch which caused wing heat shield damage that went undetected. The seven Columbia astronauts died in the accident and the shuttle fleet was grounded for 2 1/2 years as NASA reviewed and revised its safety procedures. INSPECTION NASA mission management team chairman John Shannon said in a briefing at Johnson Space Center that small bits of debris flew from the shuttle fuel tank as Endeavour took off, but none was believed to be "significant." While data from Thursday's inspection still had to be studied, flight director Matt Abbott said video from the scan was encouraging. "It looked very, very clean," he said, meaning no heat shield nicks were visible. Space station crew members will photograph the shuttle's belly as it approaches on Friday and transmit the images to NASA for study, and another inspection will be performed before Endeavour heads for home in about two weeks. Morgan, 55, trained as the backup to fellow school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who was one of seven astronauts killed on space shuttle Challenger when its fuel tank exploded shortly after takeoff in 1986. Morgan taught in Idaho after the disaster until she officially joined NASA as an astronaut in 1998. During the flight, she will take questions from school children at least once, but her primary tasks will be operating robot arms on the spacecraft and supervising cargo transfer. Endeavour, which last flew in 2002, is making the second of four shuttle flights planned this year as NASA pushes to finish the space station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010.
