 ASHGABAT, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has sacked his energy minister and two other senior officials, saying he was disappointed with their work, state television reported on Monday. The Turkmen leader fired Yusup Davudov, energy minister from 2005, for "serious shortcomings", and appointed 46-year-old Kurbannur Annaveliyev in his position. The energy minister oversees electric power generation and transmission, but not gas, a mainstay of the economy. The president also sacked the car industry minister and the construction minister, appointing Ashir Sarybayev and Shamukhamed Durdylyyev, respectively. All three had been appointed by Berdymukhamedov's predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, who died in December of a heart attack after ruling the Central Asian country for 21 years. The new leader has sought to reverse some of Niyazov's harshest policies in the tightly run former Soviet nation and has appointed new officials to key positions. Berdymukhamedov criticised the sacked officials for their "lack of business initiative and sense of responsibility". Turkmenistan is Central Asia's top natural gas producer which depends on Russia as the main conduit for exports. The gas sector is overseen by a different minister, Baimyrat Khodzhamukhamed
