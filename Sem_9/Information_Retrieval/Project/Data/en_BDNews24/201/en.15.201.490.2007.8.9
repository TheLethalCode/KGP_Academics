 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Chhatra League formed a human chain on the Dhaka University Curzon Hall premises Thursday, demanding that August 15 be observed as national mourning day. They also demanded immediate, unconditional release of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina from jail. The participants in the human chain carried banners that read, "Execute the verdict of the Bangabandhu murder case immediately". Up to 25 workers of the BCL organised the human chain. They wore gags at the time. Witnesses said the programme lasted about 10 minutes from 10am. BCL's DU unit president Sohel Rana Tipu and general secretary Sajjad Sakib led the programme. Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com: "Programmes to demand immediate execution of Bangabandhu murder case verdict and unconditional release of Sheikh Hasina will continue." BCL Central Committee joint secretary Jasimuddin Bhuiyan was also present during the programme. bdnew
