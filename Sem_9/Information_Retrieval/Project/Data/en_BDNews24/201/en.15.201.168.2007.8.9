<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  Police Thursday fired tear gas and charged batons to disperse hundreds of jute mill workers demanding arrears, leaving one worker dead and 20 others wounded, police and witnesses said. The violence erupted after the workers of the state-owned Amin Jute Mills Ltd came to receive their overdue salary from the mill authorities, the mill's general manager Aminur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The workers demanded salary for two weeks but the authorities were just able to give them for one week, he said. The authorities' failure in going by the workers' demand sparked resentment among the workers. Panchlaish zone assistant police commissioner Mizanur Rahman said their action came after the workers put up a barricade on a nearby road and started throwing stones at them. Police sub-inspector Zahir Ahmed, who was on duty at the police check post on the Chittagong Medical College Hospital premises, confirmed to bdnews24.com that one worker died after he was rushed to the hospital. It was not clear immediately how he was injured during the violence. Ahmed, however, could not give the name of the dead immediately. Abdul Khaleque, a former trade union leader of the mill, said the situation turned extremely fierce after the news of the worker's death spread fast. Khaleque said police fiercely charged batons and fired teargas to take the situation under control. The violence continued at 1:45 pm. bdnews24.
