 LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks rose and emerging market assets posted modest gains on Monday after moves by central banks to inject money into the banking system reassured investors, prompting them back into riskier assets. The European Central Bank injected liquidity into the euro money market again on Monday, easing market tensions triggered by liquidity concerns in the banking system hit by troubles in risky US subprime mortgages. The ECB and authorities in Asia carried on a global campaign for a third day to prevent money markets seizing up after the recent revelations by financial institutions of their exposure to crumbling credit markets. While moves by central banks raised concerns that the liquidity problem was far more serious than previously anticipated, they helped calm tensions and shift investor focus back to strong corporate and economic fundamentals. "Companies still have strong balance sheets, strategic M&A has further to go," said Teun Draaisma, strategist at Morgan Stanley. The U.S. bank has moved to overweight equities and cut allocation to cash following a recent fall in stocks. MSCI's main world stock index was up nearly half a percent, having fallen 7.3 percent from lifetime highs hit only a month ago. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.7 percent, rebounding from a nearly 5 percent sell-off during the last two sessions. Tokyo stocks ended up 0.2 percent, while Asian stocks outside Japan were up 0.9 percent. US stock futures pointed to a firmer start on Wall Street. Emerging market assets also posted gains. MSCI's emerging market equity index gained 0.8 percent, while spreads on JPMorgan's EMBI+ gauge narrowed 3 basis points to 204 bps over U.S. Treasuries. Short-term money markets have also eased after efforts by central banks to keep money flowing through the system. Overnight dollar rates in the London interbank market were fixed around 20 basis points lower on Monday after hitting a 6-1/2 year high on Friday. Euro deposit rates also eased after hitting their highest in 6 years last week. But analysts say it is premature to conclude the storm has passed. "Central banks are treating the symptoms, not curing the disease. The root cause of the current squeeze on liquidity appears to be the inability of many large investors in asset backed securities to roll commercial paper. This has forced them to draw on funding lines with commercial banks," HBOS said in a note to clients. "Until investor demand for asset backed commercial paper returns (or worse the underlying investment funds are wound down amid a fire sale of their assets) it is hard to see how cash markets will function smoothly without on-going central bank support." The euro was down 0.3 percent against the dollar after the ECB action as investors sought dollars -- the root of the cash crunch in money markets. Investors are also scaling back expectations for a September interest rate hike by ECB, dragging on the euro. The yen was higher against other currencies as investors unwound carry trades of purchasing high-yielding currencies, financed in the Japanese currency. The single currency was down 0.3 at $1.3650, holding off the all-time high of $1.3853 reached in July. The September Bund future was down 0.1 percent. Oil prices rose with the London Brent crude up 1 percent. Gold was lower at $6
