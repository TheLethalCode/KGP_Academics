 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The ongoing anticorruption drive has a positive effect on revenue collections with the tax evasion tendency declining substantially, the National Board of Revenue said Thursday. Taxpayers are now paying taxes spontaneously, a top official said. About Tk 333 crore more tax was collected in July, the first month of fiscal 2007-08, than in July last fiscal year. The growth in revenue collections was 13.58 percent. On rising revenue collections, NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday: "Revenue growth cannot be fully understood from the statistics of one month. "A clear picture will emerge after a few months. However, it is true that the ongoing anti-graft drive has had a positive effect on revenue collection. It seems that the tendency to evade tax has decreased," he said. "Many people are spontaneously coming to the NBR to pay. Such incidents did not happen earlier," Rahman said. "Tax dodgers are being given punishments of different tenures. This has also contributed to the increase in revenue collection. Besides, NBR officials have also started working with renewed vigour for tax collection in the changed situation." NBR recorded Tk 2,783.64 crore in revenue collections in July, up from Tk 2,450.75 crore in the same month a year ago. The NBR statistics show that Tk 1,274.96 crore was collected from import duty in July, a rise of 9.23 percent from Tk 1,167.25 crore in the same month of last fiscal year. NBR recorded income tax collections at Tk 509.72 crore in July, up from Tk 320.53 crore in the same month a year earlier, which means a rise of Tk 188.79 crore or 58.83 percent. Collections from VAT and other categories rose by 3.44 percent to Tk 975.96 crore in July from the same month a year ago. bdnews
