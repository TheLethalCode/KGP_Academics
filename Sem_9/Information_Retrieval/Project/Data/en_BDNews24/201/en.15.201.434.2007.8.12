 KABUL, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan pledged on Sunday to work together to combat the common security threat of Taliban and al Qaeda militants. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf addressed the closing session of a gathering, or jirga, of Afghan and Pakistani politicians and tribal elders in the Afghan capital Kabul aiming to bring the two often-feuding US allies closer together.

"It is ending with good results, achievements and a message for both countries." Analysts and diplomats warned against expecting too much from the jirga, saying it was only a first step towards a unified approach to combating militants who threaten security in both countries. A second jirga to be held in Pakistan at an unspecified date may yield firmer results, they said. A jirga is a traditional meeting among the Pashtun tribes that live on both sides of the border, where elders use consensus to try to peacefully settle disput
