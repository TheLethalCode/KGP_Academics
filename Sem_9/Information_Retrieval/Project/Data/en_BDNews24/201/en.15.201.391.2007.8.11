 KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush will host French President Nicolas Sarkozy at a "casual lunch" at his family home in Maine on Saturday, signaling warmer US ties with France after strains over the Iraq war. It was a rare invitation. Only one other world leader has been invited by Bush to his family's seaside compound along the rocky coast of Maine -- Russian President Vladimir Putin in July to try and soothe escalating tensions over US missile defense plans in Europe. The United States is hoping for improved ties with France under Sarkozy, after relations chilled with his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, who voiced opposition to the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. Bush usually invites foreign allies to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, to show a special relationship. The last head of state to visit Bush's Texas ranch was Colombian President Alvaro Uribe in August 2005. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said "geography" played a role in the Kennebunkport venue for the two leader meetings this summer -- Sarkozy was on vacation in nearby New Hampshire and Putin was heading to Latin America. Sarkozy, who took office in May, was criticized in France for choosing the United States for his first vacation as president. He briefly interrupted his American holiday to fly back to France to attend the funeral of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger on Friday, but returned to visit Bush in Maine. Bush started a working vacation in this resort town to attend the wedding of a family friend. He has gone biking, and out on a boat with his father, former President George Bush, and brother Jeb, to do some fishing. The Bush invitation to Sarkozy and his wife, Cecilia, was extended during the Group of Eight meeting in Germany in June. "It's a casual lunch," Perino said. "As when any world leader gets together with another, there's a possibility that they could discuss business," she said. "Obviously we're working very closely with France right now on a range of issues," Perino said, noting efforts at the UN Security Council on Lebanon, Sudan and Iran. A US climate change summit in September may also come up in conversation during the lunch, expected to last about 90 minutes, Perino said. A Portland Press Herald newspaper editorial on Friday exclaimed: "Bienvenue, President Nicolas Sarkozy!" and said the French leader should consider vacationing in Maine instead of New Hampshire. The editorial ended: "After all, a number of us speak French, and this is Vacationland. See you next summe
