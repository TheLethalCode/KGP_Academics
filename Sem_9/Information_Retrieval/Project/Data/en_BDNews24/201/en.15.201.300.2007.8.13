 LONDON, August 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors jumped back into riskier assets on Monday, reassured by central bank moves to inject money into the banking system, driving stocks higher and raising demand for emerging market debt. Caution remained on currency markets, however, where the yen strengthened as popular borrowing-based "carry" trades unwound. Markets have been rocked for weeks by news of problems in banks and funds exposed to risky investments in US mortgage and asset-backed markets, triggering fears that the cheap credit that has helped fuel global growth might dry up. Central banks in Europe, Asia and North America injected huge sums into the money market late last week to prevent money markets seizing up as the number of financial institutions revealing exposure to crumbling credit markets swelled. The trend continued on Monday when the Bank of Japan pumped $5.1 billion of funds into the banking system in a one-week operation. The European Central Bank also said it would add liquidity to calm markets again, although it said money market conditions were improving. MSCI's main world stock index was up nearly half a percent and its emerging market stable mate gained three-quarters of a percent. The two, however, have fallen 7.3 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively, from lifetime highs a month ago. "It's certainly very reassuring that central banks are providing liquidity, but that doesn't repair or make go away any losses that funds have experienced from the subprime sector," said Guy Hutchings, chief investment officer at MFS Investment Management. STOCKS REBOUND European stocks rose, reversing a sharp two-day slump. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.4 percent, rebounding from a nearly 5 percent sell-off during the last two sessions. "After what happened last week much of the focus this week will be on central banks," Bear Stearns analysts wrote in a note. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.9 percent, Germany's DAX gained 1.2 percent and France's CAC 40 was up 1.4 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average inched up 0.2 percent or 35.96 points to 16,800.05 while the TOPIX index lost 0.08 percent, or 1.29 points, to 1,632.64, the lowest close since December 2006. Confidence, meanwhile, was growing on emerging debt markets. Spreads on JPMorgan's EMBI+ gauge narrowed 3 basis points to lie 204 basis points over US Treasuries. On currency markets, the yen was stronger against other major currencies as investors adjusted "carry" trades in which low-yielders like the yen are borrowed and transferred into higher-yielding assets elsewhere. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent from late US trade to 118.26 yen. The euro slipped 0.3 percent to 161.61 yen, but stayed above a four-month low of 159.98 yen hit on Friday. The single currency was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.3666, holding off the all-time high of $1.3853 reached in July. Euro zone government bond yields were mixed. The interest rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield was down 1.2 basis points at 4.219 percent. The 10-year Bund yield was up 1.5 basis points at 4.379 percent. Bond yields and prices are inversely related.
