 HONG KONG, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong closed schools and financial markets on Friday in the face of an approaching tropical storm that also forced the postponement of a soccer match between Spanish side Barcelona and a local select team. Tropical storm Pabuk targeted Hong Kong from the east earlier in the week, then slipped down the Chinese coast -- only to do an about-turn and advance back towards the former British colony. The government advised people to "lock all windows and doors, fit bars into position and insert reinforced shutters and gates if they are available ... Do not stand near windows on the exposed side of your home. Move all furniture and valuables away from these areas." The Department of Health said that all clinics had been closed, except eight methadone clinics. General out-patient clinics, evening clinics and specialist clinics run by the Hospital Authority were shut. At the airport, flight operations were normal for the time being, a spokeswoman said at about 0715 GMT. The government cautioned against swimming at local beaches. Pabuk lashed Taiwan and the Philippines earlier in the week. Tropical storms in the region gather intensity from the warm ocean waters and frequently develop into typhoons that hit Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and southern China during a season that lasts from early summer to late autumn.
