<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai security forces killed three suspected militants in the rebellious Muslim-majority south on Friday in a shoot-out during a security sweep across the region, police said. Around a hundred police and soldiers came under fire while looking for militants and weapons in the Sungai Padi district of Narathiwat, one of the three violence-plagued southernmost provinces. One soldier was wounded in the firefight which lasted around two hours, police said. Up to eight militants were thought to have escaped, but police said weapons recovered including M-16 assault rifles, handguns and explosives. Elsewhere in the region, where more than 2,300 people have been killed in three years of separatist unrest, a Muslim rubber tapper was shot dead on his way to work. Daily killings and bombings by secretive militants who never claim responsibility have increased steadily despite the presence of 30,000 troops and police. The violence has been limited to the far south since it began in January 2004 and has shown no signs of infiltration by international militant groups such as al Qaeda or its southeast Asian affiliates, most security analysts say.
