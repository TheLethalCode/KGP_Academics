<TITLE> German train drivers put rail strike on hold </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German train drivers on Wednesday suspended plans to hold the first nationwide rail strikes in 15 years after a court banned the stoppages. The strike, due to start on Thursday with a four-hour halt to freight services before spreading to passenger trains, threatened to disrupt travel for 5 million people a day. Companies had warned of the potential damage to the economy. "We will not wage a labour war as long as the law is not on our side," Manfred Schell, head of the GDL train drivers' union, told German television, adding the union was trying to appeal against the ruling. "For now, we will wait." The planned strikes, at the peak of the summer holiday season, have dented public support for the GDL union, which has rejected a pay deal reached between rail operator Deutsche Bahn and two other unions. The 34,000-member rebel drivers' union wants a pay rise of up to 31 percent. It is seeking a separate deal from that agreed between Deutsche Bahn and 134,000 members of two larger rail workers unions who have accepted a 4.5 percent increase. The union says its drivers are underpaid given the high level of responsibility and compared with their counterparts in other European countries. Companies and industry groups say a strike could cause bottlenecks in the supply chain and lead to production problems, possibly even hitting growth in Europe's biggest economy if it were to last for more than a couple of weeks. Berlin-based DIW economic research institute says the strike could cost Germany 500 million euros ($690 million) a day. Earlier, Werner Bayreuther, Deutsche Bahn's chief negotiator, said an industrial tribunal in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg had issued an injunction barring stoppages on freight and long-distance trains. Although both sides have expressed some willingness to restart talks through a mediator, there is no sign yet that either party is prepared to make substantive compromises and the prospect of strikes has not gone away. "There are 8,000 people who want to go on strike and victimise millions of customers who won't be able to go on holiday or get to work," said Deutsche Bahn personnel chief Margret Suckale. "For that reason, we are willing to embark on mediation." The GDL has said it will not block a mediator but it is unclear who that could be or when talks could start. "We are ready to compromise on the question of pay and working hours but we are not prepared to compromise on the question of having our own, independent agreement," Claus Weselsky, GDL's deputy head, told German rad
