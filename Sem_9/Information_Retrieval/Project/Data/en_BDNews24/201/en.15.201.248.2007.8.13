 Sohel Parvez and Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Business Correspondents Dhaka, August 13 (bdnews24.com) -- A group of local investors has expressed renewed interests to buy 67 percent shares of state-run Rupali Bank and invited the government to the negotiation table, officials said Monday. "We are ready to sit for negotiations based on our offer. We have the legal right to talks if the negotiation with the first bidder failed," Matiul Islam, chairman of Domestic Investor Consortium, told bdnews24.com, Monday. The consortium, comprising 11 banks and two insurers, had earlier offered $100 million for Rupali's 67 percent stake and qualified as the second highest bidder after Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud offered $330 million for the shares. The consortium proposed to take care of Rupali's liabilities through negotiations while Prince Bandar asked the government to take all the liabilities of Rupali including bad debts, said a senior official with the Privatisation Commission, seeking anonymity. The consortium's offer came when the government has been waiting to hear from the Saudi prince on signing a sales and purchase agreement. Both the parties earlier closed down their negotiations on Rupali's liabilities and bad loans. Prince Bandar has yet to respond although the government's deadline for signing the deal ended on July 15. The prince offered the $330 million bid for a 67 percent stake and later increased the offer to $458 million for a 94 percent stake in Rupali. "We are trying to know the specific date when the prince would sign the agreement," Privatisation Commission chairman Abu Solaiman Chowdhury told bdndws24.com. He said he had received a proposal from the consortium seeking to start negotiations if talks with the Saudi prince fell apart. "They have placed a proposal. But we cannot proceed until we are clear about the prince's position," the chairman said. Chowdhury however declined to say whether they are planning to scrap the deal with the prince. "It's a matter for higher authorities to decide," he said. bd
