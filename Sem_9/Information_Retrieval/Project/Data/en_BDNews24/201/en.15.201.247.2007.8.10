 GAZA, August 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli aircraft destroyed a control tower at Rafah airport in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday, residents and security officials said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Witnesses said an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at the abandoned control tower. An army spokeswoman said the military carried out an air strike against three armed militants in the airport. The Islamic Jihad militant group said three of its gunmen were in the area, but left shortly before the strike.
