<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Gono Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain Monday put forward eight recommendations to tackle the continuing flooding in the country. "There must be increased coordination in the flood relief efforts. Politics must be kept at bay," Dr Kamal told reporters at the Jatiya Press Club. "A healthy country can only be built by removing the factors that erode our shared societal values." He went on to make specific demands that he argued would ease the plight of flood-hit communities. Dr Kamal said it was now vital to supply farmers with adequate seed and paddy saplings on an emergency basis. Subsistence farmers should be supplied these seeds for free with immediate attention being given to preparing seed beds in flood-free areas. The Gono Forum president added that loans should be provided for farmers on easy terms with deferred payments in both the governmental and private sectors. He suggested that an ensured source of fertiliser was essential to the rebuilding process. Dr Kamal also added that the introduction of a food for work programme for wheat and winter vegetables was an increasingly viable option. "Steps must be taken to supply clean water especially when one considers the upcoming dry season in October. "Two sets of laws cannot exist in the same country. No politics in the name of relief work can ever be accepted," he said. bdnew
