<TITLE> Govt cannot finish work by 2008: Iftekhar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday said the caretaker government would not manage to finish all necessary reforms by the end of 2008. "We cannot finish all necessary reforms within the next 16 months," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com after a meeting at Bangladesh Enterprise Institute in Gulshan. "Therefore we want to put some people-oriented structures in place across the country so that subsequent governments cannot alter what we have done." The foreign adviser did not elaborate on what form these 'structures' or institutions would take or what specific purpose there would be. "I can say that formation of a national security council is underway, although I cannot say when it will be fully operational. The council of advisers has been consulted regarding this issue." The idea of a national security council has remained unclear since it first surfaced soon after the caretaker government's arrival in January. At that time, the army chief spoke of forming a national security council in the 'national interest.' However few specifics have been provided other than its general remit to deal with internal security issues. bdn
