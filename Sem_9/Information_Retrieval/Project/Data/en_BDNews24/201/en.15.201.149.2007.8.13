 PARIS, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Monday, reversing a two-day slump as investors' fears over a credit crunch stemming from US subprime mortgages eased after central banks stepped in to calm markets. Mining stocks were among the best performers, buoyed by stronger base metal prices. Anglo American gained 5.3 percent, while Xstrata rose 5.5 percent. Kazkhmys surged 7.1 percent, also boosted by an upgrade from UBS to "buy" from "neutral". At 0838 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.3 percent at 1,499 points, rebounding from a nearly 5 percent sell-off during the last two sessions, when it erased what was left of year-to-date gains. Central banks in North America, Europe and Asia late last week injected large sums in an effort to prevent money markets from seizing up after a number of financial institutions revealed exposure to subprime market turmoil. The European Central Bank said on Monday it would add more liquidity to calm markets following similar moves last Thursday and Friday, although it said money market conditions were improving. The FTSEurofirst 300 was back into positive territory for 2007 on Monday, up 1 percent for the year. "There might be a bounce in the coming days, given the general assessment that the central banks did what they had to do, but then it will depend on whether we get more bad news on the credit risks," said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Fortis Investments. "We'll see more funds closing for trading or more hedge funds blowing up. There is a lot of uncertainty on who owns a piece of the credit problems and who is affected by the liquidity dry-up," he said. Shares in Postbank fell 3 percent after the bank said it had taken onto its own books 600 million euros in exposure to two investment vehicles run by subprime-crisis-hit German peer IKB. Elsewhere in the sector, BNP Paribas gained 2 percent. The French bank, which shocked the market last week by announcing it had frozen three funds due to problems in the US supbrime market, said on Monday its exposure to U.S. lender HomeBanc, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week, was small and entirely covered by collateral. Deutsche Bank gained 1.6 percent, and Commerzbank rose 1.1 percent. Both banks are also among the creditors of HomeBanc. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 1.9 percent and France's CAC 40 up 1.2 percent. The airline sector also bounced back after last week's sell-off, with gains of 5.6 percent for British Airways, 3.1 percent for Air France KLM and 3.2 percent for Lufthan
