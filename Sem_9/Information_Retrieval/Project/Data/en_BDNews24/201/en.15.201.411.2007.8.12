<TITLE> The Madman emerges from his labyrinth </TITLE>

 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three years after abruptly resigning as Argentina coach and disappearing from public view, the mysterious, obsessive Marcelo Bielsa has emerged from his labyrinth. Bielsa, named as Chile coach on Friday, has rarely been seen in public since September 2004 and is believed to have spent his time confined to his farm outside Rosario, north of Buenos Aires, studying his vast library of footballing literature and videos. The glazed, tortured expression, the long-winded scientific explanations and the apparent absence of emotion, not to mention his background, have set the 52-year-old aside from his peers. Known as El Loco (The Madman), Bielsa, who was born into a successful, middle class family of lawyers and whose brother Rafael was until recently Argentina's foreign minister, uses words like logic and verticality when talking about the game. After Argentina lost on penalties to Brazil in the 2004 Copa America final, Bielsa baffled reporters with his views on the match. "It's clear that if the aim of today's game was to decide which of the two teams was best, the final position obtained was contradictory to what each of the teams produced," he said. "This presupposes not taking anything away from the opposition." Earlier in the competition, Bielsa even confused himself with one of his rambling explanations. Having spent five minutes trying to say why he preferred Argentina's opponents to attack rather than sit back and defend, Bielsa said: "I've just realised that not even I understand what I'm saying." Before accepting the Chile job, the meticulous Bielsa spent a weekend in Santiago where he conducted a thorough inspection of the team's headquarters to make sure that facilities were up to the standards he demands for his players. Since quitting Argentina, Bielsa has been linked with almost every major coaching vacancy which has arisen in Latin America. But, until now, he had always chosen to shun the limelight. Although tactics are Bielsa's big obsession, his qualities for dealing with problem players are more likely to be put to the test with Chile. Six key players, including captain Jorge Valdivia, have been handed 20-match suspensions by the Chilean Football Association for indiscipline, effectively ruling them out of the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign which starts in October. The previous year, Mark Gonzalez and Reinaldo Navia were both sent home from a European tour after directors said women had been found in their hotel room in Dublin. Although Chile's recent third-place finish at the World Youth Cup in Canada augurs a bright future, the senior team seems stuck in a rut, unable to rise above the bickering and bad behaviour. Recent results against Brazil show the size of the problem with Chile having lost by scores of 5-0, 4-0, 3-0 and 6-1 in the last two years. Bielsa will need more than his well-known tactical inventiveness to put them back on the rail
