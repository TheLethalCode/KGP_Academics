 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  A distinct low formed in the north-western Bay of Bengal as floodwaters continued receding all over the country Sunday. The low has prompted the Met office to ask the three maritime ports to raise local cautionary signal No. 3. A Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre bulletin said the overall flood situation has improved, but 12 rivers at 14 points were still flowing above the danger mark. The bulletin said the Bay low might cause light-to-medium rains or occasional heavy rains accompanied by temporary squally winds across Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Barisal, Sylhet and Rajshahi divisions. The day temperature may remain unchanged. Assistant meteorologist Naima Batin from the weather office told bdnews24.com they had noticed an obvious low in the northwestern region of the Bay. The river ports in the southern districts have been asked to hoist cautionary signal No. 2 and other river ports are to keep cautionary signal No. 1 hoisted. "The flood situation has improved. Water levels in eastern Dhaka and the contiguous areas are also falling, although water has yet to recede further to go below the red mark," FFWC assistant engineer Mostafa Sarwar told bdnews24.com by phone. It should take another week before the situation will be normal so that further rainfall was not going to worsen the flooding, he said. The river Balu at Demra point receded 7 cm and the Sitalakhshya at Narayanganj 5 cm and were flowing 20 and 14 cm above the danger level. The Turag at Mirpur and the Tongi canal at Tongi bridge point began to recede, and their waters were flowing 44 and 64 above the danger marks at the two points. The Kaliganga at Taraghat and the Dhaleswari at Jagir and Rikabi Bazar points were flowing 44, 51 and 50 cm above the danger level. The Jamuna receded 13 cm and was flowing 12 cm above the danger level at Aricha. The river is expected to recede further to get below the red mark in the next 24 hours. In the Ganges basin, the Padma receded 9 and 5 cm to flow 42 and 40 cm above the danger mark at Goalanda and Bhaggyakul points. The Kongsha in the Meghna basin receded 14cm at Jaria Janjail to flow 2 cm above the danger level. The Meghna receded 8 cm at Bhairab Bazar and was flowing at 35 cm there and 19 cm at Chandpur above the danger level. bdnews24.co
