<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League Sunday announced a plan to commemorate Aug 15, the day when a tiny group of army officers came out of the cantonment and assassinated independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, along with most of his family members 32 years ago. In a statement signed by the party's deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haque unveiled the low-key plan since a state of emergency is in force barring all political gatherings on streets. The programmes include hoisting the national and party flags at half-mast and flying black flags atop party offices and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at 5:30am. The initial activities will be followed by placing wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu in front of the museum complex at 8am. Special prayers will be offered at the graves of Bangabandhu's family members at Banani graveyard at 8.30am. At 1.30pm, milad mahfils will be organised in mosques and foods will be distributed among flood victims across the country. A team led by the party's industry and commerce secretary Faruq Khan and central working committee member Abdul Latif Siddiqui will lay wreaths at the grave of Bangabandhu in Tungipara of Gopalganj. The party's acting president Zillur Rahman and acting general secretary Mukul Bose have asked their activists to commemorate the day with due solemnity and dignity. bdnews24.c
