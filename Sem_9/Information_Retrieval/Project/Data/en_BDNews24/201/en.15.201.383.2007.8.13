 Narsingdi, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief Moeen U Ahmed Monday said that steps had been taken to involve the army in all work to stop corruption. "No-one can make allegations of relief theft as the relief materials are being distributed with the assistance of army personnel. This is a big achievement of this government," he said. General Moeen made the remark when he came to distribute relief among the flood-affected people in the outlying Mirzarchar union Monday. The army chief said the army would work alongside the civil administration in post-flood rehabilitation activities including building roads, bridges and culverts. "We will have to face the floods with combined efforts. Those who have food will have to help the flood victims with it," he said. He urged all to cooperate in combating the flood, irrespective of party or opinion. Later, the army chief distributed 10kg rice, 1kg soybean oil, half kg lentil, one packet powdered milk and 1kg sugar to each of the 300 families at Mirzarchar. Moeen also donated Tk 1,000 to each of the 15 families, all victims of river erosion. bdnews2
