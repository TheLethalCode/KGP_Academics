 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)Thousands of patients have stretched the limit of Dhaka's cholera hospital ICDDR,B that declared an "emergency" for the first time in its history as the number of daily admissions crossed a record 1,000 patients Saturday, a top official said. A special diarrhoea treatment centre, to be jointly run by ICDDR,B and army medical staff will be opened at the hajji camp in Uttara Monday to deal with the rising number of diarrhoea cases in the city. As the floodwaters have started to recede from the suburbs of the city the number of diarrhoea patients has risen alarmingly in the last few days. Authorities fear that the daily admissions may further increase, hospital staff told bdnews24.com Sunday. "This situation is worse than what we witnessed in the 1998 floods," said Dr Tahmeed Ahmed, head of the institution's nutrition department who is also treating patients as they flock to the hospital. The hospital, meanwhile, has already extended its bed capacity to accommodate the rising number of patients. Hospital authorities said they had already used its car parking areas to treat more patients. During the "emergency" all leaves, holidays and days off of the hospital staff members have been cancelled, so that they can tackle the soaring number of patients. "We expect that the number of admissions may again cross 1,000 today (Sunday)," said Dr Shahadat Hossain, head of one of the units. The hospital recorded the number of admissions at 683 until 4:40pm Sunday. Since the beginning of August, the hospital has treated a total of 7,197 patients bdnews24.com spoke to the mothers of some of the youngest patients of the hospital. As seven-month old Hasan cries out in pain, mother Rita says the infant has been suffering diarrhoea and vomiting. He has had no sleep since he was admitted Saturday night. In another crowded ward of the hospital, Laboni lies in bed looking pale next to her mother Hasina. In the last nine hours, the six-month-old has vomited at least five times. She was admitted suffering from severe dehydration. Like Laboni and Hasan, hundreds of patients are pouring into the only hospital where treatment is ensured for every admission. Most patients from the city's flood affected Syedabad and Lalbagh areas are afflicted with severe diarrhoea. Rozina, a young woman from Sabujbagh, told bdnews24.com: "Water is scarce where the floods have been. We have no scope to boil water, as there is no stove or fuel to be found. We drink ordinary tap-water wherever we find it." Rani Das from south Badda also tells how scarcity of clean water is at crisis point, leading to the huge number of diarrhoea cases throughout the country. "We are floating in water but there is no drinking water," Rani said. "Drinking water is hard to find in the flood areas." "The only place we can find drinking water is ordinary taps, which are often left abandoned as the people leave their house due to flooding." According to figures of the government's Health Directorate, 3,017 cases of diarrhoea have been reported in the last 24 hours, with one death. Five people have died of diarrhoeal disease since Aug 10. bdn
