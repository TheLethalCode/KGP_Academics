 NEW DELHI, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's prime minister has dared leftist allies to withdraw support for his government, saying in an interview published on Saturday that he will not go back on a civil nuclear energy deal with the United States. Manmohan Singh told top leaders of the communist parties, whose support is vital for his coalition government's survival, that the agreement was "an honourable deal" and will not be renegotiated. The left parties have rejected the agreement, finalised last month after two years of intense negotiations, saying it compromises India's nuclear sovereignty, is an unequal and unfair deal, and accepts American hegemony. "I told them that it is not possible to renegotiate the deal," Singh said in an interview with the Telegraph English-language national daily, referring to his conversation with the left's leaders earlier this week. "It is an honourable deal, the cabinet has approved it, we cannot go back on it. I told them to do whatever they want to do, if they want to withdraw support, so be it," he added. In a quick reaction, Sitaram Yechury, a senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) -- the largest in the left block -- said they have a right to protest. "Registering political protest is a legitimate right in a democracy," he told Reuters in southern Hyderabad city. "What we shall do further, my party and the left will decide soon." The nuclear agreement has to be approved by the U.S. Congress and the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group. It seeks to open full nuclear energy cooperation with energy-starved India after a gap of 30 years. This cooperation was suspended after India conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998. At present, nuclear energy fulfils only about three percent of India's energy requirement. If the deal is implemented, India, Asia's third-largest economy, would have access to nuclear fuel and reactors to augment its economy which has grown at an average of 8.6 percent over the last four years. India's Hindu nationalist opposition has also slammed the deal, for reasons more or less similar to those of the left. Singh is likely to make a statement in parliament on Monday against the backdrop of rising pressure on the government to put the deal to a parliament vote. Singh said the agreement "enlarges India's development options, particularly in regard to energy security and environmental protection, and it doesn't in any way affect our ability to pursue our nuclear weapons programme". "We have not surrendered an iota of our freedom in this regard; not an iota of our sovereignty," he added. Singh said he was "not angry but anguished" by the left's stand. "I don't get angry. I don't want to use harsh words. They are our colleagues and we have to work with them. But they also have to learn to work with us," the prime minister said.
