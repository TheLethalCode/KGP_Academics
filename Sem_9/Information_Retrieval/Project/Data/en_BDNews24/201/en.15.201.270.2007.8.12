<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Nature puts on one of her best shows this month with a spectacular meteor shower visible from the entire northern hemisphere. The only equipment anyone needs to enjoy this annual show is eyes, providing the clouds cooperate leaving a clear sky. Given the optimum conditions, the Perseid meteor shower can be enjoyed throughout the country from nightfall to sunrise during August, with the best time coming on the 12th and 13th of the month. Commonly known as 'shooting stars' these meteors are actually debris left behind as the Swift-Tuttle comet makes its 130-year orbit round the sun. At this time of year the earth is at its closest to the comets' path, during this period bits and pieces shower down into the atmosphere creating the bright streaks of light seen from the ground. Eminent astronomer and former head of applied physics at Dhaka University, Prof AR Khan said: "The meteor shower appears every year. When the comet's orbit comes closer to the earth, its dust enters the hemisphere creating the meteor shower." FR Sarkar of Bangladesh Astronomical Society said: "Such meteor showers occur from time to time, such as the Persius, Jaminide and Leonide displays. This year's meteor shower started July 24." "The shower will be at its height on Aug 12-13h due to the new moon's lack of light. The best time to watch the meteor shower will be in the evening and predawn periods." The Bangladesh Astronomical Association organises educational trips to watch meteor displays, BAS general secretary Mashhurul Amin Milan added: "We organised an outing by launch to watch the Leonide meteor shower from the Shitalakhya river. We planned to do the same this time. However we changed our minds due to the floods." bdnews
