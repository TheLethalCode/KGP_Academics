 SIPSON, England, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police were on alert on Monday as climate protesters set up a tent camp in a field next to London's Heathrow Airport, the world's busiest international air transport hub. The protesters plan a week of activities which they say will culminate on Sunday in 24 hours of "direct action" in a bid to force the government to halt the planned expansion of the airport, which they argue is adding to global warming. The protest comes at the height of the holiday season, three months after a blazing jeep was used to attack Glasgow airport and a year after police thwarted what they said was a plan to bomb airliners flying out of Heathrow to the United States. "The expansion of the airport just runs completely in the face of everything we know about climate change," said activist Tom James at the camp. "We are bringing totally unacceptable risks for future generations and people around the world." Banners urging a halt to airport expansion fluttered over the marquees and tents being erected on the site as supplies of fruit and vegetables were brought in. Organisers declined to say what the "direct action" from midday on Sunday would entail, but did say they would target British Airways and airport operator BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial . Local resident Tom Creeden said they were fighting a losing battle: "It is progress and it is needed. You have got to have a bigger airport and it might as well be here as anywhere else." Scientists say air transport contributes heavily to global warming, noting that the carbon dioxide and water vapour emitted at altitude are four times more potent than at sea level. The British government is committed to tackling climate change by cutting CO2 emissions but also backs a rapid expansion of air travel, which is set to double in the next 25 years. Police said around 250 protesters had already arrived at the camp, which is just to the north of the airport, directly in the path of a proposed third runway and close to BAA's headquarters. They said the site was quiet, and BAA said the airport was functioning normally. Organisers expect around 1,500 people to join the camp, even though torrential rain is forecast this week. Police said extra officers had been drafted in to deal with the anticipated protests at the weekend. Heathrow, which BAA says is the world's busiest international airport, handles an average of almost one flight a minute. Opened 60 years ago, it was designed to cater for 40 million passengers a year but already sees close to 70 million. August is the busiest month, with holidaymakers packing the four terminals. A fifth terminal is due to open next year. "Around 1.5 million passengers are due to pass through Heathrow during the week of the climate camp, many of them families on their summer holidays," a BAA spokesman said. "It is our responsibility to ensure that we do everything we can to guarantee their safety and comfort." A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said peaceful protest was a legitimate right but that any action to disrupt the operation of Heathrow would be "unacceptabl
