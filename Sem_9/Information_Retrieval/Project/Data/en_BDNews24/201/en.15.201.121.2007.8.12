<TITLE> AL won't mix politics with flood crisis: Razzak </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak said Sunday the party has no intention of mixing politics with the flood situation. The former water resources minister said: "The Awami League will not carry any party banners at this time. The people will understand when we go to them with relief." His remarks follow army chief Moeen U Ahmed's recent statement that politics must remain separate from the flood situation. Razzak said: "What the army chief said is his personal view. We are not in the habit of mixing politics with flood relief." "However, it is incorrect to say that politics should not continue at this time. The Awami League has always come forward during natural disasters or any other danger to the people." "This time we also planned to help a big way. But due to the ban on indoor politics we have been unable to do as much as we wanted." Razzak called for the ban on politics to be relaxed in view of the massive relief effort required across the country. "It must be ensured that those who want to extend a helping hand can do so without hindrance. The state of emergency has to be relaxed to some extent at the present time. "We have decided to participate in the relief effort at the party level. We are going into different areas with our teams. "However, there must be an assurance that those who wish to volunteer do not face any problems in the future," he said. "We have decided to help the flood victims in any way we can and have therefore requested party leaders and workers around the country to be prepared." Razzak has claimed that the government is not using an evenhanded policy on party banners. "The party was told that banners are not permitted. However, some parties are carrying banners during their relief work. The law must be equal for all. I think this is a failure of the government," he said. bdnews
