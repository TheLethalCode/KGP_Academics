 Shaugat Ali Sagor bdnews24.com North America Correspondent Toronto, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Canada has denied entry to 10 performers of NTV Close Up 1 from the US for alleged immigration irregularities. Conflicting details surfaced over what exactly led to the entry hitch as the members of a committee that arranged two shows in Canada have different views. The group was scheduled to perform in twin shows in Canada, but the immigration authorities reportedly sent them back to New York to catch a Bangladesh-bound flight because of "unauthorised overstay" in the US, a member of the committee in Toronto told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. Separately, two other members of the committee, Bappi and Mizan, said the US immigration officials had arrested the 10 members of Close Up 1 and jailed them for two days. Bappi and Mizan also said they were compelled to cancel the shows because of the arrests. Close Up 1 members Salma, Nishitha, Ronti, Pulak, Muhin, Badhan, Putul, Polash, Kishore and Sabbir took part in several musical shows in different cities of the US before they tried to enter Canada. They were scheduled to perform in Montreal and Toronto on Aug 11-12, but they failed to submit valid documents of overstay in the US at the immigration checkpoint along the Canada-US border late Friday. Abu Dara Zubayer, one of the organisers of the musical programme and community leader in Toronto, said Sunday that the performers were coming to Toronto on tourist visa. But Canadian immigration officials denied them entry, as they were coming here without having authorisation from the Canadian government for musical shows, which is mandatory, he said. But Ejaz Akhter Toufique, another community leader and organiser of the programme in Montreal, insisted that the singers had overstayed in the US with permission from the US authorities. But the original copies of approval were with a lawyer, and they could not satisfy immigration officials with enough documents immediately at the border post. "That's why they did not allow them to enter Canada," he said. Toufique brushed aside the claim that the immigration officials had arrested the singers. "They were just sent back to New York by next available bus," he said. Ataus Samad, chief executive officer of NTV, said: "What I know is, the team members had Canadian visa but it expired the same day as they sought entry into Canada." "To the best of my knowledge, they may have been refused entry." About the arrests by US authorities, Samad said: "I have no idea." bdnews
