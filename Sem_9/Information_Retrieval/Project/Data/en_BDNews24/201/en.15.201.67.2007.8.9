<TITLE> Aviva's new boss tackles M&A worries, floods dent H1 </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's largest insurer Aviva reported an 8 percent drop in first-half operating profit on Thursday as the cost of heavy floods in Britain weighed on its general insurance business and overshadowed growth in life. But the group beat a key profitability target for general insurance and new chief executive Andrew Moss sought to assuage worries over his aims and ambitions for acquisitions, telling investors the main concern was organic growth. "I've made a very firm statement that our top priority is to realise the full potential of our existing businesses," said Moss, the former finance director who took over as CEO in July. Bancassurance, however, will remain on the radar after 6 deals in the first-half added 30 million potential customers. "You shouldn't think we are not going to look for opportunities to expand... What that isn't, of course, is larger deals, which we don't think are a priority at this point." Worries over Aviva's appetite for acquisitions have dragged on the group since it made a failed takeover approach for UK rival Prudential last year and months later made a cash call to pay for U.S. insurer AmerUs. Since then, however, Aviva has largely accelerated growth on its own, with smaller deals. In his first presentation as chief executive, Moss gave an upbeat vision and said he would boost profitability, considering "options to maximise shareholder value" if he cannot turnaround underperforming units. Aviva's first-half operating profit, on a European embedded value basis, fell to 1.54 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) as a 34 percent drop in general insurance profits took the shine off a 24 percent jump in life. The group's profit was just shy of an average forecast of 1.57 billion, according to a Reuters poll, but within the range of market expectations. "The headline number is slightly disappointing, but only slightly," analyst Kevin Ryan at ING said. "The question is whether they will do something about the potential volatility of the non-life business. It's very much that that has derailed these numbers." Hit by 235 million pounds of weather losses after June's UK floods and January's Kyrill storm, operating profit from general insurance slid to 560 million pounds from 866 million. However, its closely watched combined operating ratio -- costs and claims as a percentage of premiums -- was 97 percent. That was worse than last year's 92 percent as weather and competitive pressures weighed, but beat expectations and was ahead of Aviva's "meet or beat" target of 98 percent, lifted by European results and reserve releases. A figure below 100 indicates an underwriting profit. Aviva said its position in the competitive UK motor market, where its Norwich Union unit broke ranks and raised prices last summer, was improving, as premiums rose an average 8 percent in the first half but competitors also raised prices. Operating profit at Aviva's life business rose 24 percent to 1.25 billion pounds, boosted by its U.S. unit, after it bought insurer AmerUs last summer, and sales growth in Europe. Stronger margins in Britain, the United States and Asia helped offset a dip in Europe, where Spain weighed. The group's overall first-half margin was unchanged at 3.5 percent and executives said later that was expected to remain stable. Group sales jumped 25 percent to 19.29 billion pounds, helped by a proforma 51 percent jump in its US business and by a 14 percent rise in sales in continental Europe, where it has signed a raft of distribution deals in the past few months. Capital efficiency is a major concern for insurers as Europe prepares to introduce Solvency II rules. Aviva expects to be a major beneficiary because the rules compensate groups that spread risks widely and said it would consider options around securitisation, still rarely used in the insurance industry. Aviva raised its interim dividend 10 percent, in line with expectations, to 11.9 pence, but dampened investor hopes that it could accelerate the payout. "We think a 10 percent increase in the dividend and the cash returns that our shareholders are seeing are very attractive and compare very favourably with companies in our sector and more broadly," Moss said, when asked whether the payout could rise. Aviva shares were trading flat at 705 pence at 1013 GMT, compared with a drop of 1.8 percent in the DJ Stoxx index of European insurance stoc
