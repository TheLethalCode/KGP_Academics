<TITLE> Ukraine PM resorts to "non-traditional medicine" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, gearing up for an election campaign, is undergoing "unconventional" medical treatment in a remote Russian region after a knee operation, a cabinet colleague said on Wednesday. First Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said Yanukovich was in Altai, a largely Buddhist area near ex-Soviet Central Asia, where non-traditional healing methods, often administered by "shamans", or spirit doctors, are often used. "He had a difficult operation and the recovery is also difficult. He consulted his doctors and was told about methods that are in use and he is now undergoing treatment," Azarov told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "Viktor Fyodorovich (Yanukovich) told me several times he intended to resort to unconventional medicine. There are doctors in Altai who skilfully use these methods for recovery after difficult operations." Yanukovich underwent knee surgery in Spain in May for a longstanding sports injury. The prime minister said last month he had been in great pain and sought medical advice abroad as sports medicine was undeveloped in Ukraine. His Regions Party leads opinion polls ahead of the September 30 parliamentary election, intended to end a long power struggle pitting him against President Viktor Yushchenko. Azarov said he did not know whether Yanukovich intended to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during his stay. Putin openly backed Yanukovich in the 2004 presidential election, eventually won by Yushchenko after Ukraine's Supreme Court declared the original poll rigged and ordered a re-run.
