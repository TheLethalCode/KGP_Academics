<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham made his long-awaited Major League Soccer debut on Thursday, causing few waves on the pitch but creating quite a stir in the stands. The Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder came on as a 72nd-minute substitute in the nationally televised game against D.C. United. Though neither side scored during Beckham's time on the pitch, giving United a 1-0 victory, it hardly mattered to the sold-out crowd of 46,686 at RFK Stadium. The 32-year-old England midfielder was cheered wildly each time he touched the ball. "It was a great reaction, very honouring," Beckham told reporters. "But it was also great for me to be back on the pitch. I'm happy to actually get out there and kick a soccer ball for 20 minutes." Beckham had been nursing a sore left ankle since playing 16 minutes in a friendly against Chelsea on June 21. While Beckham fans had been frustrated and disappointed he had not been playing over last three weeks, the player said he was not ready to return to the line-up. He admitted he played with "hesitation" on Thursday while trying to shake off the rust. "There was tenderness (in the ankle) and I'm sure there will be for a while because it's not an injury that just clears up and gets perfect right away," he said. "There's going to be a certain amount of reaction from it tomorrow. But it's a big forward step for me tonight. Getting 20 minutes, I was happy for that." STEADY RAIN Beckham entered the game in a steady rain, weather he had grown accustomed to back home. "My biggest concern was that those were the biggest raindrops I had ever seen," he joked. "They're much bigger than back home. That was more worrying than anything. "I think the rain made it fun. The majority of the fans were getting all wet and it made it a bit more enjoyable. I'm used to that from living in England. I like it when the ground is wet." Beckham first touched the ball in the 75th minute, prompting a roar from the crowd. A minute later, the midfielder launched a long-range shot and United goalkeeper Troy Perkins caught the ball comfortably to a combination of cheers and groans. The former England captain conceded the MLS was not ready to be compared with the top-flight European leagues. "Everybody knows that the standard is different, it's slightly lower than other places in the world," he said. "We're hoping to make this sport bigger and better here. "There's still a way to go, of course, but we're on the right track." Scores of number 23 Beckham shirts were in the crowd and dozens of banners, some as far-reaching as "Egypt Loves Becks," were hanging from the upper deck of the aging stadium. One of the world's most marketable athletes, Beckham shocked the soccer world this year when he announced he would be leaving Spanish giants Real Madrid for the Galaxy in a five-year deal that could net him up to $250 million. "Even though we lost the game tonight, we can take some good from it because we played better than we did against Toronto (a 0-0 draw)," Beckham said. "But we still lost the game, so we're disappointed. We had enough chances to win the game. But that's football. Sometimes you win, sometimes, you lose.
