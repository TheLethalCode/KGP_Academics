<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)The third Karnaphuli bridge will not be open to traffic before March as the construction of the connecting roads on both sides of bridge has been delayed. Only 81 percent of the works have been completed although the entire project was supposed to be complete by Dec 15, Oli Ahmed, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on planning ministry, said after visiting the bridge. He told reporters that the bridge could not be opened before March as the 8.5 km connecting roads were yet to be constructed. Ahmed added that there were faults in construction, which must be addressed before the prime minster inaugurated the key bridge. Recommendation will be made to fine the construction firm for the faults, he said. The construction of the bridge began on July 2006 at the cost of Tk 5.9 billion. bd
