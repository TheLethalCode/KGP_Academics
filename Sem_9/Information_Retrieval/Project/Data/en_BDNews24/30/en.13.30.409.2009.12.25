<TEXT>
 Gopalganj, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)--The verdict on the murder of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be executed in January, the commerce minister said on Friday. "Killings, coups and politics of conspiracy then will be banished from the country by starting the trial for the killing of four national leaders, war crimes and Aug 21 grenade attack cases," Faruque Khan said. On Nov 19, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences on the five former army officers, convicted for the Aug 15 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujib Rahman and family members. He was speaking as chief guest at a discussion to mark Victory Day in Muksudpur KG School playground, organised by Muksudpur Upazila Awami League. "The politics of killing began in the country through the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the subsequent passage of the indemnity bill," Khan said. "And then many politicians, freedom fighters and army officers were killed indiscriminately." He said Jamaat-e-Islami has been wrongly claiming that it also has freedom fighters in its ranks. But the fact is that they had tortured and killed freedom-loving people and freedom fighters during the nation's war against Pakistan in 1971. He said they directly opposed independence war, so they must be tried in the country. Muksudpur Upazila Awami League president Atiqur Rahman presided over the ceremony. bdn
