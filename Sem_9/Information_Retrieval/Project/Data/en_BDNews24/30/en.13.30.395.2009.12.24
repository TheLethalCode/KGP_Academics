<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  The government will not refund the money seized by the caretaker authority from businessmen during anti-graft drives, the finance minister said on Wednesday. A number of daily newspapers on Wednesday reported that the seized money will be returned. "The reports are motivated. The government is not considering returning the money," A M A Muhith told reporters in his reaction to the newspaper reports. "The money has already gone to the government exchequer. Once money is deposited there it requires budgetary allocation." On whether the government has any plan to send the money back following that process Muhith said: "We do not have any such consideration." The reports said the finance ministry asked Bangladesh Bank to give a list of the firms from which the money was collected. The minister said: "I did not have the full list. That does not mean that the money will be sent back." Muhith did not comment on the reports that illegally earned money amounting to Tk 1, 232 crore was seized during the caretaker government. bdnews24.
