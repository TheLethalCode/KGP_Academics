<TITLE> India moves to tighten visa rules </TITLE>

 MUMBAI, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plans to tighten rules for Indian visas following the recent arrest of a Chicago businessman alleged to have prior knowledge of the Mumbai attacks have led to confusion and complaints at the height of the tourist season. Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Wednesday there were gaps in the visa system, which were exposed in the case of Pakistan-born David Coleman Headley, accused of making five scouting trips to Mumbai for militant Pakistani groups. Headley allegedly used his associate's business as a cover during his trips to Mumbai. "The compelling need to create a fool-proof system cannot be overstated," said Chidambaram. A draft for new rules "for facilitating legitimate travellers and strengthening security" is likely to be ready early in 2010. Among the new rules is a proposal restricting travellers on long-term tourist visas from entering India within two months of their last departure from India, which has led to a storm of protests. The plan would be a blow for many tourists who use India as a hub to visit other countries in the region, as well as for some businessmen who use long-term tourist visas for regular trips to India to avoid red tape and paperwork delays. Foreign missions in India have complained of inconsistency and a lack of clarity in the new and proposed rules. "These new visa and registration regulations are being implemented inconsistently and are not finalised," the U.S. Mission in India said in a notice on its website, adding it had received complaints from several Americans about the new rules. Local media reported British Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, on a recent visit to India, raised the issue with Chidambaram. "We understand the Indian government is reconsidering its plans. We have written to the government asking for some clarifications," a British High Commission official said. There are signs the government may reconsider. The Indian Express paper reported on Thursday the government will allow foreigners to return to India within two months as long as they make a full disclosure of their travel plans. The move comes on the heels of limits on business visas earlier in the year: India said those working in the country on business visas needed employment permits, which affected hundreds of Chinese engineers working on power projects in the country. On the latest proposal, travel firms hopeful of greater tourist arrivals into the country after the economic downturn and the Mumbai attacks last year, are awaiting clarity. "We have not heard anything yet from the government. A lot of things can change, so we will wait before we issue any guidelines," said a spokesman for Cox and Kings India.
