 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)The BNP might not also join the fourth session of parliament if "vilification" of party leaders is not stopped and a congenial environment not created, secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Sunday. Delwar said: "They (Awami League leaders) are vilifying Ziaur Rahman, Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman both inside and outside of parliament. BNP will join parliamentary sessions if a proper environment is established. We have said it earlier, and are saying it again that we want to attend parliament." The BNP secretary general was speaking at a press conference at the party's central office. He was critical of the government's 'failure'. "The government is doing nothing for the welfare of the people. No scope for employment is created. Labour market in foreign countries has shrunk. "We want to help the government. But if they failed to resolve those problems, we will be forced to launch a movement with the people." Regarding the 'slander' against Tarique, he said, "Party councillors have elected him senior vice-chairman. They (AL leaders) are speaking against Tarique Rahman for no reason. The people of the country will not allow this." The main opposition party urged them to stop character assassination of Zia, Khaleda, and Tarique and advised them to "mind your own business." "Work for the wellbeing of the country. Do not sign any deal with the neighboring country that goes against Bangladesh's interest," he said in reference to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's forthcoming visit to India. Delwar criticised the government decision to rename the Zia International Airport and demanded withdrawal of cases against the BNP leaders. Among others, BNP standing committee member MK Anwar, Mirza Abbas, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir were present at the conference. bdn
