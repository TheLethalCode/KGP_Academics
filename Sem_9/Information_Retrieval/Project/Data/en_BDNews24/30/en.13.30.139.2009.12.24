 Bogra, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Bogra assistant sub inspector of police was sent to jail on Thursday after his arrest on charges of cheating a businessman. "The accused ASI Mizanur Rahman was arrested in a case filed by his colleague, another ASI, Roksana Khatun and then he was sent to jail," Bogra police superintendent Humayun Kabir said. Bogra police chief Jahangir Hossain was also temporarily suspended from duty for his suspected role with the case of fraud, Kabir said. The case details say trader Akbar Hossain from Thakurgaon, carrying Tk 42,000 in cash after selling potatoes in Dhaka markets, boarded a night bus for his home district on Tuesday. The bus reached Bogra at 2am, where Akbar decided to break his journey. Feeling insecure with a large amount of cash, the trader went to the main police station and asked duty officer Mizanur Rahman to keep it safe. However, Mizanur reportedly refused to return the money Wednesday morning. The 55-year-old Akbar subsequently attempted to commit suicide twice, trying to cut his throat with a broken piece of glass, the case details added. Akbar was admitted into Bogra Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital. b
