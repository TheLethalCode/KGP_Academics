 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)---Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has said people have no cause for celebration in the face of soaring prices of essentials and deteriorating law and order situation. "The country is beset with many problems, so let us work together to propel the country forward by solving the problems," the BNP chairperson said Saturday when a delegation of the Christian Association came to convey Christmas and New Year greetings. A delegation of 100 members led by Christian Association president Arnold Arun Gomez called on Khaleda at her Gulshan office. Greeting the delegation, Khaleda said, "We observe Christmas every year." Khaleda and the delegation cut a Christmas cake to celebrate the occasion. She said she regarded Bangladesh as a country of communal harmony. "We all, people of different religions, are living in peace though many countries of the world are marked by communal strife." Khaleda urged the Christian community to stand by her in different movements as they had in the past. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and standing committee member ASM Hannan Shah were also present. b
