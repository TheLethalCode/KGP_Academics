 Narayanganj, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Three people of a family, including a 4-year-old, died in a fire at a slum in Narayanganj town early on Thursday, police said. The fire injured another 20 people and completely gutted around 70 dwellings. Narayanganj police chief Akhter Hossain said the fire at Rallibagan shanty of the town's Tanbazar area broke out at around 3am. Fire fighters managed to douse the blaze after about two hours. But Narayanganj Fire Brigade deputy assistant Ahsanul Kabir said they faced difficulties in reaching the fire as the entrance to the slum was very narrow. The dead have been identified as 25-year old Moni Rani, her 4-year old son Kishore Chandra and 65-year old mother Mono Rani. Rani and Kishore are survived by husband and father Krishna, a garments trader, neighbours said. Local police chief Hossain said the fire broke from a single dwelling house. "It may have originated from electric short circuit or a mosquito coil." He also said there were televisions and refrigerators in almost every house in the slum, with tens of thousands of taka worth of property lost. Narayanganj-5 MP Nasim Osman gave Tk 50,000 to the family of the dead. Narayanganj deputy commissioner gave Tk 5,000 to the deceased's family, and Tk 500, 20 kg rice and a blanket to each of the injured. bdnew
