 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission reportedly caught a senior WASA official in the act of taking a bribe on Sunday. Dhaka WASA Zone-1 inspector Mizanur Rahman, and assistant pump officer Bashir Ahmed Talukder, were arrested from a drug store, ACC deputy director Mohammad Rafiquzzaman told bdnews24.com. Rafiquzzaman said complainant Zahirul Huq, of Moddho Basabo, received a water bill of Tk 59,952 a few months ago. Inspector Mizanur Rahman allegedly proposed an illegal payment Tk 18,000 for the "correction" of the bill to just Tk 2,000. "Zahirul informed us about the matter," the ACC official said. "According to the plan, the amount was supposed to be handed over Sunday at Shihab Drug Store at Dokkhin Basabo. We arrested the two with the help of RAB." Rafiquzzaman said the two WASA officials had been handed over to Sabujbagh police and preparation for filing a case was underway. Sabujbagh police chief Mohammad Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com the case was likely to be filed that night. bdn
