 TEHRAN, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A reformist website said Iranian riot police fired tear gas to disperse opposition supporters who used a religious mourning ceremony on Saturday to try to revive anti-government protests in the Islamic Republic. "Police are firing tear gas to disperse a huge crowd in Imam Hossein square ... but people are resisting and chanting slogans against the government," the Jaras website reported. The same website earlier on Saturday said security forces "fiercely" confronted opposition backers in different parts of the capital. The report could not be independently confirmed, as foreign media have been banned from covering protests. "Riot police are fiercely confronting the opposition supporters in different parts of Tehran ... they (the police) are also breaking windows of cars passing the area," Jaras said. Six months after a disputed election plunged Iran into political turmoil, tension has again mounted in the major oil producer after death a week ago of leading dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri at the age of 87. Montazeri's death occurred in the tense run-up to Ashura on December 27, a politically important Shi'ite religious commemoration that offers the opposition another opportunity to show its strength. That day coincides with the seventh day of mourning for Montazeri, when more memorial services are usually held. On Ashura, Shi'ite Muslims commemorate the 7th century death of Imam Hossein in a battle that sealed the schism between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims. Hossein was a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad. Religious ceremonies are also traditionally held across Iran on the day before Ashura, called Tasoua.
