<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)National flag carrier Biman will not be able to relaunch its Dhaka-New York flight this year as planned, with officials citing lack of aircraft as the reason. Civil aviation ministry officials Sunday told a parliamentary body that Biman may resume the flight sometime in January or February after getting an aircraft on lease. "The ministry officials have informed us that Biman will not be able to operate the Dhaka-New York route due to unavailability of leased aircrafts," Mosharraf Hossain, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on civil aviation, told bdnews24.com after a meeting at the parliament building. The national flag carrier is expecting to secure one plane sometime in January or February, Moinuddin Khan Badal, a member of the committee, said quoting Biman officials. He said Biman would get another aircraft in March. "The airline said it will set a date for resuming of the route after managing an aircraft early next year," Badal said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina in September this year called for resumption of the Dhaka-New York flight as soon as possible to meet the demand of Bangladeshi expatriates in the US. Biman invited tenders to lease aircraft earlier this year in a bid to launch the route by October. But it failed to secure any new planes so far. TROUBLED FLIGHT The airline introduced its New York flight in December 1993 with one flight a week. This was gradually increased to three a week in June 2000. Operations on the route were suspended in July 2006 as the national airline was incurring financial losses of around Tk 40 lakh on each flight, while its fleet was also suffering from a shortage of aircraft, officials say. However, observers say the popular New York flights should not have been loss-making as there were so many passengers. Corruption and mismanagement have been blamed for the losses. CHALLENGE IN HIGH COURT Meanwhile, a petition is pending in the High Court challenging the planned relaunch of the "loss-making flight". The public interest petition was filed by a barrister Masud Reza Sobhan on Nov 4. Sobhan has said: "The Biman authorities plan to re-introduce the Dhaka-New York-Dhaka flight only for the uplift of our image abroad, in spite of the fact that it incurred heavy losses in the past." "Biman must be held responsible for incurring losses to the national exchequer of Tk 62.40 crore a year just to save the image of the government." The High Court issued a rule nisi on the government and Biman Bangladesh Airlines last month to explain its plans to resume the flight
