 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)Stock markets turned bullish as they extended their rally by nearly two percent on Tuesday when investors found shares lucrative following recent fall. Dhaka stock's benchmark, DGEN or the general index gained 79.46 points or 1.83 percent to finish at 4408.95 while the Chittagong Stock Exchange's CSCX or the selective categories index ended on 829.3071, rising 143.35 points or 1.75 percent. On opening of the week, Dhaka stocks suffered huge losses when they fell nearly two percent. It, however, recovered Monday as the indices edged up. Market analysts said investors were mainly trying to take a position by buying more shares that they already had. "Most investors did not buy anything new rather went for more similar shares which they were holding," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. However, investors' participation is low, which is evident from the meager turnover of Tk 6.33 billion on the prime bourse, he added. The top official of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh said that the buying spree might have occurred as investors has some cash. "Investors recently, got refund of the money that was stuck as IPO subscriptions, leading them to go for buying." The day saw about 86 percent of the traded scrips on the bourses rising. Gainers outnumbered losers 199 to 35 with one scrip remaining unchanged at the DSE while out of the 154 issues traded at the CSE, 136 advanced and 18 declined.
