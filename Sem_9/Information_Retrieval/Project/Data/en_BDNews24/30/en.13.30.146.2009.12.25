 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court passed an order for further investigation on a 19-year old murder case in Mymensingh in which Major (retd) Bazlul Huda, one of the death sentenced convicts in Bangabandhu murder case, along with 29 others, is accused. Dhaka's Second Speedy Trial Tribunal judge Md Asgar Ali on Thursday passed the order and also asked the Kotwali Police of Mymensingh to submit the report by February 1. The case was transferred to the Dhaka's Second Speedy Trial Tribunal two months earlier as an 'important case' for finalising it immediately. The case had been stayed for long by the High Court. Special PP at the second tribunal Rafiqul Islam Benu said he asked for further investigation as no testimonies were taken in this case in the Mymensingh court and even the chargesheet was submitted without scrutinising the names and addresses of the accused. From the certified copy of the case chargesheet, it was found that the convicts, with arms in their possessions, were taking tea at a roadside stall in front of the Freedom Party office near Purabi cinema hall in the Mymensingh town on the evening of Feb 11, 1990. One of the convicts, Major (retd) Zainal Abedin, the then Ameer of Islami Andolon, ordered others to fire on the curious people who gathered to see them with arms. One pedestrian, 'Harun', was shot dead. Mosharraf Hossain Bablu, brother of the deceased, filed a case against 30 with the Kotwali Police Station following the shootout. S M Rafiqul Islam, special public prosecutor of the Fourth Speedy Trial Tribunal, said arms were seized from several convicts, including Abedin. On July 10 the same year, assistant police superintendent Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury pressed the charges with the District Magistrates' Court in Mymensingh. Later, the case was transferred to District Judicial Court. Huda is currently held in the condemned cell at Dhaka Central Jail. Abedin is also in jail while another Md Ashraful is in prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, Mohammad Hafizur Rahman, counsel for the accused told bdnews24.com. An arms case was also filed against 23 people. Testimonies of eight people for the prosecution were taken at the Mymensingh court on the case so far. PP for the case said further investigation into the case might be required and the court set Dec 30 for taking testimony on the case. In both the cases, Huda has been mentioned as vice president of Freedom Party. bd
