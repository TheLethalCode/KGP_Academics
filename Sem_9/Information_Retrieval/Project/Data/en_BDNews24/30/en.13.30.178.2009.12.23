<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith has hinted at lowering the proportion of paid-up capital in offloading of a company share to prop up the stock market. On November 5, the finance ministry decided that from now on a company will have to go for launching initial public offering (IPO) with minimum of 40 percent of its paid up capital. The decision drew criticism from the bourse authorities saying it would hinder the market growth. "We will reconsider the decision in the interest of the market," AMA Muhith told reporters Wednesday at the ministry after a meeting with a delegation of the Chittagong Stock Exchange headed by its president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. The delegation proposed fixation of 25 percent as IPO of a company paid-up capital worth between Tk 50 crore and Tk 500 crore while 15 percent for a company paid-up capital Tk 500 crore, according to a statement provided by the CSE. On the issue of offloading share of public companies in the stock market, Muhith said that the government was trying its best to speed up the process. He said, "Although the government is trying to offload shares of state-owned entities it is not getting the pace due to the delay created by such companies themselves." The delegation also told the minister to approve launching of mutual funds (MFs) as per the existing rules. The finance ministry directed the capital market regulator not to approve launching of a couple of MFs at a time, rather go slow and allow them in phases. "Investors will bent upon more on mutual funds if they enter into the market at a time," he said in response to a question. In a written proposal, the CSE said the decision of not allowing private companies for direct listing would hamper the growth of the market as the government is considering the private sector as an important partner for economic development.
