<TITLE> Pacquiao to sue Mayweathers in doping row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA (Reuters) - Manny Pacquiao plans to sue Floyd Mayweather, the American's father and Golden Boy Promotions in the next few days following a row over doping procedures, the Filipino world champion said in a statement on Friday. "Enough is enough. These people, Mayweather Sr., Jr., and Golden Boy Promotions, think it is a joke and a right to accuse someone wrongly of using steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs," Pacquiao was quoted as saying. "I have tried to just brush it off as a mere pre-fight ploy but I think they have gone overboard," he added in the statement posted on his official website (www.mpboxing.com). The WBO welterweight title bout between Mayweather Jr and champion Pacquiao scheduled for next March was called off this week after the American demanded Olympic-style dope testing and Pacquiao said on Friday his reputation had been damaged enough. "I have instructed my promoter, Bob Arum, head of Top Rank Inc., to help me out in the filing of the case as soon as possible because I have had people coming over to me now asking if I really take performance-enhancing drugs and I have cheated my way into becoming the No. 1 boxer in the world," he said. "I maintain and assure everyone that I have not used any form or kind of steroids and that my way to the top is a result of hard work, hard work, hard work and a lot of blood spilt from my past battles in the ring, not outside of it." "I have no idea what steroids look like and my fear in God has kept me safe and victorious through all these years," added the 31-year-old Filipino who has never tested positive. BLOOD TESTS Mayweather's camp had called for random blood and urine sampling prior to and after the highly anticipated March 13 fight as mandated by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency. Pacquiao agreed to have blood taken for testing before the initial media conference and immediately after the fight but would not agree to have blood drawn within 30 days of the bout. Arum said on Wednesday using blood tests was unprecedented for professional fights in Las Vegas but more extensive testing agreeable to Pacquiao could have been arranged. "We don't object to more extensive drug testing, even though it's certainly not required in Nevada," he told Reuters. "What we're saying is that the drug testing he (Mayweather) is proposing is intrusive and would disturb Pacquiao's training if it's done within 30 days of his fight." Arum had suggested the testing demands by Mayweather were a way of ducking a fight in which Pacquiao was due to defend the World Boxing Organisation title he won in November by stopping holder Miguel Cotto in the 12th round in Las Vegas. Pacquiao (50-3-2) won an unprecedented seventh title in seven weight classes to set up the best pound-for-pound showdown against unbeaten Mayweather (40-0) in what was expected to be among boxing's biggest revenue-producing figh
