 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)--Prices of rice, lentil, edible oil and coarse flour are on the rise for the past few days. Masur lentil was selling from Tk 95 to 140 per kg, depending on the varieties, and coarse rice from Tk 25 to 28 per kg at kitchen markets in Dhaka on Friday. Packed coarse flour was climbed up to Tk 26 a kg. "We will not be able to say about rice because it is the concern of the food ministry. But we are investigating the price increase of lentil," said Mostafa Mohiuddin, additional secretary at the commerce ministry. "Wholesalers are selling lentil that costs Tk 103 at Tk 114. And then the retailers are making further profits," he said. Nepal has stopped exporting lentil since August, he said, explaining the price hike. "Recently, after bilateral talks between the two countries Nepal agreed to export 15,000 metric tonnes of lentil," he added. The website of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh displays the price of products at retail markets on Dec 18. The website shows per kg masur lentil is from Tk 85 to 138 (the price increased 9.85 percent in one month), coarse rice from Tk 24 to 25 (it increased 6.52 percent in one month), packed coarse flour from Tk 23 to 25 (it increased 11.63 percent in one month). The price of all kinds of rice increased from Tk 3 to 4 per kg in the last one week, said Harun-ar-Rashid, owner of Dinajpur Rice Agency at the New Super Market in capital Dhaka. Rashis is a wholesale and retail seller. "I am selling fine masur lentil at Tk 140 per kg and coarse lentil at Tk 120 per kg," said Sameer Kumar, a grocer at Hatirpool kitchen market. Retailer Nurul Islam at Mohammedpur Town Hall Market said that he is selling the other two types of masur at Tk 95 and Tk 115. "I am selling coarse rice between Tk 26 and 30 and miniket rice between Tk 34 and 38 per kg," said Siddiqur Rahman, a rice seller at Hatirpool. The price of per litre packed soybean oil and per kg packed coarse flour rose up to Tk 5, according to retail traders. The price of powdered milk is also upward, they said. However, the price of potato, egg and winter vegetables went down, said sellers. Before the Eid-ul-Azha, potato was Tk 28 to 32 per kg which is now selling at Tk 24 to 25; a hali of four eggs is now selling at Tk 22-23 which was Tk 26-28.
