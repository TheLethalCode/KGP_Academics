 Golam Mortuja Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)The green light flashes at the traffic intersection at Asad Gate in Dhaka, but the bus waiting at the head of a long, snaky line of vehicles does not move. The driver cranks the engine in an attempt to start it, but nothing happens. The cars behind honk their horns. The traffic policeman approaches, drumming loudly on the bus body with his baton, urging the driver to move on. The passenger bus of Rajdhani Paribahan runs on Mohammadpur-Motijheel. Such a scene takes place in the city streets very often. Vehicles now and then catch fire after engines or gas cylinders leak out. Bangladesh Road Transport Authority issues fitness certificate for vehicles, but they are saying many unfit vehicles are running in the city streets, but police are reluctant. But, police say that unfit vehicles are receiving fitness certificates and so they can not do anything. In the first week of the current month, three vehicles caught fire in Bangla Motor, Motijheel and Mirpur Road areas, but no casualties took pace. Shafiqur Rahman, chief joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, alleged that BRTA is negligent about issuing vehicles with fitness certificates. "We can sue the unfit vehicle owners if they cannot show us the fitness certificates. We are helpless when they have those," he told bdnews24.com. "BRTA issues fitness certificates without proper checking. We have informed BRTA and even its chairman of this, but to no avail." BRTA director (operations) Syed Iftekhar Hossain refuted the allegation. He told bdnews24.com, "We are checking all vehicles quite rigorously before issuing fitness chits." "Well, many vehicles are returned by our inspectors too. "It is the BRTA that issues the faulty vehicles with the required clearance without which they cannot hit the city roads." BRTA will publish the particulars of vehicles in operation without fitness certificates in newspapers soon, asking the offenders to obtain the required clearance within a given date or face the law, he said. A former BRTA chairman told bdnews24.com, "That BRTA issues fitness chits without proper checking is both a lie and a truth. Yes, perhaps BRTA issues some vehicles with fitness certificates in exchange for cash bribes." "But there are ramshackle vehicles that do not care about coming to BRTA at all for anything. They manage the police on their own and operate vehicles even on daily payments." Especially the CNG-run vehicles go dysfunctional just anywhere because of bad maintenance and lack of timely repair, people involved with the matter say. DMP traffic police chief Shafiqur Rahman said, "DMP personnel have been trying their best to ease the traffic gridlocks in Dhaka city. A moving vehicle going out of order in the middle of the road only aggravates such jams, it is needless to say that. In such cases, police cannot do anything else but tow the vehicle away." Though CNG-fuelled vehicles are not supposed to emit any smoke, one often finds buses and black cabs profusely spewing black smoke. Vehicle drivers, owners, engineers experienced in converting petrol-run motor vehicles into CNG-operated ones say that most vehicular dysfunctions stem from engines. The use of compressed natural gas as motor fuel cause engines to get overly heated fast, they say, requiring the CNG-run vehicles maintained on a more frequent and regular basis. Ilias Uddin, service engineer at Navana CNG Conversion Centre, Tejgaon, said, "A bus owner never even enquires into his vehicle's condition for months after an oil-filter-fan belt change or servicing." "For example, the lube oils supposed to be changed for every 5,000 kilometres run are not changed until the vehicle has done 15,000 or 20,000 kilometres. " Air filters are not cleaned regularly. The radiator receives carbon residues and the passages of the cooling system get clogged. "Water in the radiator is not changed, water level goes unchecked, fan belts loosen and the engine gets to be over-heated. It's all due to bad or no maintenance. "Because the CNG run engines produce maybe only five percent more heat compared with the other engines." On gas cylinder related accidents, he said, "To save money on petrol-to-CNG conversion, specially for commercially operated vehicles, it is common practice to use low quality or time-expired cylinders, which lead to fatal accidents including explosions and fire mishaps." "The vehicle owners do only one thing religiously and unfailingly and that is counting their profits, that is the daily rentals. They are just not bothered about fixing the dysfunctions," said an exasperated Ali Hossain, a bus driver. Ali Imran, a bus conductor said, the drivers and other staff operate most buses on a daily rental basis, which is why the owners do not take any interest in repairing the emergent disorders. The contract operators also find it futile to spend money on vehicles owned by another person. bdnew
