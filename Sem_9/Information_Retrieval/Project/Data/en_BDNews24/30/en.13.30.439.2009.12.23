 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the country's armed forces will be further strengthened, while maintaining good relations with neighbouring countries. She also urged the armed forces to remain alert against any threat to the country's security, in a speech at the 11th graduation ceremony of the National Defence College at Mirpur Cantonment on Wednesday. "I hope you'll always be engaged in collecting and analysing information," the prime minister said. The prime minister said, "Bangladesh has succeeded combating terrorism while the blame of militancy is also washed away. "Terrorism and militancy, which violate human rights and hit humanity, are bars to the development of many countries. These days, it's not possible to keep eyes closed when the sovereignty of a country is under threat." Hasina said, "No country can run alone these days. The situation now is that everyone has to move with cooperation of the others. HASINA CLAIMS 'CLEAN SLATE' Regarding her government's first year, the prime minister said, "None could lodge a complaint of corruption against any minister in this time," which she termed the 'maximum success' story. Mentioning her government's strict stand against corruption, Hasina said, "We'll continue the anti-corruption drives. Corruption bars the development of a country's economy." "The government is sincerely working for the socio-economic development of the country." "We've work together to fight poverty," she urged. The prime minister said, "Trial of the war criminals will be launched immediately while those involved in BDR mutiny and killing will also be tried." Regarding her recent participation in the Copenhagen Climate Conference she said, "In the conference I highlighted the situation of vulnerable countries where I also demanded for raising an international fund for the affected countries to fight the situation." bd
