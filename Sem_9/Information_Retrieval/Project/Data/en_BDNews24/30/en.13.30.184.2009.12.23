<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP will join the winter session of parliament, beginning from January 4, if the government creates a congenial environment. "We want to go back to parliament. We will return to the House if the government takes the initiative to create an environment for us," BNP senior joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told a briefing on Wednesday. "BNP wants to establish democracy in the country, it does not want to destroy democracy," he said. Alamgir alleged the government did not want to create an environment for them to return to the House even after BNP expressed its willingness to go back to parliament. "This is clear from their activities in last one year," he said. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain already hinted that they would not join parliament until the government stopped vilification campaign against Ziaur Rahman, Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman and harassment on the opposition party. BNP has been refraining from attending parliament sessions after the first session over a row over seat arrangement in the House.
