 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  The plenary session of the World Climate Summit is still ongoing on Saturday to reach a consensus. The session started at 11am on Friday. US president Barack Obama and other heads of state and government gave speeches on Friday. Barack Obama held talks with delegates of the developing countries including India, China and Brazil during a break on the day. He told a press briefing after the meeting that they had reached an agreement on signing a deal. The summit was supposed to end at 6pm with the delegates finishing their discussions and a decision on Copenhagen declaration, but it was cancelled at 5pm. The Tuvalu delegate who spoke first at the plenary session after the recess said this deal is being done bypassing a UN blueprint for fighting global warming. "I regret to inform you that Tuvalu cannot accept this document," said Ian Fry of the low-lying Pacific island state that fears rising sea levels. At the spillover night session in Copenhagen after most leaders left, he said that a goal in the document for limiting global warming to a maximum rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times was too lax. African countries including Venezuela denounced the accord, saying it would not help address global warming and was unfairly worked out behind closed doors at the December 7-18 conference. Lumumba Di-Aping, the Sudanese negotiator, said none can compel them to sign the draft deal. The Maldives president, Mohamed Nasheed, who has been playing a strong role throughout the session, said in the plenary session he had consistently been opposing the accord. But, he said, they can sign it at least for the sake of a declaration, considering the overall situation. Nicaragua and Bolivia also opposed the accord. Ainun Nishat, a Bangladesh delegate, in his speech said they should continue talks to reach an agreement. Earlier on Friday, state minister for forest and environment ministry Hasan Mahmud speaking on the draft declaration said initially many agenda concerning the least developed countries were not included in the accord. A number of conditions have been added later in the face of Bangladesh's demand, he said. Another Bangladesh delegate, who took part in the talks, said though 25 countries prepared the controversial accord the US, India, China, Brazil and South Africa finalised it. European Union wanted to agree on a number of conditions including a cap on the annual temperature rise beyond 1.5 degree Celsius, but could not do in the face of China's veto. bdnews
