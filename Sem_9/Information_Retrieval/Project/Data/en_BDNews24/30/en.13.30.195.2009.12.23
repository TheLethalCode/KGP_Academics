 WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An American Airlines Boeing 737 overshot the runway while landing at the international airport in Kingston, Jamaica on Tuesday night, causing 40 injuries but no fatalities, a local newspaper reported. "The injured passengers have been taken to the Kingston Public Hospital," Jamaican Information Minister Daryl Vaz told the Jamaica Observer. "There are no reports of fatalities." The Jamaica Gleaner newspaper said three of the injured were seriously hurt. An FAA spokeswoman told Reuters the plane was American Airlines flight 331 from Miami. The flight originated in Washington DC. The plane crashed and broke in two after landing, Fox News said on its website, quoting local reports. The Jamaica Observer newspaper said the plane arrived in pouring rain at around 10 p.m. local time and overshot the runway. CNN.com quoted Omar Lawrence, the airport's operations coordinator, as saying there were 145 passengers and seven crew members aboard. One passenger, Natalie Hendricks, called her brother in law in Orlando and reported there were no fatalities, the Miami Herald said on its website.
