<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Mauritius on Monday signed an agreement on avoidance of double taxation and fiscal evasion, says a foreign ministry press statement. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and her Mauritian counterpart Arvin Boolell signed the deal in the island nation's capital Port-Louis, said the statement. "The foreign minister held fruitful discussion with high officials of the government of Mauritius regarding the issue of 12,000 Bangladeshi workers staying there," the statement said. In July this year, Mauritius ordered some 6,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers to leave the country as a move to absorb the shock of global economic meltdown. According to expatriates' welfare ministry, some 12,000 Bangladeshis work in the apparel industry of Mauritius, a tourism-driven tiny country in the Indian Ocean near Africa's Madagascar. Dipu Moni reached Port-Louis on Monday morning from Dubai to discuss the labour issues with her counterpart there. She will return home Tuesday night via Dubai ending her first-ever tour of the country.
