 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will fly to Delhi on Jan 10 for a four-day visit to India, foreign minister Dipu Moni has said. The foreign minister told reporters that Sheikh Hasina would discuss issue of sharing water of the common river Teesta. "We are in negotiation on Teesta water sharing. The Indian water resources secretary is coming to Bangladesh on Jan 3 to expedite the negotiation," Dipu Moni told a press briefing at the foreign ministry. Teesta is important to Bangladesh as its largest irrigation project is dependent on the common river. Bangladesh Water Development Board sources say over 750,000 hectares of land is irrigated by the Teesta. Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to visit New Delhi earlier this month, but the trip was deferred as both she and her Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh were attending the crucial climate change conference in Copenhagen.
