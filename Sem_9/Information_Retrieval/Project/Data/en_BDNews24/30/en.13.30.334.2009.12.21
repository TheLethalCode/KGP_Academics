 TEHRAN, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Huge crowds of Iranians chanted anti-government slogans during the funeral of leading dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom on Monday, websites reported. Montazeri, who died late on Saturday aged 87, was viewed as the spiritual patron of an opposition movement that blossomed after a disputed presidential election in June and has proved resilient despite repeated efforts to suppress it. Violence flared when security forces around Montazeri's house clashed with stone-throwing protesters, the reformist website Norooz said. There was no immediate official comment. The report could not be verified independently since foreign media were banned from reporting directly on protests and were told not to travel to Qom for Montazeri's funeral. The reformist website Jaras said hundreds of thousands of people joined a procession for Montazeri, an architect of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah. He later became a fierce critic of its present hardline leadership. "Innocent Montazeri, your path will be continued even if the dictator should rain bullets on our heads," they chanted. Iran's internal unrest, highlighted by Montazeri's arguments that the leadership had lost its legitimacy, has complicated a long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear programme, which the West believes may have military ends, not just civilian purposes. The cleric's death from a heart attack occurred at a tense moment when the government was seeking to choke off any attempt to use the run-up to the Shi'ite religious occasion of Ashura next Sunday to stage large-scale protest rallies. Shouts of "Oh Hossein, Mirhossein" also rose from mourners near Iran's second holiest shrine, many wearing green wristbands to mark support for opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi. Their cries echoed traditional Ashura laments for Hossein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, killed in a 7th-century battle that sealed the schism between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims. Ashura, a key occasion in the Islamic Republic's calendar, will coincide with the seventh day of mourning for Montazeri, making it harder for authorities to keep people off the streets. Riot police were out in force in Qom, 125 km (80 miles) south of Tehran, ahead of the funeral of the senior Shi'ite cleric who had been a thorn in the establishment's side. Pro-government Basij militiamen shouted: "Shame on you hypocrites, leave the city of Qom," said the Ayande website, seen as close to conservative politician Mohsen Rezaie. Mourners chanted back: "What happened to the oil money? It went to the Basijis." The reformist Kaleme website said crowds had shouted: "Today is the day of mourning and the green Iranian nation is the owner of this mourning," referring to the opposition colour. Mourners carried pictures of Montazeri and of another Qom-based dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Yusuf Sanei. MOURNING FOR MONTAZERI Opposition figures declared a national day of mourning for Montazeri, who was named in the 1980s to succeed revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini but was shunted aside after he criticised mass executions of prisoners. Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini after he died in 1989, expressed his condolences, but said he asked God to forgive Montazeri over a "difficult and critical test" that he faced towards the end of Khomeini's life, ISNA news agency said. Khamenei made it clear he believed Montazeri failed the test. Iranian newspapers published no pictures of Montazeri on their front pages, in line with what reformist websites said were instructions from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Khomeini's grandson, Hassan Khomeini, a cleric, paid tribute in his condolence message to a man he said had "spent many years of his honourable life on the path of advancing the high goals of Islam and the Islamic revolution," ILNA news agency reported. Human rights activist and Nobel Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi called Montazeri "the father of human rights in Iran." President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election in a June vote that losing candidates Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi said was rigged kindled the worst unrest in the Islamic Republic's 30-year history and split the political and clerical establishment. In August, Montazeri said the authorities' handling of the unrest "could lead to the fall of the regime" and he denounced the clerical leadership as a dictatorship. The authorities deny charges of electoral fraud and have portrayed the protests, quelled by Revolutionary Guards and Islamic militiamen, as a foreign-backed plot to undermine them. "Montazeri was one of the chief spiritual and religious voices of the reformist movement," said Alireza Nader, Iran analyst at the RAND Corporation in Washington. Nader said the cleric's status as a Shi'ite religious authority and his revolutionary credentials provided a cover of legitimacy for the reformists' political and social demands. "His death leaves an important vacuum, but there are other senior clerics who are also outspoken against the Ahmadinejad administration and who demand political reform. His absence will not necessarily lead to a weakening of the opposition."
