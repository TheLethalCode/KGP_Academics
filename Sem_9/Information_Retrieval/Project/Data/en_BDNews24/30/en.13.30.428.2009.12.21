 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)The government inspector has turned down the railway authorities' "special request" for allowing Indian container-wagons to ply across the Bangabandhu bridge. Government railway inspector Abu Taher told bdnews24.com that his department has sent back Bangladesh Railway's request letter as it had no mention of the entry points and destinations of the Indian container- wagons. Bangladesh Railway, a department under communications ministry, on Nov 10 had sent a letter to the inspector seeking permission to carry container-wagons across the bridge which connects Dhaka with northern parts of the country. Railway sources say at least one railway wagon enters Bangladesh everyday through Benapole, Darsana and Rahanpurall located in the country's northern part. "The BR letter has not mentioned the entry points of the Indian wagon-containers," Taher told bdnews24.com on Sunday. "We have sent the letter back to BR seeking clarifications on their entry points, routes and destinations. "The BR letter has not taken safety of the lines into consideration while making the request," he said. The government inspector monitors the safety condition of the rail tracts and the BR must get clearance from his office for launching any new trains or services. The director general of Bangladesh Railway, Md Belayet Hossain, in the letter to the inspector said two types of Indian container-wagons were fit for plying over Bangabandhu bridge, which has a load limit. "We will certainly clarify the points raised by the inspector," Hossain told bdnews24.com on Sunday. India has been pressing Bangladesh for years to allow its goods-laden container-wagons to come straight to capital Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh. Businessmen say the cost of Indian products would be cheaper in Bangladesh if the container-wagons could be brought straight to Dhaka by railway. The railway authorities don't agree to allow India carrying goods over the bridge as it cannot carry the load of most of the Indian container-wagons. The railway DG in his letter said India proposed carrying four types of containers across the bridge, but his department found that only two models of containers would not cross the weight limit of the tracts on the bridge. The railway tract on the bridge can carry up to 4.6 tonnes of weight per metre distance. But out of the four types, two models of Indian containers have the weight load of 5.71 tonnes per metre. "Therefore, we rejected those two types of container to be plied across the bridge," Hossain said in the letter. The director general's letter mentioned that India at the inter-governmental railway meeting (IGRM) in March (6-8) 2007 had proposed carrying their containers across the bridge. India again raised the issue at the next IGRM held in Oct 8-10 the same year in New Delhi. Bangladesh at the two meetings had requested the Indian authorities for transit facilities to carry goods to Nepal, but the issue remained pending
