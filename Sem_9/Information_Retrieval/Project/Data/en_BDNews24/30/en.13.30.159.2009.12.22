<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  There is no question about the honesty of the prime minister's energy adviser, the finance minister said on Tuesday, days after a newspaper reported that he took bribe. "Toufique-e-Elahi is a bright example of honesty," AMA Muhith told a meeting at the Economic Relations Division. "He was asked to give testimony against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina during the caretaker government's regime. "As he refused to do so he was made an accused and tortured behind the bars," Muhith said. The minister said conspiracy was being hatched against the energy adviser. Certain political quarters and some media were involved with the plot, he said. The daily Amar Desh recently published a report, saying the energy adviser took bribe. The newspaper's editor Mahmudur Rahman was the energy adviser to former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Muhith said conspiracies were being hatched to disrupt the government's development projects. He asked all to guard against such plots. bdne
