<TITLE> US general defends crackdown on pregnancies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)Fed up with unwanted pregnancies under his command, a senior American general in Iraq has decided to court martial not only the female soldiers who get pregnant but also their partners who impregnate them, even if the couple is married. The new policy made last month by Maj. Gen. Anthony Cucolo, a commander in northern Iraq, is raising many eyebrows but experts say he is well within his rights to do so. The punishment handed down to those who violate Cucolo's order would likely be handled as a violation of Article 91, or violation of a general order, which is punishable by up to one or two years in prison. Cucolo told ABC News that the policy, believed to be the first of its kind, was necessary to avoid losing valuable troops in his 22,000-member command. "I need every soldier I've got, especially since we are facing a drawdown of forces during our mission. Anyone who leaves this fight earlier than the expected 12-month deployment creates a burden on their teammates," he said in a statement. "Anyone who leaves this fight early because they made a personal choice that changed their medical status -- or contributes to doing that to another -- is not in keeping with a key element of our ethos, 'I will always place the mission first,' or three of our seven core values: loyalty, duty and selfless service," he continued. "And I believe there should be negative consequences for making that personal choice." Experts say the Army may have its reasons for such an order. Sex among its ranks can cause trouble in many regards, including favoritism of the partner. Also, soldiers found to be pregnant are sent back to the U.S. in short order and stories abound of female soldiers intentionally getting pregnant to be sent home. There is an Army term for that kind of behavior; it's called malingering, which means planned pregnancies to relieve the female soldier of duty and in the process avoid dangerous assignment. Gen Cuculo's pregnancy policy is just one provision in a larger general order, which also prohibits soldiers from sexual contact with Iraqis or third-party nationals who are not members of coalition forces. "I do not expect those who have never served in the military to completely understand what I have tried to explain above," Cucolo wrote. "Recently I was asked, 'Don't you think you are treading on an intensely personal topic?' As intensely personal as this topic might be, leaving those who depend on you shorthanded in a combat zone gets to be personal for those left, too." On Monday, Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nathan Banks told ABCNews.com that Cucolo, like any other commander, has the right to institute and enforce policies as he sees fit. Some, however, don't agree. Wayne Kastel, a civilian military lawyer, appears somewhat sympathetic to the overworked men and women in uniform. "I think the troops over there are fighting hard and getting PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and all sorts of horrible stuff," Kastel said. If they need a "little comfort helping through the night," he added, so be it. He pointed to stories about drinking, sex and other debauchery that permeated Army life during previous wars. "I think the policy is to put the fear of God into folks over there," he told ABCNews.com. "I don't like it, but I would say that order over there is probably legal." John Hutson, a former longtime military judge advocate and currently the president and dean of Franklin Pierce Law School in New Hampshire, said it's well within Cucolo's rights to hand down such an order, especially if pregnancy has become a serious issue within his ranks. When a woman becomes pregnant, "you've taken somebody and you've made her less effective," he said. "And I think its only fair that if you do that with the woman than the man be held equally culpable." But the policy, Houston said, is not meant to prohibit sex altogether, "but you have to take precautions." Still, he added, "in some respects, it flies in the face of family values." But Hutson worried that Cucolo's policy could cause an increase in abortions overseas. And since military hospitals do not perform such procedures, female officers may find abortions are available not "in the way you want them," Hutson said, forcing women to potentially dangerous providers of such services.
