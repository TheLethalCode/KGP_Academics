 ABU DHABI, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Footballer of the Year Lionel Messi chested the winner to lead Barcelona to a 2-1 extra-time victory over Estudiantes in the Club World Cup final on Saturday. The Spanish team were crowned world club champions for the first time, denying Argentina's Estudiantes who took the honour in 1968. In the 110th minute Brazil right back Daniel Alves crossed and Messi darted between two defenders to chest the ball past goalkeeper Damian Albil.

Messi found Ibrahimovic in space on the left but the Swede's shot went just wide of the far post. Then, in the 52nd minute, Albil saved from Ibrahimovic who had forced his way through on the left. Pedro almost converted a cross from Thierry Henry on the hour but failed to make contact with the goal at his mercy. Barca should have scored in the 69th when Pedro had a shot blocked by Albil's f
