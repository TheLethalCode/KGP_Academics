<TITLE> Bangladesh to do double-take on New Year's Eve </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladeshis will get two chances to cheer in the New Year, and make those all-important resolutions too, as unique circumstances will cause clocks to strike midnight 'twice' on Dec 31 this year. After introducing Daylight Saving Time for the first time this year, by putting clocks forward on June 19, the Bangladesh government has decided to restore standard time at midnight on New Year's Eve. Accordingly, the nation will put their clocks back an hour at midnight on Dec 31, and then see in the New Year a second time an hour later. Those preparing to set off the traditional fire crackers or fireworks at midnight may grumble at having to fork out for two lots, but they shouldn't forget they're paying for double the fun! Those worried about double the trouble, on the other hand, should rest assured as security agencies have taken the usual "special measures" across the country, including capital Dhaka, to ensure we all get to celebrate Dec 31 night in safety. RAB media wing director Sohel Taj said 5,000 members of Rapid Action Battalion will work to maintain law and order around the country, of which 2,000 will be deployed in the capital alone. Dhaka Metropolitan Police public relations officer Walid Hossain said special check posts will be set up throughout the city after 10pm. The law enforcement officers didn't mention if these were double the usual security measures, however. From 2010, Bangladesh will put clocks forward on Mar 31 and set them back again on Oct 31. bd
