<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has found a number of countries using Bangladesh, which enjoys duty-free entry of its textiles to the EU, as a 'cover' to market similar products and secure the same incentive by fraudulent means. An industry leader in Bangladesh stressed the harm caused to Bangladeshi exports and said "strong action" must be taken to deter such fraud. BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque told bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "This sort of scam is very bad for our business." "Strong action must be taken against countries taking illegal advantage of our status." The European Commission, in a statement released Tuesday (Dec 22), said that ready made garments mainly, jeans and t-shirts, originated in the Far East, mainly China, were introduced into the EU with forged documents showing Bangladesh as their country of origin. The EC said it would recover evaded import duties worth 50 million Euros following three recently concluded investigations. During the investigations, thousands of documents, such as certificates of origin, bills of lading, customs export documents, delivery receipts and invoices presented to customs in EU Member States and to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), were found to be forged by third parties, according to the statement. The statement signed by OLAF spokesperson Jrg Wojahn said OLAF and the concerned EU members have established a customs debt around 50 million Euros. "For this amount, recovery orders to the importers will be issued by the customs administrations in almost all EU Member States," reads the statement.
