 Chittagong, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  An explosion aboard an out of commission oil tanker killed at least four ship breakers and injured 10 others in Sitakunda on Saturday. Sitakunda police chief Monirul Islam told bdnews24.com a gas cylinder exploded at around 10:30am while workers of Rahim Steel and Ship Breaking Yard were engaged in dismantling the ship. Agrabad fire service deputy assistant Jasim Uddin told bdnews24.com there might be more bodies inside the tanker. Workers claimed two more of their colleagues were still missing. Three of the four deceased were identified as Selim Hossain, 32, Rana Babu, 25 and Rabiul Mandal, 26. Police said the fourth body was so badly burnt it could not be immediately identified. The injured workers were admitted to Sitakunda Upazila Health Complex and a private medical centre in Chittagong. Four, among the injured who sustained burns, are in a critical state, said doctors. 'CATEGORY RED' CONCERNS Ship breaking is flagged as a 'Category Red', or 'extremely hazardous', industry in Bangladesh. It produces thousands of tonnes of scrap metal used by re-rolling mills, but serious concerns prevail over work safety as well as environmental standards. There are around 87 yards in Sitakunda, where about 30,000 people are employed in hazardous working conditions, making it one of the largest ship-breaking centres in the world. Workers dismantle ships by hand without proper machinery, protective wear or training. The yard owners also compel the beakers to take apart ships without clearing them of toxic materials. According to some estimates, at least 400 ship breakers have died over the past 20 years in the Sitakunda breaking yards. LEGAL ACTION In September this year, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) served a legal notice on another ship breaking yard, Kabir Steel Ltd, after five workers were seriously injured in a fire, one of whom died, saying the accident occurred because of negligence. The notice accused the company of unauthorised ship-breaking operations lacking an environmental clearance certificate from the proper authority. It also blamed the owners of the yard for not putting adequate safety measures in place in line with previous directives of the High Court. BELA also served the notice on 10 others including the environment secretary, home secretary, labour secretary, industry secretary, inland navigation secretary, director general of the environment directorate. The notice said the latest incident demonstrated that many ship yards were still operating without adequate safety arrangements, and pollution continues unabated. The notice also stated that BELA had earlier filed more than one writ petition involving pollution control and safety of workers in ship-breaking yards. On March 17, the High Court in response to a public interest petition by BELA gave a number of directives regarding entry of ships with toxic elements to Bangladesh waters. The directives also spelled out measures for ensuring worker safety. The High Court further ordered closure of 36 yards for running without proper clearance. Following an appeal by the Bangladesh Shipbreakers Association against the directives, the chamber judge of the Appellate Division stayed parts of the High Court order. bdn
