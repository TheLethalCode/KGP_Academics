 KATHMANDU, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Nepal's Maoist former rebels demonstrated across the nascent republic on Monday, the second day of a strike that has highlighted the fragility of a three-year peace process. Maoist activists shouted anti-government slogans and waved flags with the hammer and sickle as they gathered in empty streets, demanding the resignation of the government seven months after the former rebels walked out in a row with the president. The Maoists, who headed a coalition after emerging as the largest political group in last year's election, resigned in May following a failed attempt to sack the country's army chief, a move that prompted the president to intervene. They say the president undermined the supremacy of the civilian government by overruling the cabinet and have been protesting since then. On Monday, activists shouting "restore civilian supremacy" demanded the formation of a national unity government headed by the Maoists, who ended a decade-long civil war under a 2006 peace deal. Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, who replaced Maoist chief Prachanda as prime minister, rules out a new government, but says he is ready to appoint Maoists to his cabinet. Riot police guarded government buildings and key streets on Monday but there were no major violent incidents, officials said. Dozens were injured on Sunday when protesters burned tyres, vandalised cars and clashed with police. The U.N. human rights office in Nepal said the violence was "some of the worst on the streets of Kathmandu for several years". The political stalemate has threatened the peace process and could delay the drafting of a new constitution, slow the rehabilitation of thousands of former fighters and hit one of the world's poorest economies dependent on aid and tourism. "The bottom line is the inability of the Maoists and other political parties to come to a power sharing agreement," said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times. "Everything else, including the future of the peace process, is dependent on that." The new constitution, Nepal's first after the abolition of the 239-year-old monarchy, is due to be written in May next year, but analysts say political turmoil could delay it.
