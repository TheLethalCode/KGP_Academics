 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)---Machine Readable Passports will be available in April next year, within the international deadline, home minister Sahara Khatun said Thursday. "The present government will complete the project in time and start distribution from April 2010." Sahara Khatun told the officials and employees of passport office at Agargaon in the capital on Wednesday. Sahara accused the past BNP-led government of seriously delaying up the national Machine Readable Passport (MRP) and Machine Readable Visa (MRV) projects. The International Civil Aviation Authority has given directives to all the countries to introduce MRPs and MRVs by April 2010. Travelling abroad will be barred without them after the deadline expires. The minister urged passport officials to remain vigilant so no unwanted foreigners, including militants and "Rohingya refugees", could illegally obtain Bangladesh passports. She also said, "The government is set to strengthen the directorate of immigration and passport in line with its electoral pledge to build a 'Digital Bangladesh'." The government had already launched steps to computerise all passport offices of the country, she said. Thursday's programme was also addressed by home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar and head of the directorate of immigration and passport Abdul Mabud. Mabud said, despite manpower shortages, the directorate earned Tk 719 crore in revenue by issuing some 2.2 million passports last year. b
