 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh failed in Copenhagen to draw world attention to the potential security threats that may be triggered by climate change and ensuing mass migration, Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies said on Saturday. "Bangladesh delegates (at the UN climate talks) should have highlighted the 'refugee issue' from the perspective of global security," BIPSS president General ANM Muniruzzaman told a press conference at the organisation's office in the capital. Millions of climate refugees will not only be a burden on Bangladesh but also create chaos and strife for neighbouring countries, said the head of the non-profit think tank. But the Copenhagen Accord, controversially noted by the climate conference on Dec 19, excluded any mention of 'climate refugees', said Muniruzzaman. According to the worst predictions, as many as 20 million people in Bangladesh may be displaced by rising sea levels by 2050. Muniruzzaman said Bangladesh also failed to secure any specific pledges in Copenhagen though it topped a Global Climate Risk Index, published during the conference, as the 'worst affected country'. "The promise of an adaptation fund, meant for developing countries, excluded Bangladesh though it clearly mentioned African countries," he said CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURITY A major COP-15 event titled Climate Change and International Security was held by the Danish foreign ministry on Dec 15, the BIPSS president said. More than 600 people attended the event, with speakers including the NATO secretary general, UNDP chief, European Union president and African Union president. General Muniruzzaman, as a member of the Military Advisory Council on Climate Change, a select international body of experts, was specially invited by to present a viewpoint on the security dimensions of climate change and the Bangladesh perspective. bd
