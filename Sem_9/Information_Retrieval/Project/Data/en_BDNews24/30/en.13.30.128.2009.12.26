 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Ameerah Haq, newly appointed UN under secretary general, expressed disappointment over the Copenhagen climate talks ending without a deal, and urged Bangladesh to build its own approach to climate change. "We all are disappointed. We could have seen some more progress," Haq, a Bangladeshi, said on Saturday at a press conference following her recent appointment. She said, "It's up to the member nations now to act." She said the government, environmental activists and the NGOs must combine to formulate policies and programmes to combat the adverse effects of climate change while creating greater public awareness. She also said Bangladesh has been playing a very active role in UN forums and can reach the Millennium Development Goals, deadline in 2015, with the help of the UN's different development projects. Haq is the first ever woman from Bangladesh to hold the rank of under secretary general at the United Nations. The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has also appointed her as special representative for Timor-Leste and head of United Nations Integrated Mission there. While asked to comment on the human rights situation and the extra judicial killings taking place in Bangladesh, Haq said, "It's not just here, rather the law and order situation all over the world is deteriorating now." She urged for rule of law where the international conventions could also help. While commenting on the recent disputes over maritime boundary with India and Myanmar, she said, "I hope the neighbouring countries and ourselves will work together to address the matter." Regarding the participation of Bangladeshi troops in the peacekeeping missions, Haq said, "Our men are proud to be in missions. They're working hard and doing very well." She also wants to see more Bangladeshis taking higher positions in the missions. Currently, the commander in Ivory Coast peacekeeping mission is a Bangladeshi, she mentioned. Bangladesh is the second largest country in contributing troops to the peacekeeping missions in 19 countries. She most recently served as deputy special representative in Sudan and prior to that, as deputy special representative for Afghanistan. She will take up her position in Dili, East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, on Jan 5 under the peacekeeping mission there to implement a Security Council mandate.
