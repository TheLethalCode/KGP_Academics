 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The government is thinking of changing the venue for holding war crime trial as it is not spacious enough for setting up the tribunal, the law minister said on Monday. The government earlier said it would use the 14, Abdul Gani Road building as the tribunal venue. Shafique Ahmed visited three proposed sites for holding the tribunal at 14, Abdul Gani Road, the old Supreme Court Building and Judiciary Training Institute (adjacent to Curzon Hall). "The tribunal venue needs huge space for investigation officers, observers, media, judges, docks and other related functions. "We have not taken any decision on selecting venues yet," he said. "We were mulling the Gani Road building for using as the tribunal venue. But the place is not suitable. "We have to rethink about the selection," the law minister said. A decision will be taken soon after visiting other establishments, Shafique said. State minister for law Quamrul Islam accompanied the law minister during the visit. bdn
