 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has asked the government to refrain from removing Ziaur Rahman's name from various establishments and vilifying newly elected senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman. "We will launch movements if the government does not shun these tendencies," senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told a press briefing at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters on Saturday. "The government has become active to remove his name. But Zia cannot be removed from people's hearts," he said. His comment came after the cabinet in its last week's regular meeting agreed in principle to rename the airport. Different newspaper reports have speculated that it might be renamed as Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The Dhaka International Airport, which began operating in 1980, was named Zia International Airport in 1983. "They have also become involved in spreading baseless propaganda against Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman," Alamgir said in his first briefing after he was promoted to senior joint-secretary general following the Dec 8 council. He criticised the ruling party for failing to run the country. "Awami League is failing like the caretaker government. The country witnesses a restive politics and sluggish economy. "The BNP leader said: "A certain quarter is trying to harm the party by making abusive comments against Tarique Rahman at a time when BNP was revived through holding a successful council. Khaleda Zia's elder son was made senior vice president in the party's national council. "They are attempting to destroy BNP, the country's biggest popular party, as the caretaker government did earlier." Alamgir urged the government to show democratic attitude and tolerance. He demanded investigation on a reported allegation against the prime minister's son Sajib Wazed Joy and energy adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury of taking bribes. The daily Amar Desh published the report on Wednesday. Alamgir said he was worried about threat given by two ministers to the daily's editor. "It is a state terrorism," he said. BNP chief Khaleda Zia also expressed her worries about the threat on Friday. b
