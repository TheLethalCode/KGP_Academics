 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)The government hopes to add another 1,360 megawatts to the power-starved national grid within the next three months, the state minister for power said Thursday. State minister Enamul Haque told a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on power that the government would be able to add at least 4,000 MW during its five-year term, ending in 2014, to reduce power outages and boost industrial production. "The minister has informed us that additional 960 MW of electricity will be supplied to the national grid by January 2010," Subid Ali Bhuiyan, the standing committee chairman, told journalists at parliament's media centre. "Besides, 400 MW more will be produced by March next year. "It means a further 1,360 MW of electricity will go to the national grid by March 2010," he said. Bhuyian said the this amount would come from completion of power projects started during the last caretaker government and from reactivation of some inoperative plants. The committee chairman also said the energy ministry about to give a work order of a tender to produce another 600 MW of electricity. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Public Purchase approved tenders on Wednesday for five rental power plants (RPPs) billed to generate 330 MW in total. Earlier this week finance minister AMA Muhith said that tenders for power projects to generate another 4000-4500 MW would all be floated in 2010. Muhith saw up to 5000 MW being added to the grid by the incumbent government to fulfill its election pledge of easing chronic power shortages. "If the present government can implement its electricity generation plan, it will be able to add at least 4,000 MW of electricity in five years," Bhuiyan quoted the energy minister as saying on Thursday. Power outages will no longer plague the people, he said. Production of electricity in the public sector in 2009 stood at about 4,300 MW per day against the daily demand for about 7,000 MW, according to ministry figures. bdn
