<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)The estimated cost of the Padma bridge has escalated to $2.4 billion, with all but $140 million being pledged by donors. International tender will be floated by February for construction work to start in 2010, finance minister AMA Muhith said after an inter-ministerial meeting on the proposed bridge held Monday. The bridge construction will be completed during the incumbent government's tenure, which ends in 2013, he said. The proposed bridge, to span 6.15 kilometres, will boost communication of the country's southwest. It is also expected to bring new industry to the region, which the government says will expand the country's economy as a whole. "The initially estimated cost of construction was $1.4 billion, which increased to $2.4 billion at the end of today's (Monday) meeting," said Muhith. The caretaker government had put cost to around $1.4 billion, which it later revised to $1.8 billion, he said. The present government, immediately after coming to power, raised the estimate again to $1.9 billion, with loans pledged from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Islamic Development Bank among others. Muhith said the World Bank will now provide $1.2 billion, the ADB $550 million, IDB $120 million and JICA $300 million. Abu Dhabi Development Group will lend $31 million. The rest, just $140 million, will be raised locally by issuing bonds and other means. The necessary preparations including the signing of agreements with donors will be completed by January, said the minister. Communications minister Abul Hossain, who was at the inter-ministerial meeting, said, "The bridge's construction will add 1.2 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). When asked if the WB would be made lead donor Muhith said, "The prime minister will finalise it." He further said there is no obligation to select the major donor as the lead one. Replying to a question on whether construction work is being delayed the finance minister said, "As far I know, proceedings of such a huge project have never advanced so fast." Planning minister AK Khandaker, prime minister's adviser for economic affairs Moshiur Rahman, finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, secretary for the Economic Relations Division Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan and other officials attended the meeting. bdn
