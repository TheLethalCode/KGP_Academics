 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  New chief justice Mohammed Tafazzul Islam was sworn in to office on Wednesday. The prime minister, attorney general and Supreme Court judges were present as President Zillur Rahman administered the oath at Bangabhaban at 9:30am, Md Shawkat Hossain, registrar of the Supreme Court told bdnews24.com. Islam is the 17th chief justice of Bangladesh. He was appointed as a judge in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Aug 27, 2003. He headed the five-member Appellate Division bench that delivered a historic 'final judgment' last month in the Bangabandhu murder case. The bench upheld death sentences of five former officers convicted for the Aug 15 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Islam will be in office for less than two months as he is due to retire on Feb 7, 2010. The president appointed Islam on Dec 15, ahead of MM Ruhul Amin's retirement. The outgoing chief justice met the president at Bangabhaban on his last day in office Tuesday. The president lauded Amin on his time in office and hoped that his contribution in establishing justice and rule of law would be followed by others. Amin assumed the office on June 1 this year. bd
