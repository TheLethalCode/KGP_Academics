 Chittagong, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong court on Thursday dismissed two cases filed against home minister Sahara Khatun and lawmaker Shahida Tarek Dipti. The two cases were filed earlier in the day with the court of Chittagong judicial magistrate Akhter Hossain, accusing the home minister and MP of tarnishing the reputation of BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury by making defamatory statements. Local BNP leader Mohammed Imran and Jubo Dal leader Farhad Hossain were the litigants. Prosecution lawyer Shafiqul Morshed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that Imran cited Sahara's comment, on Channel-i News At Nine on Dec 18, saying: "War criminal SQ Chowdhury will be brought to justice and punished". Farhad complained Shahida Tarek, during a meeting in Fatikchhari Upazila on Dec 19, had stated: "Everyone should unite so that notorious war criminal and Razakar Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury cannot stand in the way of spirit of the liberation war." Chittagong district public prosecutor Abul Hashem told bdnews24.com the court dismissed the cases after hearings "as there were no elements to take the charges into cognizance". bdn
