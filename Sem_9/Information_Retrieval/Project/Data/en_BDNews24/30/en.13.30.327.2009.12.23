 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has said ruling Awami League, backed by the local administration, has foiled a party meeting in Narsinghdi. Section 144 was imposed in Narsinghdi on Tuesday after BNP and Awami Swechchhasebak League called meetings on the same venue at Palash Upazila. The BNP meeting was due to receive newly standing committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan, a MP from Narsinghdi constituency. BNP was trying to organise the meeting on the venue despite the ban, but it could not take place due to police intervention resulting in clashes. "Awami League, backed by the administration, is responsible for the incident. Such an incident has not taken place in the last 20 years of history in Palash," Moyeen Khan told a briefing on Wednesday at the National Press Club. He demanded punishment to those responsible for foiling the scheduled BNP programme. bd
