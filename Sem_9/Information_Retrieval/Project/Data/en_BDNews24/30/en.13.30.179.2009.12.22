<TITLE> Loan facility to help 'harmed' businessmen: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)--The finance minister says business confidence will come back following the move that allows businessmen harmed during the interim government to reschedule their overdue loans without down payment. Speaking to the media at the Economic Relations Division in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on Tuesday, A M A Muhith said the latest measure will not upset the discipline in terms of loan in the banking sector. "Those (businessmen and industrialists) who who could not do anything during the caretaker government's tenure should be given scope to work." Bangladesh Bank on Monday issued a circular that asked banks to let the 'harmed' businessmen reschedule their loan without down payment and on the basis of their relations with clients. The minister said those businessmen and industrialists who were detained or who fled the country, who had their bank accounts frozen and arrest warrant out on them, leading to losses, will get the latest facility. The central bank had been asked to issue the circular to help them offset losses and restore full confidence among the businesses, Muhith added. He claimed that the economy is already shrugging off sluggishness in investment and that the move was in no way aimed to boost investment. The finance minister hoped that the decision would help the affected industries to get back on stream and drive the economy. He attributed the flagging investment to the military-backed interim government's repression, global recession and problems in the infrastructure sectors like gas and electricity. "After our (Awami League) government took office, the problems are veering off," he said. A sweeping anticorruption drive under the state of emergency in 2007-08 had stuffed the jails with some of country's most influential business leaders, while many others fled the country, leading to a stagnation in new investment. bdn
