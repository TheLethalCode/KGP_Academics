<TITLE> Radicals 'trying to trigger communal tension over Tipai' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)--The Communist Party of Bangladesh has said the radical Islamist organisations are trying to trigger communal tension through their protests against the planned construction of Tipaimukh Dam in India. The party urged the people to remain alert to the threat in a statement on Friday, a day after Islami Andolan, led by Charmonai Pir Syed Mohammad Rezaul Karim, started a long march from the capital's Muktangan. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan and general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim alluded to that programme and said the fundamentalist quarter's long march has no relation with the real Tipaimukh Dam issue. The statement added that the main goal of the radicals is to gain political mileage by deceiving people. However, the CPB leaders urged all the left-leaning, progressive and patriotic forces to stand up against the dam plan. India's contentious dam project is planned to cross the Barak River, which enters into Bangladesh as the Surma and Kushiara rivers. The two rivers are lifeline for hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region of Bangladesh. India had already said on a number of occasions the dam would not withhold water, but environmentalists and the people of Bangladesh, as well as Manipur state, remain concerned over the impact of the projected dam in vulnerable downstream areas. bdnew
