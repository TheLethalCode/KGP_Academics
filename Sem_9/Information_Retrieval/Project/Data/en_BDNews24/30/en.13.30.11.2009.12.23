 WELLINGTON, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's injury-ravaged fast bowler Shane Bond will retire from test cricket to concentrate on the shorter forms of the game, in a bid to prolong his international career. Bond, who in November played his first test in two years after a stint with the rebel Indian Cricket League, said the decision was not an easy one, but he needed to bow out of the longer form of the game after a string of injuries. "It's been a tough call because test cricket remains the ultimate form of the game -- but I'm comfortable I've made the right choice," Bond said in a statement. Bond, 34, has been viewed as one of New Zealand's best fast bowlers, however his career has been decimated by injury. He has only played 18 tests since his debut in 2002, taking 87 wickets at an average of 22, with a best return of 6 for 51. In his test comeback against Pakistan in November Bond snared eights wickets to help New Zealand win the match but he also picked up an abdominal injury, and has been ruled out of cricket until late February. Bond said he is targeting the world Twenty20 and one-day competitions coming up in the next two years.
