 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) Mauritius might recruit more professionals from Bangladesh, but it will take them through official channel to avoid fraudulent practices in the process. Briefing journalists at the foreign ministry on Thursday, Dipu Moni said the Mauritius government will go ahead with legal measures against some Bangladeshis allegedly involved in unlawful activities there. Foreign minister Dipu Moni reiterated that Mauritius government lifted its previous expulsion order on 6,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers engaged mainly in apparel industry. Mauritius in July this year announced to send them back as a measure to absorb the shock of the global economic crises. Allegations were also there that a handful of Bangladeshis had been involved in criminal activities that angered the Mauritius government. Dipu Moni visited capital Port-Louis on Dec 21 and had talks with Mauritius prime minister, foreign minister, labour minister and other high ranking officials. Dipu Moni, however, said. "We are very proud that the Bangladeshis working in Mauritius have been serving the country in a disciplined way". "The Mauritius leaders have assured me of recruiting skilled manpower from Bangladesh as the recruiters are very happy with Bangladeshi workers' performance and discipline," she said. Foreign ministry sources say Mauritius has shown interest in appointing doctors, engineers and other professionals through Bangladesh Overseas Employment and Services Limited under expatriates' welfare ministry. According to the government figures, 12,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers, mainly female labour, are currently employed in the island nation.
