 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Tuesday asked the government not to harass Bangla newspaper Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, publisher Hasmat Ali and special correspondent M Abdullah until Jan 3. Justice Ashraful Islam's single bench on Tuesday gave the order upon a petition by the three a day after a Magura court had ordered their arrest. He set Jan 3 for the next hearing. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam represented the government and barrister Rafique-Ul-Haque the defendants. The defendants should appear before the court that took the charge against them into cognisance, Alam said. They felt they might be harassed if they went to the lower court, so they came to the High Court, Haque said. Chief judicial magistrate of Magura Sheikh Jalal Uddin issued the warrant on Rahman, Ali and Abdullah after hearing the defamation charge filed by Magura district Swechchhasebok League convenor Ashraf Hossain. The defamation suit said the false news that was published against prime minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajib Wazed Joy and energy advisor Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury libelled them and sought $10, 000 crore in compensation. The daily reported on Dec 16 that Joy and Chowdhury allegedly accepted a Tk 35 crore bribe from US oil company Chevron for helping them get a Tk 370 crore job without any tender. The same day, two other defamation charges were also filed against them in Chittagong and Joypurhat. Chittagong additional chief magistrate Asaduzzaman Khan asked them to appear in court by Jan 31 and Joypurhat senior judicial magistrate Khairul Alam on Mar 3, 2010. The charge filed in Joypurhat said the news run in Amar Desh sought Tk 10 crore in damages to reputation of Joy and Chowdhury. Mahmudur Rahman was the energy advisor to former prime minister Khaleda Zia, now the leader of the opposition in parliament. bdnews
