 Savar, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Gonosastha Medical College held up six Hanif Enterprise buses for eight hours on Saturday, releasing them only after Tk 2 lakh was paid in 'compensation' for a fellow student injured in a road accident on Dec 14, police said. A truck, reportedly owned by associates of Hanif Enterprise, ran over physiotherapy student Sheuli Akhter, 22, who was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Ashulia police chief Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that students released the buses after they "reached an understanding" in a meeting attended by Dhaka District Sramik Union leaders. Islam was also reportedly present. The students handed the money to Gonosastha Medical College registrar Mir Mortuza Ali Babu for college student Sheuli's treatment. Dhaka District Sramik Union president Abbas Uddin told bdnews24.com that police also released the truck that was impounded after it ran over Sheuli. bdnews
