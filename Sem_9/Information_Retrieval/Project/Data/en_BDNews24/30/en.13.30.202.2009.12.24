<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Upul Tharanga struck his seventh century to steer Sri Lanka to a challenging 315 for six in the fourth one-day international against India on Thursday. Left-handed Tharanga hit 118 and shared an entertaining 126-run third-wicket stand with skipper Kumar Sangakkara (60) to help Sri Lanka post a confident score after choosing to bat first in the day-night game. In a must-win game for the tourists, who trail the five-match series 2-1, opener Tillakaratne Dilshan (9) fell early to left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra. Tharanga, who hit two fifties in the last three matches, gave a caught and bowled opportunity on seven to Nehra before smashing pacer Ishant Sharma for five fours in his first over. Recalled Sananth Jayasuriya fell to spearhead Zaheer Khan for 15 before Sangakkara and Tharanga came together for a dominant stand. Fluent Tharanga hit 14 fours and two sixes as he and the captain took the score to 198 in the 37th over before Sangakkara was stumped off spinner Harbhajan Singh. Tharanga and Mahela Jayawardene (33) put on 36 before Zaheer dismissed the opener in his second spell. Debutant all-rounder Thissara Perera struck a quickfire 31 to help Sri Lanka finished the innings with a flourish.
