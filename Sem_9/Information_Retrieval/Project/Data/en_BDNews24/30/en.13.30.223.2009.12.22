<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)Farmers will receive cash subsidies for diesel through the coming boro season, at an estimated cost to the government of Tk 350 crore, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said Tuesday. "We've decided on the subsidy. How and exactly when it should be handed will be settled after consulting the prime minister and cabinet members," Matia told reporters at the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council. The fuel subsidy will be given to farmers with a highest ceiling of 3 bighas (1 acre) of farmland. An agriculture ministry official told bdnews24.com that a primary analysis indicates that about 9 million farmers will need the diesel subsidies. They will get a subsidy of Tk 5 per litre. Price of diesel is currently Tk 44 per litre. About 35 litres of diesel is required to irrigate one bigha of farmland of boro paddy. This year, an estimated 19 million metric tonnes of boro rice has been targeted on about 4.7 million hectares of farmland. In the fiscal 2007-2008 during the caretaker government's rule, farmers were given Tk 249 crore (Tk 2.49 billion) as cash subsidies for diesel purchase in the boro season. The current fiscal budget has an allocation of Tk 3600 crore (Tk 36 billion) as agriculture subsidies, the bulk of which is being spent in buying fertiliser. Meanwhile, work on creating a comprehensive farmers data bank has been progressing, after obtaining data from 64 districts, Matia said. Agriculture Assistance Provision Cards are being printed for 18.2 million farmers, the minister said. "We have provided the districts with cash for printing the cards. They'll be distributed as soon as printed," Matia said. The purpose of introducing the card is to build an integrated farmers data bank, said ministry officials. The ID card will be useful to farmers in a number of ways. For example, the card will be used to access any subsidies given by the government in the agriculture sector. Records of received assistance will be inscribed on the back of the card. The government is aiming to introduce the ID cards before the diesel subsidies for the boro season, said a ministry official. b
