<TITLE> Bus carrying Syrians attacked in Lebanon </TITLE>

 BEIRUT, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shots were fired at a bus carrying Syrian workers in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing one Syrian, security sources said. The attack occurred a day after Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri completed a two-day visit to Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that marked an end to nearly five years of animosity between Damascus and a broad political alliance led by Hariri. Lebanon's ties with Damascus hit rock bottom after Hariri's alliance accused Syria of assassinating Saad's father, Rafik al-Hariri, in February 2005. They also blamed Damascus for attacking and killing other politicians and journalists. Syria denies the allegations. A special court has yet to indict anyone for the killing. Outrage in Lebanon over the assassination and international pressure forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon in April 2005, ending three decades of military presence in its smaller neighbour.
