 Mohosinul Karim bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) Allegations of longstanding "inertia and inaction" have been made against the top man at the livestock department with regard to proper promotion of qualified personnel and leaving essential posts unfilled. Department officials alleged that even minister Abdul Latif Biswas's instruction to promote the competent and recruit more probationers has also gone unheeded by Dr Habibur Rahman, the acting director general currently in charge of three offices, as he has not prepared or put up any list of the deserving officials. As a result, in addition to the promotion tangle created over a long period, long-vacant posts lie unfilled. Of the total 1,541 Class I posts at the department, 400 lie vacant. Almost all of the offices of five directors, 14 deputy directors and 33 assistant directors are being run by officers holding 'current' charges. Minister Abdul Latif Biswas told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "About two weeks back, the department's DG had been asked to put up lists of officials who should be promoted. As the order went unheeded, another letter was issued Tuesday to forward the required lists within a week." Biswas said he would like to resolve the stalemate next week at the promotion committee meeting. Refuting allegations of inertia on his part, acting DG Habibur Rahman said, "The alleged promotion tangle has been taken care of. In the backdrop of litigations filed by the deprived through a protracted period, all promotions of personnel within the department had been withheld for the last 14 years." "If you look at my case, I too have been compelled to serve as an officer holding 'current' charge, even seven years after I qualified for the DG's office." Acknowledging receipt of the ministry letter, Rahman told bdnews24.com, "Yes, I just received a faxed directive from the ministry Tuesday asking for a list of recommended departmental promotions, which will be done as soon as possible." Among the lower tier employees of the department, 408 have already been promoted in line with a ministerial order and now preparations are ongoing for the promotion of senior officials, the acting DG said. Of the two deputy directors, the senior DD Dr Sabbir Ahmed currently holds the director post of the Mohakhali Livestock Research Institute. Though junior in service terms, the other DD Habibur Rahman is acting as the DG, currently in charge of three offices. Requesting anonymity, a departmental official alleged the acting DG Rahman has been delaying all promotions till the senior DD Sabbir Ahmed retires, apprehending that if the 'promotion tangle' is resolved and regularised, the senior Ahmed may assume the DG's office in his place. Omar Faruque Dewan, public relations officer of the department, who also applied for a promotion told bdnews24.com that 33 principal scientific officers were qualified to be promoted deputy directors and 14 assistant directors were fit to be promoted directors. A number of assistant directors are discharging their duties in 'current' charge of directors, he said. Of the 14 DD's positions, 12 are vacant. All the directors' offices are being run by officers equivalent to assistant directors holding 'current' charges. Outside the DG's office, of about 1,538 departmental posts, there exist five directors and 12 DDs offices, of which again, officials functioning as DDs, directors and DG are all holding 'current' charges, Dewan said. bdnews24
