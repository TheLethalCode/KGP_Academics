 TEHRAN, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian opposition website said security forces clashed with supporters of the late dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri in at least two cities on Wednesday, including his birthplace. If confirmed, the incidents signal rising tension in Iran, six months after a disputed presidential election plunged the Islamic Republic into its deepest internal crisis since it was founded three decades ago. Police chief Esmail Ahmadi-Moqadam said the pro-reform opposition would face "fierce" confrontation if it continued its "illegal" activities, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Referring to the central city where Montazeri was born, the Jaras website said: "Sporadic clashes started from Tuesday night in Najafabad and still continued. The situation is tense in the city. People are chanting anti-government slogans." It also said many demonstrators were injured during clashes with security forces in the nearby city of Isfahan, which occurred on the traditional third day of mourning for Montazeri. Another reformist website, Parlemannews, said at least 50 opposition backers, including four journalists, were arrested during the clashes in Isfahan, one of Iran's biggest cities. Jaras said protesters who had gathered in Isfahan to commemorate Montazeri, a fierce critic of the hardline government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election in June plunged Iran into turmoil. "Police fired teargas to disperse people ... many people were injured ... some arrested," Jaras said. It also said plainclothes security agents in Isfahan surrounded the house of a leading pro-reform cleric, Ayatollah Jalaleddin Taheri. The reported incidents took place two days after huge crowds turned out in the Shi'ite holy city of Qom for the funeral of Montazeri, when many people chanted anti-government slogans, websites reported. REFORMIST SPIRITUAL PATRON The website reports from Isfahan and Najafabad could not be verified independently because foreign media are banned from reporting directly on protests. Government supporters staged counter rallies in Qom on Tuesday and Wednesday, official Iranian media reported. Iran's internal unrest, highlighted by Montazeri's arguments that the leadership had lost its legitimacy, has complicated the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the West believes may have military ends, not just civilian purposes. Montazeri, who died on Saturday at the age of 87, was an architect of the 1979 revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah and was once named to succeed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as supreme leader of the Islamic state. But Montazeri, viewed as the spiritual patron of the opposition movement that led the big protests following the June presidential election, fell from grace after criticising the mass execution of prisoners in the late 1980s. Ahmadinejad's re-election, in the election that losing opposition candidates said was rigged, kindled the biggest unrest in the Islamic Republic's 30-year history and split the political and clerical establishment. Despite scores of arrests and security crackdowns, opposition protests have repeatedly flared up since the vote. Montazeri's death occurred in the tense run-up to Ashura, on December 27, a politically important Shi'ite religious commemoration that offers the opposition another opportunity to show its strength. Opposition backers have seized such occasions marked in the Islamic revolutionary calendar to raise their voices.
