 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Members of union parisads and municipalities called for greater autonomy and financial clout on Saturday in a bid to strengthen local government institutions. They urged the government to give them more manpower and fix income sources for them. Bangladesh Union Parisad Forum and Bangladesh Municipality Association organised a seminar on the role of the local government bodies to make better use of local resources. Professor Tofael Ahmed, a former member of the now defunct local government commission, said despite around Tk 7,500 crore budget for the local government sector, merely Tk 715 crore has been earmarked for local government institutions. Of this, Tk 115 crore will go to 4,498 union parisads, or local councils, and Tk 200 crore to 309 municipalities. He proposed to boost the allocation and said the local government bodies should be directly involved with more projects. He also said union parisads and municipalities should have scope for revenue from taxes. State minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak, meanwhile, sought all support from the municipal mayors and UP chairmen to implement the government's 'One House, One Farm' project. He pointed out various plans to strengthen the government's ties with local government institutions. Nanak said the government has taken up initiatives to make local government complexes the centres of local administration through which development activities will be brought to the grassroots level. Ahmed also called for fixing mayors and chairmen's status and powers by removing legal inconsistencies. State minister Nanak also spoke of the government's initiatives to remove inconsistencies in local government laws and increase honorary allowances for municipality mayors, councilors, UP chairmen and members. b
