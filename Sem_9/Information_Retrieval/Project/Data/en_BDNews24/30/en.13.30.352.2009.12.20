<TITLE> Ershad takes a spiritual turn </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com) - "I seek (things) only from Allah and none else," Jatiya Party chief president Hossain Mohammad Ershad said on Sunday. Ershad, a former president, said this in a retort to media reports that have portrayed him as a dejected and neglected man despite being a partner of the alliance government. "I want to tell them I am a Muslim, and I do not seek anything from anyone but Allah. He has given me enough honour," he said in self-satisfaction. But, he immediately came back to his senses from his spiritual world saying he will ask his supporters to get ready for the next general election to grab up to 100 parliamentary seats so that no party can form government without his support. Ershad's Jatiya Party with only 29 seats is a minor partner in the alliance government, led by Awami League, which holds absolute majority in the 300-seat parliament. He also said his party is the only exponent of Bangladeshi Nationalism, sending a challenge to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which has long been nourishing the dogma as a deterrent to Awami League's Bangali nationalism.
