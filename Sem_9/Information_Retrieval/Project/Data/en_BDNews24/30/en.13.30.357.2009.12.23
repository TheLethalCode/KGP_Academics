 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank has doubled the export development fund (EDF) to $300 million (Tk 30 crore) on Tuesday to offset export losses from global recession. "The EDF has been doubled to cover the losses of the exporters due to global recession," governor Atiur Rahman told bdnews24.com. Exporters will benefit from the fund, he said. The central bank, which manages the EDF, provides loans from the fund to exporters in foreign currencies. The EDF size was $ 150 million or Tk 15 crore before. The textile owners under the BTMA, who did not get any loan from the fund, will now get loans to import yarn on condition that clothes made from it must have to be exported, said Rahman. A circular, issued on Tuesday, was sent to the chief executives of all banks. From Jan 1 next year, the banks will take loan from EDF at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1 percent interest and will extend credit to the exporters at LIBOR rate plus 2.50 percent interest. Until now, they used to borrow from EDF at the LIBOR rate and gave loan at LIBOR rate plus 2.50 percent interest to the exporters. The previous process will become void on December 31 of the current year, said the circular. bdnews
