<TITLE> US commander in Iraq scraps pregnancies policy amid furore </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com) Amid mounting criticism from women advocacy groups, the top US commander in Iraq has said he will scrap a policy that has led to the punishment of soldiers under his command for becoming pregnant. General Ray Odierno said the new, Iraq-wide guidelines would take effect beginning January 1, lifting rules enacted by the U.S. commander in northern Iraq Maj Gen Tony Cucolo, who reports to Odierno, that laid out possible punishments for pregnancy among his soldiers, Reuters reported on Thursday. The policy had been criticized by some women's advocates and on Tuesday four U.S. senators wrote to the secretary of the U.S. Army asking that it be rescinded. According to U.S. policy now, individual commanders can issue rules on behavior for troops under their command that are more strict than those issued by their military superiors. Maj. Gen. Cucolo, in charge of 22,000 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, has defended his policy, saying that he could not afford to lose soldiers to pregnancy while the U.S. military draws down its soldiers from Iraq. Troop levels are set to fall to about 50,000 by the end of August next year, and a full withdrawal is due by 2012. Possible punishments for becoming pregnant, or getting another soldier pregnant, ranged from an administrative reprimand to court martial, although Cucolo later made clear he did not intend to court martial any soldier who became pregnant. His policy had been in effect since November 4. Four of his soldiers had been found to be pregnant since then. Three male soldiers involved were also reprimanded, one more seriously because he had committed adultery.
