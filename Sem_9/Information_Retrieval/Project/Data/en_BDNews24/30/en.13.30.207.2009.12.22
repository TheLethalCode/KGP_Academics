 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government will float tenders in 2010 to add 4,000-4,500 megawatts to the overstrained national grid, finance minister said on Tuesday. Preparations for inviting bids are already complete, AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting with delegates of the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) at the Economic Relations Division. The minister hoped some 5,000 MW of power in total would be added to the grid during the present government's tenure, to fulfill its election pledge of easing chronic power shortages. Muhith also said the government will maintain transparency in all its major development activities, including construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge and big power stations. "If development works are done in a proper manner it will bring welfare to the country. If things go awry it will be bad for all of us. "That's why we have taken all measures to manage all development projects in a fair and transparent manner," he said. IDCOL delegates handed the finance minister a cheque for Tk 6.0 crore as the share of profit made in FY 2008-09. It deposited Tk 4.0 crore in FY 2007-2008 to the national exchequer. bd
