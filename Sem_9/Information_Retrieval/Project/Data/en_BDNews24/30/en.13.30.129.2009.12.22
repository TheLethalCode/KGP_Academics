 LONDON, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The international community has betrayed the people of Gaza by failing to end an Israeli blockade to allow the territory to be rebuilt, a group of 16 rights groups said in a report on Tuesday. The report argued that Israel was in violation of international humanitarian law by enforcing a "collective punishment" with an indiscriminate blockade on Gaza -- punishing all for the acts of a few.

Poor water quality was also a major concern for aid agencies, with diarrhoea causing 12 percent of young deaths. Israel launched what was called "Operation Cast Lead" last December to try to suppress rocket fire. The Gaza Palestinian death toll was more than 1,400 according to a Palestinian human rights group, and about 1,000 according to Israel which says 13 Israeli lives were lo
