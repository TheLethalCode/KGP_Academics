 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)Police candidates will have to cover a distance of 1600 metres in 6.5 minutes by foot to qualify for a further round of tests to secure the job of a sub-inspector, a parliamentary sub-committee has suggested. The sub-committee, formed by the parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry on Sept 3 this year, made the recommendation to improve the appointment procedure of the sub-inspector of police. The 4-member parliamentary sub-committee, headed by Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Huq Chunnu, suggested that the recruitment procedure should be similar with that of Delhi police which appointed officers in four phases. However, the parliamentary standing committee asked the sub-committee to make its recommendations "attainable" in line with reality in Bangladesh. The committee has allocated one more months to make the recommendation applicable. "I don't know how the candidates in Delhi cross 1600 metres in 6.5 minutes. It is difficult," Major General (Rtd) Abdus Salam, the standing committee chairman, told journalists Tuesday after the standing committee meeting at parliament building. "Any recommendation must be attainable considering the reality in Bangladesh. If not, it will be meaningless," said the chairman. "Therefore, the committee has extended the tenure of the sub-committee to make its suggestions realistic". The parliamentary standing committee formed sub-committee to suggest ways for upgrading the appointment of sub-inspector of police. Ruling Awami League MPs Nurul Islam Sujon, Sanjida Khanam and Shafiqul Islam are the other members of the sub-committee. bdnews24.com has obtained a copy of the sub-committee report. The sub-committee says the existing appointment procedure of sub-inspectors has some 'flaws'. According to the present system, candidates must face viva-voce and physical capability tests and sit two 50-mark examinations. "Due to absolute authority of the recruiting board, it becomes very hard to make the recruitments fair. Such authority also leads to tampering in selection of candidates leaving aside merit and qualification, the report said. "Therefore, the appointment procedure followed in the Delhi police can be replicated here," it said. First the candidates must cross 1600 metres in 6.5 minutes, according to the recommendations. Only the successful candidates will be allowed to take part in the next steps -- 12 feet long jump and 3.5 metres high jump tests. "The disqualified candidates will have no chance to appeal," it said. "In the second step, the authorities will have to take measurement of their chest, weight and height," according to the sub-committee. Candidates passing the two steps will then be allowed to sit for a 200-mark written examination on reasoning (70 marks), general knowledge and current affairs (50 marks), numerical ability (30 marks) and English (50 marks) in three hours. "The candidates passing the written tests will be invited for a 20-mark oral examination. "Candidates with 178 cm height and aspirants having national cadet core certificates may get bonuses of 3.0 and 2.0 marks respectively," said the recommendations. As per the existing recruitment procedure, the candidates sit for examinations on Bangla and English (100 marks), general knowledge and arithmetic (100 marks) and psychological test (25 marks). Besides, 100 marks are set for viva voce and physical fitness.
