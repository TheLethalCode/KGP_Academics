 Feni, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)- The prosecution has brought allegations of looting, spreading rumour and criminal activities against the suspected BDR mutineers of Feni region. Trial proceedings of the special tribunal formed at 19 Rifles Battalion headquarters began at around 10am on Monday when 62 accused border guards were produced before the court. BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam, who led the special court, adjourned the court until January 24, allowing the accused an opportunity for self defence within this period. The trial proceedings ended at 11:30am for the second day. At the Monday's hearing, prosecutor Lt Col Gazi Salahuddin briefed on the incidents that took place on February 26 at the Feni headquarters of BDR. He said Subedar Maj Fakir Abdul Jalil and BHM Havilder Mohammad Ruhul Amin had led the mutiny at Feni headquarters. Havilder Khorshed Kabir, Havilder Fazlul Haque, Havilder Mohammad Ali and nine other non-commissioned officers spread rumour of attack on the Feni headquarters. Soldiers looted arms and ammunition from the armoury during the mutiny. The mutineers led by Nayek Mahbubur Rahman and Nayek Mokhlesur Rahman spread panic in the area by compelling the shopkeepers to pull down their shutters and put barricade on the Feni-Maijdi highway, Salahuddin said. The prosecutor demanded exemplary punishment for the accused on verification of their charges. Deputy attorney general advocate Mohammad Farhad Hossain, Lt Col Md Akhteruzzaman and Maj Md Maksudul Alam assisted in the trial proceedings. The accused will be able to get legal assistance from lawyers for self defence, Salahuddin told reporters after Monday's trial proceedings. The trial of the suspected mutineers began on Sunday, which is the third in a series of such hearings on the mutiny. Earlier, it took place at Rangamati and Satkhira. Daganbhuiyan police filed a case charging 62 border guards who had expressed solidarity with the bloody rebellion at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka in February. They were produced before the Feni divisional judicial magistrate's court on May 14, and have been detained in Feni jail since then. The first trial of mutiny suspects began in Rangamati on November 24, followed by a trial in Satkhira on December 7. The bloody February 25-26 mutiny at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka killed over 73 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. The rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts across the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. bd
