 Chittagong, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Former commerce minister Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury has been made president of BNP's Chittagong metropolitan committee, party leaders said on Monday. The central BNP leadership constituted a partial Chittagong metropolitan committee and Chittagong north district committee on Monday. BNP standing committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy told bdnews24.com, "BNP chairperson has approved Amir Khosru and Dr Sahadat Hossain as metropolitan president and secretary respectively. Gias Uddin Quader Chowdhury and Aslam Chowdhury have been made the Chittagong north president and secretary respectively. Roy, however, said, "A letter concerning the appointments is awaiting the secretary general's signature. They (the presidents and secretaries) will form the full committees" The BNP leader told bdnews24.com, "The selfless and devoted leaders will be included in the full committees." The announcement was initially planned at a party council in Chittagong on Nov 16, the first in 20 years. But it could not be done through an election as the council was disrupted by internal squabbling. At least 50 people were injured during the violence between two groups of supporters backing the then BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman and convenor of the metropolitan unit Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury. The last council of the Chittagong metropolitan committee was held in 1988, electing Noman president. The central BNP leaders then decided to announce the committee without any council. bdnews24.com/m
