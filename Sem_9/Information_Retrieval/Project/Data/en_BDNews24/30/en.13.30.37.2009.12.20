 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign minister Dipu Moni leaves Dubai for Mauritius early on Monday to discuss the job loss of Bangladeshi migrant workers in the island nation. According to the itinerary obtained by bdnews24.com, the foreign minister will land in Dubai from Danish capital Copenhagen at 11:30pm on Sunday. She will fly from Dubai at 2:35am Monday and reach Mauritius capital Port Louis at around 9:00am the same day. "The foreign minister will discuss employment of more Bangladeshi workers in Mauritius," a senior foreign ministry official told bdnews24.com on Sunday. He said Moni would also try to persuade her Mauritius counterpart to stop send back Bangladeshi workers. In July this year, Mauritius ordered some 6,000 Bangladeshi workers to leave the country as a move to absorb the shock caused by last year's global economic recession. According to the foreign ministry sources, 12,000 Bangladeshis work mainly in Mauritius's apparel industry, a picturesque landscape in the southwest Indian Ocean off the coast of the African continent. The foreign minister will return to Dubai early on Tuesday before departing for Dhaka in the evening. Moni earlier attempted to visit Mauritius, but could not do so. Mauritius's deputy prime minister Ahmed Rashid in July showed interest in visiting Bangladesh, which could not be arranged. As Bangladesh has no mission in Mauritius, its mission in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, handles relations with that country.
