<TITLE> Law ministry split effective 'immediately' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The announced split of the law ministry into two separate divisions, reportedly causing tensions on Thursday, will be made "immediately effective", law minister Shafique Ahmed has said. Shafique told reporters on Thursday that conflict within the ministry will be removed with the formal separation. Witnesses said the atmosphere in the law ministry was "tense" on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the ministry was divided through a gazette notification. The gazette was released late Wednesday night. Officials and staff, on the last working day of the week, were mostly surprised at the sudden split. However, none wanted to comment publicly on the situation. The law minister told reporters the division of the ministry was needed to ease separation of its executive and judicial activities. The ministry's two wings, the law and justice wing and legislative drafting wing, will now run separately as the Law and Justice Division and the Legislative Drafting and Parliamentary Affairs Division. However, responsibilities and jurisdiction of the two divisions have yet to be finally decided, Shafique said. "Efforts to fully implement the decision will be made very rapidly," he added. The law minister first hinted on Dec 17 that the division of the ministry was imminent, with the Supreme Court's decision that same day upholding a High Court ruling that declared Kazi Habibul Awal's appointment as law secretary illegal. Awal was appointed as acting law secretary on June 28, 2007. The HC on January 18, 2008 declared his appointment illegal for going against the regulations for appointment in the law ministry. The regulations reserve 75 percent quota for judicial cadres in the ministry. But Awal was not a cadre of the judicial service. He was appointed from the legislative drafting wing of the ministry. The case highlights the conflict between the judicial and administrative cadres in the law ministry. Law minister Shafique said last week "problems" in the ministry would be resolved if it was divided into two separate divisions under two secretaries. The division was announced by gazette on Wednesday, before a certified copy of the Supreme Court verdict on Awal had even reached the ministry. The law secretary was not at work on Thursday. His staff said he was on leave. Awal recently returned from a foreign visit and not yet resumed his office, they said. bd
