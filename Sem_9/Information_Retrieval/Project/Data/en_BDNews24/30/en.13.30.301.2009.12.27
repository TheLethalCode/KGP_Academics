<TITLE> Detroit plane attack plan reignites old fears for US Muslims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)The news didn't get much immediate attention because of the holidays, but it was serious enough to interrupt the first family's Christmas vacation in Hawaii. President Barack Obama was informed by phone that a passenger on a Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit was attempting to blow up the plane by igniting a powdery substance. Fortunately for all 228 passengers and crew members, the attempt was foiled by fellow passengers sitting beside the suspect, who it turned out, is a Nigerian Muslim student in his 20s. According to news reports, he confessed to the FBI agents that he acted at the behest of al-Qaeda. The alleged Qaeda connection was enough to send a chill across the Muslim community in America. The incident occurred just two weeks after five American Muslim students were arrested in Pakistan for allegedly trying to join jihadists in Afghanistan with the stated purpose of killing American soldiers. Their arrests followed another gory incident early last month when a Muslim American army major, Nidal Hasan, went on a shooting rampage in Fort Hood military base killing 13 fellow soldiers before he was critically shot by a guard. The episodes coming one after another in quick succession have the American Muslims worried about their future in this country, heightening fear that they would come under stricter surveillance from the law enforcement agencies. The recent revelations that FBI agents have in recent months infiltrated mosques and other Muslim establishments across America only deepened the fears. Although Federal authorities and Muslim advocacy groups insist that they are trying to work together in building trusts between them, questions remain as to whether the efforts are enough to address the challenges that lie ahead. The issue has also triggered a massive soul-searching among Muslim leaders and parents about how to deal with rising radicalism among the younger generation, especially after five college-age young men in Alexandria, just outside Washington, were arrested in Pakistan early this month after allegedly being recruited over the Internet to join the jihadists there. Until now, Muslim leaders and parents thought they'd done all they could. They had condemned extremist ideology, provided ski trips and Scout meetings, and encouraged young people to speak openly about how to integrate their religion, Islam, with the secular world. Mosques and Islamic organizations across the United States regularly issue statements rejecting violence and fringe ideologies. But after the arrests, Muslim leaders have been scrambling to fill what they describe as a void in their connection with young people, searching for new ways to counter the influence of the extremists whom young people might encounter, especially online. "I'm really concerned about what the Internet is doing to my young people," said Mohamed Magid, imam at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, popularly known as the Adams Center, outside Washington. "I used to not be worried about the radicalism of our youth. But now, after this, I'm worried more", he told the Washington Post on Friday. Since Sept. 11, 2001, as American Muslims have seen repeated arrests of young European Muslims on terrorism charges, many in this country came to believe that the stronger integration of young American Muslims in the United States would help immunize them against the disaffection that leads to extremism. Magid said he has met in recent years with other Muslim leaders to talk about social networking to counter radicalism in Europe, "but we never thought about it for here." Now, Magid said, "I have to be a virtual imam," meaning that Muslim groups need a larger and more effective online presence. Referring to extremists, he said: "Twenty-four hours, they're available. I want to be able to respond to that." For some, a new approach cannot come too soon. Zaki Barzinji, 20, a northern Virginia native and former president of Muslim Youth of North America, said mosques are "sort of in the Stone Age when it comes to outreach. Their youth programs are not attractive, not engaging. They're shooting in the dark because it's always adults who are planning this outreach." Nor is the threat limited to the Internet, Barzinji said, adding that groups of "traveling Muslim proselytizers" sometimes appear at Virginia Tech, where he is a senior, often attracting foreign students, who tend to be more socially isolated. Barzinji said Muslim groups should create online forums where young Muslims can find answers from authoritative sources. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman at the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he spent a recent day at work with a copy of "The Social Media Bible," trying to figure out how to do just that. One idea: a Web portal offering video explanations of Koranic verses that are sometimes misinterpreted by radicals, as well as suggestions of what Hooper called "positive things you can do to rectify injustice." Still, some experts and religious leaders contend whether those measures provide a guarantee to achieve complete success. They doubt that they could still leave some cracks through which a few young people could slip through. And the results can be devastating for the whole community. "They ruin it for the rest of us," said Azraf Ullah, 15, of northern Virginia, who was attending a Scout meeting at the ADAMS center this month. "We have to work harder to show that we're not that." Magid, the imam, said Muslim leaders should be more active on social networking sites and should create an online network of imams to talk to young people, "even addressing questions about jihad," he said, adding that it is no longer enough to rely only on mosque-based Scout troops, basketball teams and religion classes. Hooper said some leaders are discussing an Islamic Peace Corps through which youths could help Muslims in underdeveloped countries. But some advocate a more adventuresome approach, borrowing from the extremists' methods. "A 20-year-old, he's not satisfied with a canned food drive to solve the world's problems," said another religious leader. "You've got to give them something more, even a little macho.
