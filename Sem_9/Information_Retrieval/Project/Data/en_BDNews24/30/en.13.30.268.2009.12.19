 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Developing nations have spoken out vehemently against a climate pact brokered in Copenhagen by US president Barack Obama, saying it was undemocratically "imposed" and negates two years of work. Lumumba Di-Aping, the Sudanese negotiator for the group of 132 developing countries known as G77, called the outcome of the UN climate talks "a gross violation of the tradition of the United Nations". He also said the deal reached locks developing countries and the poor of developing countries "into a cycle of poverty for ever". "Today's events ... represent the worst development in climate negotiation and history," Di-Aping told a press conference Friday midnight in an immediate reaction to the 'Copenhagen Accord'. He said the deal, with the lowest level of ambition in terms of temperature and emission reduction targets, would result in massive devastation in Africa and small island states. "Gross violations have been committed today. Against the poor, against the tradition of transparency and participation on equal footing by all nations and parties to the convention and against common sense". Di-Aping said Obama "defiantly eliminated any difference between him and the Bush tradition and era". "Because the architecture of this deal is extraordinary flawed. What has happened to day confirms, what we have been suspicious of that a deal would be superimposed by United States with the help of the Danish Government and all nations of the world". "A deal cannot be super imposed on the parties. It simply says there is no respect for any instructional frame, democracy and transparency and there is no respect for sovereign states" Di-Aping told the press conference. "Because 28 countries decided on behalf of the rest." Di-Aping said G77 member states have not yet received the official text of the deal. Regarding their acceptance or rejection of the deal, he said: "We are still discussing, we have not yet received the document." 'UNACCEPTABLE' Individual delegates of several developing nations and four major emerging economies also rejected the climate deal on Saturday, saying it could not become a UN blueprint for fighting global warming. "I regret to inform you that Tuvalu cannot accept this document," said Ian Fry of the low-lying Pacific island state that fears rising sea levels. At an extra night session in Copenhagen after most leaders left, he said that a goal in the document for limiting global warming to a maximum rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times was too lax. Delegates of Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua also angrily denounced the Accord, saying it would not help address global warming and was unfairly worked out behind closed doors at the December 7-18 conference. Earlier, European Union nations reluctantly agreed to sign up for the accord worked out at a summit of 120 leaders by the United States, China, India, South Africa and Brazil -- meant as the first UN climate pact since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. For any deal to become a UN pact, however, it would need to be adopted unanimously at the 193-nation talks. If some nations are opposed, only its supporters would adopt the deal -- currently a group of major nations representing more than half the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Even backers of the accord conceded it was imperfect and fell far short of UN ambitions for the Copenhagen talks, meant as a turning point to push the world economy toward renewable energy and away from fossil fuels. 'FURTHER TO GO' Before leaving Copenhagen, Obama said the deal, which holds out the prospect of an annual $100 billion in aid for developing nations by 2020, was a starting point for world efforts to slow climate change. "This progress did not come easily and we know this progress alone is not enough," he said after talks with China's Premier Wen Jiabao and leaders of India, South Africa and Brazil. "We've come a long way but we have much further to go," he said of the deal, meant to prevent more heatwaves, floods, wildfires, mudslides and rising ocean levels. China, the world's largest emitter, expressed satisfaction with the deal. "The meeting has had a positive result, everyone should be happy," said Xie Zhenhua, head of China's climate delegation. European nations were lukewarm.
