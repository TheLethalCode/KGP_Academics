 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is increasing election expenses and deposits for the mayoral candidates in upcoming Dhaka City Corporation election, an official says . DCC mayoral candidates have to deposit Tk 1 lakh and their election expenses have been determined at Tk 30 lakh, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at his office on Monday. These measures have been taken to prevent fake candidacy, he added. In case of local elections, according to Sakhawat, election expenses will range from Tk 5 lakh to Tk 30 lakh in proportion to the number of the voters of an constituency. The same applies for Chittagong City Corporation (CCC). All mayoral candidates will be asked to deliver speeches on the same stage, the election commissioner said. The EC would arrange congregations in four different places but the candidates will not be allowed go for door-to-door campaigns or public meetings to seek votes. The candidates can arrange road meetings but not use more than one loudspeaker, he added. Sakhawat also said that they plan to hold all the local elections by 2010. The EC has already announced plans to hold DCC elections in March 2010. bdn
