 Dhaka, Dec 24, (bdnews24.com)Warid Telecom has teamed up with eminent filmmaker Mustafa Sarwar Farooqui for a new campaign that features 17 television commercials promoting 17 selected Value Added Services The campaign was launched Thursday at the Star Cineplex of the city's Bashundhara shopping mall by the company's chief commercial officer (CCO) Marius Voinea. Chief executive officer Muneer Farooqui was also present at the occasion. Speaking at the launch, Voinea said stiff competition and rising consumer demands of the market has triggered the need of VAS besides the basic voice service. VAS offers potential for customers to enjoy a variety of features to fulfill communication requirements, according to the Warid CCO. "Revenue from VAS is also increasing." Referring to a report on the South Asian telecom scenario, he said VAS revenues now accounts about 8 percent of the total revenue where as a few years back it was hovering around 2.5 percent. "To my knowledge, this is the biggest ever VAS set and the biggest campaign in the history of Bangladesh with 17 TVCs [television commercials]."
