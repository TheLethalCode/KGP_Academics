<TITLE> Energy adviser dismisses bribe story </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister's adviser on energy affairs Towfique-e-Elahi Chowdhury brushed aside a recent bribe allegation in a newspaper report. He said the report was politically motivated and designed to tarnish the image of the government. "There is not a shred of truth in the report," he said. The Daily Amar Desh newspaper recently carried a report saying Chowdhury and prime minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajib Wajed Joy had taken $2 million in 'kickbacks' from foreign investors in Dallas, Texas, USA on Oct 14. Those who published the report must prove its authenticity, Chowdhury said at a news conference at energy and mineral resources division at the Secretariat on Sunday. Otherwise, he said, they will have to face legal action because it is unethical for a newspaper to publish such a false and baseless report. "I flew to Dallas to attend a seminar in October but I neither met with Joy nor had any talks with him," the adviser asserted. "I was on board the plane on the day the bribe was reported to have been received," he added. The press conference was held to present results of the Dec 15-16 London Road Show for wooing investment into the Bangladesh power and energy sector. The energy adviser said 78 firms--22 of them owned by non-resident Bangladeshis---participated in the road show, and 30 firms showed interest in investment after bilateral talks. He said a proposal for generating 3,900 megawatt electricity -- 2600 MW by coal and 1300 MW by gas -- was made in the programme. Investment worth nearly $ 5billion will be needed. Bidding for pre-qualification assessment will be invited in January to implement the project and the process will hopefully be complete by June, he said. Chowdhury said such road shows will also be arranged in Singapore and Washington in the future. State minister for power Enamul Haque and power secretary Abul Kalam Azad, energey secretary Mohammed Mohsin and PDB chairman Alamgir Hossain were also present at the press conference. bdne
