<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for law Quamrul Islam on Sunday said he might lodge complaint at the Supreme Judicial Council against Supreme Court judge Justice Nozrul Islam Chowdhury for his comment on the passage of laws in parliament. A censure motion might also be moved in parliament, he said at a press briefing at his office on Sunday. Quamrul claimed that Justice Islam ridiculed the process of the passage of laws in parliament at a recent round-table discussion. Terming the judge's remark 'shameful' and 'in breach of the code of conduct', the state minister said that the judge cannot make such comments openly as he is still working as a judge in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court. Quamrul dismissed suggestions that his criticism in anyway amounted to contempt of court. Parliament is the highest forum. The judge or anyone else cannot speak against it. It is his job to explain the laws passed by the parliament. If there are any faults, he can mention them in his judgment, but he cannot comment openly like this, said Quamrul. bdnews
