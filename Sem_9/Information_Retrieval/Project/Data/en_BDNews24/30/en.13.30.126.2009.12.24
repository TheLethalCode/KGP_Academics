<TITLE> Gates seeks to overhaul US foreign policy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)It's not a done deal yet but a new plan by US defense secretary Robert Gates could significantly overhaul American foreign policy to focus on shoring up 'failing states' around the world. The approach aims to address 'new threats' to US national security. According to an unclassified memo obtained by the Washington Post on Wednesday, Gates' proposal targets more funds for nation-building, especially in those countries that are on the verge of becoming failed states and are most likely to provide safe haven to terrorist organisations like the Al-Qaeda and Taliban. The proposal also goes beyond the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to address what the military increasingly sees as new threats to the United States -- failing states such as Yemen and Somalia that could provide a haven for terrorist groups. The proposal -- sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Dec 15 -- would concentrate existing and new money in three long-term funds, totaling as much as $2 billion for nation-building, aiming for more efficient and better managed spending through streamlining the bureaucracies of the Defense and State Departments. Perennial rivalry between the Defense and State has often bedeviled American efforts to stabilise war-torn countries in the past. The rivalry issue has come to fresh focus because of the ongoing problems stymieing the U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The recent huge increase in Pentagon funding for stabilisation efforts in those countries has prompted complaints about militarisation of U.S. foreign policy. According to the memo, the new funds would be dedicated to training security forces, preventing conflicts and stabilising violence-torn societies around the world. The funds would exist separately from the war budgets, and allow for quicker and better-coordinated response to looming or actual conflicts. Under Gates's proposal, State and Defense would provide money from their own budgets -- either contributing 50/50 or according to each department's priorities. The departments would select the projects together. Gates painted different scenarios for launching the three funds in 2011. The most ambitious envisions a $1 billion fund to train and equip foreign security forces and another $1 billion for conflict prevention and stabilisation. "Such an approach would dramatically increase non-military assistance," the memo says. While the proposal sounds ambitious and innovative, several legislative aides and a senior administration official said Gates's idea for joint funds might not fly, given that the multiple congressional committees that oversee the Defense and State budgets are unlikely to cede control. More broadly, the plan could raise concerns that the Defense Department is trying to expand its growing role in institution-building, which was traditionally carried out by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In recent years, the Pentagon has become more active in that area through its $350-million-a-year Global Train and Equip Program and the Commander's Emergency Response Program, which allows officers to hand out small grants for starting businesses or doing community projects. That program received about $1.5 billion in 2009. "Gates's proposal goes well beyond current Defense Department involvement in stabilisation and conflict prevention," said Gordon Adams, a defense and foreign affairs budgeting expert at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank. "And the sizeable money they're asking for seems unrealistic." Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said the proposal wasn't a Pentagon power play but "an attempt to get people out of the business-as-usual approach." "We need to be much more quick to respond to allies who are in need of security assistance so they can handle these problems and they don't devolve into emergencies that require American forces," he said. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said the department was reviewing the memo. "It contains some creative ideas on moving forward. Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates share an interest in improving the security assistance process," he said.
