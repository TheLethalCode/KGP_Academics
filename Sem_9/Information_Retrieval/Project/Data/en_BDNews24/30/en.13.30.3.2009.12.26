<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)BNP's criticism of the role of Bangladesh at Copenhagen climate conference came from ignorance, the state minister for environment said on Friday. Hassan Mahmud hit back at the main opposition party after its standing committee member Abdul Moeen Khan claimed that Bangladesh had failed to effectively raise its interest at the recent conference. Khan had said at a news conference on Thursday claimed that Bangladesh had failed to take the lead in forcing a legally binding carbon emission cut target on rich countries. He alleged that the government delegates miserable failed on that score. Mahmud alleged that BNP was trying to derive political leverage out of a national issue such as climate change. Speaking at an impromptu press conference during the ceremony marking the centennial of Chittagong Government Muslim High School, he said Bangladesh had gained a lot from Copenhagen summit. The junior minister said it is the BNP, not government, that is playing dirty politics over a sensitive issue like climate change, which is a cause of concern for the entire world, not only Bangladesh. He said Bangladesh's position and proposals at the summit were prepared at a special meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on environment ministry in presence of committee chairman Abdul Mobin Talukder. Talukder is a BNP MP and two other legislators of that party, Nilufer Chowdhury and Majharul Alam Prodhan, went to Copenhagen with the government delegation, Mahmud pointed out. So, he said, BNP should not differ with the agreed stance now. As a country greatly affected by the climate change, Bangladesh raised its voice there very well under the leadership of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On top of that, world leaders, including US president Barack Obama, deliberated on the havoc wrought by climate changes on Bangladesh, the state minister argued. Moreover, he added, the prime minister was instrumental the constitution of a global fund for the most vulnerable and least developed countries. Her resolve and tireless efforts meant the clauses on initiatives for the most vulnerable and LDCs were included, according to Mahmud. bdne
