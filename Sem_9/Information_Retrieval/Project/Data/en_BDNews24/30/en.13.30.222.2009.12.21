 CUTTACK, India, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja took a career-best four for 32 to restrict Sri Lanka to 239 all out in the third one-day international on Monday. The five-match series is tied 1-1. Openers Upul Tharanga (73) and Tillakaratane Dilshan (41) gave Sri Lanka a spectacular start after they had opted to bat first before the Indian spinners, led by Jadeja, took charge. Tharanga put on 65 with Dilshan, whose first eight scoring shots were boundaries, and 100 for the second with captain Kumar Sangakkara (46). But their last nine wickets fell for the addition of just 74 runs and the visitors were dismissed with 5.4 overs to spare. Dilshan, who hit centuries in the first two games, tore into the new-ball pair of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma as Sri Lanka raced to 50 in 3.4 overs. But he then top-edged Ashish Nehra to wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, playing in the place of the suspended Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Stand-in skipper Virender Sehwag broke the second wicket stand by having Sangakkara stumped before Jadeja clean-bowled the left-handed Tharanga with a big-spinning delivery. Mahela Jayawardene's poor form continued as he fell to off-spinner Harbhajan Singh for two and Jadeja forced Chamara Kapugedera (15) to play on to the stumps. Jadeja finished his spell of 10 consecutive overs with the wickets of Nuwan Kulasekasra (10) and Ajantha Mendis (6) before Nehra finished the innings by bowling Lasith Malinga (13).
