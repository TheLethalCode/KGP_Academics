<TEXT>
 (CORRECTION IN SECOND PARAGRAPH - letter quoted Khaleda Zia) Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP has withdrawn its expulsion order for former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, his assistant said on Saturday. Haidar Ali told bdnews24.com that a letter containing the withdrawal of his expulsion order had been received at Babar's residence. He said the letter quoted BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, saying: "The party hopes (Babar) will contribute to increasing its political and organisational strength with sincerity and efficiency." BNP expelled Babar from the party on Dec 27 2008, two days before the ninth parliamentary elections, because of his alleged links to the party's so-called "reformist" faction. The former state minister is now behind bars facing charges in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Babar was originally arrested in May 2007 under emergency rules and sentenced to 17 years by a special court in an arms case. He contested from Netrokona-4 as an independent candidate in the last general elections following his expulsion. Babar was a close party colleague of Tarique Rahman, Khaleda's elder son, who has recently been promoted to the powerful new post of BNP senior vice chairman. b
