 Arshad Mahmud Washington, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)The dawn broke Sunday bright and clear with the morning sun spreading a wash of orange across the sky in and around Washington. After a miserable, gloomy day of unrelenting snowfall, the bright morning brought a sense of relief to all of us. We have been stuck in our home for over 36 years since the snowfall began on Friday evening. But as soon as I looked out the window my heart sankliterally. Mounds of snow covered our area in Centreville just outside Washington and I kept thinking how I am going to dig out of this terrible mess. Frankly, it was much worse than I had expected. In our nearly seven years in Washington, we never experienced this amount of snow. In fact, when it finally stopped in the wee hours of Sunday it broke all previous records, dumping some 24 inches of snow in our area. (Doug Hill, the ABC 7 respected meteorologist, said this snow fall was worse than 1932 when Washington got more than 15 inches). As I kept worrying about the way out, I saw many of our neighbors armed with shovels began clearing their driveways. While I thought of joining them, I realized I had no shovel to work with. Nasreen, my wife, kept telling me to buy a shovel but I never took her advice seriously as Washington hardly gets much snow. In desperation I called Erik Simpson, my next door neighbor, for help. To my horror, he said he didn't have a shovel either. Fortunately, he found one from another neighbor and promised to give it to me after he was done. When he finished at around 10-30 am, I got down but couldn't open the door because of the snow. Erik advised me to come out through the garage door, which fortunately I could open without much difficulty. In no time, I got down to work. But the job proved formidable. I kept thinking how am I going to clear our drive way all by myself. I asked Nasreen to call my son, Asif, to come home quickly but he said he was stuck at his friend's house because of the snow. On Friday evening, both Asif and our daughter, Fariha, had gone to their friends' house promising to return the next morning. With no help forthcoming I had no choice but to work all by myself. By the time I finished after two and a half hours I was totally exhausted and had very little energy to climb upstairs. Unable to walk, I just slumped and spread myself on the stair. The situation got so worse that Adrian Fenty, the Mayor of Washingto, declared emergency. So did Virginia governor Tim Kaine. He called over 600 National Guards to help the police and other road crew. The Federal authorities declared all government agencies closed on Monday. These measures would perhaps give some idea of the readers about the magnitude of the disaster that had befallen greater Washington and a large part of the Northeast that includes the states of West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Many area rodas are still impassable after nearly 36 hours. Airports were slowly struggling back to a semblance of normalcy. By Sunday morning, Dulles International outside Washington was handling arriving flights while still plowing away a thick blanket of snow, and Baltimore-Washington International Airport was trying to restore full operations. Amid all the disasters, there were some bright spots. Some area residents took advantage of the heavy snow skiing on the roads. Some also found it convenient to walk into a movie theatre, which somehow managed to keep open.
