 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  With 'Digital Bangladesh' high on its agenda, the Bangladesh government is looking to India for tips on digitisation and computerisation of land records. A delegation led by land minister Md Rezaul Karim Hira is currently on a tour to India for studying the Indian government's programme for modernisation of the land record system in the country. The delegation on Friday met officials of the rural development ministry in New Delhi and was briefed about India's National Land Record Modernisation Programme (NLRMP). India's minister of state for rural development, Sishir Adhikary, welcomed Hira at his office in the Krishi Bhavan in New Delhi, before the two delegations shared ideas on land records management. Adhikary highlighted the purpose of modernisation of land records in India and stressed the citizen focus of the NLRMP and its role as a comprehensive tool for supporting and planning the government's developmental and regulatory work. Chinmoy Basu, additional secretary in the department of land resources, briefed the visiting delegation from Bangladesh about the salient features and innovations under the NLRMP Hira lauded India's role in the freedom movement and subsequent development of Bangladesh. He sought inputs from India in land record management in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh delegation will also travel to Indian states of West Bengal and Karnataka to study the land record management system there. Karnataka is the first Indian state to launch digitisation of the land record system. Bhoomi  the Karnataka government's programme for land record computerisation  began in 2001, covering just 177 'taluka' (small administrative unit) headquarters of the state. The project now has a network of over a thousand offices (including the latest privately run centres), all linked through internet to a central depository to which all earlier physical land records have been digitised and transferred. India's Union Government has conceived the NLRMP on the lines of the Bhoomi. West Bengal is one of the four Indian States to receive installments of the Central fund for computerisation of land records and other related works under the NLRMP in the 2009-10 financial year. Apart from Hira, the Bangladeshi delegation included state minister for land, Mostafizur Rahman; member of parliament and chairman of the standing committee on the ministry of land, S K M. Mozammel Huq; member of parliament and member of the standing committee on ministry of land resources, Benjir Ahmed; and other officials.
