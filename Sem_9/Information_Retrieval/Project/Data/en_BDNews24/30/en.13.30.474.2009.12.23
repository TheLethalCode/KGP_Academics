 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will publish the updated voters' list on February 3, ahead of Dhaka City Corporation elections, an election commissioner said on Wednesday. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has already said the DCC elections, delayed by two and a half years, will be held by March. Before publishing the final list the EC will make an 'updated' draft voters' list public on January 3 to seek claims and objections from individuals, Sohul Hossain told reporters at the Election Commission office. Those who earlier failed to enrol themselves as voters will have their names in the final voters' list through application to the election commission by January 18, he said. Preparation for the announcement of Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) election schedule will also be taken shortly after the final voters' list comes out, he added. The election schedule of the Dhaka City Corporation might be announced in mid-February, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said on Tuesday. The rules and regulations relating to the polls will be finalised in January. The tenures of the current DCC elected officials, including mayor, expired on May 24, 2007. Voter lists with photographs were introduced in Bangladesh in 2007. This is the first update of the Dhaka voter roll since then. bdnews
