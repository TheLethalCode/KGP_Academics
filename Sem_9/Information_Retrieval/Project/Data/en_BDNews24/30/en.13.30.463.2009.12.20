 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)--The government on Sunday decided to cut interest rates to eight percent on loans for state-owned jute mills to let them pay back. The banks have also been asked to provide loan facilities to those mills. However, the jute mills under private ownership would not get the facilities, but the banks have been told to sanction quick loans on easy interest to those, jute and textile minister Abdul Latif Siddique told a meeting at the Secretariat. The meeting, attended by officials from the ministry, BJMC, the central bank and the banks, decided to cut maximum five percent on their fixed 11 to 13 percent interest on loans. But the BJMC proposed for lowering the lending rate to seven percent. The banks, who the state-owned 16 jute mills owe Tk 6,380 million, have stopped granting new loans. As a result, those mills are facing problems in buying raw materials and production, Bangladesh Bank and Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation officials said in the meeting. Jute secretary Ashraful Moqbul said the state-owned mills took loans on 11 to 13 percent interest but could not pay back, which is why the banks have stopped to provide new loans. The decision of cutting interest rates was made to resolve the problem, he added. BJMC will get two and a half years (31 months) to start paying the installments. The meeting also asked the banks to extend loans to the mills on current rates. Asked if the mills are capable to pay back, Moqbul said the situation is far better now than it was before. The production has increased to 600 tonnes from 350 tonnes this year. bd
