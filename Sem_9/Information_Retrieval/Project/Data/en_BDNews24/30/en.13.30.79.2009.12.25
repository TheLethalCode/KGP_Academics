<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will fly to New Delhi on Jan 10 for a much-anticipated summit with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, foreign minister Dipu Moni has said. The foreign minister told reporters Thursday that Sheikh Hasina would discuss the critical matter of sharing water of the common river Teesta, among a gamut of bilateral issues. "We are in negotiations on Teesta water sharing. The Indian water resources secretary is coming to Bangladesh on Jan 3 to expedite the negotiation," Dipu Moni told a press briefing at the foreign ministry. Teesta is important to Bangladesh as its largest irrigation project is dependent on the common river. Bangladesh Water Development Board sources say over 750,000 hectares of land is irrigated by the Teesta. Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to visit New Delhi earlier this month, but the trip was deferred as both she and Manmohan Singh were attending the UN climate conference in Copenhagen.
