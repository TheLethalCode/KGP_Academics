 Gazipur, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  The handcuffed body of a man found in Gazipur Friday has been identified by his relatives. The deceased's elder brother Zamaluddin Chowdhury identified him on Saturday as Shyamal Chowdhury, 32. The family is originally from Nurpur village of Akhaura thana in Brahmanbaria. Bhairab police chief Abul Kasem Akand said the brother had filed a case with Bhairab police against four men including Gazipur Department of Narcotics Control on-duty officer Mizanur Rahman. Zamaluddin claimed Shyamal had left for Dhaka by the Surma Mail train at 4am Friday. "At around 9am, one of the accused, a man named Manik from Narsingdi, contacted me and said Shyamal was being held by Mizan and demanded extortion money. However, Gazipur Department of Narcotics Control inspector Mehedi Hasan, denying the allegation against one of his officers, said they raided the train and recovered 10 bottles of Phensidyl from Shyamal. "Shyamal was later handcuffed and while the police were making a list of arrestees, he jumped off the train," Hasan said. bdnew
