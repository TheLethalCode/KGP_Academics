 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP on Saturday vowed to uphold multi-party democracy and protect national security under the leadership of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said: "BNP workers and the people in general are happy about Khaleda Zia retaining chairmanship of the party and Tarique Rahman becoming senior vice-chairman." "Multi-party democracy, sovereignty and independence will remain secured under their leadership." Delwar was speaking to party supporters before the start of a procession from the Naya Paltan party headquarters to mark the elections of Khaleda and Tarique at BNP's Dec 8 national council. Meanwhile, BNP earlier Saturday reinstated former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, who was expelled from the party on Dec 27 2008, two days before the ninth parliamentary elections, because of alleged links to the party's so-called "reformist" faction. Babar was a close party colleague of Tarique Rahman, Khaleda's elder son, who has just been promoted to the powerful new post of BNP senior vice chairman. Babar's personal assistant Haidar Ali told bdnews24.com the letter received at Babar's residence quoted BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, saying: "The party hopes (Babar) will contribute to increasing its political and organisational strength with sincerity and efficiency." The former state minister is now behind bars facing charges in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. Babar was originally arrested in May 2007 under emergency rules and sentenced to 17 years by a special court in an arms case. bdnews2
