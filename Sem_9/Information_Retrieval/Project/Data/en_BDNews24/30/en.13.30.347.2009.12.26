 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has warned that actions will be taken against authorities of the educational institutes which do not enroll disabled students. "If the handicapped are received cordially in educational institutions they will recover fast from their disability," Hasina said in her address at a programme marking the 18th International Disability Day at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Saturday. "Disability is not a disease; it is part of a freak human nature," she said. The PM said the government will raise the stipend to ensure their education. Hasina also asked the corporate sector and private organisations to create scope for work for the disabled people. The prime minister said she will talk to the finance minister asking him if the organisations that create employment for the disabled people can get tax rebate. Hasina asked for modification of Disabled Welfare Act, formulated in 2001. She ordered to make special arrangements in transports for them. The PM also asked for arrangements for their participation in information and communication technology, sports and culture. Hasina reminded the ministries of the special quota for the disabled people. bdnew
