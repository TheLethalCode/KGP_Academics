 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)British and Spanish police have seized one of the single largest hauls of cocaine, estimated to be 1.5 tonnes, from a ship bound for northern Spain. The joint operation was assisted by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre. Spanish police boarded the 150ft former coastguard vessel, named The Destiny Empress, 200 miles off the Iberian coast on Tuesday (Dec 22) at 08:00 in the morning. The ship - which was en route from the West Indies - was taken into port where it was searched by Spanish police. The searches revealed a consignment of cocaine stored in the hold - with initial measurements suggesting it totals at least 1.5 tonnes. This would have a street value of 375 million in the UK. It is believed that the vast majority of these drugs were destined for London. Police made number of arrests including members of the ship's crew. Police say the drug smugglers in this case are experienced criminals with long-standing associations. Their network stretches from London and Spain to the Caribbean and Colombia.
