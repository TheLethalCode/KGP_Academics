 STOCKHOLM, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbian President Boris Tadic will travel to Stockholm on Tuesday to submit a formal application for European Union membership, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on Saturday. "Clearly this is an historic and important step for Serbia," Bildt, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, wrote in a website blog.

Earlier this month, the EU unblocked an interim trade deal providing for the abolition of customs duties over six years and the reform of Serbia's law on competition and state subsidies. But the crucial ratification of the EU's pre-membership Stabilisation and Association Agreement remains on hold because the Netherlands wants to see Mladic, sought for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, first extradited to the Hague tribunal. Dutch peacekeepers who served as part of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia were deployed in and around Srebrenica in 1995, but did not have enough weapons or the mandate to prevent the killin
