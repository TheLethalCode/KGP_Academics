 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has decided to mark January 11 as 'black day' and January 25 as 'democracy killing day', BNP secretary general Delwar Hossain said Saturday. "Some army personnel entering Bangabhaban on January 11, 2007 compelled the then president Iajuddin Ahmed to impose emergency rule in the country and thus foiled the process of democracy," Delwar said at a press briefing. The BNP leader was speaking at a press briefing after a party joint meeting at the Naya Paltan headquerters Saturday afternoon. "Similarly, on January 25, 1975 the then ruling Awami League imposed a one-party rule by establishing BAKSAL killing multiparty democracy." He, however, said the decision was discussed in the joint meeting, but not finalised. BNP will also observe its founder Ziaur Rahman's 74th birth anniversary on January 19, said Delwar. About the imposition of emergency rule, Delwar said, "That was a designed to obstruct the functioning of the constitution. Nation will observe this day (Jan 11) as a black day." Indicating AL's establishing BAKSAL, Delwar said: "Awami League launched one-party rule to establish BAKSAL by making fourth amendment (of constitution). They allowed only four newspapers banning all others and enacted Special Powers Act depriving political workers of their democratic rights." BNP's standing committee member Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, joint secretary general Amanullah Aman, woman lawmaker Shammi Akhter and other leaders were present at the press conference. bdn
