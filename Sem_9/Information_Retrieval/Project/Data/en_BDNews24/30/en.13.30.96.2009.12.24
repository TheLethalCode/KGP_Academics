 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)At least five million people are Internet users in Bangladesh, with the number rising by three percent a year, the ICT secretary said on Thursday. About 4.6 million mobile phone subscribers use Internet services, while 0.4 million people access the service through public and private companies, Abdul Awal Majumder told a briefing on 'Digital Bangladesh' at the Information Directorate. Thirty percent of the country will have Internet coverage by 2015, he said. The government plans to bring the entire country under Internet network by 2021. Some 77 access points have already been set up across the country to bring the rural population under Internet coverage, Majumdar added. On complaints that government websites are not updated regularly, the secretary said: "Each ministry has assigned a joint secretary to monitor these activities and review them every 15 days." He said his ministry will monitor whether the assigned officials are properly doing their jobs. The Awami League-led coalition government in its election manifesto pledged to build a 'digital Bangladesh'. Explaining the theme Majumder said: "Digital Bangladesh does not mean availability of computer everywhere. "It's a modern philosophy to apply modern technologies in education, health and employment generation, alleviation of poverty and dealing with the impact of crises created due to climate change. "Computer is only a tool here," he said. "Talking only about digital Bangladesh will not do. We need to build a corruption-free society to fulfill it," Majumder added. b
