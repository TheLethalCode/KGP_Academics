 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) --- Clocks will go back again on Dec 31 night, the government decided on Thursday, with mornings getting darker as winter draws in. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government also decided to introduce Daylight Saving Time on an annual basis. Clocks will be advanced by one hour on Mar 31 up to Oct 31, when they will go back again, he said. Bangladesh experimented with Daylight Saving Time for the first time this year, advancing clocks an hour on June 19, for 'an extra hour of daylight' in the evenings to save power in the energy-starved country. But no firm decision was given until Thursday on when clocks would go back again. With the arrival of winter, people with early starts, in particular parents having to take children to school as early as 7am, have been vociferous about the delay in deciding to set clocks back again as mornings get darker. Daylight Saving Time is practised in the summer months by more than 70 countries across the globe. Benjamin Franklin first propounded the idea, while Germany was the first country to advance clocks in 1916 to cut the consumption of coal in wartime. The US followed by putting clocks forward in 1918. PLANETARIUM NAME CHANGE APPROVED Thursday's cabinet meeting also endorsed a bill to rename the Bhashani Novo Theatre (Planetarium) as the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre. It also approved the Bangladesh National Scientific & Technical Documentation Centre Bill-2009, National Science and Technology Museum Bill-2009, National Institute of Biotechnology Bill-2009 and Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority Bill-2009. It also tabled a draft of president Zillur Rahman's speech for the start of the new parliamentary session in January. bdnews
