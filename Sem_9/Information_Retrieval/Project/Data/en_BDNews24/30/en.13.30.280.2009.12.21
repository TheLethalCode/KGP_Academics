 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Monday rejected the comments made by Justice Nozrul Islam Chowdhury on the process of passing laws in parliament, saying the judge made the remarks from ignorance. At a recent round-table discussion, Justice Chowdhury scorned the process of the passage of laws in parliament saying, "Passage of laws is not much difficult (in parliament). Clerks do the drafting and the parliament members take no time to pass them. Most of them even do not read the drafts." Such remarks from a Supreme Court judge are not prudent, said the minister. "I think he did this from ignorance," Shafique told journalists while visiting the tribunal for the trial of war criminals in the old Supreme Court building. "These kinds of comments regarding parliament members are not sensible for a sitting judge. Parliament members are also embarrassed," he said. The minister said parliament members pass laws. But prior to this, those are approved by the cabinet and moved in parliament as bills. After that, the laws are sent to the standing committee on law for further scrutiny. Answering to a query whether Supreme Judicial Council will be formed, the minister said, "This is not my concern. However, if anyone lodges complaints, president can ask the chief justice to form the council." State minister for law Quamrul Islam, who was also present there, told the reporters he would lodge complaints against justice Nozrul Islam Chowdhury next Sunday. bdne
