 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  Five Supreme Court judges, in their judgement on the Bangabandhu murder appeals, censured the failure to act of subsequent governments in bringing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's killers to justice. "The Appellate Division highlighted the inaction regarding the killing, terming it, in a civilised society, unfortunate and shameful," attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after receiving a release of the full judgement. The five Appellate Division judges who last month upheld death sentences of five convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case signed and submitted the full 412-page judgement on the appeals on Dec 17. The release of the full text makes way for the next phase of legal procedures, including possible review and clemency petitions by the convicts condemned to death. The attorney general said justice Mohammed Tafazzul Islam handed down the main verdict with the four other judges in agreement. Three of the judges also gave personal opinions. Islam, in his judgement, pronounced: "[S]uccessive Governments expressly as well as impliedly prevented the institution of the case against the appellants and other accused persons by promulgating Indemnity Ordinance 1975 and protected the appellants and other accuseds persons as would be evident from the fact that after the incidents the appellants and other accuseds not only remained under the shelter of the then governments but also held influential and powerful positions." "Had the Governments in power not supported the killing, it was the bounden duty of the Governments in power to institute a case for ascertaining the cause for the death and bring the killers to justice." Islam said if no case was filed against the killers by anyone on behalf of the victims, the state according to law was under obligations to institute a case "specially when an elected President was brutally killed along with his family." The judge said the accused not only committed an offence of murder, "they also committed atrocities against humanity by killing a child and three innocent women." The judge said the officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi Police Station was also under an obligation to hold investigation into the offence without an order of a Magistrate and to submit a report. The entire administration "from the top to the bottom" failed to perform their responsibilities, said Islam. He termed it as a "scandalous chapter in our history and this sort of practice should be stopped forever and it should not be allowed to repeat again." "The State as a guardian of fundamental rights of its citizens is duty bound to ensure the administration of justice and the rule of law," said the senior judge. Five former army officers convicted of the Aug 15 1971 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family members appealed their death sentences in the case: Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM Mohiuddin, Bazlul Huda and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. The convicts appealed to the Supreme Court for reducing the death penalty to life sentence, Alam said. "The Supreme Court judged that there was no scope to commute the death sentence for the brutal and hateful killing." After analysing all the evidence, the Appellate Division bench decided that the death sentence was appropriate, Alam said. Defence counsels argued the killings should have been tried as a mutiny under the Army Act, and the trial and conviction of the five appellants under criminal law were invalid. The Supreme Court judged that the killings were not part of a mutiny, but a conspiracy to kill Sheikh Mujib and his family. bdn
