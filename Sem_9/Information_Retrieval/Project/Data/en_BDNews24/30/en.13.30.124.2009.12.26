 CARACAS, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nine sailors were killed and five were burned in a Christmas Day blaze aboard a Greek freighter in waters off a Venezuelan Caribbean island, the official Venezuelan news agency ABN reported on Friday. It quoted Admiral Carlos Maximo Aniasi, commander of Venezuela's navy, as saying the blaze broke out in an engine room of the "Aegean Wind" before dawn and spread upward on the vessel which was carrying iron ore from Brazil to Houston and had a 24-strong crew.

Lugo told Reuters the lifeboats of the "Aegean Wind" were intact on the ship, with no signs that there had been efforts to loosen them to abandon ship. The Venezuelan navy sent a patrol boat with paramedics and rescue personnel to further search the ship below deck, which was filled with thick smoke, he said. A coast guard official said the blaze was under control. The Venezuelan navy is sending a helicopter with navy firemen on board to extinguish the blaze, the admiral told Globovision TV. Earlier on Friday, a Greek coast guard official said in Athens: "The fire is under control, there is no risk of sinking. Of the missing crew, three are Greek and the rest Philippine nationals."
