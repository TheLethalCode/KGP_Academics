 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com) Senior BNP leader Mahbubur Rahman on Friday slammed Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam for his 'undemocratic' remarks about BNP's new leadership. "His speech on our party's recent leadership, elected by a successful council, is a reflection of undemocratic and fascist attitude," Mahbub, the party's policymaking standing committee member, told reporters at the National Press Club after attending a programme. "Those who talk about our elected committee do not believe in democracy. His words are acceptable by no means," he added. Syed Ashraf on Thursday said corruption will vastly rise if BNP comes to power again since the corrupt and looters have been given important positions. Mahbub, a former army chief, said, "Our leadership is elected through a democratic process. The Awami League could not say so if it was democratic. "A combination of young and old leaders were picked in the committee which is a good. BNP has turned back again," he claimed. The party will move forward on a different path, he hoped. The main opposition held its fifth national council on Dec 8 after a long hiatus of 16 years. The council expanded the standing committee, reelected Khaleda Zia as chairperson and made her elder son Tarique Rahman the senior vice chairman, a move that gave him greater power in the party. Khaleda later announced 19-strong standing committee and seven joint secretaries general. bd
