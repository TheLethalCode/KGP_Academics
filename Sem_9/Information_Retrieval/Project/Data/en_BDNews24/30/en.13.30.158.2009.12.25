 VATICAN CITY, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The woman who lunged at Pope Benedict and caused him to hit the floor at the start of his Christmas eve mass was "psychologically unstable" and was not armed, the Vatican said on Friday. In its first formal statement on the episode, the Vatican identified the woman as Susanna Maiolo, 25, a dual Italian-Swiss national. It said she was arrested and taken to a medical facility for examinations. It said the pope's schedule would not be changed as a result of the incident.
