 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has suggested the science and technology ministry set up information centres with computer access in every union before the government runs its term. The parliamentary standing committee on the ministry at its meeting on Wednesday recommended equipping the union parishads with computer, Internet and other necessary technologies to serve the grassroots people. It said the information centres would help people in the remotest areas to get information. "The ministry presented its plan to set up information centres in every upazila, but the committee has recommended to do so in every union," Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a committee member, told bdnews24.com at parliament building. He said the science and technology ministry would equip the union parishad, the lowest tier of local government body, with computer, Internet and necessary gadgets to serve people with information on agriculture, migration, jobs. "For instance, a rural mother will be able to go to the information centre to know about her children living abroad," said Palak. He said the ministry would set up some of such centres next year on trial basis. "Moreover, the local government ministry with the help of the UNDP will set up more than 500 information centres," said the committee member. He said Bangladesh Computer Council will provide technical assistance to create human resources to run the information centres. Md Dabirul Islam, the committee chairman, presided over the meeting.
