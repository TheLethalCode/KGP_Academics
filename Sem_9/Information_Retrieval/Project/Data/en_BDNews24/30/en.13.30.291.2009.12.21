 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Monday dismissed an allegation of his party's links with media reports that alleged prime minister's son Sajib Wazed Joy's involvement in corruption. "The AL general secretary's allegation is a downright lie and ill motivated," he said while giving his reaction to the charges made by the Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam that BNP had orchestrated the campaign through the media loyal to the opposition party. The allegation labelled against BNP senior vice-president Tarique Rahman is also baseless and ill-designed. The caretaker government persecuted him through filing false cases, said Delwar while answering reporters' queries after placing bouquet on the grave of BNP founder Ziaur Rahman in the morning. Delwar was accompanied by the newly formed standing committee members, senior joint secretaries and joint secretaries general at Zia's grave. Amar Desh and some other newspapers on Dec 17 published report that said Joy and prime minister's energy adviser Towfique-e-Elahi Chowdhury took Tk 350 million in kickbacks from oil company Chevron in Dallas, Texas, USA on Oct 14. Energy adviser Chowdhury has brushed aside the bribe allegation. Those who published the report must prove its authenticity, Chowdhury said at a news conference on Sunday. At a separate news conference the same day Ashraful Islam, also LGRD minister, in a news conference said: "They (BNP) have resorted to 'such nasty campaign' in an ulterior design to hide the misdeeds of Khaleda Zia and her sons Tarique and (Arafat Rahman) Coco." Delwar, referring to Ashraful's comment on Tarique, said: "It is not correct in the eye of law to jump on labelling someone guilty immediately after accusation. A proper investigation into the allegation has to be done following laws." The ruling party is envious of Tarique's ascending to party politics, Delwar said. "Anybody can enter into politics. It is everybody's birth and fundamental rights. There should be no question about it. One should leave it to the people whether or not he will succeed in politics." Those who went to offer floral wreaths at Zia's grave included standing committee members RA Ghani, Moudud Ahmed, M Shamsul Islam, Tariqul Islam, ASM Hannan Shah, MK Anwar, Sarwari Rahman, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Abdul Moyeen Khan, Nazrul Islam Khan, Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, joint secretary general Amanullah Aman, Mizanur Rahman Minu, Mohammad Shahjahan, Rizvi Ahmed and others. bdnews24
