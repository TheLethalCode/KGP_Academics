<TITLE> Climate talks a success for Bangladesh: Hasan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh achieved success in the Copenhagen climate conference by being recognised as the country "most at risk" from climate change, the state minister for environment said on Tuesday. "Some participating countries were not happy with the outcome of the summit, but we believe it is a great success that an accord was reached," Hasan Mahmud told a briefing at the Secretariat on his return from the Danish capital. Mahmud said countries had agreed to form a climate change fund, and prioritise the least developed and most vulnerable countries, following prime minister Sheikh Hasina "climate diplomacy". "Our climate diplomacy achieved success, through which Bangladesh was able to make a special appeal to the world." "This will help Bangladesh to get compensation more easily in future to deal with the impact of the climate change." He said Bangladesh would get special consideration under a proposed $30 billion climate fund. The state minister said whatever fund is formed Bangladesh will seek compensation based on its at-risk population. "It will be 15 percent of the total fund." Hassan said: "All concerns of Bangladesh have been reflected in the summit. The consensus reached by countries was an achievement though no legally binding agreement was achieved." "Bangladesh played a strong role in preparing Copenhagen Accord. The idea that Bangladesh is the most affected and risky country has been reestablished through the summit." Bangladesh topped the 2009 Global Climate Risk Index published by climate and development group Germanwatch during the Copenhagen talks. But the Dec 7-18 climate conference ended with a bare-minimum agreement when delegates "noted" an accord led by the United States, China, India and other emerging powers. The accord -- weaker than a legally binding treaty and weaker even than the 'political' deal many had foreseen -- fell far short of the conference's original goals. It set a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times -- seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods, droughts, mudslides, sandstorms and rising seas. But it failed to say how this would be achieved. It also held out the prospect of $30 billion in annual aid in the immediate future, building to $100 billion a year from 2020, for developing nations but did not specify precisely where this money would come from. It also pushed decisions on core issues such as emissions cuts into the future. UN climate chief Yvo de Boer said the Copenhagen Accord was little more than "a letter of intent". Another round of climate talks is scheduled for November 2010 in Mexico. Negotiators are hoping to nail down then what they failed to achieve in Copenhagen -- a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. But there are few guarantees. Hasan said he hoped a legally binding agreement will be possible in the COP-16 summit that will take place in Mexico. The state minister also said this is the first time all political parties, civil societies and NGOs in Bangladesh have agreed on the same issue. He criticised opposition leader Khaleda Zia's statement on the climate negotiations last week, in which she said Bangladesh should not "beg" to anybody. Hasan said: "We did not go to beg to anybody. The former prime minister's statement proves her limited knowledge about the summit. Her advisers failed to make her understand fully." Other Bangladesh delegates who attended the Dec 7-18 climate talks in Copenhagen were present in the briefing at the Secretariat. bd
