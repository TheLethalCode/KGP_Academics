 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Defence lawyers in the Bangabandhu murder case received a copy of the full Supreme Court judgement on Tuesday, which upholds death penalties of five convicts that appealed their sentences. The death warrants may be issued to jail authorities on Wednesday, officials said. We have received a copy of the verdict," Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, defence lawyer of two of the convicts, Bazlul Huda, and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com. He said they will submit a petition to the Supreme Court for review of its verdict well before Jan 21. Defendants have 30 days after receiving a copy of the verdict to submit review petitions. In line with Article 105 of the Constitution, execution will be stayed until any review petitions by defendants are settled, Mamun said. Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for convicts Syed Faruq Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, also acknowledged receipt of the verdict. He said his clients too would submit review petitions. Abdur Rezzak Khan, lawyer for Shahriar Rashid Khan, also said he received a verdict copy. The Supreme Court on Nov 19, in a long-pending judgment, rejected the appeals and upheld the death sentences of the five former army officers, convicted for the Aug 15 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family members. The five Appellate Division judges who heard the appeals signed and submitted the full 412-page judgment on the appeals last week. It was released on Sunday (Dec 20). DEATH WARRANTS Following release of the full judgment, death warrants for the convicts might be sent to Dhaka Central Jail authorities on Wednesday, public prosecutor at Dhaka district and sessions judges court Khandaker Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com. In addition, the warrants might be sent to all relevant offices, including Dhaka district magistrate's office, he said. Administrative official Subal Sokha Roy at the same court echoed Mannan. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque, however, has said the death warrants will remain ineffective despite being issued as defendants have expressed intent to submit review petitions. bdne
