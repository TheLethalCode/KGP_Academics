 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - Aman paddy production is expected to surpass the target this year, a trend that could help achieve the national yield forecast and belie ADB's estimate of lower output. Asian Development Bank predicted a drop in agricultural output, which might push the growth of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) down. It said in a recent report that agriculture growth might fall to 4.1 percent from last year's 4.6 percent. It also projected the GDP growth downward to 5.2 percent for fiscal 2009-10 from last year's 6.0 percent. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury revealed the new Aman prospect on Wednesday while addressing a dialogue hosted by Centre for Policy Dialogue. Quoting data, she said Aman production will hit 13.2 million tonnes while the target was 12.7 million tonnes. The higher Aman production will help the country achieve its overall food production target of 35 million tonnes this year, a growth of one percent over 32 million tonnes harvested in the previous year, which was a record. Speaking at the function, executive director of Brac Dr. Mahbub Hossain said, "The demand for food in Bangladesh is about 27 million tonnes and there will a balance between demand and supply if we can produce 30 million tonnes. He said, rise in food price on the world market has triggered a price hike in Bangladesh and so the commerce and food ministry must remain vigilant. PRIORITISING AMAN Earlier on Tuesday, Matia said the government needs to change its strategy of farming paddy by giving more priority to Aman harvest over Boro, which needs irrigation through lifting of underground water that might have arsenic contamination. "Current Aman harvest is small compared with the Boro. We now aim to shift priorities to farming Aman more intensively to address arsenic contamination, which has been a direct adverse result of drawing excessive groundwater required for irrigation of Boro crops," Matia told a workshop at Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council. "We now plan to re-label the south-western region as 'Boro zone' instead of the present northern districts. Farming of Rabi crops also has to be increased. If we succeed in raising the Aman harvest to equal Boro yield, then we may be able to increase production of wheat, pulses, winter vegetables etc lessening our dependence on Boro." This year, an estimated 19 million tonnes of Boro rice production has been envisaged utilising about 4.7 million hectares of land. Advocating the introduction of large-scale Boro farming in the south-west, Matia said, "We'll ask the farmers there to conserve the monsoon flood water in canals, ponds, rivers, rivulets etc and encourage use of that water for irrigating the Boro lands in winter, which will help contain the increasing salinity of water and land in the region." The minister suggested that to enhance Aman yields, farmers should use seeds of improved varieties. Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation has been given Tk 4.0 billion to improve and streamline irrigation systems across the country. Former agriculture secretary Jahurul Karim attending the workshop said, "Paddies constitute about 79.4 percent of our agricultural produces. We now have to increase the yields of both paddies and other crops simultaneously." If farmers aim at harvesting the Aman within November, then its yield will be better gradually and production of other crops will also see a rise, said Karim. "Besides, the 2.85 million hectares of land along our coasts should also be properly harnessed and utilised through drawing up sound plans to save regional biodiversity, enable afforestation and crop production," he said. bdnews24
