 SANAA, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A radical Muslim preacher linked by US intelligence to a gunman who killed 13 people at a US Army base is believed to have died in a Yemen airstrike on al Qaeda militants, a security official said on Thursday. "Anwar al Awlaki is suspected to be dead (in the air raid)," said the Yemeni official, who asked not to be identified. Yemen said 30 militants were killed in the strike in the eastern province of Shabwa. The gunman in the November 5 shooting at the Fort Hood, Texas army base, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, had contacts with Awlaki late last year, US authorities believe.
