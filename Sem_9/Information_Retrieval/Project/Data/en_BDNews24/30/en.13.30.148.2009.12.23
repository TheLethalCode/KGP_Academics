 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Schedule for the Dhaka City Corporation may be declared mid-February, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossian said Tuesday. The election rules and regulations will be finalised in January, he added. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has already announced the DCC elections, delayed by two and a half years, will be held by March. The terms of the current DCC elected officials, including mayor, expired on May 24, 2007. The schedule will be declared within 40-45 days of finalising the rules, Sakhawat told reporters at the Election Commission. He said candidates for the mayor and the councillor posts will not be able use photographs of political leaders or any political symbol in their election campaigns. "Some changes have been made to the election rules this time. The draft amendment is almost finished, which will be sent to the law ministry soon for approval," Hossain said. Any person of minister, state minster, deputy minister or equivalent rank will be barred from participating in election campaigns, he added. Sakhawat earlier in the week said some amendments are alsobeing introduced on election expenses. DCC mayoral candidates have to deposit Tk 1 lakh. These measures have been taken to prevent fake candidacy, he added. All mayoral candidates will be asked to deliver speeches on the same stage, the election commissioner said. The EC will arrange congregations in four different places; candidates will not be allowed go for door-to-door campaigns or public meetings to seek votes. They may arrange road meetings but not use more than one loudspeaker, he added. bdn
