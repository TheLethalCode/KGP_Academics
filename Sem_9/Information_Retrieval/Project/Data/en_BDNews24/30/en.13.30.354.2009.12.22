 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  The present government is working only to appease its foreign friends, not the people of the country, said BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosarraf Hossain Tuesday. Criticising the government's hostile attitude towards newspapers, Mosarraf said: "The way the government is threatening journalists for publishing reports on their (the government's) corruption it only exposing their fascist nature." "Awami League in 1975 ordered all newspapers except four to stop publication; it always feared newspapers." The BNP leader was talking at a solidarity meeting arranged jointly by the BNP backed Federal Union of Journalists and Dhaka Union of Journalists at the National Press Club in protest against "recent threats" and attacks on daily Amar Desh editor and reporters. Mosarraf said: "They (Awami League) have not yet implemented any of their election pledges. They could not provide jobs to the jobless. Price of rice has been hiked. The state of law and order has worsened." "On issues like Tipaimukh Dam and delineating sea borders, the present government has failed so far." The BNP leader urged all professionals to unite under a nationalist banner to build up a tough movement against the AL government. Among others, BNP senior joint secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam, National Democratic Party president Safiul Alam Pradhan, National Peoples' Party president Shawkat Hossain Nilu, Amader Shomoy editor Naimul Islam Khan, Doctors' Association of Bangladesh secretary AZM Zahid Hossain and National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud were present at the meeting. bdn
