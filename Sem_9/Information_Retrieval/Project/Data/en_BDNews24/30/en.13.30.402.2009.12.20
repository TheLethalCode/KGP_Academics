 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Five Supreme Court judges, in the verdict on the Bangabandhu murder appeals, have criticised the post assassination government for being inactive regarding the trial, the attorney general said Sunday. "The Appellate Division cited the inactive stand regarding the killing terming it, in a civilised society, unfortunate and shameful," he told reporters after collecting the copy of the verdict. The five Appellate Division judges who upheld the death sentences of five convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case signed and released the full 412-page judgement on the appeals on Dec 17. The release of the full judgement makes way for the next phase of legal procedures, including possible review and clemency petitions by the convicts condemned to death. The attorney general said justice Mohammed Tafazzul Islam handed down the main verdict with the four other judges in agreement. Three other judges also gave personal opinions. bdn
