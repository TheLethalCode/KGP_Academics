 SEOUL, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven North Koreans crossed into the South by taking a seldom used sea route that has been the site of deadly naval clashes between the rival Koreas in the past, officials said on Tuesday. News of the crossing came a day after the North threatened to turn the contested Yellow Sea border off the west coast of the peninsula into a firing range, raising tension as it also appears to be ending its boycott of stalled nuclear disarmament talks.

In a move aimed at decreasing tension, South Korea will soon complete the construction of a fibre optic cable across the border that will be used as a military hotline, a Defence Ministry official told reporters. More than 16,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, almost all of them in the past 10 years, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The vast majority escape across the border into China, and often with the help of brokers or relief groups, seek passage to South via a third country.
