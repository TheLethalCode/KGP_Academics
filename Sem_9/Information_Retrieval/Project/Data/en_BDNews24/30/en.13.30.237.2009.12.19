 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)---Disaster management minister Abdur Razzaque urged Dhaka residents to make more use of surface water for at least three months of the year as the city's water table faces depletion. Quoting different statistics, he said, the underground water level in Dhaka city is falling and exact information will have to be dug out through research, Razzaque told a seminar on 'Building a Secure Mega City' at the Institute of Engineers Bangladesh on Saturday. He said it would be possible to maintain underground water table if navigability can be restored in surrounding rivers. The proper utilisation of the rivers surrounding the city should be ensured. The minister said proper planning along with its implementation is necessary for ensuring facilities as Dhaka grows as a mega city. "Proper infrastructural planning and assessment of its quality must be ensured," he added "Railway bridges constructed during British rule are still intact while installations and roads constructed during recent time have become unfit for use," he pointed out. The quality of work would improve if engineers are sincere and dutiful, he said. The minister said migration to Dhaka city is the major problem. He said besides formulating plans for Dhaka's expansion, the rural economy should be strengthened. "Employment should be generated in the rural areas by providing loans on easy terms and low interest to the rural entrepreneurs. Migration cannot be checked unless the rural areas are equipped with modern facilities like electricity and telephone," he said. The programme chaired by RAJUK chairman Nurul Huda was among others addressed by state minister for science and information Yasef Osman and central president of Institute SM Nazrul Islam. Engineer Abdus Sobhan presented the key paper in the programme. b
