<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)Awami League has accused the opposition BNP of plotting to keep the prime minister's son Sajib Wazed Joy out of politics, and take the heat of the opposition leader's own sons, by spreading malicious propaganda through partisan press. AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told a press briefing at the party office on Sunday that opposition-backed newspapers such as Amar Desh had "abandoned objectivity and ethics in journalism to serve the malicious plan of their masters". Amar Desh carried a story on December 17 accusing Joy and the prime minister's energy adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury of taking a backhander of Tk 35 crore ($5 million) from Chevron in Dallas, Texas, on Oct 14 to help the US oil company secure a contract to set up gas compressor stations in Bangladesh. Chowdhury on Sunday brushed aside the newspaper allegations. He said the report was politically motivated and designed to tarnish the image of the government. "There is not a shred of truth in the report," he told a separate news conference at the energy and mineral resources division of the Secretariat. Those who published the report must prove its authenticity, Chowdhury said. "Otherwise, he said, they will have to face legal action because it is unethical for a newspaper to publish such a false and baseless report." Ashraf, also terming the Amar Desh story completely baseless, in turn accused the opposition of spreading such false reports as a smokescreen "to hide the misdeeds" of BNP chief Khaleda Zia and her sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco. "They are following the blueprint of the (caretaker government's) 'Minus-2 formula' to assassinate Joy's character and put him in parallel with Tarique who is charged with serious corruption." "They have used some of their compliant newspapers for the purpose." Meanwhile, the Amar Desh journalist who wrote the story was attacked on Saturday. Special correspondent M. Abdullah told bdnews24.com four men on two motorbikes attacked his car on the way to his office at the Banani intersection on Airport Road. He said there was "a noise like an explosion" that left his windshield broken. None was injured in the incident but Abdullah said the attack may have been carried out in connection with the story against Joy and Chowdhury. Regarding the attack, Ashraf said on Sunday: "Those attackers will be tried. We believe in freedom of the press, but also in objectivity." He also said the government was amending the law to bar direct arrest of journalists in defamation cases in a bid to create greater press freedom. "We hope it will be passed in the next session of parliament". bd
