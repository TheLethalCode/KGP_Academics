 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)--Finance minister A M A Muhith on Friday asked Dhaka University to clear sessions backlog. "Session jams should come to an end in all departs including English to ensure better future for students," he said, speaking as chief guest at the 24th annual reunion of English Department Alumni Society at TSC auditorium. Muhith did his Bachelor's with honours in English literature in 1954 and Master's from Dhaka University in 1955. "Students will have to take many responsibilities. It is a month of victory. We achieved independence through the sacrifice of the blood of martyrs so that everyone can live happily and prosperously." Asked to helm the Society as its president, Muhith politely refused and said the incumbent government's ministers have decided not to take charge of any organisations. He suggested the department publish a souvenir marking its 25th anniversary next year. Dhaka University vice-chancellor professor A A M S Arefin Siddique, among others, spoke at the ceremony.
