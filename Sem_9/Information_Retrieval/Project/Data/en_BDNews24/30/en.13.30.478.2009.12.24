 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines reaped Tk 34.45 crore profit in the first quarter of the fiscal year, the national carrier's managing director said on Thursday. Biman earned just Tk 24 crore in profits in the whole of 2008-09 and Tk 5.91 crore in 2007-08. Prior to 2007-08, BBA faced much criticism for its huge losses. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Biman's MD & CEO Muhammad Zakiul Islam attributed the jump in profit to proper maintenance of schedules and efficient financial management. The state-run airline was made a public limited company in July 2007. Around 2000 officials and staff were sent into retirement with golden handshakes. Zakiul said, "We want to make Biman more profitable." "To this end, we have planned to introduce more aircraft on various routes after their arrival in January." BBA now runs on 16 international and domestic routes. b
