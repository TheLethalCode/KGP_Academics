<TEXT>
 Munshiganj, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)Reduced navigability halted ferry crossings on Friday between Mawa in Munshiganj and Mangalmajhi in Shariatpur. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) Mawa assistant manager said there is not sufficient water in the Padma for the ferry crossings as the surface water level has reduced. He also said the ferry service would not resume until Padma's navigability is augmented by dredging. Passengers and vehicles are now crossing the Padma river through the Kathalbari terminal of Madaripur, adding an extra eight kilometres to the route. BIWTC executive engineer (dredging) Mashkura Alam said that they are surveying the Mawa-Mangalmajhi route. The issue of dredging would be decided after the survey. bdne
