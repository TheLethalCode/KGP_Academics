Shipping minister Shajahan Khan handed over cheques among the scores of families of the victims in two separate programmes at Lalmohan and Charfashion Upazilas on Wednesday. The launch capsize in the Tentulia River on Nov 27, the night before Eid, left a final death toll of 81 passengers including women and children.
