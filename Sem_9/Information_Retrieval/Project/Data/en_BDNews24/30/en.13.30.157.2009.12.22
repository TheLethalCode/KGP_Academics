 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)Island nation Mauritius has announced lifting of its order that had called for deportation Bangladeshi workers after Dec 31 this year, a foreign ministry statement said Tuesday. The ministry released the statement a day after foreign minister Dipu Moni's visit to capital Port Louis Monday on an invitation from her Mauritian counterpart. "Dipu Moni requested the Mauritius government to extend the duration of work permits to male workers of Bangladesh beyond December 2009 and facilitate recruitment of fresh workers," said the statement. "After a threadbare discussion about the matter labour minister of Mauritius announced the withdrawal of Mauritius government's earlier decision to deport Bangladesh workers after 31 December 2009," it said. The Mauritius government showed its keen interest for recruiting doctors, engineers and architects from Bangladesh, according to the statement. In July this year, Mauritius ordered some 6,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers to leave the country in a move to absorb the shock of the global economic crises. According to expatriates' welfare ministry, some 12,000 Bangladeshis work in Mauritius, a tiny country in the Indian Ocean near Africa's Madagascar. Dipu Moni called on Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam. She also met Ramakrishna Sithanen, vice-prime minister and minister for finance and economic empowerment, Arvin Boolell, foreign minister, Jean Francois Chaumiere, minister for labour, international relations and employment and Dharambeer Gokhool, minister for industry, science and research.
