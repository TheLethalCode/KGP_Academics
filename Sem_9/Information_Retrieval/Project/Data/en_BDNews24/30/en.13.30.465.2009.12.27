<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)Thirty-eight long years after independence, the three dozen valiant Rajarbagh policemen, who resisted deadly Pakistan occupation forces on the ominous night of Mar 25 1971, have finally received formal recognition for their deeds. Dhaka Metropolitan Police hosted a programme on Saturday to honour the 37 members of the Rajarbagh police line who fought bravely against all odds at the inception of the nine-month long liberation war. Of the 37, eight police men gave their lives that night, three have died since and 26 are still living. The reception chaired by Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque was also attended, among others, by inspector general of police Noor Mohammad. Police chief Noor Mohammad said: "The honouring of the valiant freedom fighters of the police force should have happened long before this." Of the surviving heroes, police sub-inspector Shajahan, havildar Abdul Awal and constables Joynal Abedin and Jahirul Haque reminisced about that fateful night. Abedin said, "A handful of policemen put up strong resistance with rusty rifles against the well-equipped Pakistani forces on the night of Mar 25. "But they were never honoured after independence." The police department never cared for them since then, he said Saidur Rahman, son of sub-inspector Abdul Jalil, who died on the night of Mar 25, 1971, said: "The police department has remembered my father 38 long years after independence but did not bother to care for us before." The surviving police heroes, and the families of the deceased, were handed a certificate and crest as a mark of honour. They were also handed Tk 5000 each. Noor Mohammad said police headquarters had also directed each district police administration to provide facilities for the children of freedom fighters if possible. bd
