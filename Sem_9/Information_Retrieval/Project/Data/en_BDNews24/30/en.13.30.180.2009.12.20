 Bogra, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities closed Government Azizul Haque College in Bogra for an indefinite period following violent clashes between Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League activists that left scores injured on Sunday. At least 50 activists of both student political wings were injured in the clashes that lasted for about four hours. Police were forced to fire rubber bullets and tear gas to bring the situation under control. All students were ordered to leave their halls by 5pm, authorities said. They also announced that internal examinations of the college would remain suspended until further notice. However, the National University examinations would be held as per schedule. Azizul Haque College principal Dr Sultan Ali said the reasons behind sudden eruption of clashes would be investigated. Witnesses said that pro-ruling party Chhatra League brought out a procession on the campus just after noon in protest against the daily Amar Desh that had published a report against Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. After parading through the campus the BCL activists went to the Campus Chattar to burn copies of Amar Desh when Shibir activists started chanting slogans against them. Witnesses said the armed clashes involved gunfire, ransacking of college rooms and vehicles. Police were forced to fire 60 rounds of rubber bullets and tear-gas shells to disperse the clashing activists. Chhatra League and Shibir leaders blamed each other for instigating the violence. The injured students and activists were admitted into Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital in Bogra. bdne
