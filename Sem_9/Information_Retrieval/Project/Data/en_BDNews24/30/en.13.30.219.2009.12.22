 ALMATY, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A prominent Kyrgyz opposition journalist died in hospital on Tuesday, nearly a week after he was thrown out of a tall building in Kazakhstan with his hands tied behind his back, police said. Gennady Pavlyuk fell into a coma after he was attacked on December 16 while on a visit to Almaty, the financial capital of Kazakhstan bout 250 km (150 miles) north of the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek where he was based. A Kazakh police spokesman said his death was been treated as murder. Kyrgyzstan's opposition has condemned the attack on Pavlyuk, a staunch critic of the Kyrgyz government, saying it was an attempt by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to silent dissent in the impoverished former Soviet republic. "The authorities ... were afraid of Pavlyuk," said Kyrgyz opposition leader Omurbek Tekebayev. Kyrgyzstan's opposition has accused Bakiyev of tightening his grip on power since a disputed presidential election in July. Bakiyev's office says it is committed to promoting democracy and press freedom. "The authorities must investigate whether it's related to his (Pavlyuk's) professional activities," said Almaz Turdumamatov, a Bakiyev spokesman. Attacks on journalists and politicians have become more frequent in the ex-Soviet republic, home to a U.S. military air base, compared with other countries in Central Asia. The assault on Pavlyuk, described as Kyrgyzstan's most well-known journalist, also comes against a broader trend of growing journalist fatalities in the world. The Committee to Protect Journalists said this month the 2009 tally compared to 42 deaths in 2008 and surpassed the previous record of 67 deaths in 2007. Pavlyuk had been preparing to open a new opposition newspaper next month in the mountainous mainly Muslim nation. It was unclear what brought Pavlyuk to Almaty. Bakiyev, who has denied opposition allegations of vote rigging in the July poll, came to power in 2005 after violent protests toppled his long-serving predecessor, Askar Akayev. Initially hailed in the West as a liberal leader in an otherwise authoritarian region, he has gradually consolidated power and fostered closer ties with Russia, which also operates a military airbase in Kyrgyzst
