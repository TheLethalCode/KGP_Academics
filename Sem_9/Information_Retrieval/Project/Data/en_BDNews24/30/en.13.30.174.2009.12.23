 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)--Police will now fine drivers or seize cars for haphazard parking to ease traffic gridlocks in the streets of the capital. The decision came from the first-ever evaluation meeting on road lanes introduced on Dec 8 to cut traffic snarls in Dhaka. Dhaka Metropolitan Police officials and transport leaders and workers met on Tuesday night at the DMP commissioner's office. Twenty teams in plain clothes hit the road on Wednesday to prevent haphazard car parking and violation of traffic rules and road lanes system. Each team led by a sub-inspector consists of four members. Police are also thinking of modifying road lanes system, recently introduced to cut traffic jam, at the suggestion of transport leaders who said passenger buses can run on the left lane instead of the mid lane. Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner A K M Shahidul Hoque told bdnews24.com that buses will be allowed to run on the left side of the road on a trial basis. However, the current lane systems will be modified if that is successful, he said. Police have also decided not to arrest drivers of CNG-run three-wheelers with fake licences up to March at the request of the autorickshaw owners and drivers. The owners and operators said they have been given until Mar 31 to get valid licence. Balaka Bus-Minibus Workers Committee general secretary Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com that transport leaders also demanded introduction of oral test instead of written test for driving licence. Many drivers bought forged licences as they cannot read and write even though they knew well how to drive. They also told the DMP officials that lane marks and names on various roads were unclear. The commissioner assured them of taking up the issues with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority officials. Police on Wednesday began identifying those violating lane systems and parking cars haphazardly by recording their vehicle numbers with video camera. They will face cases and the case papers will be sent to their addresses. DMP joint commissioner (traffic) Shafiqur Rahmanm and all DMP zones deputy commissioners were present at the meeting. bd
