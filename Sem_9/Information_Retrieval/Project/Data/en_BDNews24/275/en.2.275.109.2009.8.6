 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Warid Telecom, a subsidiary of UAE-based Abu Dhabi Group, has changed its logo and names of some services to portray a uniform brand image and identity of the Warid Group, says the company. Telecommunication minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu and the CEO of Warid Telecom Muneer Farooqui unveiled the new logo Wednesday. "The change will bring freshness and newness in the Warid Brand and will align us with the rest of the Abu Dhabi Group's Telecom concerns around the globe," Farooqui said. From now on, Warid's two services  Zem and Zahi  for prepaid and post-paid packages will be simply named as Warid Prepaid and Warid Post-paid. Warid has bought some 30,000 city bus tickets and will distribute them among commuters on Thursday to mark the occasion. Addressing the logo unveiling ceremony, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu urged all concerned including private mobile phone companies to extend cooperation in realising the government's Charter For Change. He said his government had been working to expand broadband internet facilities to every upazila. The government has signed a $400 million deal with China for the development of state-run mobile company TeleTalk and Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) to establish 3G technology through the Next Generation Network, the minister said. Muneer Farooqui said Warid currently has 1,750 base stations across Bangladesh and the company have so far invested around $600 million in its telecom service.
