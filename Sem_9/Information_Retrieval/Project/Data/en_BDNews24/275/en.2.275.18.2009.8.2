<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku has said the government is waging a war against terrorism and militancy, which it will win. Terming government ministers "soldiers" of the prime minister, he said they were battling under Sheikh Hasina's leadership. "We have achieved victory in the battle for democracy. I was elected by defeating a war criminal," said Tuku, who beat Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in his Pabna constituency in the December elections. "Now I start the war against terrorism and militancy," Tuku told reporters Sunday at the Secretariat on the first day in office. Tuku was transferred from the energy and power ministry on Friday as Hasina expanded and reshuffled her cabinet "to implement electoral pledges". The government will take stern action against those who obstruct the rule of law through terrorism and militancy, said Tuku. "We have fixed plans to uproot terrorism," he said, and called on all to join the fight against terrorism. The new state minister for home is set to hold meeting with heads of organisations and offices under the ministry at around 3:30pm. b
