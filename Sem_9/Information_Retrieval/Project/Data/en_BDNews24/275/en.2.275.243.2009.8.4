 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com) - The government has approved Tk 1093 crore to be spent on highway development countrywide, planning minister AK Khandaker said on Tuesday, after an ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Of the Tk 1093 crore, Tk 421 will come from government sources and 672 from development partners for the Roads Network Development and Maintenance Project-2 (Revised), said Khandaker. "Roads countrywide will be widened, maintained and improved under the project," he said.
