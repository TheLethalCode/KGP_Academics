<TEXT>
 Pabna, August 4 (bdnews24.com)  Erosion along the banks of the Padma and Jamuna rivers in Pabna district has reached critical levels, leaving over a thousand families homeless in the last month alone, officials said Tuesday. Bera, Sujanagar, Ishwardi and Sadar upazilas have borne the brunt of the ongoing erosion. Displaced locals in the worst affected areas say they had no time to relocate their homes due to the speed of the rivers' advance. Bera upazila chairman, Khandaker Azizul Haque Arzoo, told bdnews24.com, "Proper steps are being taken to stop the erosion." Local authorities said there has been little erosion over the last eight or nine years in the area, but six villages under Sujanagar upazila, Charashutoshpur, four villages of Sadar upazlia, four villages of Ishwardi, and 13 villages of Bera have seen the worst of it this year. Local WDB officials said large-scale erosion began along the banks of the Padma and Jamuna rivers in the four upazilas soon after the rainy season set in, but has significantly gained pace over the last 15 to 20 days. Shahidul Islam Talukdar, WDB executive engineer in Bera, said the flood protection barrier at Nagarbari, Kajirhat and Najirganj ferry points are now on the verge of collapse. Talukdar said the WDB had taken up a Tk 1.4 crore project to shore up the flood embankment at Nagarbari, although the initiative had so far failed to slow the erosion. bd
