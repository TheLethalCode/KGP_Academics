 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)The government will put the tenders of the Roads and Highways Department online in two months to cut corruption and terrorism, the finance minister said on Monday. "We have made this decision also to ensure accountability and transparency. The initiative means we have lived up to one of our election pledges," AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting with UNDP deputy country director Robert Juhkam at the Secretariat. "In our election manifesto, we had declared to establish a digital Bangladesh and we are working to that end," Muhith said. The minister said a private organisation is working to make the entire tender process, including bid invitation and submission, online. The tender procedure of the other ministries, including land-related activities, and departments will also be made online in phases. "These important government activities going online means corruption will decline, and accountability and transparency will be ensured as well," the minister said. bdn
