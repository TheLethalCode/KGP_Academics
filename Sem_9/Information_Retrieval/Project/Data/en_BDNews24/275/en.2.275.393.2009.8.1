 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's 10-member parliamentary delegation has failed for a second day to visit the proposed Tipaimukh dam site, in India's northeast Manipur state, as the helicopter carrying them could not land due to torrential rains. "We wanted to land, but could not due to inclement weather," Abdur Razzak, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources, told the BBC Bangla Service on Saturday. "We hovered above the site by helicopter, viewing the area for around half an hour from above. It is a very inaccessible place that often experience heavy rains," he said. "We went closer to the site today (Saturday) than Friday, but could not see any installations or erection work in progress." The team had earlier failed to visit the site on Friday too, amid heavy rainfall, and returned back to the Assam capital of Guwahati, where they were staying after meeting with the Indian government in New Delhi earlier in the week.

India has already said the dam would not withhold water as it is part of a power generation project and not intended for irrigation purposes, but the people of Bangladesh, as well as Manipur state, remain concerned over the contentious project. The members of the parliamentary team include Awami League MPs Abdur Rahman, ABM Anwarul Haq and Jahir Hossain, Jatiya Party member of parliament ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader and independent MP Fazlul Azim. It also has two expertsBUET professor Monwar Hossain and Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission. The other two members are water resources secretary Waheduzzaman and foreign ministry director general Emran Ahmed. Jamaat-e-Islami MP Hamidur Rahman Azad did not join the delegation at the last moment as he fell ill. Bangladesh's main opposition BNP failed to name two members for the team, even though the party has been among the loudest critics of the dam project in recent mon
