 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Sunday sent Faisal Morshed Khan, son of former foreign minister M Morshed Khan, to jail on surrender in a graft case. Special judge Amar Kumar Roy denied bail after Faisal, convicted and sentenced to 10 years in an illegal wealth case, turned himself in to the court. Faisal, chairman of AB Bank and managing director of Pacific Motors, was brought to the dock in a wheelchair from Ibrahim Memorial Cardiac Hospital at around 1pm. His lawyer, barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque, told the court that Faisal should get division in jail as he was a diplomat and served as a consul general in Mexico. The lawyer said he was suffering from cardiac problems and undergoing treatment in the hospital. The court said jail authorities would take steps in line with the law and arrange for his proper treatment. Faisal was sentenced on Aug 20 last year to 10 years in prison for accumulating wealth beyond his known income and suppressing wealth information in a statement to the Anticorruption Commission. The graft watchdog filed the case on Dec 1, 2007, with Gulshan police against Faisal and his wife Shyama Sejan Khan. The High Court later halted the case proceedings against his wife. Faisal was also sentenced in a separate case to seven years, in April 2008, for abetting former Jamaat-e-Islami lawmaker Shahjahan Chowdhury in the illegal purchase of a duty-free car through Pacific Motors. b
