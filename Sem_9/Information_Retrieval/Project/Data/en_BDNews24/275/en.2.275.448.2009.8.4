 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith has pointed the finger at the World Bank over corruption in the road sector. The bank has pledged $3 billion in assistance to Bangladesh over the next three years, but is "unwilling to invest" in road construction because of corruption in that particular sector, Muhith said Tuesday after a meeting with visiting WB vice president for South Asia, Isabel M Guerrero. "I requested World Bank for greater assistance on road projects because infrastructure is important for us," the finance minister told reporters. "But at the moment they are unwilling to invest in road construction. They say corruption takes place in the sector." "I told them,'You have links to this too in that it was you who approved past projects'." The $3 billion pledged for the coming three years is much more than has been given previously, Muhith said. The bank was eager to work for the development of the southern region, he said. "They have agreed to fund the excavation of river Gorai and showed interest to fund the development of Mongla port. "The World Bank will also assist in reforming of sea or river channels. But we have not submitted any project proposal to them yet." Muhith said the multilateral donor agency supported reforms of the public procurement system. They also discussed information technology, social safety net, rural development and power projects. WB interim country director Robert Floyd was also present in the meeting. Guerrero arrived in Bangladesh on Monday on a five-day visit. No pay scale this month On a separate issue, asked by reporters when civil servants were likely to see a proposed pay hike, Muhtih said he would send the reports from the pay commission committee, defence committee and secretary committee to the cabinet after reviewing them. "The cabinet will give the final approval. But there is no possibility that the report will go to the cabinet this month," he said. b
