 SYDNEY, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have resisted the temptation to wield the axe after last month's loss to New Zealand by choosing an unchanged starting team for Saturday's Tri-Nations match with South Africa in Cape Town. Australia's selectors kept faith in the same starting side that lost 22-16 to the All Blacks in Auckland but did make one unforced change to the replacements. Reserve flanker Phil Waugh was left out of the 22-man squad and replaced by utility back Peter Hynes to give the Wallabies a more conventional bench of four forwards and three backs. Australia team: 15-Adam Ashley-Cooper, 14-Lachie Turner, 13-Stirling Mortlock (captain), 12-Berrick Barnes, 11-Drew Mitchell, 10-Matt Giteau, 9-Luke Burgess, 8-Wycliff Palu, 7-George Smith, 6-Richard Brown, 5-Nathan Sharpe, 4-James Horwill, 3-Al Baxter, 2-Stephen Moore, 1-Benn Robinson Replacements: 16-Tatafu Polota-Nau, 17-Ben Alexander, 18-Dean Mumm, 19-David Pocock, 20-Will Genia, 21-Peter Hynes, 22-James O'Connor
