<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed shipping minister Shahjahan Khan has said he will try to stop irregularities and corruption in his ministry without compromise, even if that means he will have to lose his job. "I won't tolerate any irregularities or corruption in my ministry," he told reporters at the Secretariat on Sunday, his first day in office after being sworn-in on Friday. "Graft will have to be prevented at all cost. I won't compromise with them even if I have to lose my job," he said. Shahjahan also said the government would resolve sea border disputes with neighbouring Myanmar and India through discussion. He said they would work to realise the prime minister's plan to increase navigation of the country's rivers. The work procedure will be fixed soon in consultation with the officials concerned, he said. Shahjahan admitted his ministry faced a bad reputation. He said his ministry was notorious for delays, and stressed the need for fast implementation of projects. bdnew
