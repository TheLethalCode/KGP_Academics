 Jhinaidah, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)A transport strike in six southwestern districts was called off Sunday with the administration's assurance to private bus operators to ban informal public transport, including all 'shallow-engine' driven vehicles. "We called off the strike this evening following assurance from the administration," said Hasan Abul Fazal, general-secretary of Kushtia Bus-Minibus Owners Association after a three-hour meeting from 3pm with Khulna divisional commissioner Younusur Rahman. Jhinaidah and Kushtia police officials said they had already stopped operation of all shallow-engine driven vehicles, known locally as 'Nasiman' and 'Kariman'. Bus owners and workers associations in Kushtia, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Magura, Jhenaidah and Rajbari declared an indefinite strike on Saturday, suspending movement of buses, and forcing all trucks and rented vehicles off the road from 6am on Saturday until "further notice". Inter-district vehicle movements had also been interrupted. People across the districts were stranded without any form of transport as private vehicles were also unable to move in many places due to road blockades by the strikers. Thousands of bus passengers travelling south from Dhaka had been stuck at Daulatdia ferry terminal in Rajbari due to lack of transport alternatives in the district. Abdul Hanif, president of Meherpur Kitchen Market Association, said over 320 tonnes of vegetables had failed to be delivered to the market due to the strike on Saturday. bdnews24.
