 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to quash another 121 cases, on the grounds that they were filed for political persecution, the head of the scrutiny committee that recommended withdrawal of the cases said on Wednesday. A total of 308 cases were presented in the committee's fifth meeting, Kamrul Islam, committee chairman and state minister for law, told reporters. Of them, 280 were filed under penal code while the remaining 28 were pressed by the Anticorruption Commission, said Islam. "Of the total, we have decided to cancel 121 cases, 41 cases will not be cancelled, and the remaining 146 cases will be further reviewed at the committee's next meeting," Islam said. The meeting recommended quashing cases against Awami League leaders Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and his wife, Sylhet mayor Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran, HBM Iqbal, Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton, AKM Rahmatullah, Haji Mohammed Selim and deputy speaker Shawkat Ali. The committee has so far recommended 364 cases to be quashed since its first sitting. The Awami League-led government, soon after coming to power in January, announced it would look into cases filed against politicians and others for 'political motives only' under past administrations. The government invited applications for cancellation of such cases from February, forming district level vetting committees countrywide and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended three times up to July 12. Its first meeting on June 10 recommended cancellation of 62 cases, including 12 against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On June 21 it approved another 46 cases to be cancelled, on July 1, in its third meeting, the committee recommended 66 cases and on July 15 in the fourth meeting, it recommended another 69 cases be quashed. bdnews
