 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)--Former British envoy in Dhaka, Anwar Choudhury, arrived in Bangladesh on Monday on a three-day visit. Choudhury, who is currently director in charge of international organisations at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, arrived on a Qatar Airways flight at about 9:30am. BNP activists were demonstrating at Zia International Airport roundabout, after the leaders of the main opposition party called on the government last week to "refuse entry" to Choudhury who the opposition has accused of being one of the instigators of the '1/11 changeover'. Many have raised allegations that foreign envoys, including Anwar Choudhury and ex-US ambassador Patricia Butenis, played a major role in the Jan 11 2007 installation of the military-backed emergency government. Current British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans last month refuted allegations that the diplomatic community in Bangladesh had a hand in "calling the army out of barracks" for the 1/11 imposition of emergency. He mounted a strong defence of his predecessor Choudhury. Evans said the state of emergency was imposed at the time as an "internal dynamic" in Bangladesh.
