<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank has approved a $130 million credit to Bangladesh to increase access to electricity in rural areas through local renewable energy projects, a WB handout said Saturday. "Investing in grid electricity alone will not realise the Government of Bangladesh's goal of universal access to electricity by 2020," said Robert L Floyd, acting WB country director for Bangladesh. The project will provide financing for projects such as biomass and biogas power plants, solar water pumps for irrigation and solar mini-grids, said the handout. The credit is an additional financing to the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Credit, a project since 2003, which has connected 600,000 consumers to the electricity grid. The credit also funded constructed of around 8,500 kilometres of new distribution lines, and provided 320,000 consumers with Solar Home Systems. "Many of these households in poor areas are too remote to connect to the electricity grid and would never receive electricity through conventional methods," said Floyd. The credit has been made through the International Development Association, the WB's concessionary arm. A part of the financing will be used to purchase and install about 10 million energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps in densely populated areas in the country, which will replace an equivalent number of incandescent lamps
