 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com) - Two more swine flu cases have been detected, taking the tally of infected cases to 32, IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman said Tuesday. Rahman told newsmen 12 cases had been contracted in the country. The other 20 cases had been detected in Bangladeshis who had recently arrived from the US, Britain, Australia and South East Asia. Of the total 18 are male and 14 female, aged between 2 to 46 years, most of whom had totally recovered, said Rahman. He an said of the female cases, two were pregnant. "Risk is heightened in pregnancy for any disease. One of the pregnant women was admitted to the hospital, but it was not a severe case," said Rahman. "We were worried whether any new virus would show up as a conjunction of swine, bird and human flu, as flu viruses can mutate rapidly. But we haven't seen evidence for such so far." Rahman said the incidence of seasonal flu was higher than usual this year. "But in any event we don't have scarcity of flu medicine." He said some 85,549 doses of oseltamivir, were stored at district levels, while the central government has more 2,490,000 doses of the drug, commonly known by one of its brand names 'Tamiflu'. Incoming international passengers continue to be screened for flu symptoms at Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports. Chittagong and Mongla seaports and 11 land ports are also screening travelers. Government hospitals around the country have also been asked to open separate outdoor centres for swine flu patients. India confirmed its first swine flu death on Tuesday, while 65 have died in Thailand and one in Indonesia. According to the World Health Organisation, almost 134,503 cases have been detected to date in 161 countries worldwide, with 861 recorded fatalities. In neighbouring countries, 8,877 cases have been detected in Thailand, 551 in India, 495 in Indonesia, 55 in Sri Lanka, 17 in Nepal, five in Myanmar, three in Bhutan and one in Maldives. The WHO declared the global swine flu pandemic on June 11 while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu.
