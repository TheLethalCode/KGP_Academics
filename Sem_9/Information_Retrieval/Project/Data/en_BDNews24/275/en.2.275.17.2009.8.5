 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved against what it alleges was an illegal petition filed on behalf of Arafat Rahman Coco, son of opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, challenging the legality of a money laundering case against him. The government, in a petition to the High Court on Wednesday, also sought permission to file criminal cases against those who were involved with adopting illegal means in filing Coco's petition. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury heard both parties in the government's petition and set Aug 10 for the next hearing. The same High Court bench is proceeding separately on Coco's petition that was filed on Aug 2 by Taherul Islam Touhid claiming power of attorney on behalf of Coco who is currently residing in Thailand. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court on Wednesday that the proper official of the Bangladesh embassy in Thailand had not certified the power of attorney claimed by Touhid in the hearing of Coco's petition. Alam also said the power of attorney showed a false address. He said Coco's lawyer Mahbub Uddin Khokon attested his client's signature on the alleged power of attorney. "He has no power to do this as he was not present in Thailand when Coco allegedly gave this signature," said the attorney general. He said it was clear Coco did not authorise Touhid's signature and that the power of attorney was "a forged and fabricated document". "It needs investigating and criminal charges should be filed." Alam accused Khokon of abetting the "forged power of attorney". The court asked him if he had anything to say on the substance of Coco's petition. His petition challenges the case was filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year under the Money Laundering Act 2009. The case accuses Coco of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. An accused in other cases, Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. Attorney general Alam told the High Court bench on Wednesday he would speak on the substance of Coco's petition only after the power of attorney issue was investigated and resolved. Advocate TH Khan, barrister Rafiq-Ul-Huq and barrister Moudud Ahmed opposed the government's petition in Wednesday's hearing. bdnew
