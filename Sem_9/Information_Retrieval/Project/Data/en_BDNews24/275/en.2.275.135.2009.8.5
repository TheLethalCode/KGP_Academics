 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)--The chief election commissioner on Wednesday said the provisional registration of political parties will be cancelled if they failed to submit permanent constitution within the rescheduled Jan 25 deadline. Further changes will be made to the amended and recently approved Representation of the People Order and the Election Commission will discuss the issue again with the political parties, ATM Shamsul Huda said after a meeting with the president at the Bangabhaban on Wednesday. Election commissioners Mohammed Sohul Hussain and Mohammed Shakhawat Hossain were also present at that time. Most of the 39 registered parties, including ruling Awami League, have submitted fully amended and ratified constitutions, but BNP, Krishak Sramik Janata League, Zaker Party, Freedom Party, Bangladesh Jatiya Party and Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal, including main opposition BNP, have yet to submit theirs. The EC is considering the request of Gono Front, Oikyoboddho Nagorik Andolon, Progressive Democratic Party and Workers' Party to accept their draft constitution as permanent. BNP will have to submit its permanent constitution by Jan 25 to keep the registration intact. It has decided to arrange council by December for final approval of its permanent constitution. The cabinet on Monday approved the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Act 2009, allowing political parties six more months to submit a permanent constitution and it is now waiting to be passed into a law. Asked to comment on local governmnet minister and AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam's view of holding the general polls every three years, Huda, "It is a political issue and the government will decide that." "How rational it would be to hold polls every three years in a poor country like Bangladesh since TK 250-300 crore is needed to hold general elections?" Secretary of the president's office Mohammad Shafiul Alam, military secretary to the president major general Md Ehtesham Ul Haque and president's press secretary Abdul Awal Howlader were also present at the meeting. bdnews
