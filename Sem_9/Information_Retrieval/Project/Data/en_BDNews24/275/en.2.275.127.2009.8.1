<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)  Ousted Proshika chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed was rushed to hospital with chest pains after leading hundreds of supporters in a march on the NGO's Dhaka headquarters on Saturday, sparking clashes that left dozens injured. Mirpur police reached the spot at around 10am and struggled to bring the situation under control for around three hours. Mirpur zone assistant police commissioner Moniruzzaman said a group of people initially approached Proshika's Mirpur-2 offices at around 9am but failed to enter the building as staff from inside obstructed them. Clashes occurred as the building's employees tried to chase them off. The balconies of the 14-storey tower were packed with Proshika staff. Both sides were seen throwing brickbats and other missiles. Witnesses from the two camps said at least 35 people had been injured among them during the violence, half of whom were taken to hospital. At around noon, former Proshika chief Kazi Faruque Ahmed led a larger procession of supporters, chanting "Joy Bangla", and tried to force his way into the building. Witnesses said local leaders and supporters of ruling party Awami League were also seen in the procession. The governing body of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-government organisations, replaced Kazi Faruque as chairman in May this year in the face of ongoing employees' agitation against Faruque for alleged corruption and nepotism. The former chairman, who along with family members also faces money-laundering charges, says he was illegally "ousted". Faruque, who has legally challenged his removal, told newsmen on Saturday: "I am still the chairman of this organisation." "I came to office this morning, but was not allowed to enter." On the involvement of local Awami League-backed leaders in his procession he said the Awami Swechchhasebak League and Jubo League were with him as they were united in the "pro-liberation cause". "The people inside the building are led by anti-liberation forces," he claimed. Faruque, pressed by reporters on whether his attempt to enter the building was justified, said a petition challenging his removal and formation of a new board was yet to be resolved in court. A High Court bench, on a petition by Faruque, issued a rule on July 2 on Proshika's governing body to explain within 10 days why his removal as chairman should not be overturned. Director of Proshika's micro credit field operations, and member of a recently formed management committee, Md Abdur Rob, said it was not right on the part of Kazi Faruque "to attack the office with his people". "He has already been sacked. If he wants to return to his job he should resolve it through legal procedure," Rob said. "We resisted him at the gate to defend ourselves as he wanted to enter into the building with a mob." 'Chest pains' About 200 of Faruque's followers had surrounded the Proshika building by 1pm, exchanging threats with Proshika employees who attempted to leave their workplace, when Faruque suddenly collapsed with chest pains and was rushed to hospital. Proshika chief executive Kazi Khaze Alam, a supporter of Faruque, told bdnews24.com his former boss was admitted to the nearby National Heart Foundation and Hospital after suffering from a mild heart attack. "He underwent an emergency procedure in which two rings were set in his heart," said Alam. Faruque was being kept in Cardiac Care Unit, he said. 'Organisational matter' Police eventually brought the situation under control by around 1pm as the crowd dispersed after Faruque was rushed to hospital. Mirpur zone deputy police commissioner Chowdhury Monzurul Kabir said the clash was "an organisational matter of Proshika". "We are not concerned about which group is in the right or which group is wrong." "We have nothing to do with their internal affairs. We will do whatever is required to maintain law and order," he said. Kabir denied accusations that police were slow to act as the clashes sparked off. bd
