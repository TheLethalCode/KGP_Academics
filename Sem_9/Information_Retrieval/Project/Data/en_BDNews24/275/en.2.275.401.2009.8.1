 DAMBULLA, Sri Lanka, august 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka cruised to a 2-0 series lead with a comfortable six-wicket victory against Pakistan in the second one-day international on Saturday. Left arm pace bowler Thilan Thushara claimed three wickets as Sri Lanka bowled out Pakistan for a below-par 168 in 47 overs.
