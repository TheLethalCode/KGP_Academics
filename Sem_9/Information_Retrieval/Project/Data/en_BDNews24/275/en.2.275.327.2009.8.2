<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Sunday a recent decision to send two district judges into retirement was a "procedural mistake" and the government has moved to overturn the decision. Dhaka district sessions judge Mohammad Abdul Gafur and Gazipur women and children prevention tribunal judge Mohammad Shahjahan were ordered into retirement on July 30 for failing to abide by "good conduct and discipline in public administration". Gafur and Shahjahan also hold the top two posts of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association. "The president by his power issued the order to retire JSA president Mohammad Abdul Gafur and JSA secretary Mohammad Shahjahan and now by practicing the same power he may withdraw the order," Shafique told reporters on Sunday. Their retirement was yet to be finalised. "The president did not sign the paper so far," said the law minister. "The government also has the authority to review any decision. And it has done so on that basis," said Shafique in response to a question from a reporter. Asked whether the government had taken a "wrong decision", without consulting the chief justice, the minister said it was a "procedural mistake". Preferring not to be named, a JSA member told bdnews24.com the two judges met with the prime minister at her official Hare residence on Sunday morning along with the home minister, law minister and state minister for law. "The decision to overturn the retirement order was made in the meeting." The two judges had been preparing to make a legal appeal against the decision, the official added. A government handout last Thursday announced the decision to retire the two judges. The retirement order had followed an unruly protest by members of the judiciary who complained that they had not been properly consulted over judicial reforms. Around 150 judicial officials, led by Gafur and Shahjahan, met with law minister Shafique Ahmed at the secretariat on July 27 to complain that their opinions had not been solicited prior to the process of separation of the judiciary that began in 2007. They also demanded removal of law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. Deputy home secretary for security Naizam Uddin Khan later arrived at the scene with armed police to calm the protests. A JSA leader told bdnews24.com in reaction to the retirement order: "The government has no jurisdiction to take such an action without the chief justice's approval." bdnew
