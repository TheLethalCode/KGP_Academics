 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet on Monday approved the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Act 2009, allowing political parties six more months to submit a permanent constitution to the EC. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina chaired the regular meeting of the council of ministers, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the meeting at the Bangladesh Secretariat. According to the new RPO, previously amended ahead of the 2008 parliamentary polls, July 25 was the deadline for submission of permanent constitutions, after ratification, of the 39 political parties registered ahead of the elections with draft constitutions. Officials at the Election Commission had said they were willing to extend the deadline, however, as the main opposition BNP and at least 10 other parties asked for more time. Ruling Awami League and its key ally Jatiya Party handed in their constitutions at the EC secretariat by the deadline, after holding their councils on July 24. Election officials said some 20 parties had submitted constitution by hand or post by the deadline.
