Eight people were slightly hurt as they fled the plane via emergency exits. The Airbus A320, made by the European aerospace group EADS, was due to fly to Alicante in Spain. Passengers said the incident took place as the aircraft was heading toward the runway. "There was no announcement, the crew asked us to evacuate in very quick Spanish so people started to panic a little bit," passenger Alix Gossellin told Reuters television. "Some climbed over the seats and then the emergency chutes came out and within five minutes we were on the tarmac, so -- quite quick. It was very impressive because it was each man for himself," she added. Vueling said the fire began on the Airbus's right engine at 10.36 a.m. (0836 GMT). It did not specify whether those hurt were passengers or crew.
