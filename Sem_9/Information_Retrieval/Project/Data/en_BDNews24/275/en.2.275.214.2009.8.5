<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has finalised regulations for 3G network licences, BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed said Wednesday. "BTRC will soon invite applications from aspiring companies," Ahmed said at the unveiling of a new logo of a telecom company in the city. On a separate issue, Ahmed said WiMAX facilities would be up and running in Bangladesh as soon as this October. WiMAX technology has already been introduced experimentally in Gulshan, Baridhara and Banani areas last month. Ahmed also mentioned some 32 organisations will be given the Internet Protocol Telephony Service licences to run legal VoIP services. Details of the 3G licence regulations are yet to be published on BTRC's official website. Neither Ahmed nor any other BTRC official, when contacted, disclosed details about the possible qualifications for applicants, how many licences will be offered or their terms and conditions. Telecommunication ministry officials, however, have said the government wants to licence state-run mobile phone operator TeleTalk to operate next generation technology in Bangladesh, so applications for 3G licences will be invited after strengthening TeleTalk's network. Telecommunication minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu at the same ceremony on Wednesday said the government was ready to provide even better service to BTCL and TeleTalk users through the Next Generation Network. The government has already signed a $400 million deal with China for development of TeleTalk as well as the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. BTRC figures show, TeleTalk currently has the lowest number of mobile phone subscribers, at 1,100,000, while the youngest of the private operators Warid Telecom has over 2,500,000. bdne
