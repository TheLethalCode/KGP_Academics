 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP has condemned the removal of a large mural of former president Ziaur Rahman from the Bangabandhu National Stadium, a move he alleges was instigated by the government. "This act highlights the oppressive nature of the ruling Awami League," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at the BNP headquarters in Naya Paltan on Tuesday. Unidentified workers, on Monday night, removed the BNP founder's portrait from its position above the perimeter wall of the stadium. Ziaur Rahman's portrait was installed opposite a similar one of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the tenure of the last BNP-led alliance government. Delwar demanded Zia's portrait be reinstated to its former position at the national stadium. "This action was planned by the government," alleged Delwar, who added that a campaign existed to erase the names of Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia from history. He said the memory of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was being tarnished by such unwarranted activities. Delwar said he feared for the future of portraits and other tributes to Ziaur Rahman across the country. bdne
