 TEHRAN, Aug 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in as Iran's president on Wednesday, nearly eight weeks after a disputed election that unleashed the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution and divided the political and clerical elite. The 53-year-old hard-liner took his oath of office before parliament, with riot police out in force in nearby streets to foil any protests by opponents who say the election was rigged. "I, as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, swear before the holy Koran and the Iranian nation and God to be the guardian of the official religion, the Islamic Republic and the constitution," Ahmadinejad declared at the ceremony. Opposition websites said supporters of Ahmadinejad's main political rival, Mirhossein Mousavi, were planning protests. A witness reported seeing hundreds of Mousavi supporters in the vicinity of parliament, but no clashes with the riot police and Basij militia there. Police arrested at least 10 protesters, the witness said, adding that mobile phones had been cut off. Ahmadinejad said Iran wanted peaceful coexistence with the world, but would resist any "bullying" power. "Internationally, we seek peace and security. But because we want this for all of humanity, we oppose injustice, aggression and the high-handedness of some countries," he said. U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of France, Britain, Italy and Germany have all decided not to congratulate Ahmadinejad on his re-election. But the White House acknowledged that Ahmadinejad was Iran's "elected leader." Ahmadinejad reacted tartly to the Western cold shoulder. "We heard that some of the Western leaders had decided to recognize but not congratulate the new government," he said. "Well, no one in Iran is waiting for your messages." He now has two weeks to present a cabinet to parliament for approval, but may get a rough ride from the conservatives who dominate the assembly, as well as from his moderate foes. Mousavi and reformist cleric Mehdi Karoubi say the next government will be illegitimate -- defying Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has formally endorsed Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad has also come under fire from some hardliners angered by his initial choice of Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaie as his first vice-president. They were further upset when he took a week to obey Khamenei's order to dismiss Mashaie. Nevertheless, Khamenei described Ahmadinejad as "courageous, hardworking and wise" at a ceremony on Monday that was boycotted by leading moderates, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who support Mousavi. At least 20 people have been killed since the June 12 election and hundreds have been arrested. The authorities opened a mass trial on Saturday for more than 100 reformists on charges of inciting unrest. The next session of what Khatami and Mousavi have denounced as a "show trial" will take place on Thursday. Iran accuses the West, particularly the United States and Britain, of having fomented trouble after the election, which officials describe as the healthiest in the Islamic Republic's history, in an attempt to topple clerical rule. "Enemies tried to question the election's validity," Ahmadinejad said after taking the oath. The West suspects Iran of seeking a nuclear bomb. Tehran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purpo
