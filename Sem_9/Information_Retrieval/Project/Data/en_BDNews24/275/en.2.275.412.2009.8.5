 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)--Former British envoy Anwar Choudhury has denied the allegation of having orchestrated the Jan 11, 2007 takeover by the military-installed caretaker government that was in office for two years. "I categorically deny any involvement in the 1/11 shift in the political scenario," said Choudhury, currently on an official visit to Dhaka as director in charge of International Organisations of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Bangladesh-born British diplomat, who arrived in Dhaka Monday, emphasised that any change that happened on that date was a 'result of the internal dynamics of Bangladesh.' A statement made available on Wednesday by the UK High Commission in Dhaka quoted Choudhury as saying Britain and Bangladesh have been friends for a long time. The standing foreign policy of the UK is to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, said Choudhury, who served as British high commissioner to Bangladesh from 2004 to May 2008. "Britain supports a democratic, stable and transparent Bangladesh and we believe that independent countries must make their own decisions without any external influence," Choudhury observed when asked to comment on allegations that he was instrumental in the 1/11 changeover of power. Incumbent British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans in July also refuted the allegation that the diplomatic community in Bangladesh had a hand in "calling the army out of barracks" in Jan 2007. He also spoke in defence of Choudhury. Evans stressed that the state of emergency was imposed at the time as an "internal dynamic" in Bangladesh. Outgoing German ambassador Frank Meyke had also stressed that diplomats in Dhaka played no part in prompting a state of emergency "But once it happened, we supported it." The statements came at a time when some in the ruling and opposition parties have been talking of bringing the leaders of the 1/11 changeover "to justice" for imposing emergency rule and installing a two-year interim regime without constitutional basis. Choudhury, when asked to comment on the performance of the two-year rule of the caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, said that it was up to the Bangladeshi people to evaluate the government of that period. Pledges support for robust democracy He reiterated UK's solid stance in support of prosperity, stability and a transparent democracy and hopes that democracy will become stronger in Bangladesh The diplomat said that he would continue work to improve UK-Bangladesh relations further as part of his new job, which involves international relations with governments of other countries and international institutes. "I am very happy to be here and though I was busy travelling extensively with responsibilities involving the G-20 summit, the positive reports from Bangladesh like the holding of a transparent election and the establishment of a democratic government have reached me." "I also hope that the ruling party and the opposition will work together for a better Bangladesh," he added. During his visit to Bangladesh, Choudhury will meet with top government officials, media personalities, UN officials and civil society members. "I would also love to meet the opposition leader [Khaleda Zia]," he said and added that the current opposition had a cordial relation with the UK once they were in power. "We had very warm relations and worked together to combat extremism,' commented the former high commissio
