 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)Veteran BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury MP warned of a similar fate for his party's erstwhile 'reformists' after Awami League, in forming its new committee earlier in the week, sidelined long-time party heavyweights who were seen to take the part of the past caretaker government in trying to bring about 'party reforms'. Chowdhury praised AL president Sheikh Hasina on her new committee. "The new Awami League committee reflects the bravery of the party president." "The situation will be even tougher for the so-called BNP's reformists. Proper steps will be initiated against them in time," Chowdhury warned. Chowdhury said Khaleda Zia and her family members had to face "severe torture", during the caretaker government regime that tried to expel and exile the two party's top leaders. "So, wherever the reformists are, they will meet dire consequences." Aggressive about 1/11 'allies' Chowdhury had strong words about the upcoming visit of former British high commissioner Anwar Chowdhury to Dhaka scheduled for August 3. The BNP leader termed him as an "ally of the 1/11 leaders", and the "Lord Clive of the 21st century", requesting the Bangladesh government not to issue him a visa. He said, "National security might be at risk if he, along with the four other diplomats linked to the 1/11 takeover, appear in Bangladesh." Chowdhury also urged the government to declare the present high commissioners of the UK, USA, European Union, United Nations and India as 'objectionable/adverse'. He said that it was a failure of the government not to take any steps against them. Chowdhury said, "We had to live in the jail for two years with two blankets. The Awami League government has to be conscious so that they can't create further conspiracy." Moreover he demanded trial of the main actors of 1/11, the former president, chief adviser, advisers and army chief for violating the constitution. The procedure of moving a petition in the High Court was underway, he added. Chowdhury said last week he would seek to have sedition charges brought against former president Iajuddin Ahmed, former caretaker government chief Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief Moeen U Ahmed, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and eight others for what he termed the "unconstitutional" takeover of power on Jan 11, 2007. bd
