The meeting on Sunday at Chievres Air Base was arranged to give Gates an update on a review of the war being conducted by US Army General Stanley McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said.

McChrystal is due to provide his 60-day assessment of the war by mid-August. Morrell said the meeting also was attended by: Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; US Army General David Petraeus, head of US Central Command; Admiral James Stavridis, NATO's top commander; Pentagon policy chief Michele Flournoy; and US Army Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, McChrystal's de
