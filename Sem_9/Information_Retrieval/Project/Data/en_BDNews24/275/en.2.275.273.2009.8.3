 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has called on expatriate Bangladeshis to invest in the homeland to assist in its social and economic development. He has said the ninth parliament was working to create a thriving democracy despite the many obstacles. "Our democracy has faced many problems as a result of political tugs-of-war and corruption, which slowed the wheel of the country's economy," a government press release quoted Hamid as telling expatriate Bangladeshis in London on Monday. The event was organised by the Centre for Non-Resident Bangladeshis at the Crown Plaza Dockland Hall in London. "We have to work together to promote democracy through parliament," said Hamid. The speaker is heading a 10-member delegation to London. The event was also attended, among others, by MP Mujibul Haque, Atiur Rahman Atik, Sanjida Khan, Bangladeshi High Commissioner in London Saidur Rahman Khan, DCCI president Zafar Osman and DSE chairman Rakibur Rahman. b
