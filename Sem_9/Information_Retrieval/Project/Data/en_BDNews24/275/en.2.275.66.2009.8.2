Rahman, appointed on Friday, said, for example, the 1996-2001 Awami League government had not decided to export gas to India despite being under intensepressure from the two visiting former US presidents. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had not agreed to export gas without ensuring domestic supply for 50 years, he added. "A parliamentary envoy has gone there (India) to discuss and that is the only way to resolve the matter. Everyone along with the prime minister is trying hard to fix the problem," said the junior minister on his first day in office. He met with the officials and spoke to the media.
