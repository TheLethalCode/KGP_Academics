 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary committee on education ministry will investigate the violent clashes between Dhaka University students and troops beginning on Aug 20, 2007 following an appeal by DU teachers. Committee head Rashed Khan Menon said the Aug 20-22 incidents were "a stage-managed show". "We will probe into the incident," Menon told reporters after a committee meeting. The students had argued with army members at the gymnasium ground on Aug 22 over a cricket match and later fought pitched battles with army and police for days. The clashes spilled on the campuses across the country. Menon said the watchdog would seek investigation reports by the home ministry and the judicial probe commission led by justice Habibur Rahman. "We will see whether the military's intelligence wing DGFI had made the occurrence to influence the Dhaka University Teachers' Association elections," he said. DU teachers Anwar Hossain, Muntasir Mamun, Palash Bhowmik and Shamsul Alam recently appealed to the government to reinvestigate the unrest. A slew of charges were pressed over the Aug 22 violence and many teachers and students of Dhaka University and Rajshahi University were arrested on charges of . They were convicted and sentenced by the court and later the military-installed caretaker government later exempted them from the sentences. Allegations were that the army had tortured the students after arrest. Menon said the teachers had been convicted and exempted through the stage-managed drama. But there has been yet no official orders on the exemption of the sentences and this bars the convicted teachers and students from going abroad. "We will ask the home ministry about the matter," he said. The teachers that were accused are former Dhaka University Teachers Association president professor Sadrul Amin, general secretary professor Anwar Hossain, social sciences faculty dean professor Harun-or-Rashid and applied physics and electronics department chairman professor Nimchandra Bhowmik. The four DU and 10 RU students were convicted in two cases of student unrest at Dhaka and Rajshahi universities. Four teachers and 11 students were acquitted of the same charges. bdnew
