 STANFORD, California, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American Venus Williams crushed Russian Elena Dementieva 6-0, 6-1 in the semi-finals of the Stanford Classic on Saturday. Williams will face Marion Bartoli in the final after the Frenchwoman battled to a 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 victory over Australia's Samantha Stosur. Second seed Williams nailed 20 winners and converted 16 of 18 approaches at the net to ensure she reached the Stanford final for the seventh time in eight appearances. "I felt like everything went well for me today," said the 29-year-old, who won the tournament in 2000 and 2002. "I was able to raise my level on important points."

The eighth-seeded Bartoli put on a return of serve clinic against the powerful Stosur, punching back her first serves and laying waste to a number of her second serves. The 14th-ranked Frenchwoman, who also reached the Stanford final last year, was also far more consistent from the baseline during the third set. She ended the contest with 21 unforced errors to a whopping 37 from Stosur. "She was unbeatable in the second set," Bartoli said.
