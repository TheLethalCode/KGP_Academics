<TITLE> Tancock breaks record to win 50 backstroke </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Liam Tancock broke his own world record from the semi-finals to take gold in the men's 50 metres backstroke at the world championships on Sunday. Tancock, bronze medallist at the last Melbourne worlds two years ago, swam 24.04 seconds with Japan's Junya Koga second and South Africa's defending champion Gerhard Zandberg third. The Briton had clocked 24.08 in Saturday's semi-final to fire a warning to Koga, who had taken the 100 backstroke title on Tuesday. A deluge of world records have been broken in Rome thanks to performance-enhancing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January in order to restore swimming's battered image. Spanish contender Aschwin Wildeboer could only finish fourth.
