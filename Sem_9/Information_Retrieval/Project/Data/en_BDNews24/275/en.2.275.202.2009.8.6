 CHENNAI, India, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) is confident India's cricket authorities will eventually comply with the World Anti-Doping Agency's "whereabouts" rule, its chief executive Haroon Lorgat has said. The cash-rich Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) rejected the controversial "whereabouts" rule, backing its players' refusal to sign the directive. "It is a difficult situation to be in no doubt but we are confident of convincing the Indian players and the BCCI," Lorgat told DNA newspaper. The ICC became a signatory to WADA in 2006 and its board last year unanimously approved out-of-competition tests on cricketers in accordance with amendments made by WADA to the code. "Every board has signed the code and we're sure the Indian players and the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, will understand this," Lorgat said. "Even if they don't agree they need to abide by the universal code in the larger interest of the game. "We cannot reject the code. We have to implement it. All we need to do now is to properly explain to the BCCI the need to be WADA-compliant."
