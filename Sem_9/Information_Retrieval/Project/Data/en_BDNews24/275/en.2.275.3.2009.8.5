<TITLE> Zimbabwe's vice president Msika dies: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's veteran vice president Joseph Msika, a loyal ally of President Robert Mugabe, died on Wednesday, state broadcaster ZBC reported, opening the way for a political fight over one of the country's key posts. Msika, 85, was on life support when Mugabe visited him on Tuesday night, ZBC reported the president as telling a meeting of his ZANU-PF party's politburo. "He (Mugabe) announced to the members of the politburo the passing on of Comrade Msika this morning. He said some of his organs had stopped functioning," a ZBC reporter said. The death of Msika, who was also deputy president of Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and one of the founding leaders of its nationalist liberation movements, is likely to re-ignite debate on who will succeed Mugabe as leader of the party. The vacancy for deputy president in ZANU-PF has always been the subject of intense lobbying by the party's two main factions with the position seen as a stepping stone to succeeding the 85-year-old Mugabe. Msika, known for his outbursts against Mugabe's critics, lacked a power base of his own and many inside and outside ZANU-PF said he had reached the peak of his political career. He largely owed his position to the 1987 power sharing accord which merged Mugabe's ZANU-PF and the late Joshua Nkomo's PF-ZAPU.
