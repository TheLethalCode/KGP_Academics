 LOS ANGELES, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The sixth edition of "UCLA Slang" is being published this month and it is just "presh!" The book is released every four years by linguistics professor Pamela Munro and her students at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Munro said the lighthearted dictionary is put together using a methodical process that starts with students collecting slang from friends followed by a detailed analysis to make sure submissions are spelled and defined correctly. "Students learn a lot about grammar, language and linguistics," Munro said. "You can study anything you want about ordinary language through the medium of slang." The 160-page English-slanglish lexicon includes terms, definitions, parts of speech, sample sentences and notes on the etymology and origin of new slang, Munro said. The dictionary supplies such words and definitions as "presh," which means cute or precious. Other terms or phrases include "fomo," or fear of missing out, "schwa" for wow; and "obama," meaning cool, as in "You so obama." "Bromance" means a close platonic friendship. And "bellig" means drunk and belligerent. "Eargasm" means, well, just what it sounds like. If all this is new, just say "I.D.K." to indicate "I didn't know.
