 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)A Kuwait Airways flight with 229 passengers on board made an emergency landing at the Zia International Airport with engine trouble on Sunday immediately after takeoff. The director of the airport, wing commander M Saeedul Hasan Khan, told bdnews24.com that the engine problem might have developed from a collision with a bird. No-one was injured in the incident, though, Khan added. The plane had left for Kuwait at 7:38am but returned and landed immediately. Traffic officer of the airline Mahmudul Hassan said, "One engine of the plane developed complications after a bird came in contact with the plane." The airline sent 30 passengers to London and five to Paris by another plane and kept the rest at hotel. Fifty-five of them will be sent to their middle-east destinations on Sunday night, according to Hassan. But no decision has been made about the 90 who were to go to New York, the officer added. bd
