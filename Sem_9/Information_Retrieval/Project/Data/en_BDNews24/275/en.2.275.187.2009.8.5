 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A missile believed to have been fired by a US drone struck the house of Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud's father-in-law on Wednesday, killing at least one woman and two militants, a security official and a relative said. US missile attacks on Mehsud territory in the South Waziristan tribal region have become more frequent in the past month and Pakistan has also bombarded the militant stronghold with air raids and medium range artillery. Mehsud's whereabouts were not known at the time the time of the attack, which occurred shortly before 1.00 a.m. (1900 GMT Tuesday) on the house near Makeen, a remote village in the heart of the Mehsud tribal lands. A security official in the region told Reuters that two militants were killed in the attack. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity concerning intelligence matters. A relative, however, said women and children were also among the casualties. "I received a call from my family that a drone had hit the house. One woman of the family was killed and four children wounded," the relative told Reuters. He did not want to be identified. Mehsud is regarded as Public Enemy No. 1 in Pakistan and the United States has place a $5 million reward on his head. Mehsud declared himself leader of the Pakistan Taliban, grouping around 13 factions in the northwest, in late 2007, and his fighters have been behind a wave of suicide attacks inside Pakistan and on Western forces across the border in Afghanistan. He is accused of being behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, a charge he has denied. Conspiracy theories abound over who killed the former prime minister. The government ordered a military offensive against Mehsud in June, but analysts believe the army is waiting until it has finished a campaign against the Taliban in the Swat valley, far to the east and closer to Islamabad, before fully opening up another front. Meanwhile, the army has sealed roads around Mehsud's mountain redoubt and villagers have fled the area in anticipation of an operation
