 NEW DELHI, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Indian cricket board has rejected the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) "whereabouts" rule, backing its players' refusal to sign up to the directive due to security and privacy issues. "The clause with regards to whereabouts is unreasonable," Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar told a news conference after an urgent meeting convened in Mumbai on Sunday to discuss the issue. The International Cricket Council (ICC) became a WADA signatory in 2006 and its board last year unanimously approved out-of-competition tests on cricketers in accordance with amendments made by WADA to the code.

He said security was the first issue as some players, such as Sachin Tendulkar and Dhoni, needed security cover due to militant threats and their whereabouts could not be divulged. "Secondly, the privacy of the individual cannot be impeded. And thirdly... the constitution of India gives a person some guarantees, for every citizen regarding his privacy. "It cannot be impeded for all 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 365 days." WADA regulations state that three missed disclosures of whereabouts in an 18-month period could result in a two-year ban from international cricket. Manohar blamed the situation on the issue not being discussed when it came up at the ICC meeting. "All the members agree we have to be WADA compliant," he said.
