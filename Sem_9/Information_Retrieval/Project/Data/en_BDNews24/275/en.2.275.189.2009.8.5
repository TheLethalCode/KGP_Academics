 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five Brazilian athletes training in Germany for this month's world championships have failed out of competition doping tests and will return home, the Brazilian Athletics Confederation (CBAt) has said. According to a CBAt statement, sprinters Bruno Lins Tenorio, Jorge Celio Sena, Josiane Tito and Luciana Franca, and heptathlete Lucimara Silvestre had tested positive for the banned substance Recombinant EPO. The CBAt said the five had asked for the B sample to be tested and would return home to await the outcome. "The athletes -- who are banned from taking part in competitions until the results of the respective counter-tests are known -- are returning home, accompanied by their coaches... and prefer to present their defence in (their own) country," the statement said. "Due to the seriousness of the incident, the CBAt has ordered an administrative inquiry." The tests were carried out in Presidente Prudente, Brazil on June 16, the CBat added. Tenorio was in the Brazil team which finished fourth in the men's 4x100 metres relay at the Beijing Olympics last year while Tito and Silvestre also competed at the Games. The world championships start in Berlin on August 15.
