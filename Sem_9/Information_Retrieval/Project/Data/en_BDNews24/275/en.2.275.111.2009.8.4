The project aims to address the high death rates among women and infants in Sylhet through improved outreach by field workers, increased education for safe pregnancy and delivery, and improved family planning and child spacing, a statement issued by the US embassy said. Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque also attended in launch. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will implement the project. According to the latest Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, only 51 percent of women see a medically trained provider at least once during their pregnancy and nearly half of newborns die within 30 days of birth. Mamoni will work in 15 upazilas and reach out to 3.5 million people. The project aims to increase pregnancy-related care, support safe delivery, and increase community involvement in caring for pregnant women. It will also organise emergency transport for pregnant women in labour.
