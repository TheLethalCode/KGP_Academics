<TITLE> CHT Land Commission kicks into action after 8 years </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Khagrachhari, August 4 (bdnews24.com)The Chittagong Hill Tracts Land Commission is finally set to start work, eight years after its inception, to resolve decades-long land disputes in the region, the commission's chairman said after a historic first meeting on Tuesday. "The commission's work will focus on rehabilitation of indigenous refugees returning from India and the internally displaced population," retired justice Khademul Islam Chowdhury told reporters after the commission's first meeting at the Khagrachhari Circuit House. The work will begin following completion of land surveys over the next three months, he said. The Land Commission was formed in 2001 in line with the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, but never got off the ground due lack of funds and manpower. The Bangladesh government signed the accord with Pabatya Chattagram Janasanghati Saminit (PCJSS) in 1997 to end two decades of insurgency and establish permanent peace in the region. As part of the accord, the government pledged to pull out army troops in phases and resolve land disputes in the three hill districts. The Land Commission's meeting on Tuesday comes just a week after the government announced the "biggest withdrawal" of army troops from the region since the accord was signed. Chowdhury said, "Today was the first meeting and more meetings will be held once the full commission is formed." "Although we have just two members working now, I hope the rest will be appointed very soon." He said the full 13-member commission would review land allocations once the land surveys were complete. Chowdhury also said existing land laws would be amended if necessary to resolve land disputes in the region. Nurul Islam, of the Chittagong divisional commissioner's office, chairman of the CHT taskforce Jatindra Lal Tripura MP, Mong Circle chief Shaching Prue Chowdhury and acting chairman of Khagrachhari hill district council Ruithi Karbari were among those present in the meeting. But no member, or the chairman, of the CHT regional council attended Tuesday's meeting. Chairman of CHT regional council Jotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, told bdnews24.com, "We had made preparations for the meeting. Of course we would have joined the talks if we were invited." "According to the peace accord all land disputes are supposed to be resolved through discussion with the members and chairmen of the district councils and regional council," said Raktotpol Tripura, a member of the CHT regional council. Troubles began in the region after indigenous communities, led by Chakma leaders, took up arms in the 1970s in protest against the government of a newly independent Bangladesh for its "inaction" over key demands. The demands included decommissioning the Kaptai hydroelectric project and restoration of land rights. The Kaptai Lake, built in the 1960s, inundated the palace of the Chakma King and vast tracts of land displacing thousands of people. Large numbers also fled across the border to India for safety during the two decades of insurgency following the army's deployment in the region. The AL government, after coming back to power in January, vowed to revive the long-dormant CHT Land Commission to fully implement the peace accord it signed in 1997. "The Awami League government closed the peace deal. The same government will do everything possible for the implementation of the accord," law minister Shafique Ahmed said back in February. bdne
