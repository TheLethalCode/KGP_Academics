 WELLINGTON, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand set off for their tour of Sri Lanka Monday after receiving assurances about their safety. The New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA) visited Sri Lanka last month to check on arrangements before giving players the go-ahead to proceed after they were promised extra security. "We've requested a few changes and now it's at a level where we're confident we can travel there safely," NZCPA boss Heath Mills told the New Zealand Press Association. "We have a comprehensive security wing around the team, our guys will have a couple of hundred security officers around them at all times." The first tour match is Friday, followed by two tests, two Twenty20 internationals and a one-day international triangular series involving India. The odds are heavily stacked against New Zealand, who have not played a test since April, with the side in a rebuilding phase after welcoming back players banned for joining the rebel Indian Cricket League. Captain Daniel Vettori said they were going full of hope but with realistic expectations. "You always want to go into a series wanting to win but if we could pull off a couple of draws or win the series 1-0, that would be an exciting result for this team," he said.
