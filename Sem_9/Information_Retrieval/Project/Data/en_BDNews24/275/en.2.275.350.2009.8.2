<TITLE> Tk 1000 cr 'fast-track' plan to meet gas deficit: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to boost gas production by up to 300 million cubic feet a day from existing gas fields under a Tk 1000 crore "fast-track programme", the prime minister's energy adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury said on Sunday. He said the prime minister had recently approved the plan to secure the hiked output within the next three years to meet the country's production deficit. Bangladesh's gas production total around 1800 million cubic feet a day against a daily demand of 2200 million cubic feet. Chowdhury was speaking to reporters at the Sangu offshore gas field, where he was inaugurating the installation of two new gas compressors. Exploratory drilling in the Sangu field was completed in 1996 by a subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC, who began production in 1998 in collaboration with Petrobangla. Since then, 10 wells have produced an average of 450 million cubic feet of gas a day, although production has recently declined. Cairn Energy's acting managing director Ian Wright said the two new compressors would help maintain current rates of production for at least the next three years. However, a Cairn Energy official, not wishing to be named, said there was little possibility of upping gas production at Sangu despite installation of the new compressors. Chowdhury told reporters the government was planning a new energy fund to finance wider gas extraction and exploration initiatives as well as alternate and renewable energies. "Money for the fund will come from a number of sources, including additional revenue generated by recent gas price increases," said Chowdhury. He said remittances and the stock exchange would also add to the new energy sector war-chest. Chwodhury said the government had also begun the process of importing liquefied natural gas under Public-Private Partnership (PPP) schemes to assist with gas shortfalls. The government is also trying to hike power generation with a 500 megawatt oil-based power plant, said Toufique, who added that another 1000 megawatt coal-fired power plant would be built within the next four years. bdnews24.
