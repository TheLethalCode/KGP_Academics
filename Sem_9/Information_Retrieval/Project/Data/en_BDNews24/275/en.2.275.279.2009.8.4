<TITLE> Moudud says CHT pullout threatens 'non-indigenous' residents </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed said on Tuesday that the partial army withdrawal from the Chittagong Hill Tracts was designed to clear "non-indigenous residents" from the area. "The army withdrawal will jeopardise the security of the non-indigenous community and they may be forced to leave the area," said Moudud at a meeting on the withdrawal of troops from CHT at the National Press Club. On July 29, the government announced the "biggest withdrawal" of army troops from the CHT since a peace accord was signed over a decade ago in an attempt to bring stability to the long-troubled region. Moudud, a member of the BNP standing committee, termed the pullout "part of a long-term conspiracy", adding that the decision was "suicidal" for the country. "The murder of army officers in Peelkhana, the Tipaimukh dam project, giving a corridor to a neighbouring country in the name of an Asian highway, these are all elements of the same conspiracy," said Moudud. He also condemned the role of the interim government, alleging that its aim had been to weaken Bangladesh's standing internationally. Moudud said the interim administration had destroyed the judicial system and tried many cases in 'kangaroo courts'. Turning to another topic, Moudud said the parliamentary delegation's failure to reach the site of the proposed Tipaimukh dam in India's northeastern Manipur state due to bad weather was "an excuse". "This excuse makes me laugh. In fact, the delegation made the visit with the sole aim of legitimising the project," he said. Delegation head Abdur Razzak and five other members of the 10-strong parliamentary team returned from New Delhi Tuesday. The BNP leader made his comments at a discussion titled 'Army Withdrawal from the Hill Tracts: Threats to Independence and Sovereignty', organised by the Bangladesh Cultural Academy.
