<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The government has reinstated the two district judges, the president and secretary of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association, just days after sending them into retirement. The law ministry in a statement Monday said the July 30 notification regarding the order of retirement of Dhaka district sessions judge Mohammad Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression prevention tribunal judge Mohammad Shahjahan was overturned. The reinstatement is effective from July 30, it said. Gafur and Shahjahan were ordered into retirement for failing to abide by "good conduct and discipline in public administration". Law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Sunday that the president by his power issued the order to send them into retirement and now by practicing the same power he may withdraw the order. He said it was a "procedural mistake" while asked whether the government had made a wrong decision. Preferring not to be named, a JSA member told bdnews24.com the two judges met with the prime minister at her official Hare residence on Sunday morning along with the home minister, law minister and state minister for law. "The decision to overturn the retirement order was made in the meeting." The two judges had been preparing to make a legal appeal against the decision, the official added. A government handout last Thursday announced the decision to retire the two judges. The retirement order had followed an unruly protest by members of the judiciary who complained that they had not been properly consulted over judicial reforms. Around 150 judicial officials, led by Gafur and Shahjahan, met with law minister Shafique Ahmed at the secretariat on July 27 to complain that their opinions had not been solicited prior to the process of separation of the judiciary that began in 2007. They also demanded removal of law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. Deputy home secretary for security Naizam Uddin Khan later arrived at the scene with armed police to calm the protests. A JSA leader told bdnews24.com in reaction to the retirement order: "The government has no jurisdiction to take such an action without the chief justice's approval." bdne
