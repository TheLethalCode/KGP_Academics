 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court has cleared three Dhaka University teachers of all charges linked to the campus unrest of August 2007. The court reversed the 2008 convictions and two-year prison sentences of professors Harun-or-Rashid, Sadrul Amin and Anwar Hossain. President Iajuddin Ahmed had issued special pardons for the three immediately after the convictions, in January last year, but the convictions themselves were not cancelled at the time. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Mohammad Abul Bashar dismissed the previous court verdict on Tuesday on a petition by the three DU teachers. They had filed the petition on Feb 25, 2008 seeking the withdrawal of the verdict against them on the grounds that the president had pardoned them. Hearing on the petition ended on July 2 this year. Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal-3 judge Mohammad Golam Robbani had convicted the three teachers on Jan 22 last year for inciting students to break emergency powers rules during. The case, filed with Shahbagh Police Station on Aug 23, 2007, charged the senior teachers with violating emergency powers rules by inciting the students to unrest and participating with them in demonstrations. Meanwhile, the parliamentary standing committee on the education ministry announced last week that it will investigate the clashes between Dhaka University students and army personnel on Aug 20, 2007, which led to three days of campus riots and unrest and a countrywide curfew. bd
