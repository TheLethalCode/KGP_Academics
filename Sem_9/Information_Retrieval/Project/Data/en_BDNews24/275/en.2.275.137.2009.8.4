 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  The new state minister for home has said no-one is safe from the reach of criminals, terrorists and militants in the country. "We are all under their eye; it is the reality. Neither big nor small, no-one is beyond their network," Shamsul Haque Tuku said at the opening of the renovated Sher-e-Bangla Police Station in the city. "None enjoys safety while traveling, in a rickshaw or a car. We have to overcome this situation." He vowed the strongest measures to deal with organised crime. "Why shouldn't we be just as aggressive as they are to contain terrorism in the country." "Who is stronger in number? Us or them?" "Terrorists and militants are attacking the very existence of Bangladesh. JMB and others are trying to weaken our position in every ways." "We have to think right now how we will leave our country for our next generation, saving it from militants and terrorists." "A handful of war criminals, anti-liberation elements and terrorists have taken the country to this state. But, it will not be difficult for us to curb them if we stand united against them." Assuring police of solving many problems, he pointed out that prime minister Sheikh Hasina had increased rations for them realising their problems. The government had also decided to appoint 30000 more police personnel and equip them with modern equipment, said Tuku. He told those at the station, "The law order situation has to be improved. You yourself have to control your thana." "The government, party or we will not interfere. But, we have to take steps if you fail in ensuring law and order." Asked whether any steps will be taken about allegations against Rapid Action Battalion and other agencies, of rights abuses, he said, "Steps must be taken if definite evidence is found." Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AK Shahidul Huq also spoke at the ceremony. bdnews24.c
