<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)Allegations of massive irregularities have been levelled at former housing and law adviser Mainul Hosein by a parliamentary panel which says he had misused his office mostly to favour his family. The probe body, or sub-committee, formed by the standing committee on housing and public works on June 25, has also accused the former adviser's of an "arbitrary decision" to employ ship-breaking workers in the demolition of the Rangs Bhaban, leading to the death of 13 innocent people. "Their deaths must be investigated," said Nasrul Hamid Bipu, an Awami League MP and convener of the sub-committee, at a press conference after a meeting at parliament building. Bipu said his probe body would suggest that the standing committee recommend legal actions against Hosein. Hosein trashed the allegations on Monday. "Let them prove the allegations." "Bangladesh is yet to give birth to a person worthy of proving corruption charges against me," he told bdnews24.com. Bipu had earlier told reporters at parliament's media centre, "We have received innumerable corruption charges against former adviser Mainul Hosein." "While serving as adviser, he misused his authority to help his son and wife for gains." He said Hosein's son, Arshad, had occupied a house in Gulshan and turned it into a restaurant violating government rules. Arshad set up a restaurant in Gulshan-1 (CSE-G, plot-1), said Bipu. "Hosein had directly intervened when city developer RAJUK had tried to take action against his son." The probe body chief said Hosein's son Arshad also illegally grabbed the house of Rizia Mannan and Fazle Mannan in Gulshan and made it a commercial entityMantra and Steak Housewithout RAJUK's permission. "RAJUK could not demolish the building as his adviser father Mainul Hosein directly intervened," said Bipu. "In addition, the son also constructed the Musafir Tower in Kakrail in flagrant breach of the RAJUK guidelines." Hosein however said that the tower had been built much before he became adviser. Bipu also said Hosein had allocated 158 plots of the Khulna Development Authority and 459 plots in Kushtia Housing Estate and allocated public land to 'a private university' in Mirpur "in violation of the government rules". Bipu did not name the university. He said the probe body would hold two or three meetings to finalise and submit the charges against Hosein to the parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works ministry for final decisions. Hosein is the second former adviser, to the immediate-past caretaker government that came to power pledging elimination of corruption, to face graft charges. Former shipping adviser MA Matin also faces corruption charges. Both Hosein and Matin were very critical of the politicians after the announcement of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. MPs from both the Awami League and the main opposition BNP, meanwhile, have been demanding in parliament that the persons involved in the declaration of the state of emergency in 2007 are tried. Asaduzzaman Khan, Jahirul Haque Bhuiyan Mohan and Enamul Haque and the BNP's Lutfar Rahman are the other members of the enquiry committee on Hosein.
