 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Investment has slipped due to the global recession, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Sunday, leading to record levels of excess liquidity in the banking sector. "Foreign direct investment and domestic investment have both decreased due to the global recession," he told reporters after a meeting with ceramics manufacturers. "Money is lying idle as loan circulation remains stagnant," said Muhith. Bangladesh Bank statistics showed excess liquidity reaching a record Tk 2770 crore in the commercial banking sector in April. "No one dares to invest amid a global recession. Everyone is watching and waiting," said Muhith. "Investment will rise when the impact of the recession eases. We have to be prepared for that time." He said the government would continue its incentives package to support industries until the recession eased. Muhith said the global economy might gain fresh impetus after the annual meetings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund in Istanbul this October. The finance minister said rules and regulations for new public private partnership (PPP) initiatives, under the current budget, will be finalised by August-September of this year. Investment would rise through PPP, he said. Muhith was also hopeful of large PPP input in the power sector. He said the government was giving highest priority to solving the power crisis to foster investment. "No one will invest if we fail to ensure a stable power sector." He said the government was undertaking a "mega plan" for the sector. Asked to comment on banks being slow to reduce lending rates, even though corporate tax for the financial sector was cut in the last budget, Muhith said, "We are aware of the issue. But we believe Bangladesh Bank will take care of it." "The central bank will take the proper decision in due time," he said. bdn
