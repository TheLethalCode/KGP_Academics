 PATNA, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in Bihar are distributing free radio sets to lower-caste villagers so that they can listen to music and news after a hard day's work and improve their awareness, officials said on Wednesday. Officials are distributing transistors costing 400 rupees ($8) each among hundreds of "Dalits" or the formerly "Untouchables" who remain oppressed at the bottom of India's ancient Hindu caste system. "It (radio) will entertain the tired villagers with music and will make them aware about what is happening around with news," Bihar's Tribal Welfare Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, said on Wednesday. Manjhi said the move will empower the dalit villagers further and raise general awareness levels. "You can listen to music, news and improve your areas of information if you have a radio at home," Chief Minister Nitish Kumar added. More than 16 percent of India's 1.1-billion population are Dalits and they continue to face discrimination and injustice although untouchability now is a crime.
