 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Wednesday strongly condemned the government's 'double standard' role regarding the cases filed by the last caretaker government. Referring to the Anticorruption Commission's move to press charges against leader of the opposition and BNP chief Khaleda Zia in an embezzlement case earlier in the day, in the court, "It was an eyewash with the case from the government. The pressing of charges was motivational." The ACC pressed charges against Khaleda Zia, elder son Tarique Rahman and four others in the Zia Orphanage Trust embezzlement case on Wednesday. Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. "On one side the government is withdrawing cases filed against them during the caretaker government rule. On the other side they are pressing charges and issuing arrest warrants in the cases filed against the opposition," said Delwar, referring also to the Awami League government's quashing of 'political harassment cases' filed by previous administrations. "Our protest will be stronger if they keep hitting this way," he warned. Delwar was speaking at a gathering organised in front the party's Nayapaltan office to protest the removal of a large mural of former president Ziaur Rahman from the Bangabandhu National Stadium. bd
