<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The government will investigate the financial anomalies and appointment irregularities at the public universities during the 2001-08 tenures of the four-party coalition government and the creataker regime, the education minister said on Sunday. "Judicial probe commission will be formed on four to five universities where irregularities were more intense than the others," Nurul Islam Nahid said at a meet-the-press on the state of education in the capital. The minister said the National University was a hotbed of corruption where "1800 appointments were made in a single day". He warned that officers of the secondary and higher education directorate will be sacked if found guilty of graft charges. "I will not be with a corruption-marred ministry." An education ministry official told bdnews24.com that judicial probe committees will be formed for National University, Open University, Rajshahi University, Maulana Bhasani University of Science and Technology in Tangail and Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Sylhet. Nahid said many private universities have failed to meet standards. "So a new law is underway for private universities, and hopefully it will be placed before parliament in the next session." To ensure all children's enrolment and prevent dropout, the minister said, 1,500 more primary schools will be set up across the country. If necessary, all students will be given scholarships in dropout-prone areas. The printing up of 21 crore textbooks for primary and secondary classes is the most arduous task for him at the moment. He emphasised more focus on neglected technical education to create more efficient human resources. "For that technical schools will be established in each upazila." The minister said his government was not at all against madrasa education. "We want modern and realistic education in madrasa alongside religious education." bd
