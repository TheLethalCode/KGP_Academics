 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com) - The government has raised the price of natural gas for domestic and commercial users, effective from Saturday (Aug 1). Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission announced the monthly charge for domestic supply has been raised to Tk 400 from Tk 350 for a single burner gas cooker, and to Tk 450 from Tk 400 for a double burner. Domestic users who pay for metered gas will now be charged Tk 143.25 per 1000 cubic feet, up from Tk 130. BERC chairman Md Mokhlesur Rahman Khandker told bdnews24.com on Saturday the gas prices have gone up on average 11.22 percent across the board. For commercial connections, the price has been raised to Tk 268.09 from Tk 233.12 per 1000 cubic feet. For private power plants it has been hiked to Tk 79.82 from Tk 73.98, fertiliser factories Tk 72.92 from Tk 63.41, captives and small power plants Tk 118.36 from Tk 105.59, for industries and tea gardens to Tk 166.91 from Tk 148. BERC has not raised the price of CNG. 'Tk 717 crore more a year' Petrobangla will earn another Tk 717 crore a year due to the price hike, said Khandker. BERC's order said the fund won't be treated as profit. "The new revenue will be used for the 'Gas Development Fund', to develop the sector, and will not be spent in any other sectors of Petrobangla or its subordinate organisations," Khandker told bdnews24.com. Customers' bills will have the new increment marked 'For Gas Development Fund'. A new gas policy will be developed with the approval of the commission, with public hearings arranged if needed. Petrobangla will submit proposals for the policy to develop the gas sector over the next five years. Allocations from the fund will be made based on the new policy. Petrobangla will submit reports to the BERC every six months and the programmes will also be renewed if needed, said Khandker. BERC gave its opinion after Petrobangla had requested the commission to raise gas prices in November last year. Petrobangla also issued a letter to the National Board of Revenue to waive taxes on the fund, which the NBR denied. But the ministry of finance told BERC and Petrobangla that the money taxes incurred on the fund would be returned to Petrobangla as a lump allocation. Prices of electricity Khandker said hikes in electricity prices will be decided after September. Dhaka Power Distribution Company Ltd, Dhaka Electricity Supply Company Ltd and West Zone Power Distribution Company Ltd were asked to submit information in May. DPDC, DESCO, WZOPADICO, Power Development Board and Rural Electrification Board have requested BERC to increase prices of electricity. Decisions will be made after gathering the information and analysis, said Khandker. bdn
