<TITLE> Industrialisation can't gain pace until coal, gas, power solved: Moshiur Rahman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1(bdnews24.com)Industrialisation in Bangladesh will not gain pace until problems surrounding the exploration and extraction of coal and gas were solved and power generation increased, the prime minister's finance adviser Moshiur Rahman said on Saturday. "In order to increase coal production affected communities should be compensated and relocated. Alternative employment for those who lose their land must be ensured," Rahman told a seminar on the economy organised by the Economic Reporters Forum at the National Press Club. Bangladesh has escaped the worst effects of the global recession, he said, although he cautioned that the country would begin to suffer if the downturn failed to ease relatively soon. "We are not yet robust enough to weather the impact of a prolonged recession." Rahman said greater investment by developed countries in their own infrastructure development would assist Bangladesh by providing opportunities for manpower export and remittances. President of Bangladesh Economic Association Kazi Khaliquzzaman said the government should review the annual development programme every three months rather than every six months. He also said the government's decision to disburse agricultural loans through NGOs in areas lacking banking facilities would result in large disparities in interest charged to farmers from area to area. "Some farmers will be heavily discriminated against," said Khaliquzzaman. "The government must expand the number of banks operating in rural areas," he said. Also attending the event was Economic Reporters Forum president Nazmul Ahsan, former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo and the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Waliur Rahman. Economist Ananya Rahman presented the keynote paper.
