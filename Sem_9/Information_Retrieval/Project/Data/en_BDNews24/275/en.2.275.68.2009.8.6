 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)The 68th death anniversary of Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore is being observed on Thursday with the rendering of his literary creations. Scores of organisations in Dhaka and elsewhere across the country have taken up programmes marking the day. The Bangla Academy will hold a discussion on Tagore's life and works in its seminar hall at 4pm, which will be followed by a cultural programme. Presided over by Tagore specialist Sanjida Khatun, professor Hayat Mamud will read out a special essay on the world poet. State-run Bangladesh Betar and Bangladesh Television and private radio and TV channels will broadcast strings of diverse programmes in remembrance of the great poet throughout the day. The youngest of 14 siblings, Tagore was born in 1861 at Jorashanko in Calcutta, West Bengal and grew up in a rather elevated and much enlightened cultural environment to be a ruling landlord or 'zamindar' governing sprawling estates in Kushtia, Pabna and Rajshahi in the then East Bengal. Tagore breathed his last in 1941 in Calcutta after living an eight decades of productive life after founding the world famous seat of learning Shantiniketan and writing thousands of songs, hundreds of exquisite short stories, great novels, plays and dance dramas. 'Geetanjali', a bright anthology of poems, won him the Nobel prize for literature in 1913, the first-ever for an Bengali and an Asian. The national anthem of Bangladesh was composed by Tagore, and so was India's. All branches of the Bengali literature has been enriched through about a century thanks to Tagore's diverse and voluminous works of extraordinarily high calibre. b
