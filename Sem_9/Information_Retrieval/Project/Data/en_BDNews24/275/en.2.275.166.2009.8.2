 BEIJING, Sun Aug 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese police detained 319 people suspected of involvement in deadly ethnic rioting in northwestern Xinjiang region last month, after a "wanted" list of suspects spurred tip-offs, the official Xinhua agency said on Sunday. The Public Security Bureau of the regional capital Urumqi on July 30 made public a list of names and photographs of 15 Uighurs it was seeking for their suspected role in the violence.

Uighurs, a Turkic people who are largely Muslim and share linguistic and cultural bonds with Central Asia, make up almost half of Xinjiang's 20 million people. The violence left 197 people dead, mostly Han Chinese, and wounded more than 1,600, according to official figures. Xinjiang has long been a tightly controlled hotbed of ethnic tensions, fostered by an economic gap between many Uighurs and Han Chinese, government controls on religion and culture and an influx of Han migrants who now are the majority in Urumqi. Beijing does not want to lose its grip on a vast territory that borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing reg
