 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)The world's highest rate of undernourished children is in South Asia despite having extraordinary economic growth in the last decade, says the World Bank. "The under nutrition rate in South Asian children is 45 percent, higher than in Sub-Saharan Africa where 28 percent children is underweight," Julie McLaughlin, WB South Asian sector manager for health, nutrition and population told reporters on Wednesday. Bangladesh made significant progress in the 1990s in reducing the number of underweight children, said the WB official at the press conference organised in the wake of WB's Development Marketplace, a competitive grant programme for identifying innovative, small scale projects with development potential. Visiting WB vice president for South Asia Isabel Guerrero is hosting the event. Sixty civil-society organisations from the region gathered at the city's Bangabandhu International Conference Centre to showcase innovative ideas on how to improve nutrition in the region, with focus on children aged under two years and pregnant women. Grants of up to $ 40,000 each have been awarded to 20 finalists at the closing session of the day. An additional award titled 'People's Choice Award', was also given to HIV/AIDS and STD Alliance Bangladesh for their proposal on comprehensive nutrition care to the extremely vulnerable infant and young Children. Three Bangladeshi organisations, International Centre for Diarrheal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), Concern Worldwide of Bangladesh and Training & Assistance for Health & Nutrition Foundation also received awards from finance minister AMA Muhith.
