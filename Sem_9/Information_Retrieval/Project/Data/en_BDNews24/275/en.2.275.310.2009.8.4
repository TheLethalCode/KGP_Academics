 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)A seven-year old boy was run over and killed on Tuesday by a cement-laden truck at Keraniganj and the mother was seriously injured in the hit-and-run incident on the outskirts of the capital. 'Hridoy' was killed on the spot when the truck ran over him at around 11am at Nayabazar adjacent to Ati, said Sheikh Saadi, sub-inspector of Keraniganj Police Station. Shilpi Begum, 26, the mother, has been admitted to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Hridoy's body has been sent to Mitford Hospital for autopsy report. Hridoy's father is a raw materials trader and the family lives in the Rayerchar of Keraniganj, police said. Angry locals blockaded the road adjacent to Ati for two hours to 1pm, but the traffic used the alternative route. Saadi, however, said the locals were only demanding justice. bdne
