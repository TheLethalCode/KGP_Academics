 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has ordered further investigation into the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack on an Awami League rally in the capital. Judge Md Masder Hossain, of the Speedy Trial Tribunal-1, gave investigators two more months on Monday on a petition by the prosecution. Chief public prosecutor Syed Rezaur Rahman requested further probe into the 2004 blasts on June 25 this year to discover the source and suppliers of the explosives used in the attack. The prosecution said the grenade attack, which killed more than 20 people and left scores injured, was an assassination attempt on prime minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, who was opposition chief in 2004 during BNP's previous term in power. The prosecution also says the BNP-led government made an attempt to throw previous investigations off track. Two cases, one for murder and one under the Explosives Act, were filed in 2004. The proceedings of the two cases have been running concurrently. Lawyers for BNP's former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, one of the defendants in the cases, have alleged that the present Awami League-led government "was trying different ploys to interfere with the judiciary." One of Pintu's lawyers, Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, told the court, "The government has appealed for further investigation in order to politically harass and include more politicians from the opposition." The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the cases on June 11 last year against 22 people, including Pintu and Mufti Hannan, leader of the banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul Jihad-e-Islami. Of the accused, 13 including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the rest are on the run. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified, including president Zillur Rahman, whose wife was among those killed, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and home minister Sahara Khatun. b
