<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 06 (bdnews24.com) - A parliamentary committee has called for tough measures against producers of polythene bags which, despite laws banning their manufacture and use, continue to create environmental havoc in the capital by clogging, rivers, waterways and drainage systems of Dhaka, heightening water logging problems in the capital. The parliamentary standing committee on environment at its meeting on Thursday also blamed the immediate-past caretaker government for not acting to stop the use of polythene bags across the country. State minister for environment and forest Hasan Mahmud, present at the meeting, said his ministry would go for stringent measures to enforce the law banning environmentally hazardous polythene bags. The BNP-led government in 2002 banned the use of thin polythene bags widely used in markets. The law bans both production and use of polythene bag. But polythene bags came back to markets as the country went to political turmoil by the end of 2006, the committee members told the meeting. "Most of the MPs raised the issue of water-logging in the city. The ministry officials including the minister blamed widespread use of polythene as one of the main causes of water stagnation in the city," Abdul Momin Talukder, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "The minister and some members said the interim caretaker government did not implement the law against the use of polythene bags. "And so its use spread," the charman said. Talukder said the if production was stopped, the use would automatically stop. "The minister assured the committee that his ministry will take tough measures against the polyhene producers soon". Talukder said his committee members said the parliamentary team, which visited the site of the Tipaimukh dam, should include members of the Department of Environment and the parliamentary standing committee. "The minister has pledged that such members would be included in the future," the chairman said.
