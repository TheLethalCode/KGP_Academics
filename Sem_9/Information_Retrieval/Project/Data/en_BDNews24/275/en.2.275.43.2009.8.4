 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary delegation from Dhaka, after its visit to India, is convinced that the Tipaimukh dam project will not threaten Bangladesh's interests, said delegation head Abdur Razzak on Tuesday. "We are absolutely convinced with the Indian assurance that they will not implement any project that would harm Bangladesh," Razzak told a press conference at Zia International Airport on the delegation's return from New Delhi. "The Indian government said any environmental impact would be felt by India first, and Bangladesh second." Razzak, who also heads the parliamentary standing committee on the water resources ministry, said the project was still at the initial stages. Jatiya Party's ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader, member of the delegation, said India had not yet started any construction at the Tipaimukh site. "I can say for sure that there is no structure yet on the site there." "The future of the project is not yet certain," he added. Razzak and five other members of the 10-strong delegation stayed back in New Delhi an extra day, after the team failed for a second time last Sunday to land at the proposed Tipaimukh dam site. The delegation left for New Delhi on July 29 to meet Indian ministers and go on to visit the site of the planned dam in the northeast state of Manipur. The team failed to visit the site on two attempts, on July 31 and Aug 2, as their helicopter could not land due to heavy rainfall. But members of the team said they had been able to view the site from the air. The dam would be situated over the cross border Barak river, which enters into Bangladesh as the Surma and Kushiara rivers. The two rivers are lifeline for hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region of Bangladesh. The delegation's aim, Razzak told bdnews24.com before leaving for India, was to obtain India's firm word that the dam would not be used for irrigation purposes that could divert precious water resources from Bangladesh. India has already said the dam would not withhold water as it is part of a power generation project and not intended for irrigation purposes, but the people of Bangladesh, as well as Manipur state, remain concerned over the impact of the contentious project. The members of the parliamentary team include Awami League MPs Abdur Rahman, ABM Anwarul Haq and Jahir Hossain, Jatiya Party's ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader MP and independent Fazlul Azim MP. It also has two experts, BUET professor Monwar Hossain and Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission. The other two members are water resources secretary Waheduzzaman and foreign ministry director general Emran Ahmed. Jamaat-e-Islami MP Hamidur Rahman Azad did not join the delegation at the last moment as he fell ill. Bangladesh's main opposition BNP failed to name two members for the team, even though the party has been among the loudest critics of the Indian dam in recent months.
