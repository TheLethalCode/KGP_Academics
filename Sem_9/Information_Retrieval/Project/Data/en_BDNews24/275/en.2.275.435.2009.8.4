 LONDON, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English Premier League clubs risk financial ruin if they attempt to compete with the spending power of Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, UEFA general secretary David Taylor said on Tuesday.

Liverpool's parent company Kop Holdings, owned by Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett, announced a loss of 42.6 million pounds ($69.75 million) last year mainly due to interest payments to service the debt taken out to buy the club. They recently renegotiated the club's debt with the Royal Bank of Scotland, believed to be around 290 million pounds.
