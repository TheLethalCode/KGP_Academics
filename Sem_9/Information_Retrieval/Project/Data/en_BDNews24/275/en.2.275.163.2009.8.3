<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 03 (bdnews24.com)Two little-known organisations, backed by the main opposition BNP, demonstrated against the visit of former British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury on Monday. The leaders and activists of the Desh Premik Jagroto Janata Kendriyo Committee and Sacheton Nagorik Forum gathered near the circle at the entrance of Zia International Airport at around 10.00am, voicing their objections to media. Choudhury, who landed ZIA around 9.30am on a three-day visit, had already left the scene under law enforcers' surveillance before they gathered there. "We gathered near the airport circle at 10.00am to protest the arrival of Anwar Choudhury who was the mastermind of the 1/11 changeover. "But the police dispersed us by charging with batons," MA Hashem Raju, convenor of the Desh Premik Jagroto Janata Kendriyo Committee and former leader of the BNP's student wing JCD, told bdnews24.com. However, police denied charging with batons. He said about 100 protesters came to the scene around midday, a whole two hours after the former high commissioner left the airport, and were there "at best 10 minutes". "We made them understand that the high commissioner already left. So, there was no point to the protest by that time," Shamsuddin Saleh Ahmed Chowdhury, acting officer-in-charge of airport police, told bdnews24.com. Choudhury, a Bangladeshi-born British diplomat, is alleged by many, across the political divide in the country, to have played a behind-the-scenes role in the declaration of a state of emergency on January 11, 2007. Two days ago, BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury at a press conference urged the government not to give visas to Anwar Choudhury and four other diplomats to visit Bangladesh. bdnews
