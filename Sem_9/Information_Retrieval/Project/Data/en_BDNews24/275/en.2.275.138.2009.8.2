 NEW DELHI, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India gave Pakistan on Saturday a new dossier of evidence to investigate the Mumbai attacks and prosecute Hafiz Saeed, the suspected mastermind of the three-day carnage that killed 166 people. A Foreign Ministry statement said the evidence was handed over after Pakistan gave India an update on its investigation into last November's attacks and sought more information last month. Saeed heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) charity, which the United Nations said in December was a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), an outlawed militant group accused of carrying out the assault on India's financial capital. The dossier is a 7-page document which answers questions raised by Islamabad on the earlier evidence provided by New Delhi, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters. "Pakistan is asking for answers to questions which are already there. Nevertheless, I have taken the trouble of dictating the (new) response," he said. Chidambaram said India had already given enough evidence to Pakistan to arrest and prosecute Saeed, who was put under house arrest in December but was released in June by a Pakistani court that said there was no evidence against him. He is one of 38 people, including Pakistani nationals, accused by India of being key planners of the guns-and-grenades attacks by 10 gunmen India says were Pakistanis. The raid led to renewed tension between the nuclear-armed rivals as India "paused" a sluggish peace process and demanded Islamabad "dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism". "The evidence provided in three (earlier) dossiers to Pakistan in our view is sufficient to investigate the role of Hafiz Saeed," Chidambaram said. Saeed founded the LeT militant group in 1990, and for years it battled Indian forces in the disputed Kashmir region, the flashpoint for more than 60 years of rivalry between India and Pakistan. Both claim it in full but rule in part. India says the assault on Mumbai was carried out by Pakistan-based LeT militants who must have had backing from some official Pakistani agencies. Pakistan denies official involvement but has acknowledged the coordinated attacks on Mumbai were launched and partly planned from Pakistan's soil, and that the sole surviving attacker was Pakistani. Pakistan has lodged police complaints against eight suspects, including Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the only militant caught alive by Indian forces during the attack. Saeed was not among the eight
