<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Sunday a recent decision to send two district judges into retirement was a "procedural mistake" and the government has moved to overturn the decision. Dhaka district sessions judge Mohammad Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression prevention tribunal judge Mohammad Shahjahan were sent into retirement last Thursday for "failing to abide by good conduct and discipline in public administration". Gafur and Shahjahan are also the president and secretary of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association respectively. "The president by his power issued the order to send JSA president Mohammad Abdul Gafur and JSA secretary Mohammad Shahjahan into retirement and now by practicing the same power he may withdraw the order," Shafique told reporters. Their retirement was yet to be finalised. "The president did not sign the paper so far," said the law minister. "The government also has the authority to review any decision. And it has done so on that basis," said Shafique in response to a question from a reporter. Asked whether the government had taken a "wrong decision", he said it was a "procedural mistake". bdnews
