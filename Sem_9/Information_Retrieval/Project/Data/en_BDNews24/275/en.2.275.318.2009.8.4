 Dhaka, August 04 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Tuesday deferred hearing on a petition filed by Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, challenging the legality of a money laundering case against him. A two-judge bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury adjourned the hearing until 2.15pm on Wednesday on a motion by attorney general Mahbubey Alam. Coco's lawyers TH Khan and Barrister Moudud Ahmed opposed the adjournment motion. Coco's petition was filed on the day before seeking to have the case quashed. The case was filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year under the Money Laundering Act 2009, accusing Coco of laundering funds to Singapore worth US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. The ACC further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. An accused in other cases, Coco is currently receiving medical treatment in Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. bdn
