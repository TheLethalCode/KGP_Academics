 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com) The High Court heard a petition on Monday by Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, challenging the legality of a money laundering case against him. The petition was filed on Sunday seeking to have the case quashed. A two-judge bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury adjourned the hearing until Tuesday. The case was filed by the Anticorruption Commission in March this year under the Money Laundering Act 2009. The case accuses Coco of laundering funds to Singapore worth nearly US $932,000 and Singapore $2.8 million. It further accuses him of earning the money illegally from foreign companies in exchange for awarding government contracts between 2004 and 2007, when his mother was prime minister. An accused in other cases, Coco is receiving treatment at Bangkok on parole granted on July 19 last year after he fell sick in jail. bdn
