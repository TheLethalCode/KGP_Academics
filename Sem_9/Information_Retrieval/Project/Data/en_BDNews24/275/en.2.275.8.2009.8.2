 TEHRAN, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran arrested three American tourists after what one Kurdish official said was an unwitting crossing into Iran from Iraq while hiking in mountains and Washington said it was taking the case very seriously. The Americans had been arrested after entering Iran from Iraq, a source told Iran's state-run Al-Alam Arabic language television station on Saturday. A Kurdish official said the group, said to be two men and a woman, crossed into Iranian territory while walking in the picturesque landscape. "They were interested in going up the mountain and after that they walked down the other side, which is the Iranian side," Falah Mustafa, foreign policy chief for the Iraqi Kurdistan government, told Reuters. "Because they don't know the area, they entered Iran's lands." The US State Department said it was investigating reports that Iran had arrested the tourists. Iran broke ties with the United States shortly after its 1979 Islamic revolution and is at odds with Washington over its disputed nuclear program. "We are using all available means to determine the facts in this case," State Department spokeswoman Megan Mattson said. "The safety and security of American citizens remains the US government's top priority. We take all detention cases very seriously." Senior Kurdish security official, Qadr Hamajan, earlier told Reuters that three tourists, believed to be American, who disappeared close to northern Iraq's border with Iran had entered Iranian territory and been arrested. The tourists had arrived in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, 260 km (160 miles) northeast of Baghdad, from Arbil, the capital of Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region, on Wednesday. NO CLEAR BORDER On Thursday, three out of four of the group went on to the Ahmed Awa tourist resort, known for its waterfalls, east of Sulaimaniya. The fourth member of the group was ill and remained behind. Kurdish security officials said the tourist who had remained in Sulaimaniya had returned safely to the US embassy in Baghdad. Embassy officials declined to comment. One of the group at the resort was believed to be an Arabic speaker, and a police colonel said on Friday the group had no bodyguards and no interpreter and were last seen at about 11 p.m. on Thursday at the resort. There is no clear border marker between Iran and Iraq at Ahmed Awa. In March 2007 Iranian forces seized 15 British servicemen -- eight Royal Navy sailors and seven marines -- in the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway that separates Iran and Iraq. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad later said he would free the 15 British sailors as a "gift" but scolded Britain for not being "brave enough" to admit they had strayed into Iranian waters. They were released shortly afterwards
