<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)A transport strike in six southwestern districts continued for the second day on Sunday with private bus operators and their employees demanding stricter enforcement of a ban on informal public transport, including all 'shallow-engine' driven vehicles. Bus owners and workers associations in Kushtia, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Magura, Jhenaidah and Rajbari declared an indefinite strike on Saturday, suspending movement of buses, and forcing all trucks and rented vehicles off the road from 6am on Saturday until further notice. Inter-district vehicle movements were also interrupted. "We held many talks with the police prior to calling the strike in an effort to stop these illegal vehicles moving on the highway," Hasan Abul Fazal, general-secretary of Kushtia Bus-Minibus Owners Association told bdnews24.com on Saturday. People across the districts were stranded without any form of transport as private vehicles were also unable to move in many places due to road blockades by strikers. Thousands of bus passengers wanting to travel south from Dhaka also faced problems reaching Daulatdia ferry terminal in Rajbari due to lack of transport alternatives in the district. Abdul Hanif, president of Meherpur Kitchen Market Association, said over 320 tonnes of vegetables failed to be delivered to the market due to the strike. "Farmers and other businessmen are facing a huge loss due to this strike," said Hanif. Kushtia police superintendent Shahabuddin Khan told bdnews24.com Saturday, "We invited the bus owners to talks and hopefully they will withdraw the strike in view of the peoples' suffering." bdnews2
