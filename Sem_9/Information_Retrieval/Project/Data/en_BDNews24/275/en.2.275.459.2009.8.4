 YANGON,Tue Aug 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The American at the centre of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's trial on security charges was admitted to hospital overnight after collapsing in prison, a US Embassy official said on Tuesday. John Yettaw, a Vietnam War veteran whose swim to Suu Kyi's lakeside home in May breached the terms of her house arrest, was taken to hospital late on Monday and an embassy official had visited him, spokesman Richard Mei said.

The prosecution says that, because of his stay, Suu Kyi violated an internal security law. Yettaw, a Mormon, told the court God had sent him to warn Suu Kyi she would be assassinated by "terrorists". Suu Kyi's lawyer, Nyan Win, said on Friday Yettaw appeared nervous in the courtroom and had told each of the lawyers that he loved them. A verdict in the trial had been expected on Friday but the judge adjourned the case until Aug. 11. A legal source said it could be delayed further if Yettaw did not recover in time. The trial triggered international outrage.
