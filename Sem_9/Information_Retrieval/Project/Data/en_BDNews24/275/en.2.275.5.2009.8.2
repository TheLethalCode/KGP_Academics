 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The recent hike in gas price will hit the industries hard, the knitwear exporters said on Sunday. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturing and Exporters Association in a press release said it did not differ with the government's decision to increase the gas price. "But we believe the fallout will be detrimental (to the industries) in these days of global economic recession." "The prices have been increased when we were asking for various sorts of assistance from the government to tackle the consecutive downturn of export orders. [The hike] would raise production, processing and other relevant costs of the industry owners," the statement said. The BKMEA asked the government to freeze the price hike for industries for now. The price for industries and tea gardens were hiked to Tk 166.91 from Tk 148 and for captives and small power plants Tk 118.36 from Tk 105.59 on Saturday. 'Unwise' The Communist Party of Bangladesh in a statement said the price hike was unwise. The statement signed by CPB president Manjurul Ahsan Khan and general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim said higher prices would make essential goods pricier and spell more sufferings for low-income people. They suggested that the government rather curb corruption and wastage in the energy sector. bd
