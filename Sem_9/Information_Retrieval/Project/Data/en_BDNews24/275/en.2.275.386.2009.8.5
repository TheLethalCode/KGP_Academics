 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)At least three Bangladeshi workers in Saudi Arabia were reported dead on Wednesday following a devastating fire at a residential camp located close to the Khurasaniyah Gas Plant, about 140 km northwest of Dahran. The reports of Bangladeshi deaths came from Saudi media, but Bangladesh authorities have yet to confirm them. Foreign secretary Md Mijarul Quayes told bdnews24.com, "We have come to know about the deaths through reports." "There has been no official report from the Bangladesh mission in Saudi Arabia, so we cannot confirm anything yet." The fire that broke out on Aug 2, last Sunday, was said to be one of the kingdom's worst fires in recent years, but Saudi media said delay in reporting was due to absence of any official statement. English language daily Arab News said six workers were confirmed dead and 40 still missing up to Wednesday. It also reported that the worker's camp, spread over an area of 50 sq km, belongs to the Athens-based Consolidated Contractors International Company (CCC) that has been tasked by Bechtel and Technip to construct the massive gas processing plant for Saudi Aramco. The Khurasaniyah Gas Plant is located nearly 7 km from the residential camp. Top CCC officials in the kingdom refused to answer any media enquiry about last Sunday's accident; there was also no word from the Civil Defense officials, said Arab News on Wednesday. However, it quoted one CCC technical supervisor saying that company records listed six employees as dead. "Of them three are Bangladeshi nationals, two Filipinos and one Indian. Among the 40 missing are Bangladeshis, Nepalese, Indians, Pakistanis and Filipinos," the official was quoted as saying. "Going by what we have seen, we can only assume the worst," he said. Two Saudi newspapers said the fire broke out at around 8.30am Sunday morning in one of the sections of the residential camp, containing nearly 400 workers. The victims were sent to Jubail Central Hospital and Dammam Central Hospital, said Arab News. Some reports said more than 20 bodies arrived at two hospitals. However, this figure has not been corroborated by local authorities. "We don't know their nationalities. They will have to conduct DNA tests," one local newspaper quoted one of the hospital nurses as saying.
