 Rangpur, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has demanded gas supply to Rangpur and the start of the process to declare the northern district a division. "We, the people of Rangpur, don't want relief, we want gas through pipeline," Ershad, chairman of Jatiya Party, the key ally of the Awami League that heads the ruling Grand Alliance government, said at RCCI Public School and College in Rangpur on Thursday. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had assured him of taking steps to supply gas to Rangpur. "I have talked with many entrepreneurs and they are interested to set up industries if gas supply is provided in Rangpur." New industries will generate employment for thousands of people, he observed. Ershad hoped that the government would declare Rangpur a division soon and immediately get down to implement it. bdn
