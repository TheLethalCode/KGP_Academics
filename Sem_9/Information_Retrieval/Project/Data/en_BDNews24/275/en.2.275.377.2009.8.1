<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)Road communications collapsed in six southwestern districts on Saturday as private bus operators and their employees called an indefinite strike, demanding stricter enforcement of a ban on informal public transport, including all 'shallow-engine' driven vehicles. "We held many talks with the police prior to calling the strike in an effort to stop these illegal vehicles moving on the highway," Hasan Abul Fazal, general-secretary of Kushtia Bus-Minibus Owners Association told bdnews24.com. Bus owners and workers associations in Kushtia, Meherpur, Chuadanga, Magura, Jhenaidah and Rajbari suspended movement of buses, and forced trucks and rented vehicles off the road from 6am on Saturday until further notice. Inter-district vehicle movements were also interrupted. Thousands across the districts were stranded without any form of transport as private vehicles were also unable to move in many places due to road blockades by strikers. Thousands of bus passengers wanting to travel south from Dhaka were stuck at Daulatdia ferry crossing in Rajbari from morning due to lack of transportation alternatives in the district. Abdul Hanif, president of Meherpur Kitchen Market Association, said over 320 tonnes of vegetables failed to be delivered to the market due to the strike. "Farmers and other businessmen are facing a huge loss due to this strike," said Hanif. Kushtia police superintendent Shahabuddin Khan said the Kushtia-Jhenaidah highway developed a massive tail-back in the afternoon after several buses, defying the strike, were attacked by the striking transport workers. In Jhenaidah town all vehicle movement was suspended in the morning leading to traffic gridlock throughout the rest of the day. Kushtia police superintendent Shahabuddin Khan told bdnews24.com "We invited the bus owners to talks and hopefully they will withdraw the strike in view of the peoples' suffering." Clashes In Rajbari, employees of private bus operators damaged six shallow-engine driven vehicles known as 'Nasimans'. The incident sparked violence between the owners of the locally made vehicles and the transport workers. Local police said they defused the incident. Acting superintendent of Meherpur police Moniruzzaman said they had deployed additional personnel to sensitive areas to prevent any further disturbances. bdnews2
