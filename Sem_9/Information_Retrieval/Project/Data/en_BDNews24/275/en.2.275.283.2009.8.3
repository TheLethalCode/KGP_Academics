<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)The appeals court on Monday stayed a decision to quash a money laundering case against former BNP housing and public works minister Mirza Abbas. The High Court quashed the money laundering case against Abbas on July 22. Md Mozammel Hossain, chamber justice of the Appellate Division, stayed the High Court order for three weeks and requested the government to file a regular leave to appeal within the time. "The decision from the Appellate Division now leaves no obstacle to proceeding with the case against Mirza Abbas in the lower court," additional attorney-general AKM Zahirul Haque told bdnews24.com following the ruling. Motijheel police filed the case against Abbas, in February 2007, for possessing unendorsed foreign exchange worth $5,300 in different currencies in his house at Shahjahanpur in the capital. In November the same year, a second charge sheet was lodged on the recommendation of the Bangladesh Bank, which contained an amended figure of $9,874. Additional attorney general Haque said Monday specific allegations had been made against Abbas and the evidence would bear them out. Mirza Abbas denies the allegations. His lawyer Ahsanul Karim said, "The case was quashed by the High Court." bdne
