<TITLE> Army still controls CHT, says Santu, wants peace deal roadmap </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council chairman Santu Larma has said that the army still rules supreme in the Chittagong Hill Tracts even after the government recently announced the withdrawal of one brigade. He asked the government to immediately declare a roadmap for the full implementation of the CHT Peace Accord. "The way the withdrawal of army troops from the CHT has been reported is not right at all. Only some makeshift camps have been removed," Santu, former Shantibahini militia chief, said at a press conference ahead of International Indigenous Day on Aug 9. "The report is baffling the people. Army rule is there in the name of Operation Searchlight," he said, reading out a written statement at the National Press Club in the capital. "If makeshift army camps are withdrawn, we (Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council) will have to be informed of it." "Because, the land [that housed army camps] has to be handed over to original land owners. [But] We don't know anything [about this]." Larma dismissed main opposition BNP's allegation that the withdrawal of army camps will give rise to instability in the hills region. "I would say only army control in the name of army operation 'Uttaran' is creating instability in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. So, it may be changed if the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord is [fully] implemented." There are five brigades and five camps in the three CHT districts of Rangamatai, Khagrachharhi and Bandarban. The 1996-2001 Hasina administration signed the accord with Parbatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samiti (PCJSS) in 1997 to end two decades of insurgency and establish permanent peace in the region. As part of the accord, the government pledged to pull out army troops in phases and resolve land disputes in the three hill districts. Since the CHT peace treaty was signed in 1997 to end decades-old bush war, 200 security camps have been phased out, according to a press release of the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate. The withdrawal of the rest of the troops will depend on law and order there, state minister for CHT affairs Dipankar Talukder had said. Parbatya Chattagram (Chittagong Hill Tracts) Regional Council chairman Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, also demanded reserved seats for indigenous people in parliament and at local government councils in areas dominated by indigenous community. Larma presented 13-point charter of demands of the Indigenous Forum including constitutional recognition of 45 indigenous communities, their entity, language and culture, formation of a land commission for indigenous community in the plain land, allowing their right to education in their language and culture and appointment of indigenous teachers in schools. The demands also include observation of International Indigenous Day by the state and constitutional recognition of indigenous people's right to land. Larma announced the four-day programme marking the indigenous day starting from Friday. The programmes include formation of human chain at Shahbagh on Friday, inaugural ceremony at the Central Shaheed Minar on Saturday, discussions at the Institution of Engineers on Sunday and a publication ceremony at Women Voluntary Association auditorium on Monday. b
