 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court will decide on Aug 12 whether to accept the chargesheet against opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia in the Zia Orphanage Trust embezzlement case. Senior metropolitan special judge ANM Bashirullah on Thursday set the hearing date. The court will issue arrest warrant against the fugitives or order the investigation officer to submit the chargesheet again. The Anticorruption Commission on Wednesday pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, her elder son Tarique Rahman and four others in the embezzlement case. Former BNP MP Sharfuddin Ahmed and former principal secretary at the prime minister's office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui were shown fugitives in the chargesheet. But the two were granted bail by the High Court. They submitted their bail papers to the Dhaka CMM's Court on Aug 25 last year. Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. Harun-or-Rashid, the investigating officer, dropped charges against Syed Ahmed and Gias Uddin Ahmed in the case filed against seven people with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. The four other defendants in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and Kamal Uddin Siddiqui. A total of 36 people were made state witness in the case, Harun said. The Supreme Court on Aug 2 this year upheld Khaleda's bail in the case that the High Court granted her on Aug 26, 2008. b
