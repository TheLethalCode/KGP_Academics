<TITLE> Bartoli stuns Venus to win Stanford title </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STANFORD, California, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's Marion Bartoli upset American Venus Williams 6-2 5-7 6-4 to win the Stanford Classic on Sunday. World number 14 Bartoli dominated the back court rallies, served and returned with aggression and shook off a case of nerves that cost her the second set. Eighth seed Bartoli served for the match at 5-4 in the second set, but played passively and was broken by twice Stanford champion Williams who then won the set when Bartoli double faulted. But the Frenchwoman, thrashed by the American in the 2007 Wimbledon final, kept charging and after breaking Williams to 4-3 in the third set, held her nerve. She fell behind 0-30 in the final game, but then nailed four straight winners, including a big serve down the tee to win the contest. The Stanford title was Bartoli's fifth crown overall, but the first time the 24-year-old has won a WTA Premier level event.
