 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)Former adviser Mainul Hosein on Monday fired back at a parliamentary body that accused him of a slew of corruption charges, claiming he had spent Tk 2 lakh every month from his own pocket to run his ministries. "I did not take a salary or any allowances as an adviser, instead I donated them to a trust fund in my father's name," Hosein told bdnews24.com. An all-party parliamentary probe body, formed on June 25 by the parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works, alleged earlier in the day that Hosein misused his authority as adviser to benefit his family. "Let them prove the allegations," said Hosein responding to the charges, announced by head of the probe body Nasrul Hamid Bipu at the parliament building. "Bangladesh is yet to give birth to a person capable of proving corruption charges against me," said Hosein. Hosein, one of the owners of Ittefaq, the country's oldest newspaper, said he had never received illegal money from any quarter. The head of the probe body alleged that Hosein's son, Arshad, had occupied a house in Gulshan and turned it into a restaurant, violating government rules, and the former adviser had directly intervened when city developer RAJUK had tried to take action against his son. Nasrul Hamid Bipu also alleged that the former adviser allocated 158 plots of the Khulna Development Authority and 459 plots in Kushtia Housing Estate "in violation of the government rules". Hosein headed several ministries during the military-backed interim administration, including housing and public works, law, information and religious affairs. "I am not a new person to Bangladesh. I have contributed to this country's democracy and press freedoms," he said. He claimed to have spent Tk 2 lakh a month of his own money to assist in the running of different ministries. The former adviser also claimed he had spent Tk 10,000 every month to entertain staff during his tenure. "You, the journalists, should protest against those who make these allegations," he said.
