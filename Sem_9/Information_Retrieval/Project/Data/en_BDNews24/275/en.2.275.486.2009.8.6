 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Marico Bangladesh Ltd, which markets Parachute coconut oil in the country, has got the regulatory nod to double the size of its initial public offering (IPO) and extend the subscription deadline. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday allowed it to raise the upcoming IPO from 5 percent to 10 percent of its paid-up capital, an official of the market regulator confirmed. "The approval came under the scheme of Green Shoe," SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com on Thursday. The scheme allows a company to float more shares than stated in the prospectus if oversubscribed, added the SEC official. "They sought permission to increase its IPO against the backdrop of the investors' appetite." The company, a subsidiary of the Mumbai-based group, also got an extension of its subscription date, which was supposed to end Thursday, by two days. "The SEC board meeting [on Wednesday] also gave the go-ahead to extend the closing of subscription till Monday [Aug 10]," said Bhuiyan. The company last month was cleared to float 1,492,100 ordinary shares to raise Tk 13.50 crore from the market to pay loans it owed several local commercial banks. The offer price of each share has been fixed at Tk 90 with a face value of Tk 10 and premium of Tk 80. The company's paid-up capital before the IPO is Tk. 28.35 crore. Apart from Parachute coconut oil, MBL has a foothold in the soap market with 'Camelia' and 'Aromatic' brands and trades other hair care products from its parent company, Marico Ltd.
