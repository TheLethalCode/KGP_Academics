 Sylhet, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty said on Monday backed the proposal to declare Sylhet as a 'special economic zone'. "Such an innovative idea would help Bangladesh to tackle the current economic challenge and take opportunity of global economic system," he said at a views-exchange meeting with the leaders of Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industry at a local hotel. Moriarty believed a special economic zone will be able to draw more foreign investment and create sustainable business environment for massive economic development. He said the role of Bangladesh was broadening because of its reputation in international trade. "Bangladesh has emerged to be in a leading position for the less-developed countries. I hope that this country will be able to broaden its leadership." He termed Sylhet as a "fast-growing" area. "Sylhet is becoming known as a driving force for economic growth and investment. It is now considered as one of the faster growing areas because of its international trade and higher foreign earnings." The meeting was presided over by chamber president Junnon Mahmud Khan, where co-speakers were vice-presidents Khandakar Sipar Ahmed and Zubayer Ahmad Chowdhury. bdnews24
