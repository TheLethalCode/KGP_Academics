<TITLE> Japan to scrap plan for North Korea resolution: Kyodo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan is expected to withdraw a proposal for the UN Security Council to adopt a binding resolution on North Korea's rocket launch, Kyodo news reported, a day after Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso appeared to back off from insistence on a resolution. Instead, Tokyo is expected to eventually accept a weaker draft presidential statement the United States has circulated to the permanent council members and Japan to break the stalemate between Tokyo and Beijing, Kyodo said, citing diplomatic sources. Japan will notify the five permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- of the plan when they resume talks on Saturday, the news agency reported. But Japan's Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said on Saturday he had told his Chinese counterpart Japan still favoured passing a resolution. "As far as we are concerned, a resolution is desirable," Nakasone told reporters in Pattaya, Thailand. He said he had conveyed by telephone on Saturday to Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, who is also in Pattaya for an Asian summit. "If we are to have a strong, unified message from the international community, a resolution is desirable," Nakasone said. A trilateral meeting between Nakasone, Yang and South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan on the sidelines of the summit at the Thai beach resort had to be called off on Saturday after demonstrators blocked the entrance to the venue. Japan on Friday extended economic sanctions on North Korea by a year to punish it for what was widely seen as a long-range missile test, and it has called for a legally binding resolution by the U.N. Security Council to declare Pyongyang in violation of a previous resolution banning the firing of ballistic missiles. But Russia and China, permanent veto-wielding council members, have opposed the move, unconvinced the launch was a violation. After days of deadlock, diplomats said Japan's close ally Washington had indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution. Aso said on Friday it was important for the international community to send a strong message, rather than focus on what form that took. But a non-binding statement would likely be seen as a diplomatic blow for Japan, the only country under the flight path of the rocket. That could hurt Aso, who is struggling with low voter support ahead of an election that must be held this year and fan concern among some Japanese that Washington is moving closer to Beijing
