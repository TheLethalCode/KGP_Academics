 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has granted an additional Tk 38 crore to increase the wage of rural women involved in road maintenance work. With the granting of the money, some 23,280 rural women involved in the Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets project will get a daily wage of Tk 100 instead of Tk 70. The project involves the government, European Commission and the UNDP. The EC and UNDP signed an agreement on the additional grant on April 7, a press statement issued by the local UN office said on Thursday. "This is particularly important given the recent rises in global food prices and the effect this is having on those living at or below the poverty line," it said. The new funds bring the EC's contribution to this project to approximately Tk 242 crore, of which Tk 172 crore is for rural women. "We are very grateful for this further contribution from the EC, which strengthens their already considerable commitment to poverty alleviation efforts across the country," the statement quoted UNDP country director Stefan Priesner as saying. "These funds reinforce the long-term food security of the project's primary beneficiaries: destitute women and their dependants," he said.
