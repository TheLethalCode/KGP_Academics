 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has sent letters to MPs Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and ABM Ruhul Amin Howladar asking for education certificates by May 31. "Other candidates in the Dec 29 general election challenged the information the two gave about their educational qualifications in their affidavits when filing nominations," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Monday BNP's Chowdhury is MP for Chittagong-2 and Jatiya Party's Howlader has the Barisal -6 seat. Their closest rivals in the election were Awami League candidates ARM Pearul Islam and Abdul Hafiz Mallick respectively. "After hearing their opponents' appeals, the two were told to submit the requisite documents on their qualifications. But have not done so to date," said the CEC. "They have now been given a deadline of May 31." "Under electoral laws, if anybody gives false information in their affidavit, he will be disqualified from candidacy." Pressed by reporters, Huda said, "If information given in their affidavits is proved false, the commission will write to the Speaker to take action." EC deputy secretary (law) AKM Salimullah said, "Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury originally claimed to have 'no educational qualifications' in his affidavit. But during the hearing of the appeal, he acknowledged that he had and promised to submit the documents to the commission as soon as possible." Ruhul Amin Howlader said he had a BA (Hons) in public administration from Dhaka University, said the EC official. "But he did not submit any certificate at the time. He also told the commission that he would submit it as soon as possible," said Salimullah. "But neither of them did," he said. bd
