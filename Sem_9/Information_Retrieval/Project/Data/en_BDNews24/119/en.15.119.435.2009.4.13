 TBILISI, Mon Apr 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian opposition leaders said on Monday they would move daily street protests to President Mikheil Saakashvili's office as they fought to maintain momentum in a campaign to force his resignation. Some 20,000 people demonstrated on Monday outside parliament in the former Soviet republic, the fifth day of their protest. The opposition leaders said they would keep up continuous protests until Saakashvili quit over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia.

Despite the defection of some senior allies and repeated cabinet reshuffles since the war, Saakashvili's position appears to remain strong. The West, which receives oil via Georgia from the Caspian Sea, is watching the situation closely. In November 2007, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the last peaceful mass demonstrations against Saakashvili. Diplomats say a protracted stand-off risks sparking unrest. The European Union's special envoy for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, has been trying to broker a dialogue but opposition leaders have sent mixed signals about their readiness to talk. "People like Semneby have been talking to them," a senior government source told Reuters. "There are stirrings, but they haven't settled on anything
