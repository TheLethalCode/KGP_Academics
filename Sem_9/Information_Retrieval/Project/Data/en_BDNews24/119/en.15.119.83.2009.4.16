<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government committee on prosecuting 1971 war crimes will appoint up to five investigators by early next week, said home minister Sahara Khatun on Thursday. "The government will form an 'investigation agency' for trial of war criminals by Sunday or Monday," she said at a discussion on terrorism in the city. The investigating body will have "no more than five members", she said when pressed by reporters, but gave no further details. The law minister on Apr 9 had said the government would appoint an investigating agency, prosecutors and form tribunals "within two weeks". "The trial process has started," Shafiq Ahmed had said after the first meeting of the committee for investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. Sahara on Thursday said the government was moving to form a tribunal and appoint prosecutors "as early as possible". Speaking of terrorism, she said national, regional and international efforts were needed for its elimination. She said some quarters were spreading terrorism through misrepresentation of religion to gain political power. "Flawed policies of the past alliance government have turned the country into a grazing field for terrorists," said the minister. Terrorism is changing its strategies very swiftly, she added. "Research is needed to eliminate it. Civil society research organisations work with this aim," she said. "But combined efforts will be more effective than sporadic ones." The day-long discussion on terrorism, attended by representatives of investigative agencies alongside civil society, diplomats and journalists, was organised by the angladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs (Bilia) and Bangladesh Heritage Foundation. bd
