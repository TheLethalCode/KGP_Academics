<TITLE> Economy stable, but still susceptible: WB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)--The Bangladeshi economy is currently stable but is vulnerable as the global economic slowdown threatens exports and remittances, says the World Bank. "The economy is stronger compared to other countries in the region, but this can't be taken for granted," WB senior economist Zahid Hussain told newsmen Monday. He said that the improved foreign exchange reserve and sound exchange rate management shows that the economy is quite strong. "Also export and remittance inflow still continue to be strong." Recession in the developed markets and slowdown in the Middle East has already begun to pose threat to Bangladeshi exports and remittance inflows, he added. Monday's press conference was organised to provide an update on the developments since late-November, according to WB country director Xian Zhu. He said that the government needs to think about measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis, especially on the poor population. "Whatever policy package the government designs, protecting the poor through new job creation and adequate well-targeted safety net programmes should remain the highest priority." Replying to a query, Zhu said that Bangladesh needs to carry out its "largely unfinished reform agenda" to achieve the goal of being a mid-income state. Bangladesh can afford to be more strategic in the wake of affected countries' monetary and fiscal expansion, responding to the crisis, says the multilateral lending agency.
