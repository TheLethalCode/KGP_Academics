<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  A group calling itself the 'Islamic law committee' has demanded the resignation of law minister Shafiq Ahmed and director general of the Islamic Foundation Shamim Mohammad Afzal over a reported comment that Kawmi madrasas "produce militants". The group, headed by Islami Oikya Jote chief Mufti Fazlul Haq Amini, has chalked out a two-day protest programme, that includes a rally in Muktangon on Apr 18 and a meeting in Dhaka on June 21. "We will continue with regular protests until the demands are met," Amini told a press conference in the city on Saturday. Shafiq Ahmed was reported by some newspapers recently as saying Kawmi madrasas are breeding grounds for militants. However, the law minister has since said he was misquoted. Amini, a member of the four-party alliance led by the main opposition BNP, told reporters at the National Press Club Saturday: "We cannot sit idle if someone delivers such a statement against Kawmi madrasas." "Kawmi madrasas do not have any link with militant activities. Blaming them and the Alem community is motivated." "The law minister's comment proves that he is ignorant about madrasa education," said Amini, who was himself educated at a Kawmi madrasa. The IOJ chief also demanded a stop to any intervention in the Kawmi system. The law minister had said earlier this month that Kawmi madrasas might be brought under the education ministry. Shafiq was speaking at an anti-terrorism workshop on Apr 1, held just days after a sensational seizure of arms and bomb-making equipment at a Bhola madrasa. But the minister made no direct reference between madrasas and militants at the time. Meanwhile, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has since stated that madrasa students will receive "modern lessons" along with religious lessons in line with new education guidelines. He made the comment last Wednesday as he named a 16-member committee tasked with formulating a new national education policy. Amini said Saturday the Alem community would not accept any change, "in the name of modern education", to the teachings of the Quran and Hadith by madrasas. If the government forcibly tried to amend the Kawmi syllabus it would be treated as a move to close the madrasas, he said. Amini said false information was being spread to divert attention from the government's failure in handling the Peelkhana incident. Asked to comment on the government's steps to try 1971 war criminals, he said: "We don't have any problem with trial of war criminals. But the real war criminals must be uncovered first." Amini added that there was no war criminal in his party. "If anyone identifies any war criminals in my party it would be part of a conspiracy," he said. b
