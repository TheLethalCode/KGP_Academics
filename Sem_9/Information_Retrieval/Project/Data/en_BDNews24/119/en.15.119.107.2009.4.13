 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)  Midfielders Jahid Hasan and Mamunul Islam sustained injuries to add to national team's injury woes ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers to be held in Bangladesh from April 26. They joined striking pair Jahid Hasan Emily and Mohammad Robin. Speedy winger Jahid suffered injured his right heel while Mamun suffered a knee injury during Wednesday's practice match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Both players were out of action for four days. "Jahid's wound is a friction type of injury as he feels pain in his right heel," physio Dolilur Rahman said. "Mamun has ligament pressure on his left side of the right knee." Mamun is recovering rapidly and is expected to return on Tuesday but there is still uncertainty about Jahid. "I can comment about Jahid only after an X-ray is done on Tuesday as we need to find out whether he has a hairline fracture," said the physio. "I feel pain on the heel whenever I put my foot down," a Jahid told bdnews24.com on Monday. Striker Emily also skipped Monday's training after having a full training session as well as playing a practice game on Sunday following a muscle spasm. "I felt nothing after Sunday's practice match and training but my thigh started to pain in the night," said Emily, who had just recovered from a hamstring injury. However, the physio sees no problem with Emily's new trouble. "It is a muscle spasm and nothing serious and it can happen after recovering from a major injury. I think he trained a little too hard on Sunday and it caused him trouble." Defender Mohammad Sujan also complained that he had cut his heel after using a pair of new boots on Monday. bd
