 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The next three years' import policy will come into effect from July 1, incorporating some 256 recommendations from 196 institutions, the commerce minister said Sunday. Faruq Khan said the new policy set to replace the current one for 2006-2009, would be based on realistic guidelines. "It will be finalised after open discussion with all stakeholders," he said, at a discussion with top business leaders, organised by the committee on import policy, at the Dhaka Sheraton. Faruq invited cooperation from those present with the current "business-friendly government". He also urged businessmen to refrain from "making money at people's expense". "It's normal that businessmen will make profits but they should not profit at a level that make people suffer." Representatives from the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh Computer Council, and government representatives attended the discussion. bdnews24.c
