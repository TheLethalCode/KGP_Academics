 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said Bangladesh needs to connect to the Asian highway and railway network without fail, for the resulting economic gains. "When the world itself is opening up, we cannot keep our doors shut. (If we do so) we will become recluse," she said at a meeting with communications ministry officials at the Secretariat Monday. She said Bangladesh could become a bridge between the West and the East. "We have a lot of resources. If we can use these resources prudently we definitely can be a developed and wealthy nation," said Hasina. She said Chittagong and Mongla seaports were important from national and regional perspectives. "If we can develop and modernise these ports neighbours Nepal, Bhutan, India and even China can also use these ports. Then, the ports can contribute hugely to the economy." Fast communications system was key to development which was why Bangladesh and needed to have a developed communications system. The prime minister also touched on the possibilities of building a deep-seat port. She revealed her government's plans to erect elevated highway from Tongi to Narayanganj, launch commuter train service, build underpasses and ring roads and develop waterways on rivers around Dhaka to resolve traffic jam in the capital. Hasina said her government was firmly committed to build road communications network with the southern regions and build the Padma bridge. She told the meeting about her government's plan to develop rail and waterways already in place and stretch rail link up to Cox's Bazar. She urged public servants to work as a team for the people without fears and said it was not possible to work in despair and threats. "Many are hesitant because of the past events and think they may be asking for trouble if they worked; so it's better not to work." Hasina assured them that the government will take care of any problems they might face. "You please do you job. I tell you on behalf of the government that if anyone has to go to jail, it'll be ministers." The prime minister asked the officials to remember that they were being paid from taxpayers' money. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain briefed her on the communications system across the country. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad briefed reporters after the meeting. bd
