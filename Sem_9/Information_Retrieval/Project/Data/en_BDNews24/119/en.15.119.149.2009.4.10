 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho will not face charges over an alleged assault following a Champions League match in England last month, Manchester police said on Thursday. Police had been investigating allegations that Mourinho had punched a fan in the face outside Old Trafford stadium after his team lost 2-0 to Manchester United and were knocked out of the competition at the last 16 stage. "Greater Manchester Police is aware of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to bring charges after an allegation of assault was made following the Manchester United-Inter game in March," police said in a statement. "A full investigation was carried out after this allegation and the victim has been kept apprised of all developments and is supportive of this decision," it added. Mourinho is on the verge of winning the Italian league title in his first season at Inter. He took over as coach at the club last June having been sacked by Chelsea in September 2007. Mourinho won two Premier League titles with Chelsea in 2005 and 2006
