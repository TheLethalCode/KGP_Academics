 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)- Bangladesh College of Leather Technology was closed sine die Saturday following daylong demonstrations, a road blockade and teachers held hostage by protesting students. The college principal told bdnews24.com that the authority was forced to take the decision to close doors "with the current stalemate". Students were asked to vacate the hostel by 6 pm Saturday, he said. Teachers were seen held captive inside the administrative building with the main gate under lock on Saturday afternoon. Protesting students had earlier blockaded the Zigatola crossing in Dhanmondi to press home demands, which they said had been "repeatedly ignored" by college authorities. Scores of protesting students gathered at the crossing from their Hazaribagh campus, blocking it to traffic, at around 10:45am. Police, charging with batons, managed to clear the road at around midday but the students continued to demonstrate in the area. Chased by the police, students smashed a number of vehicles and a business premise. Some four to ten people, including students and police, were injured before the students eventually returned to the college campus. Police remained deployed outside the campus until late afternoon. College principal Fazlul Karim told bdnews24.com by phone that he was not in a position to attend the college in the current situation, but asserted "full support of any lawful demands of students". He alleged that despite their all-out efforts to address the demands of the students, teachers were being held hostage. Protesting students denied the allegation. "We took to the street as the authorities turned a deaf ear to our long-standing needs," said third year student Assaduzzaman. He told bdnews24.com they had repeatedly notified their demands to the principal. "But he ignored them." They placed their demands to the college authority most recently on April 5, but the authority took no steps, he said. "The situation will return to normalcy once our demands are met." said Marjan Amin, another third year student. They denied holding teachers hostage inside the campus The students' six-point demands include awarding the students engineering degrees under the engineering and technology faculty of Dhaka University, relocation of the exam centre to the college campus, keeping form fees within Tk 5,000 and hold exams on schedule. Principal Fazlul K said that the college had talks with Dhaka University and had also reached a decision to cut form fees. He said they were trying to meet the remaining demands. Assistant commissioner of police Mokhlesur Rahman told reporters that some half a dozen students and police were injured earlier during the agitation at Zigatola crossing. bdne
