<TITLE> Japan PM support reaches 30 percent: NHK </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso rose to 30 percent in an opinion poll released on Monday, a level political analysts have said was the minimum needed for the leader to call a snap election. Some lawmakers in Aso's long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party are urging him to call an election in May or June to take advantage of his improved popularity and a funding scandal plaguing his main opposition rival, but others remain cautious about rushing to call a vote that must be held by October. The poll by NHK public TV, which showed Aso's support rate had risen 12 points from last month, follows North Korea's launch of a rocket over Japan, seen by Tokyo as a thinly disguised missile test, and the government's unveiling of a record 15 trillion yen ($154 billion ) stimulus package for the recession-hit economy. The Democrats had looked poised to win the general election and topple the LDP until party leader Ichiro Ozawa's aide was arrested and charged last month with illegal fundraising. An opposition victory would end over a half-century of nearly unbroken rule by the conservative LDP and bring to power a party vowing to stress worker and consumer rights over corporate interests while reducing bureaucrats' grip on policy decisions. But in the latest worrying sign for Ozawa, an opposition-backed candidate lost a closely watched local election at the weekend, a defeat that could increase pressure on the veteran politician to resign ahead of the nationwide vote. BRIGHTER MOOD FOR LDP His party's loss in the vote for governor of Akita prefecture in northern Japan follows a similar defeat last month near Tokyo, eroding Ozawa's image as a skilled campaign strategist. While some ruling party lawmakers were optimistic about the local election result, others were more cautious. "It does make the mood bright, but this does not clearly show support for the LDP or the cabinet," Makoto Koga, the LDP's de facto campaign manager, told reporters. In the NHK poll, 19 percent said Aso would be more appropriate as prime minister compared to 14 percent who chose Ozawa. But 60 percent found neither an appealing choice. Another public opinion poll by the Mainichi newspaper published on Sunday also showed Aso outranking Ozawa, who has stayed on as party leader despite surveys showing a majority of voters would prefer him to step down. Around three-quarters of voters in the Mainichi survey wanted Ozawa to quit as leader of the Democrats. But the same survey showed 42 percent of respondents wanted the Democrats to win the general election, while 32 percent wanted the LDP to win. "The situation is tough. It might be better if Ozawa quits," said a Democratic Party assemblyman in Tokyo after the results of the Akita election were known. "But it's a tough call." Media quoted LDP Secretary-General Hiroyuki Hosoda as saying the election result was a sign voters supported the party's economic poli
