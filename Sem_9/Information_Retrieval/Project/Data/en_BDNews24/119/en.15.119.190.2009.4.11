<TITLE> India can beat anyone anywhere, says Harbhajan </TITLE>

 CHENNAI, India, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh from a rare test series victory in New Zealand, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes India have what it takes to beat the best in the world on their home soil. India's test series win in New Zealand this week was their first in four decades. It was also their third successive test series victory since beating top-ranked Australia in November. "This team is capable of winning anywhere," Harbhajan told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "If we play to our potential, stick to the basics and focus on the job, we have the team that can beat anyone anywhere." India defeated Australia and England in back-to-back series at home last year and are once again considered a true force in world cricket. India have yet to win a test series in Australia, although they squared a close series 1-1 in 2004 and lost a controversial test series 2-1, before winning a tri-series last year. India won their first test in South Africa in 2006 and emerged surprise winners of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup there two years ago. The 28-year-old bowler said winning matches overseas has made a big difference. "The guys are confident, confident of performing in any conditions," said Harbhajan, the side's main spinner since Anil Kumble retired last year. "I think this team can win anywhere -- South Africa, Australia -- we have got the ability to exploit any conditions." Harbhajan is his country's second most successful spinner and emerged the highest wicket-taker in New Zealand with 16 wickets. BEST YET? Their success streak, including a 1-0 win over England, has triggered debate in the cricket-mad country as to whether the current side are the best yet. India are ranked third behind Australia and South Africa in the test rankings and the batting-heavy team has found a potent new ball pair in the wily Zaheer Khan and quick Ishant Sharma. The pair have played a significant role in the last three series victories and are regarded as the best new ball pair in the business. "Zaheer has bowled beautifully to give India early breakthroughs," Harbhajan said of the left-armer. "Ishant is still raw, and he needs to be focused. He is a talented bowler." Harbhajan, who has taken 330 test wickets and over 200 one-day wickets, did not get drawn into the debate of whether the team is India's best yet. "I won't want to compare between eras," said Harbhajan. "But a batting like up of (Virender) Sehwag, Gautam (Gambhir) ... (Rahul) Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, (Vangipurappu) Laxman, Yuvraj (Singh)... I'd say it is one of the best. It's an exciting team.
