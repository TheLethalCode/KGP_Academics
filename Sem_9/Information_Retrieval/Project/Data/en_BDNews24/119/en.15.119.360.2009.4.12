 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)A BNP MP who sits on the parliamentary standing committee on foreign ministry argued with the foreign minister Sunday over frequent use of the term 'militancy" in her speeches. Foreign minister Dipu Moni in her written speech to the standing committee said militancy and the global economic meltdown were the two main challenges of the government. But Mahbub Uddin Khokon, the lone opposition MP in the 10-member standing committee, said use of the word militancy marred Bangladesh's image abroad. Committee chairman A H Mahmood Ali quoted Dipu Moni as telling him: "We disagree with you. Militants must be termed militants." The minister in her presentation said foreign ministry would launch diplomatic initiatives to mobilise international support in favour of the trial of the war criminals. The BNP MP later told bdnews24.com he told the meeting that the frequent use of the term militancy harmed the country's image. "We have to be very cautious about it If anyone commits any crime, punish them. But we should not frequently use the terms militants and militancy," Khokon, the MP, said. The committee chairman said the first meeting of the watchdog recommended appointing foreign service officials as the labour attachs to foreign missions to help the mission heads maintain chain of command. The labour attachsofficials from the labour and employment ministry do not listen to the ambassadors or high commissioners. "They even hold press conferences without the informing the ambassadors," Mahmood Ali, a retired diplomat, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "As a result, there is no coordination in the works in the missions." He said the labour trouble in Malaysia was a result of holding of a press conference by Bangladesh's labour counsellor in Kuala Lumpur . "This measure, if implemented, would solve such problems," he said. He said if labour attachs were appointed from the labour ministry, they must be deputed to the foreign ministry.
