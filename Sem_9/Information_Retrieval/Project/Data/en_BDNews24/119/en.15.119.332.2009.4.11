<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)  A medic at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Hospital ended up in the ICU after he was physically assaulted by fellow doctors on Saturday, said colleagues. Nazrul Islam, a medical officer of the urology department, was beaten up as he took shelter in a locked room, said Saiful Islam, president of the BSMMU branch of the pro-BNP Doctors Association of Bangladesh. "I locked him up in my room for his own safety, fearing an assault. But the attackers managed to break into the room and beat him up," said Saiful. "Four doctors were arrested following the attack," said Rezaul Karim, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Station. They were named by police as Dr Opu, Dr Suman, Dr Bari and Dr Maruf. All of them are linked to the pro-Awami League doctors group Shadhinata Chikitshak Parishad, alleged Saiful. Another doctor, Dr Rabbi, said Nazrul was placed in intensive care after receiving blows to the head with a chair. Other colleagues of Nazrul's, who did not wish to be named, said the incident was a continuation of past enmity. "Nazrul was general secretary of JCD, the student wing of BNP, when he was at Mymensingh Medical College. Suman and Opu were in BCL, the student wing of Awami League. They were rivals from that time," said one. Ward master Sharifuddin filed a case accusing Dr Opu and others of the assault, said police. bdnews24.
