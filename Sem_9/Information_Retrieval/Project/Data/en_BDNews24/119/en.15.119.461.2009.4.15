<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The court-appointed lawyer for man accused of being the lone surviving gunman of the Mumbai attacks was on Wednesday dismissed due to a conflict of interest, the judge ruled at the start of the trial on Wednesday. Anjali Waghmare, who had been appointed as state legal aid last month, was found unsuitable to represent Mohammed Ajmal Kasab because she had earlier accepted a brief from a witness related to the November attacks, judge M.L. Tahilyani said. "There can't be any other option but to revoke the order of Anjali Waghmare's appointment as an advocate for the accused," he said at a specially built court housed at the city's Arthur Road jail, where Kasab is being held. An associate of Waghmare will handle the case till the court appoints another lawyer, Tahilyani said. Kasab, wearing a grey T-shirt and three-quarter length trousers, head covered by a white towel, was earlier brought to court by armed policemen wearing flak jackets. Kasab, who has said he is from Faridkot in Pakistan, sat barefoot in the dock, stealing glances at the assembled media, smiling and occasionally laughing at the proceedings. Police say Kasab, who now sports a beard, his hair falling in a mop on his forehead, was one of 10 gunmen who landed in Mumbai by boat and rampaged through landmarks including five star hotels, the main train station and a Jewish centre.
