 Madaripur, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)The government will build a new town to resettle people who will lose their homes and lands to construction of the proposed Padma Bridge, set to be the Bangladesh's longest, a top government official said Friday. There will be 4,000 plots under the 46-acre rehabilitation project in Bakharerkandi, Bangladesh Bridge Authority executive director Abdul Karim said. The town will have schools, hospitals, markets and other modern facilities, Karim told reporters while touring the areas of the bridge in Bagerhat district. A number of people will have to be shifted from places of Shibchar and some other areas in Madaripur and Shariatpur districts to make room for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, likely to be constructed from 2011. The total cost of the 5.58-km-long bridge has been estimated at around Tk 10,000 crore. The bridge over the Padma river, which will connect Mawa in Munshiganj with Jazira in the southwestern district of Madaripur and some 20 other districts in the region, is also dubbed to help trade at Mongla port in Bagerhat district. Karim visited Mawa-Kaurakandi, the bridge point, Banglabazar Par, acquisitioned area at Shibchar and the bridge's approach road. bdne
