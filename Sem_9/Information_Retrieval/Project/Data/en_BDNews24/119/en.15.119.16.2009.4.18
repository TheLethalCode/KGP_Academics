 Dhaka Apr 18 (bdnews24.com) - Religious leaders in a meeting with prime minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday offered to help the government in its fight against militant groups. "We will help the government to arrest militants and terrorists by forming committees to help detect suspects," said Habibur Rahman, amir of Khelafat Majlish and vice president of the Kawmi Madrasa Education Board. He was speaking to reporters after a team of 62 leaders of the Alim community, led by Allama Mufti Ahmed Shafi, president of Befakkul Madarisil Arabia Bangladesh, a Kawmi madrasa-based organisation, met with the prime minister at her Hare Road residence. In a one-hour meeting, they also discussed "government recognition" of the Kawmi madrasa system, Rahman said. He added that the prime minister instructed them to hand her a proposed syllabus to be included under a new national education policy being formulated by the government. Hasina assured them of every type of assistance under the new policy. Questioned about a recently disputed comment by law minister Shafiq Ahmed, that Kawmi madrasas had links to militants, Rahman quoted the prime minister as saying the minister had said it "mistakenly". Shafiq Ahmed, meanwhile, had previously and again on Saturday stated that newspapers had "misquoted" him with regard to the reported comment. Rahman also quoted Hasina as saying Kawmi system could not be blamed for incidents such as the arms haul at a Bhola madrasa that was run by UK-based NGO Green Crescent. bd
