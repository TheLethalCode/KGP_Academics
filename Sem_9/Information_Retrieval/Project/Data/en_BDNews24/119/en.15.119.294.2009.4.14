 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has asked the external resources division to procure as much as possible in foreign crisis funds, in the face of global recession, to implement power and infrastructure projects. "We have asked the ERD to secure as much foreign assistance as possible as the internal revenue target of Tk 54,000 crore for the current fiscal might not be achieved," chairman of the standing committee on finance, AHM Mustofa Kamal, told bdnews24.com after a meeting on Monday. "The NBR may not be able to achieve its revenue target due to the global financial crisis." The size of the annual development programme in the next will be bigger, said Kamal. "So, we need more money from external sources, especially to finance development projects for power and infrastructure," he said. Kamal said Bangladesh could go for a share of the IMF's $50 billion fund committed to help developing countries face the global crisis. "In the same way, we can get a share of a similar ($17 billion) fund created by Japan for Asian countries affected by the crisis," he said. Bangladesh received over $1 billion as foreign assistance in the first nine months of the current fiscal against its target of $1.8 billion. Committee members Syed Ali Ashraf, MK Anwar, Mayeedul Islam, Tajul Islam and MA Mannan attended Monday's meeting.
