 MILAN, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter coach Jose Mourinho said he hoped Adriano found happiness away from Inter Milan even if that meant he had to stop playing. The Brazil and Inter Milan striker said on Thursday he was taking a break from football and would rethink his career. "Inter have done everything to help Adriano before I arrived and with me, as a coach and human being, so have the president and his team mates," Mourinho told a news conference on Friday. "We'll see.

Adriano, who has scored 29 goals in 47 appearances for Brazil, was top scorer at the 2004 Copa America and the 2005 Confederations Cup after replacing the unavailable Ronaldo in both tournaments.

He irritated Mourinho with a perceived lack of commitment earlier this season but had crept back into the coach's favour
