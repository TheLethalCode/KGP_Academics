 ISLAMABAD, April 16 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif declined on Thursday an offer for his party to join the cabinet, but said he would support the government in its struggle to fight militancy and revive the economy. Political tension in nuclear-armed Pakistan has eased considerably since last month, when the government, led by the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), gave in to opposition demands to reinstate a controversial Supreme Court chief. Tension was further eased when the Supreme Court cleared the way for Sharif's party, the country's second biggest, to resume as the governing party in Punjab, Pakistan's largest province and politically the most important. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani this week invited Sharif back into the coalition it left last year because of a dispute with the PPP over the judiciary. Sharif told reporters on Thursday his party would support the government, but would not be part of it. "Without being part of the cabinet, in the government, we want to assure the government that we will support it like their own members do," he told reporters after meeting party leaders. GRAPPLING President Asif Ali Zardari and the government are grappling with rising Islamist militant violence and struggling to revive an economy propped up by a $7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan. Analysts say the government wants Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) back in the coalition to share the burden, as well as the blame for any failings. Sharif, a former prime minister, said the country could not afford confrontational politics. Political wrangling also alarms the United States and other Western allies who want the government to focus on its economy and on fighting the militants. Polls show Sharif is Pakistan's most popular politician, partly because of his steadfast opposition to former army chief and president Pervez Musharraf and his support for the judiciary. Zardari, the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, is much less popular and if his PPP is seen as having failed to solve the country's problems, Sharif's party would be set to win the next general election, due by 2013, analysts say. Sharif was dogged by accusations of corruption during his two terms as prime minister in the 1990s when he also clashed with the Supreme Court and sections of the media.
