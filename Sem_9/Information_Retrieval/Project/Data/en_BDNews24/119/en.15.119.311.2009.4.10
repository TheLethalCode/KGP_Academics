<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)The 'deliberately distorted' history lessons in the national curricula will be corrected next academic year, finance minister AMA Muhith announced Friday. "Starting from next year the nation will read our national history correctly. In the past, specific history lessons had been purposively distorted by the interested quarters," Muhith said at a seminar at Jagannath University. "The onus is on us to make the generations aware of the real history of our nation and nascence. The future generations want to know the real history." The university's department of history organised the seminar titled "Our Freedom Fighters" at its central auditorium there. When questioned by a reporter, Muhith said, "The government will soon search out those who have been financing the militants in the country." Dr Mezbahuddin, the vice chancellor, was a special guest at the seminar. Syed Anwar, president of Bangladesh History Society, presided over the event. bdnews24.c
