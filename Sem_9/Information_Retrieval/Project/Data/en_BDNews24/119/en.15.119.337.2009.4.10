 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  The home minister has said the government will quell any move to create unrest over the last week's cabinet decision to cancel lease on BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's house in Dhaka cantonment. "Some people are trying to create disorder over the issue, but [we] won't let it happen," Sahara Khatun said Friday at a programme at the National Press Club in Dhaka. The minister asked how Khaleda being the opposition leader could do politics in the cantonment when Sheikh Hasina, while she was opposition leader, too, was not allowed to enter the restricted area. Addressing Khaleda, the opposition leader, she said, "Please move to your Gulshan house in line with the government's decision. People will appreciate you." "How many houses does a person need?" Khaleda had occupied the house illegally and now the BNP were spreading misleading words, Sahara said. The home minister said Pakistan army collaborators in 1971 war, the Razakar and Al-Badr, would no more be allowed to drive flying national flag while freedom fighters wander about the streets. The government has decided to appoint investigating agency, tribunals and prosecutors, she pointed out. On Peelkhana carnage by border guards, she said the government wanted to punish the perpetrators severely so that no-one dared to kill army officers again. She attended a discussion styled 'Importance of Homeopathic Treatment in Healthcare of Bangladesh' organised by pro-independence Homeopathic Doctors Council. Dilip Kumar Roy, president of the council, presided over the discussion where state minister for law Kamrul Islam also spoke. State minister for law Kamrul Islam said prime minister Sheikh Hasina felt the importance of homeopathic treatment and so, her past government had allotted money to that sector although no other government allocated funds. He announced that the government would appoint a homeopathic doctor in each Upazila. bdnew
