 SUVA, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's president revoked the politically unstable South Pacific nation's constitution on Friday, named himself to temporarily replace a post-coup interim government and called for fresh elections by 2014. President Ratu Josefa Iloilo said he would soon appoint a new interim government but gave no firm time-frame. His actions come after an administration headed by military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama since a bloodless December 2006 coup was declared illegal by Fiji's Court of Appeal on Thursday. Fiji has suffered four coups and a bloody military mutiny since 1987, mainly as a result of tensions between the majority indigenous Fijian population and the economically powerful ethnic Indian minority. Iloilo's plans will likely further harm Fiji's international relations, already strained after Bainimarama went back on a promise to hold elections in the first quarter of 2009. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 mainly former British colonies, after Bainimarama's 2006 coup. The United States and European Union imposed sanctions until the tourism- and sugar-reliant island nation held elections. Bainimarama says Fiji must first change its racially based electoral system, which he blames for past instability. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this week urged Bainimarama to restore democracy, backing a demand by South Pacific leaders for elections this year. Australia and New Zealand, Fiji's main trading partners and biggest aid donors, have refused entry to any member of the Fiji military, government and their families since the 2006 coup. Australia condemned Iloilo's decision to abrogate the constitution and backed the appeal court's ruling, which included a recommendation for prompt elections. "This is the right course for Fiji and the only way forward for the people of Fiji," Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a statement on Friday. ELECTIONS BY 2014 Fiji should hold fresh elections by 2014, Iloilo said in a national broadcast from his presidential residence set in sprawling grounds overlooking the harbor in the capital, Suva. "I am sure you will all work together with me and the soon-to-be appointed interim government to ensure that this transition to a new legal order is not only smooth but will reap many benefits for us and the future generations and resolve many of our long outstanding and systematic problems," the aging and ailing Iloilo said. Iloilo appointed Bainimarama prime minister after the military leader toppled former premier Laisenia Qarase, who he accused of corruption and being soft on the leaders of another coup in 2000. Iloilo's election timetable and call for electoral reforms mirror those of Bainimarama, whom he is known to favor. "It has brought about reforms. It has created opportunities for new ideas. It has adhered to my mandate," Iloilo said of Bainimarama's government. "It has had a positive impact on the lives of our people in particular the ordinary citizens of our country, including those in the rural areas," he said. Qarase had asked the court of appeal to overturn an earlier High Court ruling that Bainimarama's government was legal. Iloilo sacked three judges involved in Thursday's ru
