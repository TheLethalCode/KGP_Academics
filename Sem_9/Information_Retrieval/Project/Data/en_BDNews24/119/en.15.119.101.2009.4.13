<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)Unrest at educational institutions countrywide has been a source of embarrassment to the government in its first 100-day in office, the commerce minister has said Monday. Faruq Khan also spelled law and order, militancy and war crime trial as the tough challenges facing the administration of Sheikh Hasina in her second stint as prime minister. "The home ministry is trying to identify those responsible for anarchy on the campuses," he said, as supporters of the ruling Awami League's student front Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed among themselves and with others over control over the past months, leaving at least two top leaders killed and scores wounded. He, however, added the Awami League-led coalition government's workload in the first 100 days were ten times the previous governments'. Asked what the tough challenges for the government were, the minister said, "I think maintaining law and order, curbing militancy and holding the trial of war criminals are the challenges." He took stock of the Awami League-led coalition government's performance after a meeting with the Chinese ambassador Zhang Xianyi Faruq said the government will distribute fertilisers among the farmers according to national ID cards. The past caretaker government in the last two years harassed politicians and deterred democracy on the pretext of drives against corruption, he maintained. The current government will continue drive against the people who are really corrupt and the people responsible for injustice and corruption during the last two years will stand trial, he said. The parliamentary standing committees will also look after the issue. On the power crisis, he said, "It is impossible to reach an overnight solution to the crisis. However, a positive result will come out by the next one year." bdnews24.
