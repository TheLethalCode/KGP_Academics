 TOKYO Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan on Friday extended economic sanctions on North Korea by a year to punish it for what was widely seen as a long-range missile test, but softened its drive for a United Nations resolution to chastise Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to escape any serious fallout from the Sunday launch, analysts and diplomats have said, while its leader Kim Jong-il has been able to win enormous political gain at home for a defiant act that helped tighten his iron grip on power. Japan has called for a fresh, legally binding resolution by the U.N. Security Council to declare Pyongyang in violation of a previous resolution banning the firing of ballistic missiles. But Russia and China, permanent veto-wielding council members, have opposed the move, unconvinced the launch was a violation. After days of deadlock, diplomats said Japan's close ally Washington had indicated it might be willing to accept a nonbinding statement rather than a resolution. "Frankly speaking, to express the views of the international community, a binding resolution would be desirable for Japan," Aso told a news conference. "But ... there is no point if we are hung up on a resolution and if its content does not make sense," he added. "While there are various forms such as a statement or a resolution, what is essential is for the international community to send a proper message." Japan's Yomiuri newspaper said that China and the United States were now in nearly full accord on a non-binding statement and that Japan was moving toward agreement. A nonbinding statement would likely be seen as a diplomatic blow for Japan at home, where Aso is struggling with low voter support ahead of an election this year. It might also fan concern among some Japanese that Washington is moving closer to Beijing. Aso leaves on Friday for a summit of 16 Asian countries in Thailand, where diplomats say Japan will push for leaders to issue a statement about North Korea's launch. LAVISH PRAISE Japan's extension of its own unilateral sanctions is seen as mostly symbolic because the measures have caused scant harm to the North's already broken-down economy, which has little to export other than arms to what many consider rogue states. Sanctions previously set for six months have been extended four times since they began in 2006, with Japan citing lack of progress in talks to denuclearise the North and to investigate Pyongyang's past abduction of Japanese citizens. New measures announced on Friday tighten the oversight of fund transfers to its secretive neighbour. North Korea in its official media has blasted Japan for creating "a ruckus" over the launch and said any attempts by Tokyo to fish out pieces of the rocket that splashed down off the Japanese coast would be a military provocation. North Korea said it has put a satellite into orbit that is now circling the globe playing revolutionary songs as part of its peaceful space programme. U.S. and South Korean military officials said nothing was placed into orbit and all parts of the missile known as the Taepodong-2 crashed into the sea in a flight of about 3,200 km. The missile is designed to carry a warhead as far as Alaska. The North's propaganda machine has lavished praise on the launch and leader Kim, 67, whose suspected stroke in August raised questions about his control and whether anyone was waiting in the wings to take over Asia's only communist dynasty, analysts said. A gaunt Kim, with thinning hair and a noticeable limp, appeared at his first major state event since the suspected stroke last year when parliament re-elected him as the country's supreme military leader on Thursday. Kim put to rest any doubt about whom he sees as his second in command when the rubber stamp parliament elevated his brother-in-law and close confidant Jang Song-taek to a powerful military post, analysts said on Friday. The energetic and urbane Jang, 63, an economic specialist considered pragmatic and worldly, is seen as the most likely choice to take over should Kim suddenly pass away. He could also mentor one of Kim's three known sons if he decides to groom them for succes
