<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The plaintiff of an extortion case against Awami League MP Sheikh Helaluddin has claimed that joint forces during the last caretaker government had forced him to file the case. "In fact, it was a false case, no such incident had occurred at all. We didn't have any interaction or communication with Sheikh Helal," Md Mamatajuddin, manager of Reza Construction Limited, told a press conference in the capital on Sunday. "Since the change in government, on April 7, I appealed to the home ministry to withdraw the case, explaining the real situation," he said. Sheikh Helal, cousin of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was elected uncontested last month to Bagerhat-1 after Hasina vacated the seat, one of three she won in the Dec 29 parliamentary election. Mamatajuddin filed the case against Helal and a sub-contractor, Munshi Saiduzzaman, with Kafrul police on May 21, 2007. He accused Helal of using Saiduzzaman to extort Tk 1.2 crore from Reza Construction. The first information report of the case said that the firm had paid the money by cheques. Mamatajuddin said Sunday: "The joint forces pushed our company to file a case against Sheikh Helal. They detained me and tortured physically and mentally." "I gave a statement and signed the first information report out of fear." Asked about the delay in withdrawing the case, the construction firm's director SAS Sohel said it was due to legal processes and they "did not face any political pressure to withdraw the case". "Had we been pressured then, we would not have taken four months to withdraw the case," Sohel said. Besides the Sheikh Helal case, the firm also filed three other cases against pro-BNP businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun during the caretaker period. "We filed all the cases under the same circumstances. Measures will be taken about these cases later as well," Sahel said. About the documented cheques presented as evidence in the Sheikh Helal case, Sohel said; "There's no connection between Helal and those cheques." bdne
