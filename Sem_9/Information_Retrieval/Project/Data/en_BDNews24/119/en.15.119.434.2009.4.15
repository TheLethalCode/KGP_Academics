 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission will leave it up to mobile operators to offload shares. BTRC's new boss, retired brigadier general Zia Ahmed, said Wednesday that they "will not intervene in this regard". Under the past caretaker government, BTRC put pressure on mobile operators to offload shares in the stock market. Now the telecoms regulator says it is not their concern. "My duty is to ensure consumers are being served. It is not my duty to oversee who floats shares," Zia Ahmed told a press conference. "There are several government bodies to monitor this, including the commerce ministry." On the much-publicised issue of illegal VoIP operators, he said, "We have to take various steps control illegal VoIP. We could reduce the call termination fee, continue the anti-VoIP drive, and investigate the involvement of ISP and VSAT operators." The regulator will also review international long distance telecommunication services (ILDTS), the BTRC chairman said. "We will review the ILDTS policy because it has some bottlenecks, which act as obstacles, and we want to issue licences to more companies." He said the commission would also reduce the tax and duty of imported ICT equipment and expand optical fibre cable facilities for spread of Internet reach. "3G technology and Wimax are also being introduced. Already Wimax has been demonstrated, a guideline has been finalised on IP telephony. In addition, an initiative has been taken to reduce internet fees," said Ahmed.
