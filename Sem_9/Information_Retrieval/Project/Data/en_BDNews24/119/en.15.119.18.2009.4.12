 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The commerce minister has urged businessmen to not make money at the expense of the people. "It's normal that businessmen will make profits but that they should not profit at a level that make people to suffer," Faruq Khan said Sunday at a discussion on Import Policy Order. Businesses need to cooperate with the business-friendly government, he added. The three-year Import Policy Order will come into effect from July 1, replacing the current one for 2006-2009, Faruq said at the discussion organised by the committee to make recommendations on import policy. The minister said a realistic import policy would be made on some 256 recommendations derived from 196 institutions. The order will be finalised after open discussion with all stakeholders. Representatives from the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh Computer Council, and government representatives attended the discussion at Hotel Sheraton. bdnews
