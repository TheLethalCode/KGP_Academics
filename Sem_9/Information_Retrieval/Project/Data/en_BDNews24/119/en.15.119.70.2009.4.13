<TITLE> Japan kills 680 Antarctic whales, below target </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's whaling catch in its latest Antarctic hunt fell far short of its target after disruptions by anti-whaling activists, the Fisheries Agency said on Monday. Japan, which considers whaling to be a cherished cultural tradition, killed 679 minke whales despite plans to catch around 850. It caught just one fin whale compared with a target of 50 in the hunt that began in November. Some ships in its six-ship fleet have returned home after clashes with the hardline group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, including a collision that crushed a railing on one of the Japanese ships. A Fisheries Agency official said ships could not carry out whaling for a total of 16 days because of bad weather and skirmishes with the activists. Japan officially stopped commercial whaling after agreeing to a global moratorium in 1986, but began what it calls a scientific research whaling program the following year. Whale meat can be found in some supermarkets and restaurants. The agency has declined to comment on a recent report that Japan is considering reducing the number of whales it catches each year. Japan has a moratorium on catching humpback whales, a favorite with whale watchers, after international criticism.
