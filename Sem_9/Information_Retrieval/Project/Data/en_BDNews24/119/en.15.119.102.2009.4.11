 BERLIN, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - VfB Stuttgart coach Markus Babbel will stay in the post next season after sorting out a schedule to get the required Bundesliga coaching licence with the German Football Federation (DFB). "We had good talks and we have decided that it is feasible, which means that I can do it," Babbel told reporters on Friday. "It will be 10 stressful months." Babbel will be officially named head coach on July 1 and his contract will run until the end of the 2009/10 season, Stuttgart said. The former Stuttgart assistant coach, who took over from Armin Veh last November, will undergo a coaching course at the official DFB academy in Cologne. The DFB said Babbel would need to be at the academy between Monday and Wednesday and not Thursday as was initially stipulated. "This is not a special solution for me but for all the colleagues," Babbel said. The 36-year-old former Germany international has steered the team from 11th to fifth place in the Bundesliga and into contention for a European spot. Stuttgart play second-placed Hamburg SV on Sunday
