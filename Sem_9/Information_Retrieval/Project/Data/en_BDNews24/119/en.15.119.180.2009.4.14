 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar appointed staff to the parliament secretariat in breach of the law, a parliamentary probe committee said on Monday. The committee said speaker of the previous parliament did not maintain district quota for the appointments. The probe body, formed by speaker Abdul Hamid on March 19, to investigate Sircar's alleged corruption, after Sunday's meeting said that he had drawn beyond authority more than Tk 27 lakh for his medical treatment. The 11-member committee, headed by Fazle Rabbi Mian, also formed three sub-committee to unearth 'corruption' by the immediate-past speaker, now a BNP MP. "He (Sircar) did not follow the government's policy of maintaining district quota for the appointment of officers and employees," Mian told reporters after Monday's meeting at parliament building. "We have to sift through huge volumes of papers to find out the irregularities and corrupt practices of [Sircar]. "Therefore, we have formed three sub-committee to make the probe fair," he said. The chairman said the sub-committee headed by S K Abu Baker would examine the irregularities in spending of the medical fund. "The sub-committee led by Mujibul Haq will examine papers on appointing employees while the panel headed by Shajahan Khan will look for parliament's spending on beautification," said the committee chairman. He said Sircar during his seven years in office appointed 223 officials and employees including 103 class-three and 153 class-four employees. Hamid in the face of some of ruling coalition MPs' demands formed an 11-strong committee to investigate whether his predecessor appointed employees in violation of the rules, wasted public funds or misused office. The committee was also tasked to investigate corruption of any other persons facing allegations from any quarters. The chairman on March 30 said corruption charges against former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain, now BNP secretary-general, who allegedly extorted money from the parliament's cafeteria, would be looked into, if necessary. The other members of the all-party committee are chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque (BNP), Mujibul Haq Chunnu (Jatiya Party), Mainuddin Khan Badal (Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal), and AL MPs Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, ASM Feroze, Shajahan Khan, Habibur Rahman, SK Baker, Abdul Mannan and ABM Anwarul Haq. The BNP's Farroque attended none of the three meetings.
