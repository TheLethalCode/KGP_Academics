<TEXT>
 Khulna, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com) - The government will handle "lawfully" any politics played by the opposition BNP over the cabinet's decision to cancel the lease on Khaleda Zia's cantonment house, said the commerce minister on Saturday. The minister's comment echoed that of a senior BNP leader on the same issue the same day. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, speaking in Dhaka, said the party would continue its "lawful protest", "despite threats", until the cabinet decision to evict party chief Khaleda Zia from her cantonment residence was withdrawn. Faruq Khan told reporters at Khulna Circuit House: "Former president HM Ershad gave the cantonment house to [Khaleda] illegally as no decision had been taken by the then cabinet." Khan said, "No politician should live in a sensitive zone like the cantonment." State minister for power Shamsul Haque Tuku, in a similar vein to the commerce minister, said, "Former president Ershad violated laws allotting two houses to Khaleda Zia." "The Awami League-led 14-party grand alliance will resist BNP if they try to create any instability in the country over this issue," he added, addressing a meeting at a school in Pabna. Commerce minister Faruq Khan was in Khulna to inaugurate an international trade fair. bdn
