 JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa bowling coach Vincent Barnes is confident off-spinner Johan Botha can get his delivery method right after he was reported for a suspect bowling action in Monday's one-dayer against Australia. Botha, 26, was also reported for 'chucking' after the third test against Australia in Sydney in January 2006 and was subsequently suspended from bowling. He underwent remedial action and resumed his international career in June 2007. "We're confident we can get it (his action) back to where it should be," Barnes told reporters on Wednesday. "We know we can get it right because we've done it before. "There's been a bit of a media frenzy ... but Johan is dealing with it well. He's mentally strong and when it happened before it made him stronger." SURPRISE CALL Barnes said the decision by umpires Asoka de Silva, Brian Jerling and Rudi Koertzen to report Botha had come as a surprise. An International Cricket Council (ICC) statement on Tuesday said the report by the umpires cited concern over the spinner's quicker ball and his 'doosra'. Barnes said Botha did not try to bowl the 'doosra', a delivery that turns away from a right-handed batsman, in Port Elizabeth on Monday when South Africa won by 61 runs to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. "It was disappointing and it came out of the blue," said the bowling coach. "We've heard nothing from the Australians to suggest they had any doubts over his action. "Johan and I have watched a video of the match and I find it strange he was called for bowling the 'doosra' because he did not try to bowl it once in his 10 overs. He hardly uses the 'doosra' because he has to bowl it a lot slower." Barnes said Botha was a key bowler for South Africa. "It's disappointing this happens when he's on top of his game and has become one of the best spin bowlers in limited-overs cricket," he said. "Johan has bowled exceptionally well and we have depended on him to defend totals for us. "What he has achieved in the last two years has been phenomenal, especially against Australia." Botha will undergo an independent analysis of his action by the ICC's panel of human movement specialists. The process should be completed in five weeks. If he is found to have an illegal action he will be suspended from bowling in international cricket. Botha has played 45 one-dayers and two tests
