 RIO DE JANEIRO, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three players and both coaches were sent off on Sunday in a Brazilian derby which had been preceded by a campaign to promote peace between the rivals' sets of supporters. Trouble erupted early in the second half of the Juventude-Caxias game in Caxias do Sul when Gilmar Iser, coach of the home team, ran on to the pitch to protest a decision.
