<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  TThe government has cut the price of rice in open-market sales by Tk 2 to Tk 16 per kilogramme, with demand for OMS rice less than expected. The price will be effective until April 30, food minister Abdur Razzak told reporters Sunday after a meeting of the food planning and monitoring committee. Open market sales of rice at Tk 18 per kilo began on Apr 1. The minister said the government had also launched various vulnerable group programmes under the social safety net. "Because of these programmes food at low cost is reaching more people. As a result, the demand for OMS rice has been less," he said. On whether it was possible to make further price cuts, he said: "Yes. But it would not be right." "Farmers would be discouraged from rice production." On the government's domestic procurement of paddy and rice, Razzak said: "The government will buy paddy and rice to the amount of six to seven lakh tonnes. But the price has not been fixed yet." "The purchase is likely from May 1 and the amount and price will be set by the third week of the current month," he said. The government will set the price considering the interests of both farmers and consumers, the minister said. bdne
