 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  The two top Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders managed "to see" prime minister Sheikh Hasina, claimed BCL's general secretary on Friday. Mahfuzul Haider Choudhury Roton told bdnews24.com: "The BCL president (Mahmud Hasan Ripon) and I saw Sheikh Hasina at 'Jamuna' tonight." The two entered the prime minister's Hare Road residence at around 7pm and came out at around 11pm, he said. BCL central leaders, Ripon and Roton in particular, have made several attempts to meet with Sheikh Hasina at her official residence, at parliament and the prime minister's office since she resigned as organisational head of the pro-Awami League student body on April 3, in the wake of BCL factional clashes and violence on campuses countrywide. Dhaka University BCL activists have observed token hunger strikes, signed mass petitions, held processions and demanded that central leaders, whom they see as responsible for Hasina's withdrawal, "mend relations" with her. bdnew
