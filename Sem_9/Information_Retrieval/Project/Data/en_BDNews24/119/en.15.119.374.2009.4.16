 TIRANA, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutchman Arie Haan is to stand down as Albania coach due to the team's poor results, the national soccer federation announced on Wednesday. "The decision came as a result of the weak games of the Albanian soccer team in the last matches and its failure to reach its objective of a better position in the South Africa 2010 World Cup qualifying Group One," the federation said in a statement.
