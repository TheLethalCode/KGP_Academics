 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary standing committee has declared former Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, former secretary Md Delwar Hossain and two commissioners "in contempt of parliament and the constitution" for refusing to appear before the committee on Sunday. Chairman of the standing committee on public undertakings, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, said: "We have sought clarification from them, under which law they have refused to appear before the committee." The standing committee has given the four until seven days prior to its next meeting on June 2 to clarify their position, said Alamgir. The government sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members last week to attend Sunday's meeting of the parliamentary watchdog. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties. The ACC was asked to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. Former ACC secretary Hossain, now land secretary, refused the summons in writing. "As the Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution, it is not proper to summon me as its secretary," Delwar told reporters last week. Former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud also reportedly refused in writing, but made no public statement. Meanwhile, commissioner and present acting chairman Habibur Rahman told reporters last Thursday: "We have decided not to attend the standing committee meeting. This decision has been intimated to them." "They believe they have the legal authority to summon the commission. We disagree," said the acting ACC chief. "The ACC is accountable only to the president for its activities. Besides, the name of the ACC is not included in the list of government organisations [under the committee's purview]." The government appointed Habibur Rahman acting ACC chief on Apr 7 after former chairman Hasan Mashhud quit his office at the start of the month.
