<TITLE> Thai PM moves to restore order </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva promised on Sunday to restore law and order and said swift action would be taken against anti-government protesters who forced the cancellation of an Asian summit in the country. In a weekly address to the nation, he promised legal action in the next few days against those responsible for the latest unrest in Thailand's long-running political crisis. Red-shirted supporters of ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, said authorities had arrested Arismun Pongreungrong, a popular singer who was prominent in the assault on the summit venue in the resort town of Pattaya. Leaders of the pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) said their supporters would march to a court that might issue further arrest warrants and to demand Arismun's release. Abhisit said in his address that he had spent most of the night in meetings with senior people in the security forces. "In the current situation, what I have to do is to bring peace to the country, bring back governance and have a process of political reform," he said. Abhisit suffered a political humiliation when the summit he had presented as a sign of the country's return to normality had to be cancelled after red-shirted protesters broke into the venue, sending Asian leaders fleeing by helicopter. "Yesterday was a truly shameful day for our country, which had its international image destroyed," the Bangkok Post said in a front-page editorial. The events will pile more pressure on an economy teetering on the brink of recession, especially if foreign tourists are put off by the scenes of chaos. Thaksin's supporters say Abhisit only became premier because of a parliamentary stitch-up engineered by the army. They want new elections, which they would be well placed to win. NEW YEAR HOLIDAY The "red shirts" regrouped around Abhisit's office in Government House on Sunday. They have surrounded it since late March and stepped up the demonstration last week. However, the Thai New Year is celebrated from Monday to Wednesday and many people leave the capital to spend the holiday with their families. Numbers at Government House had dwindled before the weekend and it was unclear how many would stay on. Thai financial markets are closed for the holiday until Thursday. After months of falls, many Asian stock markets have rallied in recent weeks but the Thai market has been held back by the political unrest and is flat on the year. Patareeya Benjapolchai, president of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, told Reuters he was concerned. "It's really up to the government now how it manages the situation within this five-day break. What happened was a loss for the country. The ASEAN summit was supposed to be a step-up for our economy," he said. "The impact on the capital markets will be worrying and we have to see what the authorities will do to rebuild confidence. Newspapers were outraged both by the pro-Thaksin supporters' insult to foreign leaders and by the government's inability to put proper security in place. Police and soldiers put up little resistance as the demonstrators marched towards the summit hotel. "Rumours of a possible coup or House dissolution were spreading last night as it appeared the government had lacked cooperation from police and military in preventing the protesters from entering the summit venue's compound," the Nation reported. Four prime ministers over the past 15 months have failed to resolve a deep rift between the royalist, military and business elite on the one hand, and a rural majority loyal to Thaksin. Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid jail on a corruption conviction and is thought to be bankrolling the protests, phoned in to his "red shirts" at Government House late on Saturday. Less rabble-rousing than on some occasions, he thanked them for their sacrifice at this holiday time and asked them to be patient for a few more days as they were about to get results. "If our people in Bangkok and all the provinces unite... I think this time we can change the country. We will see real democracy with the king as the head of state," he said.
