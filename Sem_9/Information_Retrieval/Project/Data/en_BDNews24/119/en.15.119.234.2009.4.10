 ROME, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all times GMT): Lazio President Claudio Lotito has threatened to make his players sleep at a club training camp away from their families indefinitely if they did not end a poor spell of form in Saturday's derby against AS Roma (1300). "I'm ready to make the training camp permanent if I don't see the reaction I've asked for from the players," Lotito was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. The club president imposed the regime after ninth-placed Lazio's third consecutive defeat last week at Siena. Captain Francesco Totti is expected to play for sixth-placed Roma despite training separately from his team mates on Thursday because of an ongoing problem with his knee. Francesco Toldo is likely to be in goal for leaders Inter Milan against Palermo at the San Siro on Saturday (1300) after Julio Cesar strained a thigh muscle in last weekend's 1-0 win at Udinese. Cesar's Brazilian compatriots Maicon and Mancini are also injured. Out-of-sorts Brazil striker Adriano said on Thursday he was taking a break from soccer after failing to return to the Italian champions from international duty with Brazil last week. Juventus, who trail Inter by nine points, hope Claudio Marchisio will be available for Saturday's visit to fourth-placed Genoa (1830) after tests showed a knock to the midfielder's foot was nothing serious. Genoa will probably be without Argentina forward Diego Milito, whose 16 league goals have been instrumental in propelling the surprise packed to the fourth Champions League qualifying spot with eight games left, because of a leg problem. After sitting out his first league game since joining AC Milan in last week's 2-0 win over Lecce, England midfielder David Beckham is being tipped to be on the bench again at Chievo Verona on Saturday (1300). Italian media said coach Carlo Ancelotti may prefer to use Mathieu Flamini to combat the physical challenge Chievo are likely to pose third-placed Milan
