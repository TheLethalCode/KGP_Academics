 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club will turn into a limited company in three months to develop the club as well as help towards construction of a Mohammedan stadium. Club president Mosaddek Ali Falu made the comments during a grand reception accorded to the Citycell Super Cup winners Mohammedan SC at the club premises on Friday in front of fans, club officials and former footballers. "We will build the stadium in Savar on 25 acres of land allotted by the government," said Falu. The Mohammedan boss said that they would start work as soon as the land was handed over. Mohammedan accorded a reception to all players, coaching staff and team officials to celebrate their triumph in last month's Tk one-crore Super Cup beating arch-rivals Abahani 1-0. Twenty-five players and coaches were presented Tk one lakh cheques each and a crest as veteran footballers of the black and whites looked on. The club also awarded its former captain Jewel Rana, who helped Mohammedan to be champions in the Federation Cup and retired from the game during a B. League clash between Mohammedan and Abahani. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin along with vice-presidents Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir, Mohammedan's national footballers and national coach Edson Silva Dido joined the programme at the last moment following the national team's practice. Praising the BFF president, the Mohammedan president said that the revival of football had started under the new leadership of Salahuddin and now all involved in football needed to unite to take it forward. Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan, general secretary of Mohammedan, was dreaming of elevating Mohammedan to an Asian standard as the country's oldest club since it had started its journey in 1936. Coach Maruful Haq was given the responsibility before the season started and the theoretical-based coach guided Mohammedan to the Federation Cup and Super Cup. "All credit goes to the players, who toiled hard to clinch the Super Cup despite a shaky performance in the beginning," said Haq. "With only 50 percent fitness, the players showed spirited show and clinched the title." The coach said that the players with 70 percent fitness managed to win the season-opener Federation Cup title, but it was disappointing not to be champions in the B. League despite having perfect fitness and preparation. Amirul Islam Babu, manager of the team, urged the officials to take necessary steps to build a strong side for next season in a bid to clinch the professional football league title. Mohammedan had to be satisfied finishing runners-up twice behind Abahani in the B. League. "We must have to win B. League and I request the club president and the general secretary to take necessary measures to build a strong team," said Babu. Mostaqur Rahman, additional general secretary, praised the spectators for inspiring Mohammedan during the Super Cup and hoped they would stand by the club in future to achieve greater success. After receiving his crest and bonus money, Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz thought that the ball was now their court and they had to enthral spectators with improved performances. bd
