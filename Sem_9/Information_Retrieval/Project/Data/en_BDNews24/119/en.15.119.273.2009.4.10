<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona will appeal to UEFA to reverse the punishments incurred by coach Pep Guardiola and forward Lionel Messi in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg, the club said on Thursday. Messi was shown a yellow card for diving in the penalty area by referee Howard Webb in the first half of the 4-0 win over Bayern Munich and Guardiola was ordered to the stands for protesting the decision. European soccer's governing body may not announce its decision on the appeals until after Tuesday's return leg in Munich but it was possible it would do so on Saturday, Barca said on their website (www.fcbarcelona.com)
