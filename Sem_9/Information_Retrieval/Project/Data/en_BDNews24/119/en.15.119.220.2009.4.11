 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com) - The Rapid Action Battalion allegedly assaulted the home minister's nephew on Friday, while raiding a residential hotel in the city. Mohammad Israil, owner of the 'Imperial Guest House' in Tejgaon, told bdnews24.com that a RAB squad entered the hotel in the afternoon, broke open the door of Room 41 and took a boarder named Nasir away. "They then came to the manager's desk where my son Polash was sitting and asked for his name and the keys to the hotel." "My son said he was the nephew of the home minister," said Israil, adding that he himself was Sahara Khatun's elder brother. "When they heard my son's reply, one of the RAB officers mocked him, saying 'If you are her nephew, then so am I'. He assaulted Polash and tried to arrest him," the hotel owner said. Police and more RAB members arrived on the scene. Israil said he got a message by phone to the home minister who called back and spoke with the RAB officers. "They then released my son and left with the accused." Polash was admitted to Al-Razi Hospital near the hotel in Farmgate, the father said. RAB-4 chief Lt Col Shamsuzzaman said, "We neither arrested nor released anyone by the name of Polash." The RAB squad arrested two accused from the hotel, Mohammad Abdur Rab and Nasir Uddin, with counterfeit notes amounting to Tk 30,000 and counterfeiting equipment, said Shamsuzzaman. He said another two men had been arrested earlier in the day on a tip-off about a counterfeiting gang operating in the city. On their information, RAB had raided the Imperial Guest House and arrested Rab and Nasir too, said the RAB officer. bd
