 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet approved Thursday a new ICT law and the new OIC charter, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters. He said the Information and Communications Technology (Amendment) Act 2009 aims to provide legal validity to information and technology, their security, security of computer network, curb tech crime and preserve information. On the charter of the Organisation of Islamic Countries, he said the charter had been changed and refined in the light of the changed global scenario. As many as 28 of the 57 OIC member countries have signed the amended charter so far while six countries ratified it, Azad said. The original charter was adopted in 1972 and Bangladesh became an OIC member in 1974. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who chaired the meeting, thanked the law-enforcers for ensuring peaceful celebrations of the Pahela Baishakh, the first day of the Bengali New Year on April 14, in Dhaka and other parts of the country. She suggested bus services from various points in the capital on the Pahela Baishakh next year to allow people to easily reach the celebration venues, the press secretary said. bdnew
