<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)Over one lakh students who registered for HSC and equivalent exams in Class IX will not be appearing in the tests scheduled to start on Thursday (April 16). "Poverty and lack of opportunities are the root causes of the drop-out problem in our country," education minister Nurul Islam Nahid told a press conference at the education ministry on Monday. "We have taken it as a great challenge to prevent drop-out from primary to higher education," he added. Some 592,186 regular students are registered under the eight general education boards, the madrasa board and the technical board for the 2007-08 session. But some 117,960, or 19.92 percent, will not sit this year. The technical education board tops the list of all ten boards, in terms of dropout rate, with 26.74 percent of registered students failing to apply for the exams. Of the eight general boards, Comilla Board has the highest dropout rate of 23.68 percent. Last year, only 464,357 out of 607,654 registered students sat the exam. The dropout rate shrank from 23.58 percent last year to 19.92 percent this year. Zero tolerance for cheating The education minister said 'zero tolerance' will be shown to students who attempt to cheat. "None will be spared," he said. "Those who are thinking of copying others in the exam halls need not come to the halls," said Nahid. "Those teachers who are thinking of abetting students in copying need not come to the halls." "Authorities have been directed to ensure smooth power supply during exams hours," he added. b
