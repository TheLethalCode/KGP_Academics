 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)Jahangirnagar University vice chancellor Dr Sharif Enamul Kabir has blamed recent campus violence in part on former Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists infiltrating Bangladesh Chhatra League The university has been one of the worst hit by campus violence in recent months, attributed to 'factional clashes' between Chhatra League groups fighting for control of hallsso much so, the BCL central committee dissolved its JU unit on Feb 17. "I know the perpetrators of the recent violence on the campus," Kabir told reporters after a meeting at the home ministry on Wednesday. "Those who were previously associated with Chhatra Dal politics are now creating instability after infiltrating Chhatra League," he said. "Some outsiders too are attempting to destabilise the campus," he added. State minister for home affairs, Tanjim Ahmed, also said, "We have noted with concern that some have changed their hues with the change in the political scenario." "But no one will be spared from punishment," he cautioned. "We want an education-friendly environment but certain vested quarters are trying to create a volatile situation on campus," said Tanjim. The government has taken steps to ensure the atmosphere of education for general students on the campus, he said. "Steps will be taken against those who attempt to create trouble." Asked about the success of the government on law and order in general, he said, "We will see in time whether we have been successful. However, we all live with failure and success. We must continually evaluate every criteria." The vice chancellor said, "We conferred with the state minister about the law and order situation at the university. We have sought the assistance of the government so that those who have been committing terrorist activities on campus can continue no more." "The government has assured us of all assistance on the issue," said Kabir, who was appointed JU vice chancellor on Feb 24. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, among others, has also pointed the finger at "converts" from the pro-BNP Chhatra Dal infiltrating the ranks of the pro-Awami League BCL and instigating violence. Hasina, however, stepped down as organisational head of Chhatra League earlier in the month, and on Tuesday gave the sternest warning yet to the BCL top ranks. She said those who fuelled campus unrest would have to pay dearly and warned them of a possible five years in jail for creating trouble. Jahangirnagar University has witnessed at least 10 major clashes, injuring hundreds, since the Awami League-led government came to power in January. The government ends its first 100 days on Wednesday, with ministers pointing to student violence erupting at educational institutions countrywide as one of the main challenges during the period. b
