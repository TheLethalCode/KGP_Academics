For the courts, two different designs have been proposed for the buildings in 40 small or medium districts and 24 larger districts, officials said. The judicial magistrates are now sharing the premises of the district judges. The government will acquire lands in 37 districts for the project, to be jointly implemented by the law ministry and the public works department. In other districts, government-owned lands will be used. A Tk 981crore railway project will upgrade the Parbatipur-Kanchan-Panchgarh and Kanchan-Biral metre-gauge railway tracks into dual-gauge ones.
