<TITLE> Samajwadi Party says may back Congress-led alliance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LUCKNOW, India, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Samajwadi Party which held the balance of power in the last months of the Congress party-led government could again support a similar coalition, its leader said. Samajwadi Party, which has for years dominated Uttar Pradesh, could have substantial weight in deciding the general election that began on Thursday. The party came to the government's rescue last year after its communist allies quit over a decision to forge ahead with a nuclear energy deal with the United States. Since then the SP has ended its support for Congress over seat-sharing disputes. "It's true they did not pay attention to us. (But) there is no enmity with the Congress," SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday. "Nothing is permanent in politics. We are not enemies," he said when asked if the party could again support Congress. The SP's support could mould future financial reforms in a trillion-dollar economy. Unlike the communists, who blocked many reforms when it shared power with Congress, the SP has said it would follow a pragmatic approach to Congress' economic policies. The party of 69-year-old Yadav, a former wrestler who was once India's defence minister, won 39 seats in the 2004 election. But he now faces a challenge from the Bahujan Samajawadi Party, led by Mayawati, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Her party is projected to win more seats in a state with the most number of seats in the national parliament and Mayawati has been tipped as a possible kingmaker in coalition building after the polls. "If we win enough seats and our support matters, then we will do everything to ensure a stable coalition," Yadav, who faces corruption charges, said. Opinion polls suggest the Congress-led alliance appears to lead the election race. But polls have proved wrong in the past. The SP attracted criticism after its manifesto said it would curb the use of the English language and computers. The Congress party said it would take India back to the stone-age. "Our stand is whatever work can be done by hand should not be done by computers. This leads to loss of jobs," said Yadav.
