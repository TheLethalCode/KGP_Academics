 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government will execute at all costs the cabinet decision to cancel the lease on opposition leader Khaleda Zia's house in Dhaka cantonment, the state minister for housing has said. "We prefer she leaves the house on her own. If she does not, we will take the same steps as we would for any person. All measures will be taken according to law," Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters Sunday. "The government will implement the cabinet decision at any cost," he said. The state minister added the former prime minister had repeatedly breached the conditions of the lease. According to the conditions of the lease,, he said, Khaleda was supposed to submit a fixed amount of tax to the state coffers in July every year. But she did not do this after the first two years. "Apart from that, she pursued political activities in that house and her two sons did business there." The cabinet decided to cancel the lease for breaching those conditions, said Mannan. On whether Khaleda would be "evicted", the state minister said: "The Cantonment Board has already been given a directive to implement the cabinet decision. The board will do what is required." "You will come to know everything in course of time," he said. Mannan said Khaleda's family enjoyed the highest government facilities. "The family got the highest facilities after the death of (her husband president) Ziaur Rahman including house, vehicles, monthly allowances." After all these facilities, they were allotted the 99-year lease on the cantonment residence, he said. "In line with the existing law, if one breaches lease conditions one's lease will be cancelled. The same measure is being taken here," said Mannan. "She has been allotted the 29 Minto Road house as the opposition leader. She can stay there too," the minister added. bdne
