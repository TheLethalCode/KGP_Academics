<TITLE> Study sees Sonadia as best deep-sea port site </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The consultant for the proposed deep-sea port project has suggested the Sonadia-Moheshkhali point as the best location. The deep-sea port can be set up at Sonadia channel in three phases until 2055 at a cost of $ 1.2 billion with the first phase completed by 2016, Japan's Pacific Consultant International (PCI) added. In a feasibility study, it also said the impact of regional transit cargos for the proposed deep-sea port would be marginal, accounting for about 10 percent of the expected cargo-handling volume. The geographic location of Bangladesh enables the proposed port to have opportunities to be a major player in the regional trade and act as a gateway to the region, according to the study presented at a workshop Sunday. "Sonadia Island succeeded so far as the best optimal location for a deep sea port out of the possible nine locations," Eddy Declercq, private sector expert of PCI told the workshop on 'Techno-Economic Feasibility Study of a Deep Sea Port in Bangladesh'. He also said transit cargo handling, predominantly from China, would be around 10 percent of the total volume. Good governance would be a key component for the project to be a success, said the PCI official. Touching on details, Declercq said a harbour of nine 300-metre jetties would be constructed along with required infrastructure and back-up facilities in the first phase. " [The harbour] would allow berthing of 9 mother vessels, 4 containers and 5 general cargo vessels." The second phase, expected to be completed by 2035, would see two more harbours with the same specifications. The deep-sea port would have six harbours when the third phase would be completed by 2055, the PCI expert said. The 31-month study since June 2006 proposed a 40-km railway track from Chittagong to Cox's Bazar, roads of the same length, development of inland waterways for transportation of goods with facilities of water treatment plant and thermal power plant. The study recommends forming an interim port authority before setting up a deep-sea port authority. The IPA would also be responsible for choosing investors from private sector to provide 70 percent of the fund for the project while the remainder would come from the government. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin urged donors to consider the possibilities for funding the project and said the government would do everything to secure funding for the project. "The government will patronage public-private partnership for the project." The study would be reviewed in light of suggestions from Sunday's workshop and then finalised, the minister told reporters afterwards. Prime minister's economic affairs adviser Mashiur Rahman stressed on attracting foreign and private investments for the project. "The government would also need to look on issues like regulatory arrangements for the port for efficient management, "he added. A need for review of tax laws and tax-harmonising would be required for handling transit cargos, said the prime minister's adviser. The workshop, organised by the shipping ministry, was participated by representatives from different government organisations, members of the technical committee and the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry.
