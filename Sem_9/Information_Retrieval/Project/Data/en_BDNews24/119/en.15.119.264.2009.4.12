<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Olympic Association has asked different federations to hold its national meet immediately to evaluate the performance of those athletes staying at the South Asian Games camp. "Holding the national meet is not only to evaluate athletes' performance of the ongoing camp, but also search for new talent to include in the second-phase training camp," BOA vice-president and training committee chief Mizanur Rahman Manu told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Manu sees no problem to include new athletes as the SA Games is still nine months away from its scheduled time of 2010 January. The first-phase training got underway from January last with 17 disciplines and later six more disciplines were included raising the number to 23, the highest in the SA Games history since the inaugural Games in 1984 in Kathmandu. The national championship of most of the disciplines has already been completed and they were asked to submit the performance sheets to the training committee, which would assess the performance. So far seven federations -- weightlifting, swimming, karate, basketball, judo, squash and taekwondo -- have not completed their national meets that gave the BOA a headache as the training committee intends to cut the number of athletes. Some 744 athletes, including 186 women, from 23 disciplines have been taking part in the first-phase training and the BOA wants to cut the number of athletes to 600-625 before the start of the second phase in the middle of April. "We will drop the athletes after evaluating their performance in the concluded national meets, but keep the squad in a sensible size so that they don't face players' shortage during practice," said the training committee head. Manu also added that they were also considering things such as injury, especially in the team events of football, cricket, hockey, kabaddi, volleyball, basketball and handball, before reducing the squad. Athletes of individual games like athletics, swimming, shooting, archery, karate, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting and taekwondo were having biomechanical tests for the first time to assess their mental and physical ability. Athletes from two more events wushu and golf also underwent biomechanical tests and the results are yet to be published. Manu hinted that the athletes would once again have such tests before the final phase training starts in August or September. BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed had earlier said that they were targeting 13 golds, two more than what Bangladesh bagged in the 1993 SA Games in Dhaka. bd
