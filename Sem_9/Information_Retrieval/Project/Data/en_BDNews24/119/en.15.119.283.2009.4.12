 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com) - Bashundhara Group has become a development partner of the Bangladesh Football Federation after signing a three-year deal on Sunday. Under the agreement, Bashundhara Group will provide Tk 4.5 crore in three years to run all district football leagues to revive football from the grassroots level. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin and Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan signed the deal on behind of respective sides at the Kurmitola Golf Club. The district football league will be named after Bashundhara as the BFF intends to help Football Associations to run the league smoothly every year. In addition, Bashundhara will also provide two pieces of land for playgrounds -- one in Bashundhara residential area and the other at River View adjacent to the River Buriganga. "I first want to thank Bashundhara Group, a local commercial company, for coming forward to sponsor football at district level where there was virtually no football due to lack of sponsorship and I hope district football will again get its life back through this sponsorship," said Salahuddin, who has been working tirelessly since his election last April. BFF had earlier made mobile operator Citycell its official partner for three years signing a Tk 16.5 crore deal and is near to sealing another deal with Nokia for youth development. Praising the BFF boss, Sobhan said that the country's football future was in capable hands. Sobhan also declared that Bashundhara would also prove two pieces of land in Bashundhara Residential Area which will cost Tk 150 crore and the rest in River View at a cost of Tk 50 crore. Salahuddin said that they were considering building a 15,000-capacity stadium in River View and the other in Bashudhara to be used as a practice venue and it would have accommodation facilities. The BFF boss also said that they would be able to hold district football leagues in a month as District Football Associations had been suffering from lack of sponsorship for a long time. National Sports Council chairman and Army Chief Moeen U Ahmed also spoke on the occasion. Moeen said that football got back its life through Super Cup and the players were finally enjoying the game. The NSC chairman said that more playgrounds at district levels would be made in the coming fiscal year. Referring to the opening ceremony of the 2011 Cricket World Cup to be held at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Moeen said that the BNS was allotted for football and it still belonged to football, but the venue could be used in any big programme to uphold the country's image. bd
