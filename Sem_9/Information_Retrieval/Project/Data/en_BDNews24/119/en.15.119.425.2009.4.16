 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)The ECNEC on Wednesday gave green light to four roads and railway projects worth over Tk 2000 crore to upgrade and build tracks and roads. An ECNEC meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Wednesday gave the go ahead to the plan, planning minister A K Khandaker said. A Tk 981crore railway project will upgrade the Parbatipur-Kanchan-Panchgarh and Kanchan-Biral metre-gauge railway tracks into dual-gauge ones. The Biral- Biral border section will also be converted to broad-gauge. The roads projects are: the Tk 706 crore 'roads network development and maintenance project-1 (first amended), Tk 120 crore 'Sarail-Nasirnagar-Lakhai road construction (amended) project', and Tk 213 crore 'Mymensingh-Jamalpur-Dewanganj section rehabilitation project'. Two local government projects were also approvedTk 510 crore for local roads and small bridges and Tk 52 crore for Rajshahi city drainage and water supply. In all, the ECNEC approved seven projects worth Tk 3,314 crore. In another major ECNEC decision, the government will spend billions of takas to construct brand-new buildings for judicial magistrates in each district headquarters. "After the separation of judiciary, (separate premises for) the courts and offices of chief judicial magistrates became very critical," planning minister A K Khandaker said of the Tk 731.69 crore plan for all 64 districts. The construction work is expected to end by June 2014. Two different designs have been proposed for the court buildingsone for 40 small or medium districts and the other for 24 larger districts, officials said. The judicial magistrates are now sharing the premises of the district judges. The government will acquire lands in 37 districts for the project, to be jointly implemented by the law ministry and the public works department. In other districts, government-owned lands will be used.
