 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Thursday asked the local government ministry to probe the alleged misappropriation of Tk 135 crore allocated for Gram Sarker during BNP's past tenure. "All members of the committee agreed that out of the total allocated Tk 181 crore for Gram Sarker, Tk 135 crore was wasted," chairman Rahmat Ali told bdnews24.com after a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on local government. "I have talked to the minister who assured me that his ministry will carry out investigation in line with the standing committee's recommendations," he said. "We have asked the ministry to collect information on sector-wise spending of the Gram Sarker funds over the last four fiscal years". The Awami League, the then main opposition party in parliament, opposed the passage of the controversial Gram Sarker (Village Government) bill in 2003, which created another local government body comprising of mainly selected members below the Union Parishad, the then lowest tier of local government. Awami League alleged Gram Sarker was created to give facilities to grassroots BNP leaders and activists, an allegation vehemently denied by the then ruling party. BNP said the Gram Sarker was created to supplement the development initiatives of the Union Parishad. The then government allocated Tk 20 crore, Tk 40 crore, Tk 60 crore and Tk 61 crore in the 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 1006-07 fiscal years. The Gram Sarker was also vested with the authority to settle villages disputes. The immediate past caretaker government, through an ordinance in 2007, annulled the controversial Gram Sarker, which at one point was also declared illegal by the High Court. The Awami League government upheld the decision of the caretaker government and repealed the Gram Sarker Act through a bill on March 15 this year. Standing committee members Noor-e-Lam Chowdhury, AKM Mostafizur Rahman, Md Ali Ashraf Khan Khasru and Md Abul Khayer Bhuiyan also attended Thursday's meeting.
