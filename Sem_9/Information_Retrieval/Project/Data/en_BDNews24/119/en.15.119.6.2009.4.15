 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League, which had intensely opposed a law to fast-track trial of crimes while in the opposition, is going to pass the same in parliament "as per suggestion of the law enforcers". The party had said in and outside parliament for years that the law infringed people's rights when the BNP-led government passed it first in 2002. "We have recommended to pass the law as it is prepared by the ministry," Abdus Salam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry, told bdnews24.com Wednesday evening at parliament building. The government tabled the law in parliament on Mar 29 and the House sent it to the parliamentary watchdog for scrutiny. "You know that there was no law during the tenure of (BNP-led coalition government). They abused the law. "But we are a people's government. We will not misuse the law," Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, state minister for home affairs, told bdnews24.com after the meeting of the panel. "We will pass the bill as per the recommendations of the law enforcing agencies." If passed, the speedy trial act will be enforced until 10 April 2010 to try offenders for crimes such as mugging, extortion, terrorism and vandalism. The past BNP-led coalition government enacted the law in 2002 for two years and extended its validity twicein 2004 and 2006. The military-installed caretaker government in 2008 further stretched its tenure by another two years through an ordinance. The Awami League-led government placed the law before parliament but did not pass it in the first session, ceasing its effect from Jan 25, 2009. According to the preamble of the bill, 159 cases are under investigation under the law. In addition, 1246 cases are on trial. The law stipulates the law enforcers submit investigation reports in seven days since occurrence of a crime. The BNP government first passed the law in April 2002 when the then opposition Awami League was calling general strikes claiming that the parliamentary polls of Oct 1, 2001 were rigged. Awami League in 2002 and 2004 said the bill was aimed at punishing BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami's political opponents, not to curb crimes such as extortion, ransacking of vehicles and terrorism.
