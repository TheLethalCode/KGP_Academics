 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  The first storm of the cyclone season that begins in April is on the horizon. The deep depression over the southeast and central Bay of Bengal has turned into cyclonic storm 'Bijli', a weather bulletin said Thursday. Brewed in the west central and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal at around 3am, the cyclonic storm moved slightly northward and hovered over the same area. The storm was centred at around 9am about 875 km southwest of Chittagong port, 815 km southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 760 km south or southwest of Mongla port, the bulletin by Meteorological Department said. It was likely to intensify further and move in a north and northeasterly direction. Maximum sustained wind speed within 64 km of the cyclone centre is about 60 km per hour in gusts or squalls. The sea would remain very rough around the storm centre, the bulletin said. Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla ports have been asked to keep hoisted distant warning signal number 3. All fishing boats and trawlers over north Bay and deep sea have been asked to remain close to the coast and proceed with caution, the bulletin added
