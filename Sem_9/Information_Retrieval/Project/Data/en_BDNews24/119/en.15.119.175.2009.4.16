 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has moved to take legal steps against candidates of the general elections who did not submit their election expenses, a commissioner said Thursday. There was no elected MP on the list, though, M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters at the EC Secretariat. "Directives have been given to take legal steps against them." Sakhawat said some 52 out of 1,538 candidates were yet to submit the statement of their election expenses. On whether the statements filed were right, the commissioner said they would have the statements examined by accountants. "If necessary we will run an audit," he said. The commissioner said Awami League and Jamaat-e-Islami had submitted their detailed election expenses. But BNP and Bangladesh Workers Party, Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP), Muslim League and National People's Party did not. Of the 38 parties that ran the elections, six parties did not submit their election expenses. They were Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal, HM Ershad-led Jatiya Party, Bangladesh Torikat Federation, Gono Front, Bangladesh Islami Front and Freedom Party. Sakhawat said the commission was ready for elections to the Dhaka City Corporation. The elections were likely by the end of the year if the proposed law was passed in the second session of parliament, he said. The commission would sit with the registered political parties soon on the parliamentary elections, Upazila polls and the amended Representation of People Order passed in parliament, Sakhawat said. The discussions might take place prior to the budget session, he said. "We are organising the discussions to bridge communication with the parties." The commission had earlier held three rounds of discussions with the parties ahead of the general elections. bdnew
