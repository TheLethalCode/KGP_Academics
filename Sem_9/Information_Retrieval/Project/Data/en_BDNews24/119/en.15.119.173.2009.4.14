 GENEVA, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, will attend next week's United Nations conference on racism in Geneva, a UN spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Marie Heuze told a news briefing that Ahmadinejad, who has in the past questioned whether the Holocaust took place, was one of four heads of state who had confirmed they would attend.

But they say the OIC and its allies could try during the meeting to have them restored. Apart from Iran, the other three countries sending their heads of state to Durban II are East Timor, Togo and Montenegro. Among countries which have said they will be sending their foreign ministers are Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Norway. The 27-nation European Union has yet to decide on a common position on whether to at
