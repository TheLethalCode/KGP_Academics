 CAIRO, Sun Apr 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian state-controlled newspaper escalated a row with Lebanon's Hezbollah Sunday by calling its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, a "monkey sheikh." Tensions between Egypt, a predominantly Sunni country, and Hezbollah, a Shi'ite group backed by Iran, have been running high since Nasrallah in December accused Cairo of complicity with Israel in its siege of the Gaza Strip. Cairo said Wednesday it had detained 49 men linked to Hezbollah, accusing them of planning attacks in Egypt. Nasrallah responded saying one of those held was a member but he and up to 10 others were trying to supply military equipment to Hamas-run Gaza. "We do not allow you, Oh Monkey Sheikh, to mock our judiciary, for you are a bandit and veteran criminal who killed your countrymen, but we will not allow you to threaten the security and safety of Egypt...and if you threaten its sovereignty, you will burn!" al-Gomhouria newspaper wrote. The editorial, by editor Mohamed Ali Ibrahim, covered the front page and carried the headline "A criminal who knows no repentance" over a picture of Nasrallah. "I say to you what every Egyptian knows, that you are an Iranian party," Ibrahim wrote. "Are there instructions from Iran to drag Egypt into a conflict?" Egypt and Iran have not had full diplomatic relations since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, when Iran cut ties after former President Anwar Sadat hosted the deposed Iranian shah in Cairo. Ties were further strained during the conflict in Gaza in January, when Tehran criticized Egypt for not doing enough to help Palestinians and for closing its border with the strip, which Egypt shut to most traffic after the Islamist group Hamas took control of the area. Egypt and other Sunni states, like Saudi Arabia, are worried by what they see as the rising influence of Iran in the region. Both Cairo and Riyadh have said Iran's power in the region is growing. Egyptian state daily, al-Ahram, citing an unnamed official, described the detained men as part of a "terrorist cell" and called Nasrallah an accomplice to a crime. Mustapha al-Sayyid, political science professor at Cairo University, said Cairo wanted to use the detentions to undermine anyone sympathizing with Hezbollah or Iran's position. Some ordinary Egyptians and opposition groups, have echoed Tehran and Hezbollah's call for Cairo to help Palestinians more. "The Egyptian government wants to denounce Hezbollah and embarrass Arab governments who have close relations with Iran," Sayyid said, adding that the al-Gomhouria article reflected official thinking. "The Egyptian government is worried that there is a competition with Iran and that Iran is using its allies in the region like Hezbollah and Hamas in order to cause problems and difficulties for the Egyptian government," he
