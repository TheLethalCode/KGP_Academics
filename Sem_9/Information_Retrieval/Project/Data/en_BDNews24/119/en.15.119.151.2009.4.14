 Arshad Mahmud writes from Washington Washington, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com)  In a landmark decision President Obama on Monday lifted a longstanding ban on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit and send money to family members on the island, indicating his willingness to open the door toward greater engagement with Cuba. The announcement represents the most significant shift in United States policy toward Cuba in decades, and it is a reversal of the hard line taken by his predecessor, George Bush. The move comes as Obama is preparing to meet later this week in Trinidad and Tobago with Latin American leaders, who want him to normalise relations with Cuba and its leader, Raul Castro. The announcement preceded another significant development two weeks ago when members of the Congressional Black Caucus group made a very successful and well-publicized visit to Cuba and met its leaders including Fidel Castro, the ailing leader. The White House, however, made clear that further openings with Cuba would depend on reactions from the leaders of that country. For the moment, Obama, who campaigned on improving relations with Cuba, has perhaps decided to "wait and see" before taking further steps to normalization, reflecting the complicated domestic politics around Cuba and the unpredictability of the Cuban response. This volatility on both sides of the Florida Straits has bedeviled every president since Kennedy, and even Obama, who has vowed to make greater use of diplomacy with enemies as well as allies, seems to have recognized the threat. As such, he did not lift the decades-old trade embargo with Cuba, enacted in the 1960s in an unsuccessful attempt to force a regime change after Fidel came to power. Instead, Obama is using his executive power to repeal Bush's tight restrictions and the looser restrictions under President Clinton so that Cuban-Americans can now visit Cuba as frequently as they like and send gifts and as much money as they want, as long as the recipients are not senior government or Communist Party officials. Obama is also allowing telecommunications companies to pursue licensing agreements in Cuba, in an attempt to open up communications there by increasing access to cellphones and satellite television. Commentators say the policy shift is an admission that a half-century of American policy aimed at trying to push the Castros out of power has not worked. Cuba policy experts characterized Obama's moves as important humanitarian steps, but they said they still left open the broader question of how the United States and Cuba plan to engage in the future. "We really don't know yet what he's got in mind for the long term," Sarah Stephens of the Center for Democracy in the Americas told the New York Times. She said the administration may be trying to take "baby steps toward building confidence" by letting the Cuban exile community in Miami, which has traditionally opposed any softening of American policy, get used to the idea. Obama is also facing pressure from the Congress, which is considering legislation that would lift travel restrictions to Cuba for all Americans, not just those with family in Cuba. But Obama is also facing stiff opposition to his new policy from those who still support the Bush hard line. The Cuban government charges hefty fees on remittances, and critics like Representatives Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Florida Republicans who are Cuban-Americans, said Obama was making a "serious mistake" that would effectively put millions of dollars into the hands of the Castro regime
