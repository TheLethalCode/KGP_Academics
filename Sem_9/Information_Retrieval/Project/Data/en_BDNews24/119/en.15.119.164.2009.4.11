 TBILISI, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 5,000 Georgians rallied Saturday against President Mikheil Saakashvili, a sharp drop in numbers for the third day of an opposition street campaign to demand his resignation. They turned out in the capital Tbilisi under cold grey skies, blocking traffic in front of the parliament, the office of the president and public broadcaster. Opposition leaders gathered 60,000 Thursday and 20,000 on Friday, and promised a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience until Saakashvili quits over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia. The 41-year-old president has polarized opinion in the former Soviet republic since coming to power on the back of the 2003 Rose Revolution. He ruled out resigning Friday. Opposition leaders said protests would resume Monday to allow supporters to mark Palm Sunday, which Orthodox Christians celebrate on April 12. Nino Burjanadze, a co-author of the 2003 revolution who in early 2008 defected from Saakashvili, said the turnout was no cause for concern. "It's very natural for the third day of the campaign," Burjanadze told Reuters. "Believe me, if anyone is concerned today, it's Mikheil Saakashvili." Diplomats question whether the alliance of more than a dozen opposition parties can maintain unity or muster enough people to force Saakashvili out. Analysts say the president's ruling United National Movement retains wide support and his position appears strong, despite the defection of some top allies and several cabinet reshuffles. Critics accuse him of monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and media. A police crackdown in November 2007 against the last peaceful mass demonstrations against Saakashvili shocked his Western backers. Opposition has grown since Georgia's disastrous five-day war with Russia last year, when Moscow crushed a Georgian assault on breakaway South Ossetia. But many Georgians appear frustrated with political bickering and are sympathetic to government calls for stability as the global economic crisis takes hold. "In these days of economic crisis people have real issues and problems to worry about," said Eka Sharashidze, head of Georgia's presidential administration. Opposition leaders said Friday they had agreed to sit down with Saakashvili after he called for dialogue, but the details of a possible meeting have yet to be set.
