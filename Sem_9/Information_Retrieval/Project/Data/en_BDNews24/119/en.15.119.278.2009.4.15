 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh national football team leaves for Nepal on Thursday morning to play a warm-up match against Nepal Police ahead of this month's AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers in Dhaka. Bangladesh were drawn in Group A along with Myanmar, Cambodia and Macao, the team on Wednesday moved into the qualifiers with a 3-3 aggregate after going 1-3 down away to hosts Mongolia. Macao had earlier beaten Mongolia 2-0 at home. The Bangladesh Football Federation also on Wednesday announced a 20-member squad for the warm-up match keeping strikers Jahid Hasan Emily, Mohammad Robin and winger Jahid Hasan, defender Ariful Islam and third-choice goalkeeper Mazharul Islam Himel. "Emily, Robin and Jahid had been suffering from different injuries while Ariful and Himel did not make much progress in the training camp," new BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi quoted Brazilian coach Edson Silva as saying. The absence of strike duo Emily and Robin means Bangladesh have to reply on new pairing of Mithun Chowdhury and Enamul Haq. As many as 25 players started to practice under the supervision of Dido and Argentine trainer Ariel Colman since May 28, a day after the Citycell Super Cup final. "The progress has not been great and the time I got is not enough when you want to change the game completely," Dido said. "However, the players had started to realise what I wanted from them." Though Bangladesh will be playing the matches of the AFC Challenge Cup at home, the National Team Management Committee, led by vice-president Badal Roy, has arranged a warm-up match abroad as recommended by the national coach. Explaining the reason behind playing a practice match aboard, Dido said it would act as a physiological boost because it would be tough to recover from a setback if the boys went down at home, but a loss aboard would not affect the players much. Bangladesh will play Nepal Police on April 18 after having just a day's practice in Kathmandu, which is situated 1,336 metres (4,383 feet) above sea level. "I don't know much about the opponents and I can't say you whether we are going to win or lose. It depends on how much the players can cope with the conditions," Dido was quoted as saying. Squad: Aminul Haq (captain), Biplob Bhattacharya, Nasirul Islam Nasir, Wali Faisal, Atiqur Rahman Mishu, Rashedul Islam Rashed, Rajani Kanta Barman, M Sujan, Moffazal Hossain Saikat, Mamun Mia, Arman Aziz, Enamul Haq Sharif, Pranotosh Kumar, Mejbabur Haq Manik, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury, Mamunul Islam Mamun, Motiur Munna, Iman Ahmed, Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury. Officials: Imtiaz Sultan Johnny (manager), Edson Silva Dido (head coach), Shafiqul Islam Manik (assistant coach), Ariel Colman (trainer) and Dolilur Rahman (physio). bd
