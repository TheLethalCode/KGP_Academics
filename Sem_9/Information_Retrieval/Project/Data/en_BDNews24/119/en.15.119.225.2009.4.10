<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)The long-proposed Ganges Barrage project is finally set for the design stage, subject to approval of the purchase committee, said the water resources minister on Thursday. Development Design Consultants (DDC), a Bangladeshi concern, will take the project to the drawing board with some assistance from Australian, Chinese and Pakistani consultants. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen said the go ahead may be given as early as this month on completion of all formalities. "The government is set to give the order for study and design of the Ganges Barrage project," he told reporters. He said the barrage, with proper management of water resources, would boost poverty alleviation and economic progress in 21 northwesetrn and southwestern districts from Rajshahi to Barguna. "It will enrich livelihoods in the Ganges-dependent region, reducing salinity, protecting wildlife diversity in the Sundarbans and developing and expanding agriculture and fisheries," said the minister. At the same time, navigability in 34 out of 54 rivers shared with India may be improved or restored. Water resource secretary Sheikh Wahiduzzaman said the total expenditure for the study and design stage is estimated at over Tk 34 crore. "It may take four years to complete the study and design in two phases. Efforts will be made to do it in less time," he said. Questioned how long it would take to see the barrage completed, Sen said, "Work will start as soon as possible after the design is complete. But it may take 20 to 25 years to build." On the cost of such a mammoth project, the minister said, "Preliminarily work will begin with the government's own funds." But financing the estimated Tk 10,000-15,000 crore project is not possible without help, he said. "Donor assistance will be sought out of necessity." Asked about hydroelectric power projections, the minister said, "Nothing definite can be said now." "But a similar Nepalese project is expected generate 86,000MW," said the minister. b
