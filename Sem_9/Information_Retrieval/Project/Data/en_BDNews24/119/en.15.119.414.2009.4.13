<TITLE> Pakistan's Sharif invited back to government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has asked former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's party to rejoin the government but Sharif's party said on Monday it was unlikely to do so. Political tension in nuclear-armed Pakistan has eased considerably since last month, when the government gave in to opposition demands to reinstate a controversial Supreme Court chief. The Supreme Court later cleared the way for Sharif's party, the country's second biggest party, to resume as the governing party in Punjab, Pakistan's biggest and politically most important province. But the country is also grappling with rising Islamist militant violence while struggling to revive a sagging economy. Analysts say the government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), wants Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) back in the coalition it left last year to share the burden -- and the blame for any failings. "The political forces of the country now should join hands to thwart the evil designs of its enemies," Gilani said in a statement late on Sunday after inviting the PML-N back into the coalition it left over a dispute with the PPP over the judiciary. The two biggest parties had a common objective to strengthen democratic institutions and to steer the country out of its present challenges, Gilani said. PML-N spokesman Siddiqul Farooq said Sharif would respond to Gilani's offer after consulting party leaders and workers. But he said the party would prefer to remain in opposition. "We want them to serve the country for another four years so that when we go to the electorate, they can judge the performance of both parties," he said. "I think they're feeling that they're not capable of solving problems." SERIOUS PRESSURE Political wrangling alarms the United States and other Western allies who want the government to focus on its economy and on tackling militancy in the northwest. The United States says eliminating militant sanctuaries in remote norwestern border regions is essential for stability in neighbouring Afghanistan, and for defeating al Qaeda. Sharif served as prime minister twice during the 1990s, alternating with his then bitter rival, PPP leader Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto was assassinated in 2007 and her widower, Zardari, took over as party leader and later become president. Sharif's rule was dogged by accusations of corruption and he clashed with the Supreme Court and sections of the media. Critics say he also flirted with Islamists to bolster his position, which analysts say has made the United States wary of him. Sharif was ousted in a 1999 coup by then army chief Pervez Musharraf, who stepped down as president last year. Polls show Sharif is Pakistan's most popular politician partly because of his steadfast opposition to Musharraf and his support for the judiciary. Zardari is also unpopular and if the PPP is seen as failing to tackle problems, Sharif's party would be set to easily win the next general election, due by 2013, analysts say. "The government is under serious security and economic pressure and wants them to re-join rather than criticise from outside," said political analyst Hassan Askari Rizvi. "But why should they take the blame at this stage? They'll wait and see ... they're eying the next elect
