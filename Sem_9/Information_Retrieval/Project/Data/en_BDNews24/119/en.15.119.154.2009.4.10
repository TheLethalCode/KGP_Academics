 MADRID, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Barcelona are keeping their concentration after Wednesday's 4-0 thrashing of Bayern Munich in the Champions League, midfielder Yaya Toure said ahead of the leaders' match at home to Recreativo Huelva on Saturday (1800). "The league is not over and we have to keep working hard," the Ivory Coast international said on the club's website (www.fcbarcelona.com). Barca can stretch their lead over second-placed Real Madrid to nine points with a win. Winger Arjen Robben and defenders Marcelo and Pepe are doubtful for Real's match at home to Real Valladolid on Sunday (1500), and fullback Sergio Ramos is suspended for accumulation of yellow cards, the club said. Midfielder Lassana Diarra has recovered from muscle tiredness that kept him out of full training on Tuesday and should be available, they said on their website (www.realmadrid.com). Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano said the third-placed club, who host struggling Getafe on Sunday (1700), are close to meeting their objective of qualifying for next season's Champions League. "The mood is very good in the dressing room," the Brazilian said on the club's website (www.sevillafc.es). "We had some difficult moments but they are behind us." Sevilla are nine points clear of Villarreal in fourth. Villarreal defender Sebastian Eguren said the players needed to put the Champions League tie with Arsenal and last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Almeria out of their minds and focus on Saturday's match at home to seventh-placed Malaga (2000). "Malaga are one of our direct rivals for the top spots and we have to keep that in mind or what happened at Almeria could happen again," the Uruguayan said on the club's website (www.villarrealcf.es). Atletico Madrid midfielder Ever Banega said he wanted to remain at the club and hoped they exercise an option to buy him from Valencia. "Nobody has told me if the club is going to take advantage of their option to buy me," the Argentine said on the club's website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). "Atletico is a great club and I want to carry on here." Atletico play at Deportivo Coruna on Sunday (1900) with both sides on 43 points along with Malaga. Valencia striker Fernando Morientes said the fifth-placed club's luck appeared to have changed and the mood was good ahead of their match on Sunday at Sporting Gijon (1500) when they will be aiming for a third consecutive win. "Everything is going our way now and the atmosphere is different," the former Spain international said on the club's website (www.valenciacf.com)
