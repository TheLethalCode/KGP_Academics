 SAN FRANCISCO, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Internet search firm Google Inc took its widest-ever lead in the US search market in March, according to new figures released on Wednesday by comScore. Google had a 63.7 percent share of the 14.3 billion US searches in March, up 0.4 percentage points from February, and above the 63.5 percent level that was its previous high. Yahoo Inc saw its US search share inch downwards in March to 20.5 percent, from 20.6 percent in February. The new data comes as Internet firms are due to report first-quarter earnings, with Google's slated for Thursday. Overall US search queries in March increased 9 percent from February, according to comScore. But February was three days shorter than March. The number of search queries per day in March equates to 462.3 million versus 468 million searches per day in February, according to Reuters calculation. Microsoft Corp's share of the US search market increased by 0.1 percentage points to 8.3 percent in March.
