On-duty police said the violence ensued as two groups of workers brought out processions to join a rally to be addressed by a local MP. Witnesses said the two groups of Ghat Sramik League attacked each other with sticks and bricks, bringing all activities around the ferry station to a stand still. The three-hour hostilities were marked by chases and counter chases between the two sides, they said. Internal conflicts within the Ghat Sramik League have been mounting in recent months centering on establishing supremacy over the ghat area. Ghat worker 'Faiz' told bdnews24.com that two groups, "one led by Ghat Sramik League president Jalil Hawladar and the other led by Kanchan Munshi who wants to oust Jalil", were fighting for control. Kotwali police said that no one had come to register a case over the clashes, and the situation was brought under control by evening. The injured workers were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, they said. b
