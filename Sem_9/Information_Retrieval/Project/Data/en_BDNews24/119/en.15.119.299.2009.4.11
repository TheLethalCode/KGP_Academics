<TITLE> Moldovan court postpones election recount request </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHISINAU, April 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Moldova's Constitutional Court postponed for one day on Saturday a hearing on the president's request for a recount in disputed parliamentary elections won by his Communist Party. The result led to violent protests in the former Soviet republic. Opposition parties called a new rally for Sunday to denounce what they described as arbitrary detentions and the mistreatment of demonstrators. President Vladimir Voronin, whose Communist Party ended the elections last Sunday far ahead of its rivals, says the pro-Western and liberal opposition had plotted a coup. He has also accused neighboring Romania of fomenting the turmoil, in which protesters ransacked parliament and the president's office. But he offered the recount on grounds that it would restore trust and calm. Court chairman Dumitru Pulbere said judges would consider his request on Sunday once it received official results from election officials. "We are trying to work as quickly as possible," he told reporters in the court's session hall. "There is no precedent of a recount in Moldova since independence in 1991. In any case, we have 10 days to validate the election results." Eight of the court's nine judges have been appointed under Voronin since 2001 and the court is likely to back the request. ELECTION OFFICIALS APPROVE RESULTS The election commission later said it had given final approval to its results of the poll for transfer to the court. In Brussels, the European Union's Commissioner for External relations, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, welcomed a "consensus" on a recount. "I encourage all concerned parties to engage into dialogue in a constructive spirit," she said in a statement. After a phone conversation with Voronin, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said the EU supported Moldova in its mission to get closer to the 27-nation bloc. "In this regard, further consolidation of democratic processes and institutions is key," said a statement issued by Solana's office. Voronin's press service said the president had asked Solana to dispatch an EU mission to Moldova to examine the election and its aftermath. It said the foreign policy chief had agreed to examine the Moldovan request "as a priority." The Communists, who back closer ties with the West while upholding links with Moscow, won nearly 50 percent of the vote. That would give them 60 seats, one short of the number required to secure the election of their candidate when the 101-seat assembly chooses a new president. Voronin cannot serve a third term, but has said he wants to remain in a decision-making role. Voronin has moved closer to the Kremlin recently and applauded its efforts to help resolve an 18-year-old separatist rebellion in Moldova's Russian-speaking Transdniestria region. Though most of Moldova was once part of Romania and the two neighbors share a linguistic and cultural heritage, it also has longstanding ties with Russia. Three opposition parties that won seats want a new election and dismiss the proposed recount as a meaningless gesture to distract attention from mass fraud on voters' lists. They have tried to distance themselves from Tuesday's violence in which one person died of smoke inhalation and 200 were injured, 80 of them police. The parties met Western ambassadors on Saturday and called a new rally for Sunday morning -- a week before Orthodox Easter. "We demand that Communist authorities immediately end acts of terror against children and young people, free those who have been detained and conduct normal legal procedures," they said. They urged the EU, the Council of Europe, the United States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the election and the protests. Officials say nearly 200 people have been detained. Vlad Filat of the Liberal Democrats said many detainees were being held incommunicado and some had been beaten.
