 PORTO, Portugal, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo's brilliant early goal sent holders Manchester United through to the Champions League semi-finals with a disciplined 1-0 win over Porto on Wednesday. Ronaldo smashed in an unstoppable 40-yard shot after six minutes and United hung on to become the first English team to win in Porto, their 3-2 aggregate victory setting up a last-four clash with Premier League rivals Arsenal. "It was an unbelievable strike, fantastic, a magnificent hit," United manager Alex Ferguson said in a televised interview. "They did well, defended well with good concentration. That was the key to it." Porto started slowly but gradually increased the pressure and came close to equalising on 20 minutes when Bruno Alves's free kick flew inches wide of the post. The Portuguese team suffered another blow when captain Lucho Gonzalez was forced off with a knee injury and had to be replaced by Mariano. Alves posed danger again in the 40th minute, heading just wide after an excellent Raul Meireles free kick. Porto continued to create chances but United, with England's Rio Ferdinand back in the side after missing the 2-2 first-leg draw through injury, defended resolutely. Striker Lisandro Lopez headed wide from a corner and substitute Ernesto Farias almost made an instant impact with a bicycle kick which flew over the United bar. United's first clean sheet in six games kept them on course to win five trophies this season
