 Tokyo, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Asif Ali Zardari vowed on Friday to fight militancy in Pakistan and urged donors and allies at a meeting in Tokyo to support efforts to stabilise his nuclear-armed nation. Donors are keen to hear such assurances from Zardari at the gathering, where they are expected to pledge about $4 billion to fund efforts on poverty alleviation, education and health. The international community is worried an economic meltdown in Pakistan, propped up with a $7.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund over two years, could fan popular support for al Qaeda and other militant groups. "We are willing to fight despite the fact that I lost the mother of my children, I have taken up this challenge, as the President of Pakistan... to lead Pakistan out of these difficult times," Zardari told the gathering. "I am hoping, and with all humility, asking of the world to help us fight this tremendous challenge, which not only do we face, but it doesn't end on my border," he said in comments that departed from a prepared speech. "If we lose, you lose. If we lose, the world loses." Nuclear-armed Pakistan is central to U.S. President Barack Obama's plan for South Asia, which includes trying to stabilise Afghanistan where Taliban militants -- many operating from lawless enclaves in northwest Pakistan -- have thrown that effort into doubt
