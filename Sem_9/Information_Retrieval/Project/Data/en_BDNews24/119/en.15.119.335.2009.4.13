 LONDON, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan went 10 points clear in Serie A, while French champions Olympique Lyon were knocked off the top of the Ligue 1 table by Olympique Marseille. Teenager Federico Macheda once again came off the bench to score the winner that kept Manchester United top of the English Premier League and Barcelona maintained their six-point lead over Real Madrid in Spain. SPAIN Real Madrid kept leaders Barcelona in their sights with a 2-0 home win over Real Valladolid on Sunday that trimmed the Catalans' advantage at the top back to six points. Barca had put pressure on the champions with Saturday's 2-0 victory over Recreativo Huelva at the Nou Camp that moved them nine clear overnight on 75 points. Goals from captain Raul and winger Arjen Robben sealed Real's 13th win in 14 matches since a 2-0 loss to Barca in December and put them on 69 with eight matches remaining, 12 ahead of third-placed Sevilla who lost 1-0 at home to Getafe. Valencia moved above Champions League quarter-finalists Villarreal into fourth on 49 after Juan Mata's superb late winner gave them a 3-2 win at Sporting Gijon. ENGLAND Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal England's four Champions League quarter-finalistsall won on Saturday to tighten their grip on the top four places in the Premier League. United won 2-1 at Sunderland after 17-year-old Italian Federico Macheda came on as a substitute to score the winner for the second successive week, while second-placed Liverpool crushed Blackburn Rovers 4-0. Chelsea built up a 4-0 lead at home to Bolton Wanderers but had to hang on as the visitors clawed it back to 4-3. Arsenal also scored four to come from behind and win 4-1 at Wigan Athletic.

FRANCE Olympique Marseille overtook Olympique Lyon at the top of the Ligue 1 table on Sunday after beating Grenoble 4-1 while the seven-times champions were held 2-2 at home by Monaco. It is the first time since mid-September that Lyon are not the leaders at the end of a round of matches. Girondins Bordeaux had put pressure on Lyon when they leapfrogged them on goal difference on Saturday with a 2-0 win at AJ Auxerre.
