<TITLE> Sircar drew Tk 27 lakh illegally, says JS probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary probe committee investigating corruption charges against former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar has said he took more than Tk 27 lakh from the public exchequer "without lawful authority". "The speaker himself in an official note has admitted that he may have drawn the Tk 27,86,00 'unlawfully' for his medical treatment," Fazle Rabbi Mian, the committee head, told reporters after a meeting Sunday. Mian said the probe committee at its second meeting discussed only Sircar's past medical expenses. He said Sircar, now an MP of the opposition BNP, as speaker in 2006 sent a file to the then prime minister Khaleda Zia for approval of the money for his by-pass surgery. "But she did not approve." "Then the speaker wrote a note on the file saying he would return the money if the Supreme Court thought the withdrawal unlawful." "Why would the Supreme Court give directive in this regard? Is this a constitutional affair?" said Mian, who was one of the MPs to propose a parliamentary probe against the former speaker. Mian said Sircar would be given the chance to defend him before the committee, which would sit again at 11.00 am on Monday. He also said the committee would try to submit its findings by April 30. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of demands by some MPs, formed the 11-member committee on March 19 to investigate whether his predecessor Sircar appointed employees in violation of the rules, wasted public funds or misused his authority as speaker. The committee was also authorised "to investigate any other persons facing corruption allegations from any quarters". Mian on March 30 said corruption charges against former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain, now BNP secretary-general, who allegedly extorted money from the parliament's cafeteria, would also be looked into if necessary. The other members of the all-party committee are: chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque (BNP), Mujibul Haq Chunnu (Jatiya Party), Mainuddin Khan Badal (Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal), and AL MPs Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, ASM Feroze, Shajahan Khan, Habibur Rahman , SK Baker, Abdul Mannan and ABM Anwarul Haq. The BNP's Zainul Abdin Farroque did not attend either of the two committee meetings, including Sunday's.
