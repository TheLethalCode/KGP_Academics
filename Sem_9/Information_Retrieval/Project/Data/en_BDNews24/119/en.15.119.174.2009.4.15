 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)A 100 days into office, campus violence by pro-Awami League students has been the only "scar" of the new government, according to several ministers. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, they said the failure will not deter the government from carrying out the tasks at hand. The ministers spelled climate change, implementation of election manifesto and global economic downturn, among other issues, as the tough challenges facing the administration of Sheikh Hasina in her second stint as prime minister. The supporters of the AL's student front Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed among themselves and with others for control over the past months, leaving at least two top leaders killed and scores wounded. They cited Hasina's giving up the role of organisational chief of student organisation and recent arrests of BCL's two central committee leaders as steps to end politics of violence. "A conspiracy like BDR bloodbath could not stop the government as it has been working sincerely since its first day in office," planning minister AK Khandker said. "There's no doubt the country will move ahead if the current pace is maintained." According to him, protecting the country from climate change impacts is the biggest challenge for the new government completing its first 100 days Thursday. The AL-led alliance won a historic landslide in Dec. 29 general election last year and took oath on Jan. 6. Khandker said the government decided to stage trials for crimes committed during the 1971 independence war on the very first day of the opening session of the ninth parliament. The trial will kick off once the investigation agency is appointed officer and tribunal formed. The minister, also head of 'Sectors Commander Forum', a body of sector commanders of independence war, said he is sanguine about the law and home ministries appointing an experienced and competent investigation officer. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said she did not want to evaluate the government's hundred days in the office, as she believed in "five-year plans". She, however said it is the people who will judge the government. "The people have already started to evaluate the government which is why no gains could be made from such a big conspiracy," Matia said, referring to the February's bloody BDR mutiny that left at least 70 army officers deputed to the border guards killed. Commerce minister Faruq Khan also said on Apr. 13 unrest at educational institutions countrywide has been a source of embarrassment to the government in its first 100-day in office. He had spelled out law and order, militancy and war crimes trial as the tough challenges facing the government. Aviation minister GM Quader, an MP of the AL's election ally Jatiya Party, said the government has taken up initiatives to implement its election pledges in the first 100 days. Prices of essentials have started coming down on the government's realistic steps and will fall, he said. Quader saw "few social changes" although he said the government has improved the law and order. He believes they will face the toughest challenge to implement the grand alliance's election manifesto. On the BCL factional clashes, the aviation minister said the prime minister has asked for actions to end violence. The ongoing global economic downturn tat is yet to cast its full spell on Bangladesh's economy will present the biggest challenge, state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud thinks. He said the government's homework to spot problems and teamwork helped curb the spiralling prices. He said the campus unrest obviously hurt the government but pointed out that it did took steps to put an end to instability at the educational institutions. He spoke for intensified coordination among the ministries of foreign, expatriates welfare and overseas employment and labour to boost manpower export and foreign currency earnings. bd
