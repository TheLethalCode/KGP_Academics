<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Thursday stayed a High Court order freezing of the proceedings of two cases filed against former state minister Amanullah Aman. A three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, gave the stay order as the government sought to appeal the earlier High Court order. The two cases, relating to landgrab and extortion charges, were stayed by the High Court on petitions by Aman on December 9 and November 5 2007. As a result of Thursday's Supreme Court order, additional attorney general Murad Reza told bdnews24.com, "There remains no obstacle now to try the two cases in the lower court." Siddiqur Rahman of Keraniganj filed the landgrab case in Keraniganj on March 19 2007, alleging that businessman Mohiuddin Mohin, backed by the then state minister Amanullah Aman, attempted to forcibly occupy and build on Siddiqur's land in December 2005. On March 29, 2007, cloth merchant Omar Faruq filed a case in Keraniganj some 15 people, including Aman, accusing them of extortion, looting and attempted murder. The case alleged that, at the instruction of Aman, the accused tried to extort Tk 2 lakh from Faruq in Sept 12 2005. On Sept 28 of that year, Faruq said, he handed over Tk 1 lakh to two of the accused Ahsanullah and Nafur Islam. For not handing over the remaining Tk 1 lakh, Faruk said he and his brother were shot on Nov 22 of that year, and gold ornaments worth Tk 3.5 lakh were looted by the accused from his house. b
