 DUBAI, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan skipper Younis Khan wants his players to stay positive and cash in on being fresher than Australia in their five-match one-day series in the United Arab Emirates from April 22. Pakistan have been forced to play their home series in Dubai and Abu Dhabi with security concerns at home heightened after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore on March 3. Pakistan did not play any home test last year as teams refused to tour due to safety fears and have not played international cricket since six Sri Lankan players were injured in the ambush while being driven to the stadium for the third day of the second test. "It was really tough for the Sri Lankans," Younis told reporters on Tuesday. "They are still suffering from the trauma. We're also shocked because our bus was just 500 metres behind them. This is tragic for cricket and tragic for sports." Australia will arrive in the UAE having lost the one-day series to South Africa. Hosts South Africa lead 3-1 in the series with the final game to be played on Friday. Skipper Ricky Ponting, batsman Mike Hussey and in-form paceman Mitchell Johnson have also been rested to give them a deserved break. "I will tell my team we have not played international cricket and if we can put our pent up energy to use, we can surely beat Australia," Younis said. "Australia have just lost their series in South Africa. They have played back-to-back matches, so don't you think they will be a bit tired when they come here?" Younis urged his players to show commitment and warned them not to take Australia lightly despite the absence of key players. "Australia will be arriving here on April 18, so we have four days before that and it will be a good opportunity for us to get used to the conditions.
