 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  More petitions have been filed for cancellation of cases to harass political rivals during the BNP-led coalition government's rule than the two-year emergency government's. The new Awami League-led government announced the move apparently to rid of charges pressed during the interim administration's regime. Around 300 such applications have been submitted to the justice department of the district commissioner's office in Dhaka, Nazmul Alam, office assistant of the department, told bdnwes24.com Thursday. A home minister letter on Apr 2 told the department that petitions seeking withdrawal of such cases can be filed until April 15. The government has formed two committees at the district and ministry level to consider the applications. Among these are four cases filed against prime minister Sheikh Hasina during the caretaker government's rule. The number of applications, from the opposition BNP party, is not that significant. Pro-BNP lawyers said they will petition for cases filed against Khaleda Zia and other BNP leaders but are waiting for the certified copies of the declaration and charge-sheet of the cases. "We will urge the government to extend the deadline by at least one month because we are yet to get the certified copies," said Sanaullah Mia, a BNP lawyer. Otherwise, he said, permission should be given to use the photocopy or handwritten certified copies. However, the ministry is yet to make a decision ion the issue, said Abu Abdullah, public prosecutor of Dhaka District Sessions Judge's Court and a member of the case withdrawal committee. He said applications were submitted to withdraw cases against AL leader Kamal Majumder and Alhaj Maqbul Hossain. Among the cases of BNP are four against Khaleda Zia, two against Barkatullah Bulu, 15 against Amanullah Aman, four against Ziaul Haq Zia, 11 against Tarique Rahman, three against Arafat Rahman Coco, 12 against Salahuddin Ahmed and two against Khairul Kabir Khokon, BNP lawyers said. b
