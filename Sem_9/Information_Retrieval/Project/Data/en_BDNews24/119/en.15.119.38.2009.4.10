<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 10 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - British police said on Friday they were searching a 10th address as part of a major counter-terrorism operation in northwest England to thwart a suspected al Qaeda plot involving Pakistani nationals. Twelve men -- 11 of them Pakistanis -- were arrested in dramatic daylight raids by hundreds of officers on Wednesday. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he had spoken with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari by telephone on Thursday night to discuss the operation. Brown's office said they agreed that Britain and Pakistan "share a serious threat from terrorism and violent extremism", and had committed to "work together to address this common challenge". Most terrorist plots in Britain since Sept. 11, 2001 have had links to Pakistan, including suicide bombings in July 2005 which killed 52 people on London's underground and bus network. Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that the new search was taking place at an address in Liverpool. They added that the suspects arrested were still in custody "in various locations across the country". Police did not anticipate making any further announcements on Friday. Wednesday's raids had to be brought forward because of a security blunder by Britain's top counter-terrorism officer, Bob Quick, who was photographed entering Brown's 10 Downing Street residence openly carrying a secret document on the operation. The document, headlined "Briefing Note: Operation Pathway" and marked "secret", described it as a "Security Service-led investigation into suspected AQ (al Qaeda) driven attack planning within the UK". Quick resigned on Thursday, acknowledging that "my action could have compromised a major counter-terrorism operation".
