 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)The country's foreign reserves have touched a new high of $6.23 billion, topping the previous record of $6.21 billion in July last year. The Bangladesh Bank governor and economists see record reserves, despite the ongoing global economic downturn, as positive for the economy. "The figure is a relief; it amounts to five months' import expenses," central bank boss Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Thursday. A country's reserves are seen as healthy if they can meet three months' import costs at any time. The BB boss mainly credited remittances by expatriate workers and reduction in imports of luxury products for the record reserve. "But a slight shrinkage in capital machinery imports is also a reason," he added. According to central bank figures, Bangladesh's foreign reserves crossed the $6 billion mark for the first time on Apr. 5 last year. Reserves will stay above $6 billion dollars until Bangladesh pays off a major portion of its import bills for Mar-Apr through the Asian Clearing Union in the first week of May. The eight member countries of the Tehran-headquartered ACU pay their intra-regional import bills every two months through their respective central banks. Import shrinkage Zaid Bakht, senior research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, was optimistic on the whole with the reserve figure "for an economy like Bangladesh's". He said a contraction in import of luxury products was a good thing in the current circumstances. But, he cautioned, if reserves are inflated through underutilisation and an overall drop in exports, then it is a bad sign. "In the long run, everything will depend on how much the global economic recession casts its spell on the country's economy," he said. Healthy remittance growth Bangladesh also broke a remittance record in March this year with $881.3 million, the highest ever for a single month. The March figure topped the previous high of $859 million earned in January, according to Bangladesh Bank numbers. February saw $784.5 million. The first nine months (July 2008-March 2009) has seen remittance earnings of $7 billion, a 34 percent jump over the same period of the previous fiscal year (2007-08). Total remittance in 2007-08 was $7.9 billion and $6 billion in 2006-07. The World Bank, IMF, ADB and local economists, however, are predicting a dip in remittances, one of the economy's main indices, in the face of the global crisis. bdne
