 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com) - The government is on guard against "political patronage of criminals", the finance minister said Saturday. "Criminals always expect political patronisation, but the (Awami League-led) grand alliance government is very cautious of this," AMA Muhith said, addressing a civic ceremony in Sylhet to felicitate MPs and ministers. "As every successive government comes along, even during the Awami League-led government, such criminals, changing their masks every time, have been patronised," he said. "But we will not shelter criminals," he stressed. Muhith also had a word to say on the hot topic of the day, the BNP-led alliance's protest against the decision to cancel the lease on Khaleda Zia's cantonment house '"BNP and Jama'at(-e-Islam) are attempting to fulfil their own agenda by making a big issue of the decision as they have no other issue to take up," said the minister. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, social welfare minister Enamul Haque Mustafa Shahid and chief whip Abdus Shahid were among the 21 ministers and MPs to be felicitated by Sylhet City Corporation. bdn
