 Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)New Year crowds were hit by a heat wave as they celebrated Pahela Baishakh, the first day of the Bengali year, on Tuesday. The mild heat wave was sweeping over Khulna division and regions of Rajshahi, Ishwardi and Bogra. It may continue and spread over more areas, said the met office. In Dhaka too, city dwellers experienced temperatures up to 36.8 degrees Celsius as they thronged the streets and festival spots through the day. The highest temperature in the country, of 38.4 degrees, was recorded in Jessore. The weather was likely to remain dry with partly cloudy skies over the country on Wednesday, said the forecast. Day temperatures could rise slightly. Depression in Bay Meanwhile, a well-marked low over the southeast and central Bay of Bengal, moving slightly north westwards, intensified into a depression. In a special weather bulletin, the met office said the depression was centred about 1165 km south-southeast of Chittagong port, 1085 km south-southeast of Cox's Bazar port and 1105 south of Mongla port at around 6pm Tuesday. It was likely to intensify further as it moved in a northwesterly direction, said the bulletin. Maximum sustained wind speed within a 44 km radius of the depression centre was about 40 km per hour rising to 50 km in gusts or squalls, causing moderate to rough seas. The maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla were advised to hoist distant cautionary signal number one. All fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay and deep sea were advised to come close to the coast, not to venture into deep sea and proceed with caution till further notice.
