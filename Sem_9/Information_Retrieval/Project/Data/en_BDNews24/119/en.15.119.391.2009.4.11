"I deeply regret the postponement," Ban said in a statement. "I understand the circumstances that led the Thai Government to take this difficult decision," The summit, led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was cancelled after Thai anti-government protesters breached security and swarmed into the media centre at the hotel complex where it was being held. "I hope for an early restoration of normalcy in Thailand and for the settlement of differences through dialogue and peaceful means," Ban's statement said.
