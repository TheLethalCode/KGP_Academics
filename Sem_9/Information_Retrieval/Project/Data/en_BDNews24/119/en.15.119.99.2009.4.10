<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)BNP will politically combat any governmental move to evict Khaleda Zia from her Dhaka cantonment residence, secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Friday. "[Khaleda] has spent 28 years of her widowed life in that house since her husband's death," Delwar told reporters at his Armanitola home. "Today, if the government evicts her by an illegal decision, we'll handle that politically." He warned that the government would have to take responsibility for any untoward happenings that might arise. Delwar criticised the government for cancelling the lease on the house. Since her husband's killing, [Khaleda] has been living in that house which had been leased to her as per an unanimous decision by the second parliament in 1981, he added.. The residents still held the house deed and all legal papers based on which the Cantonment Board had handed it to Zia family, he said. He trashed the allegations raised by law minister Shafiq Ahmed and commerce minister Faruq Khan that Khaleda's occupation of the house had been illegal. He once again asked the government to rescind the 'erratic' decision. "The onus usually is not on the cabinet of ministers to cancel a house allotment to an individual. It was done to compel the Cantonment Board to execute it." He alleged that as BNP had cancelled the government decision of allotting Ganobhaban, a state property, to Sheikh Hasina, prime minister in 2001, the government now vengefully cancelled the lease on Khaleda's residence. The secretary-general said the government was failing to deliver on its election commitments and trying to divert people's attention to minor issues. "The prime minister has not been able to transcend meanness. The government will not be able to bring in promised changes unless its leaders change their mindset," Delwar observed. b
