 LOS ANGELES, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lindsay Lohan is looking for a lover who does not mind her alleged alcoholism or electronic monitoring bracelet, or so the famously troubled Hollywood actress said in a mock Internet dating profile. Lohan, whose recent breakup with Samantha Ronson has been covered by the media, stars in an a dating profile posted online on Monday at FunnyOrDie.com that parodies similar videos created for matchmaking company eHarmony. "I would define my personality as creative, a bit of a night owl," Lohan says in the video. "I'm a workaholic, a shopaholic and according to the state of California, an alcoholic as well as a threat to all security guards if they work at hotels," she says, with a perky smile. Lohan, who is on probation, was briefly jailed in 2007 for a drunken driving and cocaine possession conviction. She had been arrested the previous May after wrecking her car in Beverly Hills and again in July following a car chase in the Los Angeles beach community of Santa Monica. She was made to wear an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, a fact that the actress jokingly mentions in her video, which features the jumpy camera work characteristic of eHarmony dating profiles. "We'll crash a few parties, a car or two, but at the end of the day I promise you, I never lose my Google hits, just my underwear," the actress says in the video. Lohan starred in the 2004 movie "Mean Girls," which made more than $129 million worldwide at box offices, but in recent years her career faced ups and downs as she battled drug and legal problems. Her latest film, the comedy "Labor Pains," will not have a wide release in U.S. theaters and will instead play on cable channel ABC Family. Lohan's humorous video is the latest comedy piece from FunnyOrDie.com using a Hollywood star to make light of a topic in the news, in this case Lohan's breakup from Ronson. FunnyOrDie.com was created by comedian Will Ferrell and actor/director Adam McKay. Last year, the Web site had celebrity heiress Paris Hilton star in a video mocking presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, after he used Hilton's image in a campaign ad. Lohan's relationship with Ronson, 31, a celebrity DJ, has been the focus of months of media attention, after they were photographed kissing at the Cannes International Film Festival in May 2008. But they recently broke up, with Lohan appearing on the cover of the latest issue of US Weekly next to her quote that she is "so alone." In her comedy video, Lohan sits on a sofa and reads from the magazine
