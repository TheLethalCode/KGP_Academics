<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)Providing for jobless expatriates, returning home in the face of the global recession, will be a major challenge for the coming year, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said on Monday. "Despite the global economic slump, Bangladeshi expatriates sent a record $88.13 crore in remittance in March which is a great contribution to our economy," he said at a seminar on utilisation of remittance. "But creating employment for returning workers at home is a big challenge ahead of the government," said the central banker. WB suggests extra million jobs The World Bank in a report Monday also suggested the government may need to create an extra one million new jobs to offset the effects of the world recession. "At least 2 to 2.5 million new local jobs will be needed until the global economy recovers, compared to 1.1 million job creation prior to the crisis, " Zahid Hussain, a senior economist of the World Bank, told reporters at the launch of the report. The Bangladeshi economy is currently stable but is vulnerable as the global economic slowdown threatens exports and remittances, said the report titled "Bangladesh: State of the Economy and Policy Response to the Global Economic Crisis". Facilities for returnees Meanwhile, the central bank boss highlighted the need for ensuring bank loans and other facilities for returnees so that they can return to a living back at home. He also urged local NGOs to maintain liaisons with overseas NGOs to assist expatriates in trouble. "We must create labour markets in some new countries by creating and exporting more skilled and efficient workers," added Salehuddin. "Remittance is the biggest foreign exchange earner." "But a big chunk of remittance makes its way back by illegal means due to high service charges," he said. The central bank boss stressed the need for a cut in service charges to encourage more inflow through legal channels. The governor was speaking as chief guest at the seminar on 'Organisational Support for Proper Utilisation of Remittance', organised by the International Network of Alternative Financial Institutions (INAFI) at the BRAC Centre Inn. Bangladesh Bank executive director Chowdhury Mohidul Haq, NGO Affairs Bureau director general Mustak Hasan Iftekhar and INAFI executive director Atikun Nabi also spoke. bd
