<TITLE> Abbas to Quartet: Israel must commit for talks to resume </TITLE>

 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Fri Apr 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has made peace talks with Israel's new government conditional on it committing to previous agreements and freezing Jewish settlement growth, aides said on Friday. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Abbas conveyed that message directly to the so-called Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations.

That could put Netanyahu on a collision course with the administration of US President Barack Obama, who called this week for a Palestinian state alongside Israel as outlined in Annapolis, and said both sides needed to make compromises. Netanyahu and Lieberman also support settlement growth despite US calls for a freeze. The Quartet's special envoy, Tony Blair, has urged Netanyahu to resume statehood talks in parallel with a push to boost the West Bank economy and to let Palestinians control more of their territory. Abbas's Western-backed government is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Blair also urged Netanyahu to ease Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas Islamists seized in June 2007 after routing forces loyal to Abbas's secular Fatah fac
