 TOKYO, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan can restore economic growth and is committed to fighting extremism, its foreign minister said on Wednesday, as the cash-strapped country eyes $4 billion in aid from allies gathering in Tokyo this week. Delegates meeting on Friday want to hear assurances that Pakistan is focused on implementing economic reforms and fighting an increasingly formidable Islamist insurgency as they set to pledge aid to fill a financing gap over the next two years. The international community is worried that an economic meltdown in the nuclear-armed country, which narrowly averted a balance of payment crisis last year, could fan popular support for al Qaeda and other militant groups. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said he was confident of donors pledging funds and added that the support, along with economic policies in place, would help push economic growth to 6 to 7 percent. The central bank has forecast growth for the 2008/09 fiscal year ending in June at 2.5-3.5 percent. "What we have in front of us is a huge agenda," Qureshi told a news conference in Tokyo. "A huge agenda of economic stabilisation, an agenda of defeating terrorism, reversing extremism and a political agenda of strengthening political and democratic institutions of Pakistan." Pakistan is central to U.S. President Barack Obama's plan for south Asia which includes trying to stabilise Afghanistan, where Taliban militants, many operating from lawless northwest Pakistani enclaves, have thrown U.S. success into doubt. In Pakistan, a hotchpotch of militant groups, many operating from those same enclaves on the Afghan border and looking to al Qaeda for leadership, have sown fear with regular suicide attacks and are increasingly challenging the writ of the state. While violence has intensified, high oil and food costs battered Pakistan's economy last year and it only averted a balance of payments crisis when, in November, it secured an IMF loan package of $7.6 billion over two years. NO "CHRISTMAS PARTY" Motohide Yoshikawa, Japan's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told Reuters in an interview that Tokyo and other donors wanted a clear commitment from Pakistan on economic reform and fighting militants. "This is not a Christmas party," he said. "Those who receive have their own obligations and those who have made pledges have obligations to pay what they promise." Pakistan will outline its medium-term strategies to fight insurgency and revive its economy at a Friends of Pakistan group meeting on Friday morning. In the afternoon, those friends, who include the United States, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, will join other donors to promise aid for the next two years. "This is a whole bunch of people coming together to express support for Pakistan but concern about the direction that things are going," US Senator John Kerry told reporters in Islamabad late on Tuesday. "It's important that there be significant aid put on the table to underscore the importance of this effort. I think there will be," said Kerry, who is sponsoring a bill to triple US development aid to Pakistan to $1.5 billion a year. Pakistani Finance Ministry chief Shaukat Tarin said this week the target of $4 billion over two years was for spending on poverty alleviation, education and health. Those sectors have suffered under efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. At the Friends meeting, Pakistan is expected to present a prioritised wish-list of projects worth $30 billion that it wants to see implemented over 10 years, including hydro dams, roads and security projects. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani said last week his government wanted a "Marshall Plan", referring to massive US spending in Europe after World War
