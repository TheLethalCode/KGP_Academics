 by Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)Police in Kolkata have arrested an alleged Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh terrorist, wanted in connection with at least two failed attempts on the life of Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina and other terror attacks in the country. CID officers captured the 35-year-old Mufti Ibrahim, alias Jalauddin, nephew of notorious Huji-B commander Mufti Abdul Hannan, late Sunday evening from an apartment in the eastern suburbs of the city. The wanted man, who joined HuJI-B in 1993, had been living in the same Kolkata apartment for over six years, running an umbrella shop and calling himself Manik Mondal. Ibrahim, who hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj, is wanted for planting 76kg of explosives near the venue of a Hasina rally in Kotalipara in July 2000. The explosives were detected just minutes before the meeting. He is also a prime suspect in the August 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally in Dhaka. His uncle Mufti Hannan was arrested for masterminding the attack. "We have taken [Ibrahim] into custody and are interrogating him", said SN Gupta, deputy inspector general of CID (operations). Gupta says that Ibrahim had undergone plastic surgery in Kolkata in recent years to evade detection after local accomplices put him in touch with a cosmetic surgeon in central Kolkata. "A few other notorious criminals and terrorists from Bangladesh, including Mohammed Iqbal and Sufi Khan, have also changed their looks with cosmetic surgery at the same clinic," says a CID officer who is part of the investigation. According to the CID, Ibrahim fled Bangladesh and sneaked into West Bengal in early 2000. CID officers revealed that he has travelled to and from Bangladesh, using fake passports, four times since then. He has been charged under the Foreigner's Act as he has no legal passport or other valid documents to stay in India.
