 TEHRAN Mon Apr 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili told EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana that Tehran would welcome dialogue on "constructive cooperation" with six world powers, state television reported on Monday. The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said on Wednesday they would ask Solana to invite Iran to a meeting to find "a diplomatic solution to this critical issue", referring to the row over its disputed nuclear plans. It marked a major shift in US policy under new President Barack Obama, whose predecessor George W. Bush shunned direct contact with Tehran as long as it did not halt nuclear work the West fears is a cover for developing bombs.

"We speak very respectfully of Barack Obama. But we are realists. We want to see real changes," Ahmadinejad told German news magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published last week. Despite reaching out to Tehran, analysts and diplomats say the Obama administration would be realistic about its chances of a breakthrough and was aware Iran may use talks to buy time to complete its nuclear programme. While seeking to engage Iran, Washington has also warned of tougher sanctions if it continues to defy United Nations demands to halt sensitive nuclear work. In the Der Spiegel interview, Ahmadinejad again dismissed demands to stop enriching uranium. "These discussions are old. The time for this is over," he said. Underlining Iran's determination to press ahead with its nuclear drive despite Western pressure, Ahmadinejad last week inaugurated its first nuclear fuel production co
