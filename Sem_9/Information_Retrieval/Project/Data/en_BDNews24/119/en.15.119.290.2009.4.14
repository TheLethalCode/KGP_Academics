 TBILISI, Apr 14(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters in Georgia set up camp outside President Mikheil Saakashvili's office on Monday and the EU urged talks on the fifth day of an opposition street campaign against his rule. Up to 20,000 protesters rallied in the capital as opposition leaders tried to maintain momentum in their bid to oust Saakashvili over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia.

Analysts question whether the opposition can remain united or muster sufficient numbers over a sustained period. Despite the defection of some key allies and repeated cabinet reshuffles since the war, Saakashvili's position appears to remain strong. Critics accuse him of monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary and media since coming to power on the back of the 2003 "Rose Revolution." Police dispersed the last peaceful mass protests against Saakashvili in a crackdown condemned by his Western backers. "It can go on for a long time, but in our view a far better scenario is to identify the agenda for a political process," EU South Caucasus envoy Peter Semneby told Reuters. If not, "the danger is always there that the grievances and discontent will remain and we will have the same thing happening in a few months or half a year with the debilitating effect that this has on Geor
