 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  Farmers say the export-focused shrimp industry is under threat from substandard or 'fake' Indian Golda fry smuggled into Bangladesh. They say the fake fry will hit their exports hard, and the government will lose revenue to a production slump. Bangladesh is famous for two varieties of giant prawn, the freshwater Golda and the saltwater Bagda or Tiger prawn, which constitute nearly 90 percent of frozen food exports, the second biggest foreign exchange earner after apparel. Nearly 30 percent of prawn exports are Golda and the rest Bagda, according to exporters. "Huge amounts of young prawns are entering Bangladesh through the Satkhira border," Sheikh Mohammad Shafiuddin, convenor of Golda Hatchery Association of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com Sunday. The illegal traders sell them as 'Golda fry caught in local rivers'. "The fry are not caught locally, but smuggled from India. And they are not even Golda fry," said Shafiuddin. The government has banned fishing of fry in rivers. The farmers who have spent crores of taka on hatcheries are losing out because the smuggled fry are sold much cheaper than local varieties, according to him. The government-approved hatcheries produce around 120 crore of the giant freshwater prawns a year against a demand of 120-150 crore, Shafiuddin said. "The fry that are being smuggled in do not grow big, 30-40 of the Indian variety make one kg, but four of our Golda prawns, when adult, make one kg," Mostafa Shiblee, managing director of Shiblee Hatchery and Firm, Kuakata, in Patuakhali told bdnews24.com. "Theirs are grown in hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in India and after 10-12 days they are sent to Bangladesh. (But) real Golda fry have to be kept in hatcheries for 40-45 days." Dr Mahmudul Karim, executive director of Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, told bdnews24.com he had been hearing for quite some time that fry were being smuggled in. Farmers will be affected if there are sold anything other than Golda fry. He asked if substandard fry were, in fact, coming in what the fisheries officials were doing. Golda prawns had good prospects but the government needed to support the industry, he said. He added that the hatcheries were simply not capable to meet the demand for Golda prawns at present. Director general of Fisheries Department Rafiqul Islam said he did not know for sure if the fry was being smuggled in. But, he added, if it was true then the onus lay with the border guards to prevent it. "We are thinking about writing to the BDR about the issue." Fisheries minister Abdul Latif Biswas also told bdnews24.com Monday that they had heard about the smuggling of fry, sat with the farmers and run investigations but had no specific information. "Still, we will try to gather more information and take steps against those involved with the smuggling of fake fry." He said a national policy on the shrimp sector would be formulated soon to control quality. "We will take measures to breed the best prawns." The first eight months of the ongoing 2009-10 fiscal year saw export of frozen foods drop by around 10 percent against the past year . Bangladesh exported frozen foods worth $371 million from Feb-July last year to the United States, EU countries and Japan but this year it exported $331 million. bdnew
