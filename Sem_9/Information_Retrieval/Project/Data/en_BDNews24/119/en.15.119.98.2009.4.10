 PARIS, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paris St Germain were held to a goalless draw by Dynamo Kiev in a lacklustre UEFA Cup quarter-final, first leg at the Parc des Princes on Thursday. PSG, now unbeaten in their last eight UEFA Cup games, dominated the match but proved too clumsy in front of goal to establish a lead for next week's return in Ukraine. Midfielder Clement Chantome had the best chance for the Ligue 1 side but his powerful shot was superbly saved by Dynamo goalkeeper Stanislav Bogush on the half hour. "Our main objective tonight was to not concede a goal but it is a bit frustrating as we had some good chances," PSG coach Paul Le Guen told reporters. "We are still hopeful we can go through to the next round but we will have to be more realistic in front of the goal," he added. Dynamo coach Yuri Semin said: "We now have the advantage of playing the second leg at home." The Ukrainian league leaders also had their chances, the clearest in the 50th minute when an Olexandr Aliyev effort from outside the box was tipped away by PSG keeper Mickael Landreau. Le Guen, who has been complaining all season that he has too few top players in his squad, started with captain Claude Makelele and forward Ludovic Giuly on the bench. Both were rested before a crucial Ligue 1 game at Lille on Sunday. Stephane Sessegnon, the driving force in PSG's midfield this season, set up fellow midfielder Chantome only for Bogush to deny the hosts with his foot after half an hour. PSG piled on the pressure after the interval and Sessegnon made a solo run for goal in the 57th minute but was caught by chasing Dynamo defenders
