 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)An alleged gangster was killed in an 'encounter' with RAB early Friday at Balurmathh under Jhilmil project in South Keraniganj. Nasir Uddin Nasir, 28, also known as Nasir Kashai, had at least 10 cases including murder filed against him, the elite force added. RAB legal and media wing director AK Azad told bdnews24.com that the 'encounter' took place at about 3:30am. RAB, however, had arrested Nasir prior to the fatal incident. Azad said, after his arrest, Nasir during his interrogation divulged information, based on which RAB had taken him out to retrieve cached arms when Nasir's cohorts opened fire at the law enforcers in a bid to wrench their comrade free. RAB retaliated and while Nasir tried to flee taking advantage of the melee, he got hit by a bullet and died on the spot. Others fled the scene. RAB retrieved a pistol, a revolver, a one-shooter gun and five rounds of ammunition from the spot, Azad said. Azad claimed that Nasir was a known terror in the area. The locals used to dread him. The dead had at least 10 cases filed against him with Keraniganj and South Keraniganj police stations. bdnew
