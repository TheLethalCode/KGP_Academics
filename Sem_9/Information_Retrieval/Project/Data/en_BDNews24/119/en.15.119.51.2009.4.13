<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)India has proposed that Bangladesh send a team to witness the proposed Tipaimukh dam which environmentalists fear would ultimately dry up the Meghna river in the greater Sylhet region. Indian foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon made the offer came at his meetings with foreign minister Dipu Moni and his counterpart Md Touhid Hossain Monday. The foreign minister expressed Dhaka's concern about the controversial project that it could deprive Bangladesh of its share of the international river that supplied waters to hundreds of water bodies in the region. Menon arrived in Dhaka Sunday on an unannounced and unscheduled visit to take part in an "ongoing dialogue between friends, between neighbours". He left on Monday afternoon. "They (India) are trying to allay our concerns about the Tipaimukh dam," Touhid told reporters after meeting Menon. "He (Menon) told me that Bangladesh should send a delegation comprising technical and political people to witness the project." The foreign secretary added that Dhaka would make a decision later. "On water, for instance, there were some concerns expressed and I said we would be very happy to receive a delegation from Bangladesh to show them exactly what is happening, what we planned," Menon told reporters after meetings with Dipu Moni, her deputy Hasan Mahmud, and Touhid. "What we planned is a river project which will not affect the downstream flows at all," "This is a part of the ongoing dialogue between friends, between neighbours, it is natural we will keep discussing the issues finding ways forward," he said. India in 2003 initiated the move to construct a dam over the cross-boundary river Barak which enters into Bangladesh through Sylhet region before meeting the Meghna. It started the construction by the end of last year without consulting Bangladesh. Bangladesh gets 7 to 8 percent of its total water from the Barak in India's northeastern states. Millions of people are dependent on hundreds of water bodies, fed by the Barak, in the Sylhet region for fishing and agricultural activities. Environmentalists in Bangladesh have held many talks on the adverse impact of the proposed dam. They say the dam would dry up the river and the water bodies in the downstream, leaving millions jobless. India dismisses the claims. 'Surprise visit' Foreign ministry sources said this is for the first time an Indian foreign secretary has come to Bangladesh without prior announcement and in such short notice. Menon disagrees. "We meet regularly. We don't have a set schedule. We meet whenever we feel," he told reporters. Touhid said his Indian counterpart did not visit after the election of new government in Bangladesh. "They think that they should prepare the ground for resolving outstanding bilateral issues after the election of the new government in India," said Touhid. "We feel that many of the issues that we might have had difficulties in the past are now coming right to a situation where we can move forward," said Menon. He said he was "very satisfied" with the quality of the discussion which reflects "the quality of the friendship". Security Menon said he also discussed security issues. "Security was one of issues we discussed, we discussed it in all the conversations and how important it is for both Bangladesh and India. "And this is something that is in our common interest that we eliminate terrorism from our region and that we do this together. So, we will continue to work together to that direction". The Indian foreign secretary met prime minister Sheikh Hasina and army chief Moeen U Ahmed Sunday night. He is expected to leave Dhaka Monday.
