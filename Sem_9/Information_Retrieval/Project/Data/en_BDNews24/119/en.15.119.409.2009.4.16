 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP secretary general urged the government to resolve the issue of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment house in the country's law courts. "It can be settled in court," Khandaker Delwar Hossain told a protest rally in front of BNP's Naya Paltan headquarters.

"So, the cabinet's decision is wrong," said Delwar, who acted as BNP chief while Khaleda was put behind bars by the past caretaker government between 2007-2008. He called on the government to avoid "the vindictive path" and cancel the cabinet decision. He repeated his previous allegation the government was raising this issue to divert people's attention away from "the government's failures" in resolving various problems, including the BDR crisis. After former president Ziaur Rahman's death in a 1981coup, the then president Abdus Sattar leased the cantonment to widow Khaleda Zia. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Azizul Bari Helal presided over Wednesday's protest rally, that announced a further protest rally by students in front of the BNP's central office and district-based protest rallies across the country on Apr. 19. b
