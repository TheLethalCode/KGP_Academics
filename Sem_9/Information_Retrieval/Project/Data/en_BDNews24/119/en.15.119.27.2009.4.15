 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)Upazila parishad chairmen have threatened to declare local MPs "persona non grata" if authority is not restored to the local councils in line with a 2008 ordinance passed by the caretaker government. The chairmen have demanded cancellation of the much-debated Upazila Parishad Act 2009, passed by parliament on Apr 6, that restored powers of MPs over the councils and made it mandatory for chairmen to accept MP recommendations as ex-officio advisers to the country's 481 upazila parishad. "The new law must be amended to allow the upazila system to function," Muhibur Rahman, chairman of Sylhet Bishwanath Upazila, told a press conference in Dhaka on Wednesday. "We will carry on a legal battle with this aim. We will put pressure on the government," said Muhibur who heads the newly formed pressure group The head of the 'upazila chairman and vice chairman forum' said making MPs' advice "compulsory" was against the constitution. "Development of the country will undoubtedly be hampered if the autonomous upazila system is forced under the wings of parliament," said another chairman attending the conference. "We cannot allow it to happen," he said. A number of chairmen and vice chairmen attended the press conference. bdnews24.com/sm/a
