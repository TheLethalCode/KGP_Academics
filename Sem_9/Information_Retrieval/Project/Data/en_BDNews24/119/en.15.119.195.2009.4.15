 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com) - An umpire was allegedly assaulted by a coach during a match between Discovery Cricket Academy and Kishore Sangha in the Under-16 Private Academy Cup at the T&T ground in Mohakhali on Wednesday. After being heard shouting abuse, coach Shahjahan Saju of Discovery allegedly entered the playing area and punched umpire Alamgir Siddique. The incident happened after Himel, a Discovery cricketer, came out to bat but the umpire did not allow him citing that he could only do so after one hour and 10 minutes or if five wickets fell as Himel had spent the same amount of time outside the field. "We received the umpires' report and will sit on Thursday to discuss how to take punitive action so that this type of incident never happens in future," said Aminul Islam Moni, the chairman of the BCB Game Development Committee. bdnew
