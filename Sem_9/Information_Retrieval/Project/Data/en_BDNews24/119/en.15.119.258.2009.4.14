 Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain lambasted the law minister on Tuesday for his comments on serving an eviction notice on BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, and dubbed his speech out of turn. He said the matter would be resolved in court. "The minister's words were illegal and unlawful. It was implied in his words that they are set to oust Khaleda Zia from her legal home by force. People will not allow this to happen," Delwar told reporters at his residence at Armanitola in the city. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters Monday that Khaleda would be served notice within the week from the relevant ministry to vacate the cantonment house. "If she does not leave the house according to the terms of the notice, legal action will be taken," Shafiq had said. "The government has turned a non-issue into an issue by taking the decision to cancel the lease on Khaleda Zia's legal house," said Delwar. "Instead of using force, you better go to the court. The matter can be resolved there," said the BNP leader. "You must leave the path of revenge to make democracy work," he said. The decision to cancel the lease was taken in a cabinet meeting on April 8. bdnew
