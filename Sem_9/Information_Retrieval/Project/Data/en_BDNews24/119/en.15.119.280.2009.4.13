 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com) Director of Kolkata Knight Riders Joy Bhattacharya on Monday ruled any uncertainty over Mashrafee Bin Mortaza's agreement with the club despite signing no deal yet. Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan's side has bought Bangladesh pace spearhead at $6 lakh from the players' auction of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which begins on April 18 in South Africa. Having played a practice match in Bloemfontein recently, Mashrafee expressed his concern over the agreement as the Kolkata Knight Riders had yet to complete the deal. "The contract is as good as signed," Joy told bdnews24.com on Monday by phone from Bloemfontein when his attention was drawn to Mashrafee's remarks. Replying to a query, Joy said, "It is our commitment. You know the auction was watched by the people over the world and his money was ensured as soon as we won him from the auction. According to the tournament's rules and regulations, we must pay all to Mashrafee." The KKR director said that they would sign the deal as soon as their accountant reached South Africa. "Our accountant has yet to reach here (Bloemfontein) from Mumbai and we will complete the deal officially after his arrival," said Joy adding that they would release a statement to end the misunderstanding. bdnew
