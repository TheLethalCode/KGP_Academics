<TITLE> Moldovan president calls for election recount </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHISINAU, April 10 (Reuters) - Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin called on Friday for a recount of an election after violent protests by protesters who say the vote was rigged. Opposition parties said the president's offer, on grounds that it would help restore calm, was meaningless and intended to distract attention from mass fraud on voters' lists. The parties have demanded a new election. Voronin, Europe's only ruling communist, asked the Constitutional Court to rule on a recount of Sunday's vote. The court is dominated by his supporters and very likely to agree. "I, as chairman of the party which gained undoubted victory in the fair and democratic contest, approach the Constitutional Court for a clear decision on the need for a full recount of the votes cast in the parliamentary election," Voronin said. "A full recount ... would be an important argument for the restoration of political stability, peace and mutual confidence in the Moldovan Republic," he said in the request, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. Thousands of demonstrators looted and set fire to the parliament and the president's offices in the capital Chisinau on Tuesday in the worst violence to sweep the city in decades. Voronin accused neighboring European Union member Romania of trying to stage a coup as part of a plan to annex Moldova, with which it shares ethnic and language ties. He expelled its ambassador and denied entry to a score of Romanian journalists. The Central Election Commission this week confirmed results showing Voronin's party winning nearly half the vote -- a ruling that implied there would be no recount as the opposition sought. The results gave the Communists just short of 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 101-member assembly -- one short of the number needed to ensure victory for the party's candidate when the assembly elects the president. RECOUNT Eight of the nine court judges in the Constitutional Court were appointed under Voronin. Opponents said the vote recount proposal was an attempt to mask fraud on electoral lists. They say thousands of dead people and Moldovans who work abroad were included on the lists and had votes cast in their names. "This is a trick to draw attention from fraud on the voter lists," said Serafim Urecheanu, leader of Our Moldova, one of three opposition parties to win seats in the election. He said the authorities were stopping opposition parties from checking the electoral lists although the Election Commission granted them access to the lists earlier in the week. After demonstrations 10,000-strong on Monday and Tuesday, only about 100 protesters stood outside the government building on Friday. Many held daffodils described as symbols of peace and spring. Dozens of riot police stood behind the building. "No one told me to protest," said Vasile, a middle-aged teacher. "I just came here because I felt so strongly about this. The nation was deceived." Moldova's opposition parties have tried to distance themselves from Tuesday's violence and some opposition leaders have accused the authorities of being behind it. Voronin has been in power since 2001 and his second and last presidential term is about to end. He cannot seek a third consecutive term under constitutional limits. But he has made it clear he wants to stay close to power and become a "Moldovan Deng Xiaoping," a reference to the late Chinese leader who continued to wield huge influence in China after stepping down from top official posts.
