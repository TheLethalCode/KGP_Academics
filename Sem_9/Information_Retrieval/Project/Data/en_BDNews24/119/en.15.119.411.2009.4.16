 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com) - The CID interrogated six serving navy officers Wednesday in connection with the notorious 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in Chittagong, the investigation officer said. "The six officers were deputed to the Chittagong region coastguard at the time of the seizure at CUFL jetty," CID senior assistant superintendent Moniruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. Of the officers, two are now in Dhaka and four others in Chittagong, he said. But he did not reveal their names. Moniruzzaman said they were grilled about the coastguard's role during the offloading of the arms on Apr 1 2004. He did not say what information, if any, the officers divulged. He said the six were the first of 38 former coastguard officers summoned by CID. Two accused Din Mohammad and Hafiz, who are now in jail, had previously "confessed" to the investigators that several coastguard officers abetted them in offloading arms at the CUFL jetty. The 38 were called on the basis of the confessions, the investigation officer said. On Apr 13, the CID petitioned a Chittagong court seeking five days to grill former CUFL managing director Mohsin Talukdar and former general manager Enamul Haque for a second time. The remand hearing may be held Thursday, investigation officer said. b
