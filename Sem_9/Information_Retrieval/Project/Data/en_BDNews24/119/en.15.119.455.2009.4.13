 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)Rights group Drishtipat held a colourful rally in Dhaka on Saturday to promote the dignity of women and the rights of pedestrians in the streets of the city. Titled 'Ey Poth Amadero' ('The roads belongs to us too'), the rally, attracting people from different backgrounds and professions, started off at the National Museum premises and ended at Shahid Minar. Coach of the national women's cricket team Farida Akhter, who joined the rally with her entire squad, said "Such events should not be a one time event." Highlighting the presence of many youngsters in the rally, executive director of Manusher Jonno Shaheen Anam said, "We are very glad to pass the torch of social movement to the younger generation". The rally was followed by a lively concert at the Rabindra Shorobor where leading women singers performed for the cause in front of an audience of 10,000. It was kicked off by short speeches from Drishtipat executive director Asif Saleh, organiser of the event and Drishtipat director Iffat Nawaz, journalist Munni Saha, garments workers organiser Najma Akhter. Iffat spoke of the problems she faced in the streets of Dhaka after moving back from Washington DC and said that she would consider this event a success if it makes even two men think twice before harassing another woman on the street. Munni Saha recalled her experiences reporting from the streets and called for a united social understanding on the issue of dignity for women in the streets.
