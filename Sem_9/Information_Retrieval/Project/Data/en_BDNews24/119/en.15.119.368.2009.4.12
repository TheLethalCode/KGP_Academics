 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission chief says they will respond to the accusations of contempt of parliament and the constitution after it receives letter from the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings.. Acting ACC chairman Habibur Rahman told journalists Sunday evening they were yet to be formally made known of the charges. The parliamentary watchdog declared former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, former secretary Md Delwar Hossain and two commissioners "in contempt of parliament and the constitution" for refusing to appear before it Sunday. "We do not have any knowledge about it formally. Let the letter come first, then the explanation will be given. But the commission sticks to its decision to not attend the meeting." "The commission is obliged to respond to the president and none else. Moreover, the commission is not on the list of the government establishments over which the watchdog has authority," Rahman argued. The government sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members on Apr 5 to attend Sunday's meeting. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties. The ACC was asked to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. Former ACC secretary Hossain, now land secretary, refused the summons in writing. "As the Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution, it is not proper to summon me as its secretary," Delwar told reporters last week. Former ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud also reportedly refused in writing, but made no public statement. b
