 PARIS, April 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux took over from Olympique Lyon at the top of Ligue 1 on goal difference with a 2-0 win at mid-table AJ Auxerre on Saturday. Bordeaux, who notched a fourth win in a row with goals by Brazilians Fernando and Wendel, lead the table on 59 points with seven games left. "We are on a good course, we played a very solid game today but we are not going to talk or even think about the title until the result of our game against Lyon next week," Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh told French radio RMC. Seven-times champions Lyon will have an opportunity to reclaim top spot before travelling to Bordeaux when they host Monaco on Sunday (1900 GMT). Olympique Marseille, third on 58 points, will also play on Sunday, at home against Grenoble (1500). Toulouse defeated lowly Nantes 1-0 to climb to fourth place on 56 points thanks to Ligue 1 top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac, who took his tally to 19 with a 25-metre, left-footed shot that went in off the post. Lille and Paris St Germain, fifth and sixth on 55 points, will face each other on Sunday (1645). At the other end of the table, in the last game scheduled on Saturday, former greats St Etienne suffered a 1-0 defeat to Stade Rennes. France's most successful club with 10 league titles and a European Cup final in 1976 to their credit, are second from bottom, two points adrift of Caen, winners 2-1 at relegation-bound Le Havre. Nantes, who have won eight titles, the last one in 2001, are third from bottom one point ahead of St Etie
