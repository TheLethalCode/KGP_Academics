<TITLE> Recession policy must include poor: WB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank has stressed the need to continue targeting poverty in the face of the global recession, saying the government's economic measures to mitigate its impact must not leave the poor out of the picture. On recent demands for bailout packages from businesses, the lending agency expressed concern Monday that they may not protect the most needy. "Whatever policy package the government designs, protecting the poor through new job creation and adequate well-targeted safety net programmes should remain the highest priority," said WB country director Xian Zhu at a press conference in the city. Monday's press conference launched the "Bangladesh: State of the Economy and Policy Response to the Global Economic Crisis" report to provide an update on developments since late-November. Replying to a query, Zhu said that Bangladesh needs to carry out the "largely unfinished reform agenda" to achieve the much-cited goal of becoming a middle-income state. Job creation, social security measures An extra one million new jobs may be needed to offset the effects of the world recession. "At least 2 to 2.5 million new local jobs will be needed until the global economy recovers, compared to 1.1 million job creation prior to the crisis, " WB senior economist Zahid Hussain told newsmen. WB also suggested continuing to strengthen the social safety net and increasing maintenance spending. Stable, but still susceptible The Bangladeshi economy is currently stable but is vulnerable as the global economic slowdown threatens exports and remittances, says the bank. "The economy is stronger compared to other countries in the region, but this can't be taken for granted," said Hussain. He said that the improved foreign exchange reserve and sound exchange rate shows that the economy is quite strong. "Also export and remittance inflow still continue to be strong." But recession in the developed markets and slowdown in the Middle East has already begun to pose threat to investment, exports and remittance inflows, he added. 30 pc decline in capital machinery import Citing a 30 percent decline in capital machinery import, Hussain said there may have been a significant slowdown in investments. "Imports of construction material have also seen cuts...then again part of this decline reflects a fall in prices also," said Hussain. Touching on impacts of the global crisis, he said export, remittance, revenue and banking sector along with employment would be affected. The bank recommended avoiding increase in tariffs and subsidies in specific industries and setting interest rate ceilings as effective policy responses. Time for strategy The country can afford to be more strategic responding to the crisis, says the multilateral lending agency. "Bangladesh is still not hit hard and has more time to anticipate effects than developed and other emerging nations," said Hussain. The Bank projects that so far economic growth is on track to achieve 5.5 percent in FY 09. However, in a worst-case scenariothat is, a collapse in export and remittance in the last quarter of FY 09it could be as low as 4.5 percent. Hussain said that the inflation rate of 6.1 percent in January this year, was quite satisfactory due to the falling prices of commodities in the international market. On agriculture, the WB official said that farm output might reach a historic turnover with the strong growth in rice production. "Livestock and fisheries are also reported to be doing well."
