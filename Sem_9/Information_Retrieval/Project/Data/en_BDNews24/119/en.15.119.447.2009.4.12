 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)US secretary of state Hillary Clinton sent greetings on Sunday ahead of Pahela Boishakh, the Bengali New Year. "Shubho Nobo Borsho," said Clinton in a statement released by the local American Centre. "I send greetings to all around the world who are observing Pahela Boishakh, the New Year festivities celebrated by those who share common Bengali cultural and linguistic traditions." "As you welcome the year 1416, I salute the spirit of tolerance and shared linguistic and cultural heritage that brings so many together, regardless of religion or nationality, to usher in a new year with music, drama, and traditional foods," said Clinton, who has personally visited Bangladesh twice in the past. "As the world faces the greatest economic challenges in generations, we all must stand together to embrace the New Year's promise of rebirth and renewal." "It is our shared hope for the future - our shared dream of a better world for our children - that brings us all together to celebrate our common humanity," she said.
