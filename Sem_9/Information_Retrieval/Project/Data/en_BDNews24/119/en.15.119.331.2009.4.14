 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)Pahela Baishakh saw the first broad gauge train, the Silk City Express from Rajshahi, arriving at Kamalapur Station in the heart of the capital. "Even a couple of years back, broad gauge trains coming into Kamalapur station was unthinkable," Md Belayet Hossain, the railway's director general told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. The people of Rajshahi have had to wait 147 years, since the introduction of railway in Bengal by the British in 1862, to reach Dhaka direct. The Bangla New Year has come to have a special significance for Bangladesh Railway. Last year on this day, the Maitree Express, the first direct passenger train service between Dhaka and Kolkata in over 40 years, made its first journey. Last New Year also saw broad gauge trains from northern Rajshahi and southwestern Khulna reach the Cantonment Station, still some 11 kilometres off the city centre, for the first time. This year, the Silk City Express chugged direct into the city centre at 1.30pm with 529 passengers on board. Communications minister Syed Abdul Hossain formally inaugurated the new service at Kamalapur Station, while crowds of onlookers and railway officials greeted the passengers. The train left again for Rajshahi at 2.40pm. However, most trains from Rajshahi and Khulna divisions, the Railway's West Zone, still cannot make it to Kamalapur Station owing to difference in gauge. The West Zone runs on broad gauge lines while East Zone, comprising Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, run on narrow metre gauge lines. Since 2000, the authorities turned Dhaka's metre gauge into dual gauge making it fit for the movement of both metre and broad gauge trains. An additional director general TA Chowdhury said operating from Kamalapur station would reduce the hassle of getting transport into the city proper. "Passengers find it difficult to get taxis or buses at the station owing to its location," he told bdnews24.com. Quazi Asadullah Another director general of the railway said by June-July all broad gauge trains coming from Rajshahi and Khulna would come to Kamalapur after the completion of signalling works. "At present, only the Silk City will ply between Rajashahi and Kamalapur," he told bdnews24.com. Railway officials say one of the major problems was the national railway network was not originally centred around Dhaka. The British rulers set up the railways in Bengal with all lines concentrated around the Indian city of Kolkata, the capital of the then undivided Bengal. The rail network remained relatively unchanged up to the late 1990s. Since then successive governments finally took initiatives to rehaul the rail system to serve Dhaka better.
