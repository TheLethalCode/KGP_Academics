<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to deter recurrent trouble on the campus, prime minister Sheikh Hasina has warned Bangladesh Chhatra League leadership of a possible five years in jail for creating trouble. She issued the warning when the leaders of beleaguered student front of the ruling Awami League that she heads went to her official residence at noon Tuesday to greet her on Bengali New Year, a BCL joint secretary, Ripon Poddar, told bdnews24.com. President Mahmud Hasan Ripon and general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton led a 35-strong team to see Hasina. The president and general secretary of the organisation's Dhaka University unit were also in the team. Iqbal Mahmud Bablu, another joint secretary, quoted Hasina as saying that the punishment can be a five-year jail sentence, if necessary. But those who will do a good job will be rewarded. "Those involved in conspiracies will be given exemplary punishment," Hasina was quoted as further saying. The prime minister said those who fuelled campus unrest will have to pay dearly. Hasina stepped aside from the ceremonial post of the BCL's organising leader on April 4 after a spate of violence by the adherents after the Dec 29 general election that the Awami League swept. Two top BCL leaders claimed to have met with Hasina on April 10. The organising secretary of the BCL's central committee, Ashrafur Rahman, and the international affairs secretary, Sohel Rana Mithu, were arrested by RAB at Moghbazar at 2:30am on April 12 on charges of upsetting academic atmosphere. bd
