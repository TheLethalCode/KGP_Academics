 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Monday recommended increasing the salaries and benefits of 51,000 employees of four state-owned banks in line with pay packages given by private banks. The parliamentary standing committee on finance also asked the external resources division (ERD) to procure as much as possible in foreign loans in the face of global recession to implement development projects in power and infrastructure. "After corporatisation, the chief executives of the four state-owned banks get several lakhs of taka as salaries but the employees don't gate paid in that proportion," committee chairman AHM Mustofa Kamal told bdnews24.com after a meeting. "All employees irrespective of status should also get good compensation packages consistent with the private banks." But the chairman could not figure out how much additional money would be needed for such a scheme. The government in 2007 corporatised the three state-owned banksSonali, Janata and Agranito create equal opportunities for all state-owned and private banks, as per the prescription of donor agencies. Rupali Bank was already corporatised. "The basic reason for corporatisation is to provide better service and earn more profit," said Kamal. He said employees should have performance targets like the private banks. The additional amount needed for their pay packages would be generated by motivating the employees and raising profit margins, he said. Sonali Bank has 22,000, Janata Bank 14,000, Agrani Bank 11,000 and Rupali Bank 4,000 employees. "Private banks are making huge profits and if performance targets are fixed for employees of the four banks, they can also generate more earnings," Kamal said. He said the finance ministry would formulate guidelines for a uniform compensation package for the four banks. The committee would implement its recommendation through the ministry as the finance minister was also a member of the standing committee, said Kamal. "It will not be a difficult task," he said. The chairman said his committee also recommended that all the 40 state-owned companies should be flaoted as soon as possible. "Companies like the Titas Gas, Jumana Multipurpose Bridge, Padma Oil, Eastern Lubricants, Telephone Shilpa Shangstha, Karnaphuli Paper Mills and others should offload their shares," the chairman said. Shares of state-owned banks and government-owned insurance companiesSadharan Bima and Jiban Bimashould also be offloaded, he said. 'Secure foreign loans' "We have asked the ERD to secure as much foreign assistance as possible as the internal revenue target of Tk 54,000 crore for the current fiscal might not be achieved," said Kamal. "The NBR may not be able to achieve its revenue target due to the global financial crisis". "The size of the annual development programme in the next will be bigger. So, we need more money from external sources, especially for financing power and infrastructure projects," he said. Kamal said Bangladesh could get a big share from the IMF's $50 billion fund committed to help developing countries face the global crisis. "In the same way, we can get a share of a similar ($17 billion) fund created by Japan for Asian countries affected by the crisis," he said. Bangladesh received over $1 billion as foreign assistance in the first nine months of the current fiscal against its target of $1.8 billion. Committee members Syed Ali Ahsraf, M K Anwar, Mayeedul Islam, Tajul Islam and M A Mannan attended Monday's meeting.
