 NEW YORK, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Baseball fans have long feasted on peanuts and hot dogs when enjoying America's "national pastime." But the new Yankee Stadium is adding tofu, calamari, edamame and taralli to the menu. A distinctly international flavor representing New York's ethnic melting pot runs through the 100-odd culinary items that will be for sale on Thursday when the New York Yankees play their first regular season game at their new home.

More than 60 percent of spectators buy hot dogs, officials said. "If you offer variety, people won't stop eating hot dogs. They'll eat a hot dog and something else," said Marty Greenspun, Legends president. A typical baseball season will see enough hot dogs sold to stretch some 300 miles, Legends officials said.
