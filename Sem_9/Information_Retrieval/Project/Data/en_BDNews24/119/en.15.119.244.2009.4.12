<TITLE> Open shut mills, make them profit: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the industries ministry to open shut state-owned mills and make them profit-making enterprises. She told the officials to revive Chittagong Chemical Industries and Khulna Newsprint Mill and said her administration wanted to build industries on private-public partnership. "It beats me if the mills and industries in the private sector can make money then why the state-owned mills cannot profit despite having all facilities," she said at a meeting at the ministry Sunday. She said her previous 1996-2001 government had faced pressure from the donors to privatise all state-owned mills. "There were talks of shutting down Adamjee Jute Mills, Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory, Khulna Shipyard and BRTC. We handed Machine Tools Factory to the army and the shipyard to the navy. Both institutes are now doing well." She referred to the changing scenario of world economy and said industries should be built by the government as well as private entrepreneurs to rev up and regulate economy. She emphasised on reviving Chittagong and Khulna as industrial hubs by setting up more mills and industries. On modernisation of Mongla Port, the prime minister said, "Nepal will also be able to use this port and we will reap economic benefits." She said the market for goods manufactured by local industries would not be created as long as the people did not have increased purchasing power. She asked officials to import sugar and lentils through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, elevate Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute to international standards, to keep the retirement age for mill workers at 60. "I hear that a plan has been taken to curtail the labourers' retirement age to 57 from 60. There can be no reason to do that while the average age has increased, skills have improved, and there is a demand everywhere to increase the retirement age. I think it should be 60," she said. She said optimum production cannot be expected from labourers if their food and accommodation cannot be ensured. Earlier, industries minister Dilip Barua briefed her on his ministry's moves to deal with the aftermaths of economic recession. bd
