 ROME, April 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlo Ancelotti on Friday refused to comment on media reports that he had agreed to become Chelsea's manager next season, but inferred that he planned to stay at AC Milan. "(Milan chief executive Adriano) Galliani spoke clearly during the week and I don't think it's necessary to add anything," Ancelotti told a news conference when asked about the reports. On Wednesday, Galliani denied speculation that Milan were looking to hire Cagliari boss Massimiliano Allegri, saying the club and Ancelotti were tied by a contract running until June 2010. "Allegri has the capabilities to train any team. But if he wants to train here, I think he'll have to wait," Ancelotti added. The 49-year-old coach has repeatedly said he intends to serve out his contract after being made favourite to succeed interim manager Guus Hiddink at Chelsea and being linked to Real Madrid if Florentino Perez becomes club president again. Third-placed Milan are 14 points behind Serie A leaders Inter and Ancelotti has been told by club bosses that third spot is a minimum requirement this term. Ancelotti, Serie A's longest-serving manager having been appointed in 2001, led Milan to European Cup triumphs in 2003 and 2007 but has captured only one league title, in 2004
