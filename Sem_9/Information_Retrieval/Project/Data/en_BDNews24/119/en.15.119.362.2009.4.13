 BUENOS AIRES, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sporting Cristal striker Flavio Maestri was jeered off by his team's supporters after scoring in a 5-0 Peruvian championship win over Coronel Bolognesi. Barcelona held on for 13 minutes of stoppage-time to beat South American champions LDU 2-1 in Ecuador and former Colombia coach Hernan Dario Gomez quit Bogota club Santa Fe after being insulted during another defeat. PERU Maestri, 36, failed to placate the fans despite scoring his first home goal since rejoining Cristal this season. The former Peru forward's 90th-minute goal was greeted with jeers and members of the hardcore supporters group continued to insult him when he left the field. The player known as "The Tank" helped Cristal win three successive domestic titles in the 1990s before joining arch-rivals Alianza Lima and he has never been forgiven by some supporters. "I'm not bothered by this, I work for Cristal and it's the club which pays me," he said in a television interview. Provincial club Juan Aurich went top of the championship's first stage, beating previous leaders Universitario 2-0 with goals from Edinson Chara and Sergio Ibarra. ECUADOR Barcelona, the country's most popular club, hung on for only their third win of the season. Narciso Mina headed Barcelona ahead in the 26th minute but Claudio Bieler pounced on poor defending to level. Pablo Palacios had a penalty saved by Jose Cevallos but the hosts regained the lead through Raul Roman. The referee added on 14 minutes of stoppage-time after Barcelona goalkeeper Maximo Banguera was twice treated for cramp. COLOMBIA Gomez, who coached Colombia at the 1998 World Cup and led Ecuador to their first finals in 2002, quit Santa Fe after a 3-2 home defeat by Quindio left them 11th in the Apertura championship. "I'm not a coach who wants to be badly treated and insulted," he said. "I've coached a lot and I've always been respected." Gomez had been in charge for 29 matches. La Equidad pulled off the weekend's most impressive win when they came from 3-1 down at Pereira to win 5-3 despite finishing with nine men. Diego Cochas scored twice for La Equidad while Wilson Carpintero, Efrain Viafara and Victor Giraldo shared the other goals. Hugo Soto was sent off in the 40th minute for a bad tackle and Dawling Leudo also saw red. Deportes Tolima, who nearly dropped out of the championship because of financial problems, stayed top with a 1-1 draw against Boyaca Chico. CHILE Champions Colo Colo slumped to their fourth successive league defeat when they lost 2-0 to Nublense and dropped to 15th in the Apertura championship. Renato Ramos scored both goals and Colo Colo had Roberto Cereceda sent off. Universidad de Chile lost their unbeaten record when they went down 3-1 at Santiago Morning and Union Espanola extended their lead to seven points by beating O'Higgins 2-1. PARAGUAY Cerro Porteno thrashed bottom club 3 de Febrero 4-1 to stay top of the Apertura championship with 21 points from eight games. Jorge Britez, Javier Villarreal, Pablo Noguera and Luis Caceres scored for Pedro Troglio's team. BOLIVIA Real Potosi stayed top of the Apertura championship despite losing 4-2 at Universitario de Sucre while The Strongest thrashed bottom club Real Mamore 6-0 for their best win of the season
