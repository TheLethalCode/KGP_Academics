 NEW DELHI, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa off-spinner Johan Botha has been reported a second time for having a suspect bowling action, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday. The 26-year-old was reported by the umpires over his quick and doosra deliveries following the hosts' win over Australia in the fourth one-dayer in Port Elizabeth on Monday. The doosra spins away from a right-handed batsman rather than into him as a conventional off-break delivery does. Botha, who was reported for chucking in 2006, will undergo an independent analysis of his action by the ICC's panel of human movement specialists. The process should be completed in five weeks. If Botha is found to have bowled with an illegal action, he will be suspended from bowling in international cricket. Botha, who has played 45 one-dayers and two tests, was also reported for a suspect action in January 2006 and suspended from bowling. He underwent remedial work and his action was found to be legal, allowing him to resume playing international cricket
