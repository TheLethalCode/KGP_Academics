 HONG KONG, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Hong Kong student union is holding a student vote on whether China should apologize for its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananamen Square 20 years ago in which hundreds were killed. While China has tried to whitewash any commemoration or mention of June 4, formerly British-ruled Hong Kong has remained the only city on Chinese soil where annual June 4 vigils, remembrances and protests are tolerated.

The vote comes amid recent signs of on-campus tensions in Hong Kong between democratic-minded students and conservative elements wanting to tone down the criticism of Beijing, particularly among students from mainland China.

Forums leading up to June 4 have also been proven divisive with mainland students booed when expressing views closely aligned with the Communist Party, namely that the crackdown was necessary to maintain stability. "Hong Kong is a place in China where people can still openly remember June 4th," said Li Yiu-kee, a student and committee member of the Hong Kong Alliance in support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China which organizes a mass candlelight vigil each year in a downtown park. "If Hong Kong students in trying to use democratic means to express their views on June 4th have these actions come under intimidation or threats, it's very important that the government protects this right," he told Reu
