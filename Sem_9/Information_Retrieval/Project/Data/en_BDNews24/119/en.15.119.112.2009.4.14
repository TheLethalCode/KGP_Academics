<TITLE> Saudi Arabia to regulate girls' marriages </TITLE>

 RIYADH, Tue Apr 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to regulate the marriages of young girls, its justice minister was quoted as saying on Tuesday, after a court refused to nullify the marriage of an 8-year-old to a man 50 years her senior. The justice ministry aims "to put an end to arbitrariness by parents and guardians in marrying off minor girls," Justice Minister Mohamed al-Issa told al-Watan newspaper, partially owned by members of the royal family.

"Some (clerics) will be against this (plan) but the justice minister is also a cleric and a member of the kingdom's top clerics body." Many young girls in Arab countries that observe tribal traditions are married to older husbands but not before puberty. Such marriages are also driven by poverty in countries like Yemen, one of the poorest countries outside Africa. The UN children's agency UNICEF expressed on Monday its "deep concern" over the Onaiza court ruling. "Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights," UNICEF's chief, Ann Veneman, said in a state
