 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com) Work on elevated highway up to Gazipur, Tongi and Narayanganj will begin this year to ease tailbacks in capital Dhaka and its fringes, prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced Wednesday. She broke the news at a meeting with the representatives of the executive committee of Dhaka-based reporters' forum Dhaka Reporters Unity. Hasina spoke about plans to construct ring road and sky train and develop water routes to resolve traffic snarls. Steps for recession Hasina said a taskforce has been formed and grains have been stored to deal with the aftermaths of the global economic downturn. She observed that the price of essentials was within the reach of the people. The price of the rice being rationed has been decreased more and low-price rationing of staples for the police and ready-made garment workers is being arranged, Hasina said. Crisis and continuation The prime minister said lack of running water and electricity were 'big problems' the country was reeling under because the BNP-led coalition government halted projects her past 1996-2001 administration had taken. She said if the schemes of one government is not continued with and stopped by the next, these problems will creep up. "We had installed Sayedabad water treatment plant and planned to make another treatment plant at Pagla. But the alliance government shut down that project. Had they implemented the project there would not be a water crisis," she said. Hasina was surprised that power outages were happening for hours on end and supply got interrupted every now and then. She suggested that if people were told beforehand about the timing and area of outages they could finish their job in time. "The same thing happened when we took office in 1996. The BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government spent Tk 20,000 on the power sector but add not a single watt of electricity." She alleged that the money was misappropriated through corruption. The prime minister said her government has moved to import electricity from Bhutan and spoke of plans for hydroelectricity, solar and wind power to feed into the national grid. "We made a policy to add to gas and electricity production to meet increasing demand. But problem began when that was not followed," she said, referring to the failure of the BNP-led coalition government to raise gas production. She talked about the plans of her government to boost gas production and develop health, education, telecommunications, information technology services. The prime minister said her administration will develop the sport sector and stressed on elections to the sports federations to let competent people lead the sport sector and facilitate democratic environment. Measures for reporters The DRU delegation, led by its president Shamim Ahmed and general secretary Pothik Saha, sought her assistance in implementing plans for the development of the organisation. She pledged Tk 20 lakh in assistance and treatment of reporters in public hospitals on a priority basis. She also instructed officials to see the condition of the plot of the DRU office of. In addition, the prime minister shared her thoughts about building flats and selling those on a hire-purchase scheme to resolve the housing problem of reporters. Textiles support Earlier in the morning, a 37-strong team of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) led by president Abdul Hi Sarkar met with the prime minister at her office. They handed a cheque of Tk 51 lakh to her for the family members of army officers who died in February mutiny by BDR men at Peelkhana. They sought her government's support to save the export-focused textiles industry from global recession. Hasina assured them of the support and said in 1996 her government set up backward linkage industry and arranged for GSP facility for the development of textiles sector. She said her government wants to build mills on public-private partnership. When the textile mill owners asked for uninterrupted power and gas supply she said her administration was trying to resolve the crisis. The delegation presented a crest to the prime minister. Prime minister's finance adviser Mashiur Rahman, press secretary Abul Kalam Azad and industrialist Salman F Rahman were present there. bd
