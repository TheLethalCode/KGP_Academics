 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Bangladesh College of Leather Technology blockaded the Zigatola crossing in Dhanmondi on Saturday to press home demands, which they said had been "repeatedly ignored" by college authorities. Scores of protesting students gathered at the crossing from their Hazaribagh campus, blocking it to traffic, at around 10:45am. Police, charging with batons, managed to clear the road at around midday, though the angry students did not disperse. They were still demonstrating and shouting slogans there an hour later. Chased by the police, students smashed a number of vehicles and a business premise. Third year student Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com they had repeatedly notified their demands to the principal. "But he ignored them," said the student. They placed their demands to the college authority most recently on April 5, but the authority took no steps, he said. The students' demands include awarding the students engineering degrees under the engineering and technology faculty of Dhaka University, relocation of the exam centre to the college campus, keeping form fees within Tk 5,000 and hold exams on schedule. bdne
