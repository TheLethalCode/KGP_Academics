 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion arrested two members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League's central committee early hours Monday for "disrupting educational activities at Dhaka University", an official said. RAB director, legal and media wing, AK Azad, told bdnews24.com the elite force picked up organising secretary Ashraful Rahman and international affairs secretary Sohel Rana Mithu from the city's Moghbazar area at around 2:30am. "They have been arrested in connection with the disruption of educational activities and educational environment at Dhaka University," said Azad. The pro-Awami League BCL has been heavily condemned for violent clashes over campus control that forced temporarily closures of a number of universities and colleges countrywide since the new government came to power in January. Prime minister and AL chief Sheikh Hasina withdrew as BCL's organisational head earlier this month in the wake of mounting violence, seen as a move to sever AL's and Hasina's ties with the unruly student body. The party also issued a stern warning, saying law enforcers had been instructed to take the strongest action against violence and extortion by student leaders and activists. AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam said "none, not BCL activists or any others, would be spared if they were involved in such crimes".
