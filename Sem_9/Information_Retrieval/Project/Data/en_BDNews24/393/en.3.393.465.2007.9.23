 BHOPAL, India, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian opposition leader LK Advani on Sunday urged his party to prepare for an early election, saying the government was a in a state of paralysis. Advani, winding up a meeting of his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's national executive, said: "No astrologer is needed to predict the direction in which it (India) is set to move." "The direction is early Lok Sabha (lower house) elections. How early is now the only question that remains unanswered," he told the meeting in the central city of Bhopal. Though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration has a mandate until 2009, Advani said the government was in paralysis because of problems with its coalition partners and supporters. Left parties, which provide the Congress-led coalition with a parliamentary majority from outside the bloc, oppose a nuclear energy deal with the United States and have threatened to walk away if steps are taken to finalise the pact. "The government seems hell-bent on going ahead with the nuclear deal. This is simply unacceptable. Everybody knows the government has no mandate in parliament to operationalise (the) deal," Advani told the party faithful. He urged colleagues to show unity and discipline. Frontrunner to be the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Advani said the party opposed a deal that was unequal and would subordinate India to the United States. A row over a court affidavit issued by the government, and later withdrawn, which questioned the existence of some Hindu gods has dragged in another of Singh's allies and sparked some violence. The document related to plans to bore a shipping canal through a bridge-like stretch of sandbanks and rocks between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. Many Hindus oppose the project, believing the structure to be built millennia ago by Lord Ram, an important diety, and his army of monkeys to rescue his kidnapped wife. Advani demanded the prime minister apologise to the nation for this "blasphemy", and attacked the administration over its failure to track those responsible for a series of bomb blasts and protect the poor from rising prices. But the key question of who would lead the party at any new polls was not openly discussed. Since a shock 2004 election defeat, the pro-free market BJP has appeared divided, rudderless and bereft of a clear strategy. The party rose to prominence in the early 1990s on the back of a Hindu revivalist movement, and ruled India from 1998 to 2004. It moderated its hardline rhetoric in a bid to expand its base, but has since failed to define an alternative political identity. Many blame the lack of a strong leader, and opinion polls show the ruling coalition ahead. BJP president Rajnath Singh was appointed as a consensus candidate nearly two years ago to resolve a split between hardline Hindu nationalists and a more pragmatic wing. Former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is the party's most popular figure, but he is now seen as too old and frail to play a robust leadership role. Despite saying in a letter read in Bhopal he was recovering from illness and would be back in active politics soon, his days at the top may be over. The party's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has reservations about Advani's new moderate image but no viable alternatives. When asked about the party's candidate for prime minister, Rajnath Singh told reporters they would "not be kept in the dark" and a candidate would be named before the first votes were ca
