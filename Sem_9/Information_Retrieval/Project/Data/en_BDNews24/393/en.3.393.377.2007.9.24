 HONG KONG, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading Asia-Pacific stock index hit a record high on Monday as shares took their cue from gains on US markets late last week, though trading was light due to holidays in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The euro rose to an all-time high against the dollar of $1.4130 as the US currency extended its sell-off since the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cut last week. Gold firmed to near a 28-year high, while oil eased. European stocks looked set to open fairly flat with the stronger currency and lower energy prices weighing on exporters and oil producers. German government bond futures started the session weaker. Spread betters in London expect the FTSE 100 index to open down 4 points to up 3 points, Frankfurt's DAX to open down 5 to 16 points and the CAC 40 to open unchanged to down 14 points. "Markets are still a bit edgy," said Simon Doyle, head of strategy at Schroder Investment Management. "The broader issue is still about the consequences of the credit tightening and the housing slowdown in the US and whether that flows through to the economy." MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was up 1.4 percent at 0621 GMT after touching a record high. The index has rebounded 28 percent from a trough during the market sell-off in August and is up 30 percent so far this year. MSCI's main emerging market index also racked up a fresh record high, gaining 0.8 percent to eclipse its previous peak in July. US stocks rose on Friday after robust results from software maker Oracle Corp brightened the outlook for technology, helping the Dow industrial average and the S&P 500 turn in their best weekly performance since March. The bullish tone spilled over into Australia, where the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index scored a fresh all-time high as BHP Billiton Ltd hit a record on a report it will announce an upgrade to its gold reserves, while Orica Ltd gained on a US acquisition. Markets in Hong Kong and Singapore rose 2.5 to 2.9 percent. India's main share index climbed to a fourth record high in as many sessions, as banking stocks rallied on hopes lenders may lower interest rates and boost demand for loans. The euro pushed to a high of $1.4130 on EBS, up 0.3 percent on the day and the highest since the launch of the single European currency in 1999. The move coincided with the dollar's trade-weighted index slipping to a fresh 15-year low of 78.329, near an all-time trough of 78.19 hit in 1992. Analysts said the 1992 low would provide a key test of whether the US currency's sell-off deepens or pauses. The Fed's 50-basis point cut in overnight rates last week to 4.75 percent stirred expectations for even more monetary easing that would erode the dollar's interest rate appeal compared with the euro and higher-yielding currencies. The dollar shed 0.3 percent to 115.10 yen but has rebounded from a low of 113.98 yen last week as the Japanese currency suffers from investors using it as a cheap source of funds to buy higher-yielding currencies in the carry trade. Gold also had a bullish tone after weakness in the US dollar spurred buying from investors and speculators, who believed the price could rise further as fundamentals supported the metal. Spot gold to $734.80/735.60 an ounce at 0631 GMT versus $731.60/732.40 late in New York on Friday, when it rallied to its highest since January 1980 at $739. Oil prices fell as oil and gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico restored more output after a mild storm triggered evacuation and production cuts. US crude for November delivery lost 46 cents to $81.16 a barrel by 0502 GMT to stand nearly $3 below the all-time high set by the October-month contract on Thursd
