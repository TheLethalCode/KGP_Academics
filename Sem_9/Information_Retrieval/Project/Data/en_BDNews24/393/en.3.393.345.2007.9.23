 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnew24.com) -- A Dhaka court Sunday ordered four former Chittagong Port Authority officials to jail in the GATCO scam case. Mohammad Mizanur Rahman of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka made the order at 3.00pm. Police arrested former CPA chairman ANM Shahadat Hossain, former director AM Sanwar Hossain, former chief finance and accounting officer Ahmed Abul Kashem and former CPA member Lutful Kabir. In response to an appeal by the counsels for the accused, the magistrate ordered jail authorities to give them division if their case complied with the jail code. Advocate Mohammad Aminul Haque, counsel for GATCO directors Syed Tanveer Ahmed and Syed Galib Ahmed, told bdnews24.com that their statements would be taken later under the Criminal Procedure Code. Advocate Haque added that he had so far been unable to meet his clients. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on Sept 2 with Tejgaon Police Station alleging that GATCO's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her son Arafat Rahman Coco stand accused of corruption in the case. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 in connection with the case. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Rail station. The accused awarded the tender to GATCO even though the company failed to meet all of the conditions. It is also alleged that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the GATCO deal. bdnews24.com
