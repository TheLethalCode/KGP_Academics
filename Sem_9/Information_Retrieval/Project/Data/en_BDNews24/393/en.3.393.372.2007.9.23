 NEW YORK, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There are many unanswered questions about North Korea's nuclear programs, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday ahead of fresh talks this week on ending Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Rice made the comment following media reports that a Sept. 6 Israeli air strike inside Syria may have been triggered by concerns that North Korea and Syria were cooperating on a nuclear facility. Speaking to reporters as she began a meeting in New York with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, Rice made no reference to that air strike but stressed how much the United States wishes to know about North Korea's nuclear programs. "There are, frankly, a lot of questions that remain to be answered and we want to be able to answer questions about all aspects of the North Korean program. I think that's very important," said Rice, who met Yang on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. A new round of six-party talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States to discuss ending North Korea's nuclear programs are scheduled to begin on Thursday in Beijing. North Korea, which detonated a nuclear device in October and is believed by US officials to have enough plutonium to make more than eight or nine atomic bombs, agreed in September 2005 to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs. But progress on carrying out that agreement reached in the six-party talks has been slow. Under a follow-on agreement struck on Feb. 13, North Korea agreed to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear complex and to invite international inspectors back to verify this. In exchange, the other members of the six-party talks pledged to provide it with 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil or its equivalent. NEXT PHASE OF AGREEMENT Both those steps have now been taken, leading to the next phase of the agreement, under which North Korea has committed to disable all its nuclear facilities and to provide a complete declaration of all its nuclear programs. In return, the other members of the six-party talks are to give it 950,000 tons of heavy fuel oil or its equivalent. The six-party talks this week are expected to discuss how to sequence those steps. In a sign Washington hopes to make progress, the Bush administration this month told Congress it may give North Korea $25 million worth of heavy fuel oil. Rice's comments, however, appeared to suggest that there may be doubts on the US side about whether and when North Korea may provide a full declaration of its nuclear program. The current nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula began in October 2002 when US officials said they believed North Korea had developed a uranium enrichment program, which could provide a second path to produce material for nuclear weapons in addition to its plutonium-based program. US officials then said North Korea acknowledged such a program but now say Pyongyang has gradually moved away from that acknowledgment. Washington insists that North Korea address the question of uranium enrichment under the Feb. 13 deal.
