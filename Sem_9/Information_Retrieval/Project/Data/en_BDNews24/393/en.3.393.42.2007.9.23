 NAJAF, Iraq, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A delegation from Iraq's ruling Shia alliance has met the reclusive Shia leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to discuss re-uniting the group after two parties broke away.

Sadr's supporters and Iraq's main Sunni Arab political bloc have all said they have no immediate plans to seek a vote of no confidence in Maliki's government.
