<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  Efforts are underway to bring 80 stranded workers back to Bangladesh from Malaysia as they have failed to secure work they claim they were promised. A three-member delegation headed by expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury returned from a four-day visit to Malaysia, the government said in a statement Saturday. The workers had gone on hunger strike in front of Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur before being removed by local security forces. The workers will be given fares to travel back home and allowed to keep any earnings they made, the statement said. A member of the delegation, speaking to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity, said: "The recruiting company that arranged the trip for the workers to Malaysia will make the compensation. "The firm in Malaysia that employed them will pay their salaries. However, as the workers have filed a case they will not get their salaries immediately," the delegate said. Matin Chowdhury said: "The foreign adviser has directed us to prepare a report on the matter. Nothing can be said before that." The delegation held meetings with Malaysian officials including the home minister, the home secretary and the director general of the human resources ministry. A Bangladeshi delegate said the meetings decided to ensure speedy immigration clearance for Bangladeshi workers at Kuala Lumpur airport and extend the tenure of their entry visa to two months from the current one month. bdnews24.com/
