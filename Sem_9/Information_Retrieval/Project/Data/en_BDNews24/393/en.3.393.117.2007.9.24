 LONDON, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Emerging market shares hit a record high on Monday, bounding ahead of still-jittery developed market bourses to recoup their losses from the credit crisis, while the dollar sank to another record low versus the euro. Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher and European shares eked out some gains despite worries over bank profits. Bonds prices slipped. Ripples from the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last week continued to flow across markets, building some confidence among stock investors who are still highly vulnerable to fears about a credit crunch. Stocks have been a main beneficiary of the Fed confidence- building with the major markets gaining some 4-5 percent in the week since the Fed acted. Emerging markets have gone further, with MSCI's main index of stocks on the sector hitting a record high a little over a month after plummeting on the cridit worries. It is now up 25 percent from an August 17 low. Funds have been pouring into emerging market equities in places like China, South Korea and the Middle East, attracted by strong profits and reassured somewhat about liquidity. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan also touched a record high and is up 30 percent so far this year. The ebullience did not carry over into Europe, however, where worries about the fall out from the subprime, or riskier, mortgage crisis took hold again. European shares edged slightly higher, held back, however, by Deutsche Bank, which fell after sources warned its profits may be hit. They told Reuters the bank could be hit by up to 1.7 billion euros ($2.40 billion) when it revalues loans that dwindled in value in the wake of a credit crunch. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent, having gained 2.6 percent last week. "People are trying to work out where is the damage," said Philip Isherwood, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. DOLLAR, BONDS The euro struck another all-time high against the dollar as the U.S. currency extended last week's sell-off sparked by the Fed's aggressive rate cut, which weakens some dollar returns. The euro pushed to a high of $1.4130, according to Reuters data. The move coincided with the dollar's trade-weighted index slipping to a fresh 15-year low, near an all-time trough hit in 1992. "There is still a lot of nervousness around and I can see no reason for an end to the current trend (of dollar weakness)," said Jeremy Stretch, senior proprietary trader at Rabobank. Dollar weakness, combined with oil prices about $81 a barrel and rising gold prices, have fuelled new worries about inflation. Euro zone government bond prices fell with long-dated paper continuing to under-perform on fears about inflation. The December Bund future was 22 ticks down at 112.28. In the cash market, 10-year Bund yields were 1.9 points firmer at 4.381 perce
