 ALGIERS, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh Islamist militant attacks including the second on foreigners this year has raised questions about Algeria's security strategy and triggered calls for new thinking in the struggle to end political violence. To date the authorities in the OPEC-member say the only way to put an end to 15 years of bloodshed is to pursue "national reconciliation", a policy which grants amnesty to the al Qaeda-linked guerrillas in return for disarmament. But commentators say the strategy, which has failed to halt the increasingly bold guerrillas, takes no account of a bleak social background of unemployment and poverty that fuels discontent and facilitates recruitment of suicide bombers. "If the authorities sleepwalk through the economic and social problems and focus only on security, it won't work," said Henry Wilkinson, an analyst at Janusian Security Risk Management in Britain. A deteriorating social climate marked by joblessness and abiding poverty posed a menace to stability. "The issue of legitimacy -- the feeling that the government is on the people's side -- is critical for the authorities," he said. Top-selling El Khabar daily published a survey of readers on Sunday showing 76 percent of those polled thought national reconciliation was an "insufficient" solution to terrorism. Kader Abderrahim, a Maghreb expert at the Institute of Strategic and International Relations in Paris, said the state's failure to generate jobs and a widespread alienation from formal politics felt by many Algerians posed security risks. "It's a situation which can explode," he said. Providing jobs and improving housing, health and education are key to stabilising a north African society of 33 million still traumatised from a decade of violence in the 1990s: About 75 percent of Algeria's under 30-year-olds are unemployed. The security menace was underlined on Friday when a bomb exploded near a police convoy accompanying foreign workers, injuring nine people including two French and one Italian. Al Qaeda's wing in North Africa said it was behind the attack, which it said was a suicide bombing, the same tactic used in previous attacks this year on army and police posts. It was the second on foreigners since March when three Algerians and a Russian died in an attack on a bus carrying workers for a Russian gas pipeline construction company. The two most high profile attacks in 2007 have been a failed attempted assassination of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika by a suicide bomber in Batna town and the suicide bombing of the building housing the Algiers offices of Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem and Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni. "'We can hit where we want.' The message is very clear," said Abderrahim. Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, called in a video posted on Thursday for north Africa's Muslims to "cleanse" their land of Spaniards and French to restore Muslim rule. The authorities are conscious that anger at an unresponsive government, lack of work and poor provision of basic services helped boost support for militant Islamist groups in the 1980s before Algeria plunged into violence in the 1990s. But Algerians say the country's social malaise continues because it is still struggling to reform after decades of central planning. Graft, red-tape and lack of transparency are obstacles to luring foreign investment and know-how. "The social context is similar to the one prevailing just before the unrest of the 1990s," said Claude Moniquet of the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center in Brussels. Meanwhile, the introduction of suicide bombers, more lethal bomb-making technology, vigorous fund-raising from protection rackets and smuggling and an increasingly sophisticated Web-based publicity machine have helped keep al Qaeda active. A related problem, Algerians say, is that some of the most experienced Algerian security experts who fought Islamist rebels in the 1990s are no longer in active service. There may be moves to redeploy some of them in the field, analysts say. Some security lapses have startled Algerians. Suicide bombers have penetrated barracks used by security forces twice posing as food delivery men. In Batna, the bomber exploded his bomb among a crowd of people waiting to greet Bouteflika. One of Africa's most brutal conflicts, the struggle between military and Islamist armed groups cost up to 200,000 lives. The violence began when the military cancelled legislative elections in 1992 that a radical Islamic party was set to w
