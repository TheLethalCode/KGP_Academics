<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday said his party had no splinter groups or mainstream and its symbol was 'sheaf of paddy', which could not be claimed or shared by any other entity. "There is only one BNP in the country under Khaleda Zia's leadership. It's to be seen what the Election Commission wants to do with our party logo," Delwar told reporters at his home. He alleged that the expelled party leaders were intimidating the BNP followers and instigated the government to keep the BNP central office closed. Khaleda expelled BNP's pro-reform secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain on Sep 3the day she was arrested. "The government has allowed the Jatiya Party to open their office despite the party having several factions. But the BNP hasn't split, but the caretaker government has kept its office out of bounds for all." "The BNP office closure has been instigated by some expelled leaders. We expect the government to be impartial, unbiased." Delwar said the expelled leaders were "merely opportunists". "They are threatening the leaders and workers who come to see us," Delwar said. "BNP was the only vanguard of nationalist ideals." He hinted at being in touch with the four allies of the BNP. "Conducive environment for the elections hasn't yet been in place. We cannot enter our own party office. We'll surely sit with like-minded allies and decide about the electoral issues when the time is right." bdnew
