 NEW DELHI, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congress party named Rahul Gandhi, heir of the Nehru-Gandhi family, as one of its general-secretaries on Monday, in an apparent indication the organisation was gearing for possible early polls. Rahul's appointment to the All India Congress Committee comes as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition government struggles to retain the support of communist allies opposed to a landmark nuclear energy agreement with the United States. Thirty-seven-year-old Rahul's mother, Sonia, heads the ruling party and he made a surprise entry into politics ahead of national elections in 2004. He entered parliament after contesting polls in the family borough of Amethi in the northern heartland state of Uttar Pradesh.
