The BCCI later announced it would launch its own multi-million dollar version from next year, with the support of other major boards, including those of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In a weekend television interview, former India captain Kapil Dev, who heads the ICL board, admitted there had been problems but said the league would start in November. "We all sat together and decided that the middle of November is the right time. At that time, even the international players are free to play the tournament," he told the CNN-IBN channel.

Retired West Indies skipper Brian Lara and the Pakistani quartet of Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Farhat and Abdul Razzaq have agreed to play in the ICL, as have South Africans Lance Klusener and Nicky Boje.
