 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Tigers returned home Sunday night fulfilling their target of playing the Super Eights of the inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. "We fulfilled our target of playing the Super Eights," captain Mohammad Ashraful told reporters on arrival of the Bangladesh team at the Zia International Airport Sunday night. "We could have won one or two more matches in the tournament had we put in a little more efforts in all the matches we played ," the Bangladesh captain said." Bangladesh routed the West Indies by six wickets in their first group match to confirm their Super Eights berth, but later they were beaten by South Africa in the last group match, Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan in the Super Eights matches. "We could have reached the semifinals, had the batsmen played a bit more responsibly." "Truly, there was a chance for us to play the semifinals, but we made mistakes, I must admit," said the 23-year old batsman. Before going to South Africa for the Twenty20 tournament, Bangladesh played a build-up tournament in Kenya where they beat the hosts and Uganda before losing to Pakistan. Besides, Ashraful's men had won against Scotland before going down against Kenya in the World Cup warm-up matches in South Africa. Ashraful lauded his bowlers saying, "Throughout the tournament the bowlers performed superbly, specially Syed Rasel was fantastic with his economy bowling, and Saqib and Razzak were also commendable." "I am not satisfied with my own performance but as a team, we achieved our target," said vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Interim coach Shaun Williams did not return with the team and is expected to arrive here from Australia after three more days. Bangladesh is scheduled to tour New Zealand next through December-January. bdnews
