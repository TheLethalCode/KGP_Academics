 SYDNEY, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have called up batsman Adam Voges as cover for injured captain Ricky Ponting on their one-day tour of India, Cricket Australia said on Monday. Ponting suffered a hamstring injury at the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa last week and Brad Haddin was originally added to the squad to travel to India. Following a another hamstring injury to batsman Mike Hussey, however, Haddin has now been named a full member of the squad and Voges will join the party as cover for Ponting. Hussey is returning to Australia. "An unfortunate hamstring injury to Mike Hussey during the Twenty20 World Cup has ruled Hussey out of the tour altogether and as such Brad Haddin has been permanently added to the touring party for the tour of India," Australia chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. "Adam Voges, who has recently captained Australia A in Pakistan, has been added to the touring squad as cover for Ponting. Once Ricky has recovered full fitness, Adam will return to Australia." Australia, who lost to India in the Twenty20 Cup semi-finals, are due to leave South Africa on Tuesday. They are playing seven one-day internationals in India, the first in Bangalore on Saturday
