 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnew24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday ordered six people accused in the GATCO scam case to jail, a day after the police arrested them. Two directors of Chittagong Port Authority were sent to jail after giving statements in the case under which Khaleda Zia and son Arafat Rahman Coco have been detained GATCO directors Syed Tanveer Ahmed and Syed Galib Ahmed gave their statements under the Criminal Procedure Code, at the court of metropolitan magistrate AJM Abdullahel Baqui at 6.45pm. The two accused were taken to jail at 7pm. Earlier in the day, four former officials of Chittagong Port Authority were also sent to jail as co-accused in the case. Advocate Mohammad Aminul Islam, counsel for the two directors, said in court: "GATCO was the lowest bidder among six firms who participated in the tender. The accused did not hamper any economic activity of the government. False allegations have been brought against them involving them with political personalities." Police arrested former CPA chairman ANM Shahadat Hossain, former director AM Sanwar Hossain, former chief finance and accounting officer Ahmed Abul Kashem and former CPA member Lutful Kabir Saturday. Advocate Aminul Islam appealed to the court for granting his two clients, Galib and Tanveer, division in jail and medical treatment. The court ordered the jail authorities to take proper action as per the jail code. Advocate Islam told the court that Galib has been suffering from paralysis while Syed Tanveer Ahmed had suffered from a brain haemorrhage and was not "mentally sound". "So let the court order for their treatment at BSMMU or any other reputable hospital." In response to an appeal by the counsels for the four of the accused, the magistrate ordered jail authorities to give them division if their case complied with the jail code. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on Sept 2 with Tejgaon Police Station alleging that GATCO's contract to run the container depot at Chittagong Port was illegal. The case was brought under the emergency powers rules on Sept 17. Former prime-minister Khaleda Zia and her son stand accused of corruption in the case. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 in connection with the case. The case record shows that a tender was floated on March 1, 2003 to appoint a contractor for the container depots at Chittagong Port and Kamalapur Rail station. The accused awarded the tender to GATCO even though the company failed to meet all of the conditions. It is also alleged that the government incurred more than Tk 1,000 crore in losses because of the GATCO deal. bdnews24.com/pb/
