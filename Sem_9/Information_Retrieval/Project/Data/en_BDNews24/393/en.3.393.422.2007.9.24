 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The recent unrest by garment workers came to an apparent end Sunday after a four-hour meeting between the workers and owners of Nasa Group. The company owners agreed on an 11-point charter of demands with the workers of four factories of the group, who promised to get back to work Monday. Hundreds of garments workers of Nasa Group protested for the last two days in Tejgaon and in front of BGMEA office, demanding a rise in allowances and festival bonuses. The first round of protests started in Tejgaon Industrial Area Saturday, which spilled over into the second day in front of the manufacturers and exporters' body, past Sonargaon Hotel. The workers burst into violence after the four factories were shut for an indefinite period. Following the lockout, the workers along with colleagues from other factories attacked nearby factories and set several vehicles ablaze around the industrial estate. The BGMEA had described the violence as a "deep conspiracy" to destroy the readymade garment industry, in a statement from a rushed press conference on Saturday. The Nasa Group owners along with BGMEA officials held a meeting Sunday with a 20-member delegation of the workers about the pay dispute. The highlights of the deal with Nasa workers:  Salary must be paid by the 10th of every month  Violence-free work environment must be ensured  If leave is not enjoyed, workers must be paid for this by year-end  Every worker would get Tk 10 in iftar allowances  Tk 25 in night-shift allowances  Layoffs must be done in line with the labour law The tripartite deal was signed by Nasa Group managing director Nazrul Islam, by Morzina on behalf of workers and BGMEA acting president ABM Shamsuddin. bdnews24.com
