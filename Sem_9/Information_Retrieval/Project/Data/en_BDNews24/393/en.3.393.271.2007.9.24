 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue considers extending the deadline to file income tax returns by one more month, chairman Badiur Rahman said Sunday. The time limit has been stretched twice with the latest one ending on Sept 30. "The deadline to submit income tax returns may be increased by one month. We will make a decision once the finance adviser returns," he told reporters in his office. Individuals earning over Tk 1.5 lakh a year need to pay tax for fiscal 2008. The tax administration chief's comment came amid calls by chamber bodies including the apex trade body, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. "We will fix a time limit in the budget to avoid revising the date for submission of income tax returns. I hope such announcement will be there in the next budget," the NBR chief said. bdnews24.c
