 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday summoned six members of the cabinet committee on purchase to testify in the GATCO scam case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The six are all former ministers who had sat on the BNP-led coalition government's cabinet committee on purchase, according to the first information report (FIR) of the case. They are former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former LGRD and cooperatives minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former health minister Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, former information minister M Shamsul Islam, former agriculture minister MK Anwar and former industry minister Matiur Rahman Nizami. The member secretary of the committee was the then cabinet secretary. The former health minister is in jail. They have been called to the ACC office at Segun Bagicha, said the commission's secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman. Eight out of 13 individuals accused in the case have been arrested, including Khaleda and son Arafat Rahman Coco. The FIR filed in 2003 said GATCO, an "inefficient and inexperienced" firm, had been entrusted with managing Chittagong Port Terminal Yard and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot. Akbar Hossain, the late shipping minister with some members of his family, intervened to give the work to GATCO with the help of the former prime minister and Coco, according to the FIR. The FIR also said the cabinet committee on purchase had cancelled the shipping ministry's approval of GATCO getting the work order. Khaleda overruled the committee's recommendation and awarded the work to GATCO. bdnews24.co
