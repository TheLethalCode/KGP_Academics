<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Sunday said emergency rules should be relaxed to hold elections to city corporations in January. "We'll hold elections to city corporations and local bodies in January as soon as voter lists are complete in the areas," he said. "Although I haven't discussed the issue with the government I think for these elections to take place not only the ban on indoor politics should go, the emergency rules should also be relaxed. "After all, this government has come to hold elections," Huda told top executives of the TV channels in his office. Huda said he did not see anything derail the polls roadmap. "If there's no big mishap or rip-off there's no reason for the election roadmap to fail, and I am not apprehensive of any such incident." On talks with political parties on reforms to election law, the top polls official said, "Both factions of the BNP are willing to join the talks, but we'll invite one group. "I hope they will settle the issue before the talks begin [with them] in November." "Implementation of the election roadmap is important. The government of West Bengal could not complete the voter list with photographs in three years despite having fewer numbers of voters than we have. "We want to complete this tough task in only 18 months. We might even finish this task before October 2008." Huda also said the army was providing technical support for the EC in voter registration. The CEC said they wanted to create 'political values' among voters so they came to the vote centres and get registered. "If we are able to infuse political values [into people] politics will be cleaner," he said. "We are getting full support of the government in terms of money and manpower, the overall situation is favourable." He asked the media to help out the EC in preparation of the electoral roll and related works and briefed reporters of electronic media on voter registration issues. "Currently we are working on voter listing with photographs in 30 places and the work will start all over the country in November," he told them. Huda said the Election Working Groups were sensitising people at the grassroots about benefits of registration. Election commissioners Md Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain, voter list project director Brig Gen Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury, chief adviser of ATN Bangla Saiful Bari, ETV's head of news Shah Alamgir, executive director for Bangla Vision news Aminur Rashid, chief news editor of NTV Khairul Anwar Mukul and chief news editor of Channel-i Saiful Amin were present at the meeting. The CEC welcomed a proposal for frequent view-exchange meetings between the EC and the electronic media. bdnews24.com
