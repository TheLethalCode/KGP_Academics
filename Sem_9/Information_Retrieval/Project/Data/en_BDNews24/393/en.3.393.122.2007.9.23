 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Six buyers have expressed their interests to purchase Tk 4.0 billion shares of the troubled Oriental Bank, a central bank official said Sunday. "We will now scrutinise the applications to see whether they are qualified. We will later ask them to place their financial offers for the majority shares of the bank," the official, who preferred not to be named, told bdnews24.com. Three local buyers and as many foreign buyers submitted EoIs (expressions of interests), the official said. BRAC Bank, Summit Industrial and Mercantile Corporation and Domestic Investors Consortium were the three local prospective buyers. ICB Financial Group Holdings of Switzerland, Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka and East Invest Private Equity Limited of the UK were the three foreign buyers. The applications came in line with a previous Bangladesh Bank announcement that had sought EoIs from strategic investors to sell Tk 4.0 billion Oriental shares. They were set the Sept 23 deadline for submitting EoIs. The BB floated the tender as part of its plan to recapitalise the embezzlement-ridden Oriental, has been facing a moratorium following a Tk 5.96 billion financial scam by its former management. The central bank offered management control to the new investors in its tender. Under the recapitalisation scheme, Oriental's paid-up capital will be raised to Tk 7.0 billion, with Tk 4.0 billion from strategic investors and Tk 3.0 billion from depositors. Oriental, according to the central bank, has 30 branches with Tk 22.05 billion in assets and Tk 23.08 billion in deposits. "We hope to complete all procedures before the end of January next year," he said referring that moratorium order on the bank will expire by the end of January. bd
