 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bimstec countries began trade talks in Dhaka Monday in an attempt to reach a consensus on the list of restricted products between member countries. Formed in 1997, Bimstec promotes economic cooperation between member countries in the South and Southeast Asian region. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed spoke to reporters after inaugurating the Trade Negotiations Committee meeting at Sonargaon Hotel. "Five members out of seven have already agreed to reduce their negative lists to 20 percent of the WTO's tariff lines. The remaining two countries want it down to 10 percent," he said. There are 5,200 tariff lines under the World Trade Organisation's Harmonised System Code (HS). Under the system, tariff lines are accorded an HS number and product description by the World Customs Organisation. If the proposed reduction to 20 percent goes ahead, member countries' negative lists will not exceed 1,040 products. If the level is set at 10 percent the list would include 520 items. Bangladesh has agreed to reduce its negative list to 20 percent of the WTO tariff lines along with Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Thailand and Myanmar have called for 10 percent of the total products on their negative list. The main focus of the meeting aims to reduce negative or sensitive lists before implementing any free trade agreement, said commerce ministry officials. The commerce secretary said members differ on the size of the negative lists and that a difference of 10 percent is huge. "Members know where the problems lie and they are very serious on this issue," Ahmed told reporters. "I hope they will manage to narrow down the lists under a give-and-take approach." "Members have to compromise to resolve these differences," he added. The ongoing negotiations were supposed to be completed by the end of 2005 for implementation in 2006. Negotiations on services and investment were to be concluded by 2007. "We are lagging behind by at least one year in implementing Bimstec agreements," Ahmed told reporters. "I hope the 3-day negotiation will help members arrive at a consensus," he added. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) was formed in 1997. Members signed a Framework Agreement on the Fair Trade Agreement in Feb 8, 2004. Bangladesh entered the deal on June 25, 2004. Bimstec provides a unique link between South Asia and Southeast Asia, which together have over 1.3 billion people or 21 per cent of the world population. A study conducted in 2004 showed a potential of $43 billion to $59 billion in trade under Bimstec's FTA. The meeting ends on Sept 26. bdnew
