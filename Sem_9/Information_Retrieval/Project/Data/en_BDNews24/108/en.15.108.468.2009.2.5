<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan on Thursday told parliament that the government was taking measures to reactivate the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) as soon as possible to contain price spirals. The minister's assurance came as ruling party MP Sarah Begum Kobori tabled a private member's resolution on revival of the TCB. Ruling party MPs AKM Rahmatullah, Falul Azim, Golam Dasogir Gazi, Shamsul Haq Chowdhury, Md Nazrul Islam, Md Enamul Haq, Israfil Alam and Anisul Islam Mondol supported the resolution and demanded that the TCB must be resuscitated immediately. Kobori withdrew her resolution on the minister's assurance to the House that his ministry had already formed a six-member feasibility study team for the TCB's revival. "The ministry of commerce has already formed a six-member feasibility study committee, headed by a joint-secretary, which has been asked to submit its report by the end of February," said Faruq. "We will reactivate the TCB as soon as possible ensuring private-public partnership after receiving the feasibility study report," he assured the House. He said the TCB played an admirable role in checking price spirals in the past. But the state-owned business organ lost its relevance by the late 1980s owing to trade liberalisation, the minister said. "The TCB became almost dysfunctional under the past BNP-Jamaat government as it reduced its staff from 1,400 to 232. Again, the caretaker government further marginalised the TCB by slashing its manpower further," Khan said. The minister said the TCB had in recent days been collecting information on the international market prices of essential commodities for the Prime Minister's office. The trade corporation was established in 1968 during the Pakistan regime. The TCB continued its market interventions until the late 1980s. Passage of a private member's resolution is rare. Last Thursday, the House unanimously passed a resolution, made by Mahmud-us-Samad Chowdhury, for trying war criminals. bdnews2
