 LONDON, Tue Feb 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China denounced as despicable on Tuesday a protester who threw a shoe at Prime Minister Wen Jiabao at Cambridge University and said the Chinese leader's visit to Europe was a total success. British police said the protester, who shouted that Wen was a dictator during Monday's incident, had been charged with a public order offence and will appear before Cambridge magistrates on February 10. They did not name the man. "The Chinese side has expressed its strong displeasure over this incident," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "The facts demonstrate that the despicable conduct of this troublemaker will win no sympathy, and will not hold back the tide of friendly cooperation between China and Britain." The shoe-throwing incident occurred when Wen delivered a speech on the global economy at Cambridge University on the last day of his official visit to Britain. The shoe missed Wen and landed on the stage about a meter (yard) away from him. The global economic crisis topped the agenda on Wen's week-long visit to Britain and other European countries which Beijing promoted as a friendly "tour of confidence" to build cooperation after tensions between the two sides over Tibet. The official Xinhua news agency said his trip was "fully successful." Official newspapers and television reports in China did not report the shoe-throwing incident. The ruling Communist Party keeps a tight grip over mass media and reports usually avoid showing leaders in awkward or unfavorable situations. The protester shouted during the incident, "How can the university prostitute itself with this dictator? How can you listen to the lies he is telling? Stand up and protest." After the protest, Wen went on with his speech and said: "We come in peace. This is not going to obstruct China-UK friendships. History shows harmony will not be obstructed by any force, so would you let me continue." About 80 people, both supporters and critics of China, had gathered earlier outside the venue. There was a large police presence in the city of Cambridge and security guards within the university building. Groups of anti-China protesters, including pro-Tibet campaigners, followed Wen during his visit to Britain. On Sunday, police arrested five pro-Tibet demonstrators after they broke through police lines as Wen arrived at the Chinese embassy in London. The shoe-throwing protest echoed the hurling of shoes by an Iraqi journalist at US President George W Bush on his farewell visit to Iraq in December. Video footage of the Baghdad incident was shown around the world. The protester, journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi who works for independent al-Baghdadiya television, shouted, "This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog.
