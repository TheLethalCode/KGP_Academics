 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24)  Shipping and inland water transport minister Afsarul Amin Saturday said there was no bar to transporting goods through Bangladesh to countries including India. "The agreements signed by the previous governments allow transportation of goods across the borders through Bangladesh territory," he told reporters after a meeting with Chittagong Port Authority officials in the morning. About the transit issue with India, the minister said, "This will be decided at the high-level bilateral meeting." On the possible use of the Chittagong port as part of the trade deal, Amin said, "We hope for a better relationship with our neighbours." "The trade deal with India was signed by Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed in 1980 and renewed by M Saifur Rahman in 2006  both former BNP ministers," he said. "As per the eighth clause of the deal there is no obstacle to using water, road and airways of Bangladesh," he said. He pointed out that not a single word of the deal had been changed from 1980 to 2008. Asked if the port was ready to provide transit facilities, Amin evaded a direct reply. "The port's infrastructure has been developed over the last few years and will be developed further." "The government will do everything it can to upgrade the port," he told the meeting chaired by CPA chairman commodore RU Ahmed. He urged all to work for transforming the port into a modern world-class port. "No excuse, no recommendation from any minister, MP, military or civil officials will be allowed from now," insisted the minister. "All works will be done under democratic norms and as per rules during the present government's tenure," said the shipping minister. Chittagong-10 (Bandar-Patenga) MP MA Latif, shipping secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, among others, attended the meeting
