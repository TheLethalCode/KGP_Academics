 MILAN, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of Serie A matches this weekend. Inter Milan's injury list is starting to shorten ahead of Saturday's trip to Lecce (1700 GMT). Defenders Cristian Chivu, Marco Materazzi and Walter Samuel have trained after knocks while Dejan Stankovic has shrugged off an injury and fellow midfielder Patrick Vieira is starting to win his long fitness battle, the club website (www.inter.it) said. Striker Julio Cruz has recovered from flu with Sulley Muntari poised to return for the Serie A leaders after a ban. Adriano serves the last game of his three-match suspension. AC Milan, six behind Inter in second, have Andrea Pirlo suspended for Saturday's home game with bottom side Reggina (1930) so Mathieu Flamini may come in. Ronaldinho is also hoping for a start after almost a month on the bench while in-form David Beckham, on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy until March 9, will play his first match since announcing he wants to stay with the Rossoneri permanently. Third-placed Juventus are without injured trio Giorgio Chiellini, Cristiano Zanetti and Paolo De Ceglie for Sunday's game at Catania (1400). Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is expected to return after flu ruled him out of Wednesday's Italian Cup quarter-final win over Napoli. AS Roma right back Marco Motta, on loan from Udinese, is in line for his debut at home to fourth-placed Genoa on Sunday (1400) with Cicinho, who has a knee problem, joining Marco Cassetti on the injury list. Christian Panucci is another option at right back but looks unlikely to be considered having failed to secure a January move after requesting to leave the club. Fiorentina will get used to life without injured forward Mario Santana when they host Lazio on Sunday (1400). The Argentine has two small fractures in his leg and has knee ligament trouble so is likely to be out for the season. Udinese's slight pick-up in form after a dreadful spell is threatened by striker Fabio Quagliarella being suspended for Sunday's home match with Bologna (1400)
