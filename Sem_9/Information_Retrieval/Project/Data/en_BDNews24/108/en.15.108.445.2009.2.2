<TITLE> Govt awaits SC directive on TAC: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The government is looking to a Supreme Court directive regarding the 452 people who have received clemency from the Truth and Accountability Commission, declared illegal by the High Court, the law minister said on Monday. "I hope the Appellate Division will give a directive soon with regard to the Commission and its clemency receivers," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at his office after receiving a wrap-up report from TAC chairman justice Habibur Rahman Khan. Bangladesh's interim government formed the TAC last year as a means of expediting dozens of corruption cases. Formed under the Voluntary Disclosure of Information Ordinance-2008, with five-month duration, it worked from Aug. 3 to Dec. 31, 2008. The ordinance that created the Commission allowed those convicted of graft to receive leniency upon confessing and returning any illegal earnings. The High Court, however, has declared the founding of the Commission illegal and unconstitutional. The court issued the ruling last November following a petition by four rights activists who said the Commission did not have jurisdiction to punish criminal offenders. Asked Monday whether the government would form another commission like the TAC, the law minister replied in the negative. "It's certain that the TAC will not be formed again. But the government is mulling whether a law for 'alternate dispute resolution' could be introduced to lessen the case-jam in the courts," said Shafiq. TAC chairman Habibur Rahman Khan said, "Our wrap-up report detailed the Commission's activities during its five month including the amount of recovered money and its orders." Asked whether he put any recommendations to the government, Khan answered, "There should be a similar law in the future to ensure the people's right to get justice. Many people are deprived of a timely verdict due to case-jam in court." On why the TAC did not seem to meet people's expectations, he replied that the delay in forming the commission was the reason. bdnews24.
