 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)A High Court ruling Monday ordered the government to explain why a judicial probe should not be instigated to investigate the murders, rapes, looting and attacks that took place countrywide in the wake of the 2001 general election. The court set March 4 for a final hearing on a petition filed Sunday by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. "People were murdered, women raped and properties plundered after the 2001 parliamentary polls," advocate Manjil Morshed, representing the human rights group, told the court during the hearing. The law enforcing agencies silently witnessed these post-election atrocities, which resulted in abuse of human rights generally across the country, he said. A HC bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Abdul Hye gave the home secretary, cabinet secretary, prime minister's principal secretary, inspector general of police and his six divisional police chiefs, four weeks on Monday to reply to the order. Acting attorney general M Inayetur Rahim represented the government at the hearing. bdnews
