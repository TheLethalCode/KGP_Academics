 BERLIN, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hertha Berlin missed a chance to go top of the Bundesliga after drawing 1-1 at Arminia Bielefeld on Friday. The visitors, missing several players through injury including striker Marko Pantelic and defender Arne Friedrich, took the lead through Andriy Voronin before Bielefeld equalised thanks to Artur Wichniarek's 12th league goal of the season. Hertha are second with 37 points from 19 games, one point behind leaders Hoffenheim who visit bottom team Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. Voronin, on loan from Liverpool, struck after 13 minutes when he picked up a long ball from keeper Jaroslav Drobny and unleashed a thunderous low drive. He almost netted a second four minutes later after an identical sprint but was denied by the crossbar. Gutsy Bielefeld hit back quickly, missing a handful of chances through Thorben Marx and Wichniarek. The Polish striker levelled five minutes before the break when Radim Kucera picked him out with a pinpoint cross to the far post and he headed past Drobny. On Saturday third-placed Hamburg SV visit Karlsruhe. Champions Bayern Munich, fourth on 35 points, entertain Borussia Dortmund on Sunday
