 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea have appealed against the red card shown to midfielder Frank Lampard in Sunday's 2-0 Premier League defeat by Liverpool, England's Football Association said on Monday. England international Lampard faces a three-match ban after being sent off on the hour mark by referee Mike Riley for a tackle on Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso with the score at 0-0. The FA confirmed on its website (www.thefa.com) that a regulatory commission would hear the appeal on Tuesday. "I only ask that the referee and the men from the FA look at the video," Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari told the club's website (www.chelseafc.com). Chelsea's Portuguese defender Jose Bosingwa may also face an FA inquiry, despite apologising on Monday for stamping on Liverpool's Yossi Benayoun in the dying minutes of Sunday's defeat, an act which went unpunished by Riley. "I apologise for what I did and it was never my intention to hurt him. I know it was wrong and I apologise," Bosingwa told the club website. "Bosingwa was not correct. He made a mistake and maybe he has punishment (to come)," Scolari added. "But if Bosingwa has a punishment  maybe they change Lampard's red card and maybe he plays the next games." Sunday's defeat left Chelsea in third place, three points behind Liverpool and five behind leaders Manchester United, who also have a game in hand
