 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Brothers put an end to their five-match misery in the Citycell B. League on Saturday when they recorded a hard-fought 3-2 win over Rahmatganj MFS in the second-leg encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. Mehdi Hasan Tapu, Atiqur Rahman Mishu and Shakil Ahmed struck one goal each for the winners while Nche Francis and Idris Kasiry netted one goal each for the losers. With the third second-leg win and overall eighth victory in 18 matches, Brothers Union raised their point tally to 31, four points behind third-placed Sheikh Russel KC. Rahmatganj MFS, on the other hand, remained at 21 points from 18 matches. Tapu put Brothers ahead in the 12th minute before Francis levelled the margin for Rahmatganj, who lost to Brothers 2-0 in the first-leg match. The Gopibagh-based outfit, Brothers, went again ahead with the help of stopper Mishu's strike in the 37th minute. After resumption, giant-killers Rahmatganj, who had earlier beaten champions Abahani Limited and Mohammedan SC, stepped up the attack and again equalised the margin when Idris converted a penalty in the 75th minute. Two minutes later, Shakil netted Brothers' third goal to seal the match to put an end to their five-match miserable run as they lost to Abahani and Mohammedan and drew against Sheikh Russel, Muktijoddha Sangsad and Arambagh KS. bd
