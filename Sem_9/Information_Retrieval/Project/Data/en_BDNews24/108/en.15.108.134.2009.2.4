 SYDNEY, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England striker Robbie Fowler has signed a two-year deal with Australia's newest A-League club, North Queensland Fury. The club announced on Wednesday they had reached an agreement with Fowler after the 33-year-old visited the club's headquarters in Townsville last month. North Queensland are one of two new clubs that will join the expanded A-League for the 2009-10 season and Chairman Don Matheson said Fowler's signing was a major coup for the fledgling franchise. "It's taken a lot of work to make this happen but it was worth it," said. "I really believe having him playing for North Queensland Fury will change the way people think about the A-League." Fowler has played for Liverpool, Leeds United, Manchester City, Cardiff City and Blackburn Rovers but became a free agent in December last year. He turned down an offer to join Sydney FC two years ago but said he was impressed with the setup at North Queensland. "I had nothing but good things to tell my family about the football side of things and the lifestyle opportunities North Queensland can offer us," Fowler said in a statement. "It's a huge decision for my family, but it's also an opportunity to continue my football career in a truly wonderful part of the world.
