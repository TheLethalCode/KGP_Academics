 COLOMBO, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh plundered centuries to lead India to a crushing 147-run win over Sri Lanka in the third one-day international and an unbeatable 3-0 series lead on Tuesday. Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan equalled the world record for one-day wickets but could not stop India piling up a massive total of 363 for five before Sri Lanka were dismissed for 216. Sehwag and Yuvraj rescued the visitors after they had slumped to 24 for two. Man-of-the-match Yuvraj was dismissed for 117 when he cut Muralitharan to Chamara Kapugedera at point, giving the off-spinner his 502nd one-day wicket to equal the world record held by Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram. The 36-year-old Muralitharan, playing his 327th one-day international, also holds the world record for most test wickets. Left-hander Yuvraj slammed 15 fours and one six and Sehwag struck 17 fours in his 116 off 89 balls. The pair shared a 221-run third-wicket stand, taking full advantage of wayward bowling and poor fielding after Sachin Tendulkar had fallen for seven and Gautam Gambhir for 10. Opener Sehwag, dropped off his own bowling by Sanath Jayasuriya on 72, was eventually run out by the same player after a direct hit from mid-off. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan shared a breezy unbroken stand of 85 in 64 balls for the sixth wicket, Pathan cracking a career-best 59 not out off 38 deliveries and Dhoni compiling an unbeaten 35. Sri Lanka made a bad start by losing Jayasuriya for a duck and only Kumar Sangakkara's gutsy 83 off 82 balls kept them in the hunt. Sangakkara's dismissal left Sri Lanka on 189 for seven and Indian left-arm spinner Praghyan Ojha completed career-best figures of four for 38 runs. The fourth one-dayer in the five-match series will be played on Thursday
