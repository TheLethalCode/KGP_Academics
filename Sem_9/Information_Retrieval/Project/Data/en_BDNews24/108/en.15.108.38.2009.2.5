<TITLE> Early food budget planned: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken up a plan to prepare its food budget in advance, food minister Abur Razzaq said on Wednesday. "An early food budget will be prepared to ensure food security in the country," the minister told reporters after a meeting with the World Food Programme's resident mission chief. WFP's John I Leaf told reporters a huge percentage of Bangladeshis were still living under subsistence level. These people are still to be brought under the food security net, he told the minister. Proper supply and distribution of food has to be ensured, he said. Razzaq said, "We've informed the WFP mission head of our plan and requested increased food assistance from donors." "As donors are now focused more on sub-Sahara Africa, Bangladesh is deprived even of the promised food assistance," he said. The minister added, however, "The government has taken measures to ensure food safety through raising output." "The budget will be prepared on domestic demands, requirement for reserves, amount of production and imports needs," Razzaq said. He also said he informed the WFP representative that Bangladesh could not store sufficient food for lack of requisite godowns in the country. He sought the international body's help in this particular area. bdnews24
