<TEXT>
 WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama on Thursday expressed concerns about the difficulty of maintaining a focused military mission in Afghanistan as his administration prepares a troop buildup there, sources at a Democratic meeting said. Obama was addressing House of Representatives Democrats on the first day of a three-day retreat here. Following a speech that focused on the domestic economy, Obama took questions from the lawmakers during a short, private session. The sources who were present at the closed session said Obama was asked for his views on the Afghan situation. The president responded that the United States cannot win the war in Afghanistan by military means alone, "needs a clear mission" and a key danger for US forces is "mission creep without clear parameters." The sources, who asked not to be identified, said Obama also told the House Democrats that Washington needs to engage in diplomatic efforts with Afghanistan's neighbor, Pakistan. Obama's remarks came on the eve of a trip by Vice President Joe Biden to Munich, where he is to meet with European leaders to consult with them about hot spots including Afghanistan. The United States has been waging a war against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan since shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington. Obama, just two weeks in the White House, is expected to approve up to 17,000 more combat troops for Afghanistan to help reverse a growing insurgency that has escalated to the highest levels since the 2001 invasion that toppled the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda militants. Obama was elected in November in part on a pledge to pull US troops out of Iraq and devote more US military forces to Afghanistan. During his remarks to the House Democrats, which were met with cheers according to those who attended, Obama also said that Afghanistan cannot become a "safe haven" for terrorists
