 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering a more up to date Private Satellite Channel and Radio Policy to better serve the public, said information minister Abul Kalam Azad on Thursday. "The private radio and satellite channels born under the 1998 policy have upheld people's expectations and maintained neutrality. But revising the decade-old policy to ensure more modern, impartial and mass oriented service is under consideration," he said. In reply to a question by Israfil Alam MP, the minister said, "The government believes in free flow of information." "It will give all-out help to the mass media for objective and impartial journalism." Answering Zafar Iqbal Siddiqi MP, the information minister said, "All print and electronic news media are enjoying full freedom, the government doesn't believe in interference into press freedom." bdnews2
