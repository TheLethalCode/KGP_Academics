<TEXT>
 BERNE, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Factbox of the 11 potential candidates to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup finals as confirmed by world soccer's governing body FIFA on Tuesday. Association: England Founded: 1863 Previous World Cup hosts: 1 (1966) Previous World Cup champions: 1 (1966) Previous World Cup participation: 12 (1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1998, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: Taking the World Cup final back to Wembley's rebuilt stadium will surely be one of the central images of the English campaign. The recent flurry of ground-building across the country will mean there are no shortage of candidates to stage the tournament's other matches. Strong points: England's status as the inventors of modern soccer is likely to feature, though the bid team will be keen not to overemphasise the importance of the past. Passionate supporters, a committed government and an impressive array of new stadiums should help provide a modern counter-balance. Transport and infrastructure improvements already being made for the London 2012 Olympics should also provide spin-off benefits. Weak points: Although more than 40 years ago, England's previous hosting of the World Cup in 1966 could be used against it by those yet to stage the event. The 2012 Olympics could also strengthen the argument that it is now someone else's turn while the spiralling cost of the Games could dampen English enthusiasm. Recent successes in the fight against hooliganism will have to be maintained throughout the bidding process. Association: Russia Founded: 1912 Previous World Cup hosts: 0 Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 9 (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 2002) Stadiums: Russia at present has only one arena capable of hosting World Cup matchesthe 84,000-seat Luzhniki Olympic Stadium, the site of last year's Champions League final. It also hosted the soccer final at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Strong points: Russia has never hosted a World Cup nor a European Championship finals and is very keen to show the world it can stage a major event. Sochi's success in securing the 2014 Winter Olympics will boost confidence. Weak points: Never hosting a major soccer championship can also be seen as a weakness because it shows the country's inexperience in staging major tournaments. Poor or non-existent infrastructure could also hamper Russia's chances. Associations: Spain and Portugal Founded: Spain 1913, Portugal 1914 Previous World Cup hosts: 1 (Spain in 1982) Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: Spain 12 (1934, 1950, 1962, 1966, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006), Portugal 4 (1966, 1986, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: In Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu and Barcelona's Nou Camp, Spain has two of the world's most iconic soccer arenas plus a host of other quality stadiums. Portugal's soccer infrastructure was updated for the successful Euro 2004 finals and boasts Lisbon's Stadium of Light and Porto's Dragon Stadium. Strong points: Spain's status as the world's top team and European champions will give weight to its bid and both countries have highly developed tourist industries well able to cope with an influx of visitors. Weak points: FIFA president Sepp Blatter opposes joint bids. The Spanish and Portuguese economies have been especially hard hit in the global economic slowdown and cash to fund a bid as well as political will to support it may be scarce. There is also lingering concern about racism in Spanish soccer and a lack of will by the authorities to tackle the problem. Associations: Netherlands and Belgium Founded: Netherlands 1889, Belgium 1895 Previous World Cup hosts: 0 Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: Netherlands 8 (1934, 1938, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2006), Belgium 11 (1930, 1934, 1938, 1954, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002) Stadiums: Rotterdam's new Feyenoord Stadium will be capable of hosting the World Cup final with a capacity boosted from 51,000 to 80,000. Aside from the Amsterdam Arena, other venues will need to be expanded but that should present little problem as they are all relatively new grounds. Belgium has recently started construction on a new national soccer stadium and already boasts the former Heysel stadium  host to many European finals and the annual athletics Golden League meetingand at least three other club stadiums with capacities over 30,000 that would need little time to upgrade. Strong points: The pair's successful co-hosting of Euro 2000 may help win round a FIFA president sceptical about joint bids. The manageable distances between the cities and the two countries' excellent infrastructures are also positives. As home to the European Union and NATO, Belgium is used to hosting large-scale events and has an abundance of hotel rooms. Weak points: Netherlands' approximately 100,000 available hotel rooms will not be sufficient to host all the sponsors, officials, teams and fans and therefore demands creativity. This plus the reduced number of night flights from local airports and Amsterdam airport will bring logistical pressures. Association: Australia Founded: 1961 Previous World Cup hosts: 0 Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 2 (1974, 2006) Stadiums: Australia's two largest stadiums are the Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity 100,000) and Sydney's Olympic stadium (capacity 83,500). Both cities also have secondary stadiums that hold more than 50,000 spectators while Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and other major regional cities all have stadiums with seating for more than 40,000. Strong points: Australia has already proven itself as a successful host of major international events, most notably with the 1956 and 2000 Olympics, the 1987 and 2003 Rugby World Cups and a number of Commonwealth Games, most recently in 2006. The Australian federal government has pledged its support. Weak points: With the 2010 World Cup being staged in South Africa and 2014 in Brazil, Australia have to convince FIFA to play a third successive tournament in the southern hemisphere. Time zones do not fit in well with European television viewers. Despite being sports-mad, Australians have only just started to embrace soccer and still lack real international success. Association: Indonesia Founded: 1930 Previous World Cup hosts: 0 Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 1 (1938) entered under the name of the Dutch East Indies Company. Stadiums: Jakarta's Gelora Bung Karno stadium staged the 2007 Asian Cup final and meets FIFA's requirements of at least one 80,000-seater stadium to host the World Cup final. Work is planned for August and supported by the government although a figure of the funding has yet to be confirmed. Security at the other existing stadiums is not yet up to the standards required and major construction of new stadiums will also be needed. Strong points: FIFA's insistence that the World Cup finals should "achieve positive change" and "benefit society" will be seized on as Indonesia looks to build on the progress made since the end of the Suharto regime. A vast 226 million population and the investment opportunities presented by Asia's emerging economies could help the bid shake off its outsider image. Weak points: Badminton-crazy Indonesia is yet to make an impact in soccer terms and the national team are ranked 144th in FIFA's world standings. The country's creaking infrastructure will also need a massive overhaul to meet the standards demanded by FIFA and even the 2022 finals could prove too early. Association: Japan Founded: 1921 Previous World Cup hosts: 1 (2002 co-hosts with South Korea) Previous World Cup participation: 3 (1998, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: Japan plans to use of most of the 10 venues built for the 2002 World Cup but does not have a stadium big enough to stage the opening game and final under new FIFA rules which demand an 80,000 seater. Their bid could depend on the success of Tokyo's pitch for the 2016 Olympics Games, which would give them a 100,000-capacity main stadium and solve that problem. Strong points: Japan successfully co-hosted the 2002 World Cup which was memorable for a carnival atmosphere and an absence of trouble among fans. Its state-of-the-art stadiums, strong infrastructure, robust economy and public backing make it a leading contender to host a World Cup without incurring debts. Weak points: Having co-hosted Asia's first World Cup, Japan could lose out in the regional race to Australia, China, Qatar or even Indonesia. The Japan Football Association's insistence that a formal World Cup bid depends on whether Tokyo gets the 2016 Olympics carries obvious risks. Association: South Korea Founded: 1933 Previous World Cup hosts: 1 (2002 co-hosts with Japan) Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 7 (1954, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: There are 10 World Cup stadiums throughout the country that were used for the 2002 World Cup. Very little work will be needed to get the stadiums ready for re-use, since all 10 were newly built for the 2002 event and have the necessary TV broadcast and communications systems in place. Strong Points: South Korea has the infrastructure, traffic system and hotels to accommodate the visitors, as well as a highly modern communications system. It is also located close to two other Asian countries and offers ready access to the region. Weak points: The country may not be as accessible to those outside the region and its hosting of the 2002 World Cups could be used against it by countries that have yet to host the event. A likely bid by a mountainous city to host the 2018 Winter Olympics Games could put a strain on the resources for another major international sports event in the same year. Association: Qatar Founded: 1960 Previous World Cup hosts: 0 Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 0 Stadiums: Six stadiums in Doha are already on hand to host World Cup level matches while plans have been drawn up for up to five more ultra-modern stadiums in Doha, Al Khor and Al Wakra, including one in the shape of an open laptop computer. Strong points: Qatar has the capacity and willingness to invest hugely in developing the required infrastructure and organising the World Cup in an unprecedented fashion. It has already hosted the 2006 Asian Games, the second biggest multi-sport Games after the Olympics. The government is fully backing the bid to make up for the disappointment of failing to make the 2016 Olympics shortlist. FIFA's executive could be tempted by the prospect of staging the World Cup in the Arab world for the first time and the Qatari head of the Asian Football Confederation will be a strong lobbyist within the executive committee. Weak points: The tiny size of the country and the poor ranking of its national team weaken Qatar's case. High temperatures and humidity during June and July will be a major factor against, as happened with the 2016 Olympics. Qatar's attempts to bolster its national team by handing out passports to foreign footballers has attracted recent FIFA criticism. Association: United States Founded: 1913 Previous World Cup hosts: 1 (1994) Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 8 (1930, 1934, 1950, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: The U.S has an abundance of top-class, modern stadiums to choose from in cities well accustomed to hosting major events. Construction costs would be limited as there are so many ready-to-go stadiums. Strong points: The stadiums, infrastructure and the tried and tested ability to handle big events makes the U.S a very safe bet from a logistical point of view. FIFA will also be attracted by the goal of spreading soccer's popularity in such a huge market that has yet to be fully sold on the game. Weak points: The U.S hosted the finals in 1994 and some may feel it needs to wait a little longer until its turn comes around again. The lack of mass passion for the game could also count against the U.S in the eyes of traditionalists. Association: Mexico Founded: 1927 Previous World Cup hosts: 2 (1970, 1986) Previous World Cup champions: 0 Previous World Cup participation: 13 (1930, 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006) Stadiums: Mexico City's Azteca stadium hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cups and was way ahead of its time. While other countries were still favouring running tracks around the pitch, the Azteca was built close to the action and gives all 114,000 occupants an excellent view. It has begun to look faded. Other stadiums are likely to need major rebuilding or replacement. Strong points: Mexico's previous two World Cups have, in playing terms, produced some of the tournament's most memorable moments and two of the most famous individual performances, with Pele inspiring Brazil in 1970 and Diego Maradona for Argentina in 1986. Passionate, colourful fans and relatively little soccer hooliganism also contribute to an excellent atmosphere. Weak points: The World Cup has changed enormously since 1986 and Mexico's infrastructure will need an significant overhaul to reach the standards demanded and accommodate the larger numbers. Spiralling crime rates are also a concern, in terms of street crime, muggings and express kidnappings as well as a vicious drugs war which killed 5,700 people last year. Taking the World Cup to Mexico for a record third time could prove a hard sell
