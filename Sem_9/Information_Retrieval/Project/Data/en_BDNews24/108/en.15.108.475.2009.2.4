 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid on Wednesday urged the opposition to return to the House, reasserting that he would be able to reorganise seating arrangement in the next session. He said he had nothing to do with the redeployment of the Special Security Force (SSF) for the Leader of the Opposition Khaleda Zia. He also said he had no knowledge of Khaleda's security threat, for which, the BNP alleged, she could not come to parliament. The main opposition BNP MPs went to the speaker in the day and demanded the restoration of the SSF and reshuffle of the parliament's seating arrangements. "They told me about the redeployment of the SSF for the Leader of the Opposition. But I have nothing to do with it as this is a matter of the government," Abdul Hamid told reporters at his office. "I have told them that I will reach the opposition's sentiment to the prime minister," he said. Hamid said the previous BNP government had set a bad precedent of withdrawing SSF for the Leader of the Opposition. "After 2001 elections, the then government withdrew the SSF for the then Leader of the Opposition (Sheikh Hasina). It proves no-one should think that they would be in power for ever," he said. The BNP, which had four front row seats in the House, demanded that it should get three more frontline seats. "They did not inform me that her (Khaleda) security is being compromissed," Hamid said. The two-time speaker said the relations between the treasury and the opposition would have improved if the BNP MPs were in the House. "I am hopeful that I can reshuffle the seating arrangements in the next session. But I cannot say in advance what specific measures I can do for them since many factors are involved in the process," said Hamid. "But they should come to the House first. I really feel sorry for the absence of the opposition," said Hamid. bdn
