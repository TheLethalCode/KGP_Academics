A police official confirmed an incident had taken place at the university but had no immediate details. Dagan himself and officials at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm could not be reached for comment. Last December, an Iraqi journalist hurled both shoes at former US President George W. Bush when he was on a farewell visit to Iraq in December. Then last Monday a protester threw a shoe at Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during a speech at Cambridge University in England.
