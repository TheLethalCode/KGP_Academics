 Washington, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday fielded questions about whether she might ban using private security contractors (unlikely) to protect U.S. diplomats and whether her husband might play saxophone at the State Department (no commitment). In an hour-long town hall at the State Department, Clinton also told U.S. diplomats and civil servants she had ordered a review of whether the department can treat same-sex partners in the same way it treats heterosexual spouses. The former senator and presidential candidate displayed some of her political skills during the question-and-answer session, easily juggling queries about national security and personnel policies and occasionally showing a lighter side. "During my presidential campaign -- you know I ran for president," she said, pausing for effect and prompting laughter from the audience. "You know, I sometimes totally forget that. It was like a blur ... went by so fast." Responding to an intern's question, Clinton said the department should try to minimize the use of private security contractors like Blackwater Worldwide, whose guards are accused of killing Iraqi civilians while protecting U.S. diplomats. Iraq has said it will not renew Blackwater's license. The State Department last week said it would not renew its Iraq contract with the firm, which has denied wrongdoing in a 2007 incident in which its guards opened fire in Baghdad traffic, killing at least 14 unarmed Iraq civilians. "We should, in so far as possible, diminish our reliance on private security contractors," she said. "Whether we can go all the way to banning, under current circumstances, seems unlikely." One diplomat said his partner did not receive some benefits that the State Department routinely gives married heterosexual couples, adding that if he were evacuated from his post, his partner could be "left to fend for himself in a war zone." A State Department spokeswoman declined to specify which benefits are not extended to same-sex partners. Clinton said she was troubled by the practice, had asked for it to be reviewed and regarded the matter "as an issue of workplace fairness, employee retention and the safety and effectiveness of our embassy communities." One woman who organizes lunchtime concerts at the department asked if Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, might like to play the saxophone at an annual talent show. "Any time he wants to come and play his saxophone, we would love to have him, so pass that on to him," she said. "Thank you for that very kind invitation," Clinton replied. "I was holding my breath when you were leading up to who you were going to invite. You invited the right member of my family," she added, drawing a laugh. bd
