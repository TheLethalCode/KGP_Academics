 KINGSTON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An imposing partnership from Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan built a firm foundation for West Indies as they reached 160 for one in reply to England's 318 all out on the second day of the first test. Skipper Gayle (71) produced a composed innings with the concentration and discipline he has often been accused of lacking and Sarwan (74) was back to form after his disappointing tour of New Zealand. England's first innings total, boosted by a smart knock of 64 from Matt Prior after they resumed on 236 for five overnight, appeared solid on a slow Sabina Park track but the reply leaves the tourists with a lot of work to do on the third day. The solitary wicket for England came via the trial referral system, opener Devon Smith given out lbw to Andrew Flintoff by the third umpire, but 'trial by television' also handed the West Indians a vital reprieve. Sarwan was on just five when he was rapped on the pads by Steve Harmison and umpire Tony Hill raised his finger but after the West Indians referred the ruling to the third umpire, Daryl Harper, the decision was overturned. The television images indicated the ball hit Sarwan too high and the little Guyana right-hander took advantage of his second chance to build a sensible and well-paced innings. His partner Gayle, like Kevin Pietersen in his knock of 97 on the opening day, largely restrained his instinct for stroke play although he began in fiery fashion by blasting Flintoff's second ball of the day over mid-on and into the stand and later Harmison and spinner Monty Panesar went for sixes. Flintoff, who responded to the six with the only genuinely dangerous bouncer of the match so far, bowled with real pace and aggression, putting aside any lingering doubts about his fitness. He was the only real threat on a surface that gives little help to medium-pacers such as Harmison and Broad. Most disappointingly for England, Panesar's slow left-arm spin was largely ineffective a day after his counterpart Benn had produced notable turn and bounce. England might regret not making more of their overnight platform - they added only 82 for the loss of five wickets after losing Flintoff early, the all-rounder failing to add to his overnight 43. Jerome Taylor then removed Stuart Broad but Prior was tougher proposition for the home side though, playing some smart shots before he was dismissed caught and bowled by spinner Benn who ended with impressive figures of 4-77 from 44.2 overs. Harmison and Panesar were dismissed shortly after lunch and then it was a long and largely fruitless day in the field for the tourists
