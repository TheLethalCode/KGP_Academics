 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP boycott of the parliament session continued on Tuesday as the Speaker showed no sign of change in the seating plan. "We are awaiting the Speaker's positive decision to help us go back to the session," opposition chief whip Joynal Abedin Faruque said after a BNPPP meeting in the opposition deputy leader's room on Tuesday. "The meeting was adjourned until Wednesday afternoon with a hope for respectable number of seats," he said. BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury chaired the BNP parliamentary party meeting at 5 pm. Three MPs from Jamaat and Bangladesh Jatiya Party also attended the meeting. Opposition leader and BNP chairperson did not attend Tuesday's meeting though Joynal earlier said she would. "Khaleda couldn't make it to the parliament as SSF security has been withdrawn from her and she felt insecured," Joynal told a press briefing Tuesday. "We too are worried about her safety." The opposition bench started boycotting the parliament sessions since Jan 28 on grounds of re-arranged seating plans. The opposition chief whip also demanded of the authorities inclusion of opposition leader-nominated MPs in the special parliamentary committees. Khaleda Zia proposed inclusion of SQ Chowdhury and MK Anwar in the special committee on the 122 Ordinances passed by the last caretaker government, he said. "But Chowdhury was dropped and Joynal Abedin Faruque was included instead in the committee," he said. "It is sad that it happened against the will of the opposition leader." "None from the opposition has been included in the council of chairmen of the parliament," he said. BNP MP Alhajj Mosharraf Hossain was present among others in the meeting. bdne
