<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Sri Lanka women's cricket team recorded a convincing seven-wicket win over their Pakistani counterparts in the Grameenphone Tri-National Series at Shaheed Chandu Stadium on Saturday. Sri Lanka reached 105 for seven in 30.4 overs after bundling Pakistan out for 103 in 41.4 overs. Put in to bat first, Pakistan fell into trouble to be reduced to 26 for four inside 13 overs and never recovered from the damage in the face of some disciplined bowling from the Island bowlers. However, tail-enders Arman Khan (25), Almas Akram (19) and Javeria Khan (11) and middle order batswoman Sna Mir (15) put on some runs on the board to help Pakistan go beyond the 100-mark. In reply, Sri Lankan opener C Polgampala fell to Asmavia Iqbal for two runs, but opener D De Silva (19) and H Fernando (23) repaired the damage to take the side to 39 for two before being bowled by Javeraia Khan, who rattled the top order to return three for three. Alam Akran wrecked the middle order with three for 17, but could not stop Sri Lanka from their triumph as S De Alwis and E Kaushalya struck 17 and 16 respectively to guide Sri Lanka home. bd
