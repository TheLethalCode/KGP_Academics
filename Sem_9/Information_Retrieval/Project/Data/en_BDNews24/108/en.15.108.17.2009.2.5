 BAGHDAD,Thu Feb 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed by a suicide bomber in northeastern Iraq on Thursday, shortly before election authorities were due to give the first official results of last week's provincial ballot. The election was widely expected to show gains for the law-and-order bloc of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, giving him a major boost ahead of a parliamentary election at the end of the year. The independent election commission was due to hold a news conference in the late afternoon. The election for regional councils that name powerful governors in 14 of 18 provinces was Iraq's first vote since 2005 and the most peaceful in the war-battered country since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. However, a suicide bomber killed 15 people and wounded 15 others in volatile northeastern Diyala province on Thursday, police said, the bloodiest attack in Iraq in weeks and a reminder of the fragility of recent security gains. The attack took place in a popular restaurant in Khanaqin, an area on the border with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in Iraq's north, which has witnessed tension in the past between government and Kurdish forces. Although official tallies have been under wraps, rivals of the prime minister have acknowledged his State of Law coalition did surprisingly well in the provincial ballot, probably coming first in Iraq's two biggest cities, Baghdad and Basra. That would give Maliki -- once seen as a weak leader installed by more powerful Shi'ite parties -- his own power base in the provinces and strengthen his hand ahead of the national election
