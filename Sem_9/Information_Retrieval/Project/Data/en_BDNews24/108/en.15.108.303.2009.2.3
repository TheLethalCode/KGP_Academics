The capital also finds individuals arriving to share new ways of expressing our opinion as global citizens. The theme of this year's Chobi Mela V is 'Freedom', which encompasses freedom of expression, and the international event also inevitably brings a global aura. bdnews24.com spoke to Turi Munthe, the exuberant thirty-something founder and CEO of street news wire agency DEMOTIX, which exemplifies the ethos of global citizen journalism, publishing photo-based stories from every corner of the world. "We are looking for photos and writers from Bangladesh and with such extraordinary variety of life here, photos and stories should pour in," says Munthe, his expectation high from what he has observed during his visit so far.

"We also sell these stories on to big media houses and the earnings are split in half. The writer gets half and we get half." What is the purpose of DEMOTIX, what makes the site different when, for news, people can just click on to Reuters or AP?
