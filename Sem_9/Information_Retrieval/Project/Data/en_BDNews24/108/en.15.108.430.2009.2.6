 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  The agitating first-batch qualifiers of the 27th BCS examinations, who failed to pass the second-round test, have announced to resume their "hunger strike until death" from Monday to pressure authorities for their recruitment. Mahfuzur Rahman, a candidate, made the announcement on behalf of demonstrating candidates at a rally at Shahbagh intersection in the city on Friday morning. A number of agitators and their guardians took out a procession from the Central Shaheed Minar, with participants bearing coffins and shouting slogans against Bangladesh Public Service Commission chairman Sa'dat Hussain. As the protestors tried to march towards the Prime Minister's Office after rounding up the Dhaka University campus, police intercepted them at Shahbagh intersection, where the agitators held the rally. They demanded that the government appointed them on the basis of recommendation a former adviser to the caretaker government had made those recommendations in Nov. last year. Following the adviser's assurance, the agitators had suspended their hunger strike. The PSC originally advertised on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams. As many as 136105 people applied and 118339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The PSC recalled 16418 for oral exams and declared 3,567 candidates successful, asking authorities to appoint them. However, allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism had marred the transparency of the 'first-batch' results. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results on May 30 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and to establish transparency in the wake of allegations of irregularities. The new results were published on Sept. 23 after 16 months of dispute and legal wrangles, and 10412 examinees passed in the 'second batch' after fresh oral tests. However, the government's decision to recall the original results triggered outrage among the first qualified batch, who had called for the removal of the PSC chairman. They have been holding ongoing protests, including hunger strikes. bdnews24
