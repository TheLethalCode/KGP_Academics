<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh, chair of the LDC Group of nations, has urged WTO in Geneva to guarantee duty-free quota-free market access for the group. "Foreign minister Dr Dipu Moni urged that the current round of WTO negotiations must ensure the long pending duty-free quota-free market access for the least developed countries (LDCs)," said a statement issued Tuesday by Bangladesh's permanent mission in Geneva. The foreign minister, in talks with WTO director general Pascal Lamy, stressed the need for an early outcome of the negotiations specifically addressing the concerns of the LDCs, said the statement. "The minister also emphasised the special priority for the LDCs under trade in services negotiations," it added. Dipu Moni was in Geneva for the Universal Periodic Review of Bangladesh at the UN Human Rights Council. "Lamy lauded Bangladesh's active engagement in the WTO and leadership role in promoting the cause of the LDCs," the statement said. Lamy briefed the minister on the current status of the WTO negotiations, according to the statement. The statement said Dipu Moni also met the Inter-Parliamentary Union's secretary-general Anders B Johnsson in Geneva. "The minister briefed the secretary general on the smooth transition to parliamentary democracy through holding of free, fair and transparent elections. "The two discussed the process of re-entry of Bangladesh to IPU following return of democracy in the country," the statement said. The matter would be considered at the next IPU meeting in April 2009, the statement quoted the secretary-general as saying. "The current status of the cases relating to 21 August grenade attack and murder of SAMS Kibria also featured in their discussion," it said. bdn
