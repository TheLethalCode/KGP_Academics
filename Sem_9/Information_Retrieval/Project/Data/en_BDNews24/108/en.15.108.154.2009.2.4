The exhibition, titled 'Blood Splinter of Jute', is purposely sited in the unusual space outside of the capital's conventional galleries as part of Chobi Mela V - the International Festival of Photography 2009. The show depicts "a bloodstained story of the golden thread of the golden fibre of Bangladesh", say the festival's organisers. It shows the present status of what was once a flourishing industry of the countrygradual unemployment, lack of government patronisation, shut down of factories, and "exploitation causing the death of thousands of jute mill workers".
