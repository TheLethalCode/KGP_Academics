 ATLANTA, Tue Feb 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A drop in gift-card use and a reliance on post-holiday clearance sales are likely to be the main culprits when major US retailers report lower January sales results this week. And as consumer spending wilts further under the stress of a deepening recession and rising unemployment, the results may signal more gloom for the rest of the year. "January is going to be a particularly tough month," said Kim Picciola, a retail analyst with Morningstar. She said the "gift buying imperative" of the holiday season is gone and consumers now don't have a reason to spend beyond buying the basics. Analysts expect January sales at stores open at least a year to show a 2.5 percent drop from a year earlier, according to the most recent Thomson Reuters data. That would be the worst sales month since Thomson Reuters began tracking sales data in 2000. "There will be more store closures and more cost-cutting coming from the retail world as retailers respond to what is shaping up to be a really dismal consumer environment for 2009," Picciola said. On Monday, Macy's Inc became the latest major store chain to cut jobs, freeze executive salaries and pare capital spending for 2009. The parent of Bloomingdale's and Macy's said it would slash about 7,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its workforce, and shave its quarterly dividend by more than half. It said same-store sales could fall 6 percent to 8 percent this year. In recent years, January has become an important month for retailers as consumers redeem gift cards received over Christmas. But with 2008 gift-card sales suffering in the most dismal holiday shopping season in nearly 40 years, analysts are not expecting much of a lift this year. Gift cards "will help in clearing out clearance inventory but I wouldn't expect a major bump-up from gift-card spending," said Sarah Henry, retail analyst with MFC Global Investment Management. VALUE IN VOGUE Retail leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc is expected to post a 0.8 percent same-store sales rise at US stores. BJ's Wholesale Club Inc and Fred's Inc are also expected to eke out sales gains as consumers continue to trade down to lower-priced chains. With retailers expected to comment on sales trends and update profit forecasts for the fourth quarter and coming year, analysts will be keeping an eye on margins and inventory levels heading into the spring selling season. "The last thing you want as a retailer is to be stuck with (fully discounted) Christmas inventory going into the spring," Henry said. Apparel retailers, with an expected 11 percent same-store sales decline, may turn in the worst January performance. Department stores are estimated to be down 10.6 percent. Colder temperatures in January hampered sales in some parts of the country. "Inclement weather may have supported staples purchases, but likely discouraged visits to the malls and early seasonal purchases," Standard & Poor's Equity analysts said in a research note. Beyond January, many retail watchers are not banking on a spring sales pickup. Analysts said consumers' lack of motivation to spend, rising unemployment and falling prices will keep retail conditions weak in 2009. "Consumers are going to remain extremely cautious in the first half of the year given everything that is going on," said Morningstar's Picciola. This caution will carry over into the second half, she added
