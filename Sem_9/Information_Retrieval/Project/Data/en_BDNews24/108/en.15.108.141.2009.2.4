 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) - Grameenphone, the country's leading mobile phone operator, has earned the right to sponsor this month's women's tri-series cricket tournament, involving hosts Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The officials announced the sponsor on Wednesday at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, where Grameenphone chief communication officer Rubaba Dowla, Bangladesh Cricket Board's marketing and commercial committee chairman Aziz Al Kaiser Titu were among those present. Grameenphone is also sponsoring the Bangladesh team in the seven-match series. It will be the first Bangladesh is hosting a women's tri-nation series. The BCB also unveiled the winners' trophy in presence of team captains Salma Khatun (Bangladesh), Urooj Mumtaz (Pakistan) and Sashikala Siriwardene (Sri Lanka). Pakistan and Sri Lanka will also be gearing up for the next women's World Cup in March in the tournament, in which Bangladesh get an opportunity to test their mettle at the highest level of women's cricket. The matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be considered as one-day internationals, but Bangladesh's matches will be considered exhibition matches as they are yet to gain one-day status. Bangladesh had earlier beaten Pakistan in the first-leg and went close to another win in the second-leg match of the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka, which has boosted Bangladesh skipper Salma Khatun's confidence for the upcoming series. "We have a strong bowling side and if the batters can go with the bowlers, I think we can win the tournament," said the middle-order-batswoman-cum-off-spinner Salma during the trophy unveiling programme. Pakistan captain Mumtaz said that they were also looking for their best in the tournament. "It is not an easy job for women playing cricket in Pakistan. But, we will be trying to make a good impression in the tournament." Sri Lanka captain Siriwardene said the game has been become hugely popular among Sri Lankan women after hosting the Asia Cup and they are now looking forward to adding another feather to their team's cap by winning the tournament. "We have taken this tournament very seriously. It will be our last before the World Cup in Australia, so we will try to give our best," she said on her team's arrival in Dhaka on Wednesday. The first three matches of the tournament will be played at Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra on Feb 6, 7 and 9, while the next three group matches will be held at Birsreshtha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna on February 12, 13 and 14.
