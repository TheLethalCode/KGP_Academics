 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24,.com)  Aslam Ali struck an unbeaten 49 as Khelaghar SKS emerged champions in the First Division Twenty20, inflicting a six-wicket defeat to Kalabagan KC in the final at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium on Monday. Khelaghar reached the target of 91 losing six in the stipulated 20 overs after Kalabagan made a modest 90 all out with nine balls to spare. Winning the toss, Kalabagan decided to bat first, but fell in trouble with scoreboard reading 37 for three inside seven overs. Shahbab Ali (18), M Kalim (13) and Imtiaz Rahman (12) crossed the digits for Kalabagan as Morshed Shawon, Enamul Haq and Mollah kept them in tight to return two wickets each. Set to chase an easy target, Khelaghar lost openers Rakib and Niaz inside the third over, but one-down Aslam shouldered the responsibility to steer the side home in the last delivery of the final over. Aslam was just one run short of half century, but he clubbed two sixes and one four facing 58 balls while SM Zakaria provided a fine support with a 21-ball 18. bd
