The White House has ordered the two departments to looks at costs and benefits of transferring two national laboratories that design weapons, the site in Nevada where they can be tested, as well as all or part of four plants that build and maintain bombs and store weapons fuel, the Times said. The idea was contained in a document the White House Office of Management and Budget sent the two departments, a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper.

Officials from the Energy Department had no comment, it said
