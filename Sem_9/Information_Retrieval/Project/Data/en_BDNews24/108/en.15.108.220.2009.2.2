 Dhaka, Feb 02 (bdnews24.com) The government is hopeful of repatriating funds allegedly received in kickbacks by Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, and confiscated by the US government, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told parliament on Monday. But the government cannot release a further list of graft suspects prepared by the US, said the minister during the questions and answers session. Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim asked the finance minister whether a full list of those suspected by the US of laundering money would be made public. The Awami League MP asked, "I want to know what measures are being taken to get back [Coco's] money." "Who else are on the list? Will the list be published?" Selim asked. The finance minister said, "Some measures have already been taken to retrieve Coco's money." The minister said a case had been filed in a US district court regarding 'illegal funds' seized from a Singapore account owned by Coco. "We are hopeful that we will be able to take the money back from the US government, subject to the verdict of the court and negotiations with the US government," said the finance minister. "But it is not possible to release any list (of corruption suspects). This is a matter of investigation. "We cannot say where the investigation will end. I cannot say anything further for the sake of the investigation," Muhith told the House. bdnews2
