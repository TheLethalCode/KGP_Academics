"A scan today has confirmed a tear in the hamstring of Steven's left leg. He will be out of action for about three weeks," the club said on their website (www.liverpoolfc.tv) on Thursday. The England midfielder was substituted after 16 minutes of his side's FA Cup fourth-round replay defeat by Everton at Goodison Park. The injury will rule him out of league games against Portsmouth and Manchester City and possibly the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie in Madrid on Feb. 25. He also misses England's friendly against Spain in Seville on Feb. 11. Gerrard has played 35 games this season for club and country, including four in 10 days culminating in Wednesday's 1-0 loss.
