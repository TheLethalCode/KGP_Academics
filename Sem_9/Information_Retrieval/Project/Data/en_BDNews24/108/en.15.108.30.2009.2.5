 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  A group of human-rights and development organisations have welcomed the government's pledges to hold war crimes trials in line with international standards, declare zero tolerance towards torture and extrajudicial killings. Foreign minister Dipu Moni made the pledges at Bangladesh's Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Feb. 3. Known as the UPR forum, 17 organisations, , including Ain O Salish Kendra, Steps, Nagorik Uddyog and Naripokko, however, said the minister failed to make any clear time-bound or actionable commitments on specific measures. "We believe that this elected government, as the representative of the people and given its overwhelming mandate, could have clearly articulated and reiterated commitments made nationally to the people of Bangladesh before the international community," a joint statement of the organisations issued by Ain O Salish Kendra on Thursday said. "It is unfortunate [we have been demanding] human rights implementation in Bangladesh over the seven years including an end to extra-judicial killings and implementation of CHT Accord." The organisations urged the government to ensure that the UPR commitments were raised for consideration before the parliament. They also asked for holding substantive and issue-based dialogues with civil society and human-rights groups to review and monitor the outcome document The organisations also urged for establishment of standing mechanisms nationally to enable ongoing review of the UPR commitments as well as national obligations to protect human rights. This can be done through setting up a parliamentary standing committee on human rights and also through interactive dialogue with human-rights organisations
