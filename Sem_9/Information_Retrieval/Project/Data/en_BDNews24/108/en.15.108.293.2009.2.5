<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited retained the second B. League title with a match to go when the sky blues handed a 2-1 defeat to Sheikh Russel KC in their penultimate round match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Thursday. Arif Khan Joy and Jahid Hasan Emily struck one goal apiece for the champions while Alfaz Ahmed pulled one goal back for Shiekh Russel. The eighth straight win in the second phase of the league helped Abahani take an unassailable lead of 47 from 19 outings, 12 points clear of joint Mohammedan Sporting Club and Sheikh Russel, who have 35 points each. Mohammedan SC, however, played a match less than Sheikh Russel's 18. Abahani had started the second edition of the professional league with a shocking 2-1 loss to lowly Rahmatganj MFS, but they recovered from the early damage to finish top after the first-leg 10 matches with three points lead over Mohammedan and Brothers Union. The Dhanmondi-based outfit again stumbled in the start of the second leg with a goalless draw against Farashganj SC, but they bounced back to put up superb show to beat title contenders Mohammedan, Brothers and Sheikh Russel on their eighth consecutive triumphs in the second leg to ensure the most prestigious domestic title. Back to the match, Abahanai, who needed just one point to ensure the title, looked a bit in a defensive mood to allow Sheikh Russel to build attacks and Sheikh Russel yielded a fine chance when Abu Morshed released the ball for winger Mobarak Hossain before Abahani defender Wali Faisal cleared it for a corner in the ninth minute. It took almost half and hour for Abahani to have a shot on the target when Nigerian striker Emeka Christina dragged his effort wide from a close range. It was again Emeka, who rattled Sheikh Russel crossbar in the 45th minute and it appeared in Abahani wake-up from the slumber and holding midfielder Arif Khan Joy put the sky blues ahead in the first-half stoppage time from a goal-mouth mle. Joy's first effort following a corner came off the opponent crossbar to fall to Emily and Nazrul's shot on Emily's lob was parried by the defenders, but Joy drove the follow-up past substitute goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury, who replaced regular Khaled Azam Biplob just before the first-half whistle. After the break, it was a totally different Abahani, who bossed the second half and created a good number of scoring chances, but unfortunately they could take only one of them home. Emeka set up Emily inside the box and the striker danced past two defenders and keeper Titu to tap the ball home in the 56th minute. Coach Amolesh Sen would have wondered why his side were not more than 2-0 up after the regulation time as Abahani twice rattled the woodwork in the second half and squandered at least three scoring chances. When everyone was preparing to leave their seat thinking of a 2-0 margin, ace striker Alfaz Ahmed headed a Rajon Mia cross home in the dying minutes for Sheikh Russel to raise his goal tally to 15. Sheikh Russel went 3-0 down to Abahani in the first-leg match. "The team combination helped us retain the title as most of the players are together over two years," said coach Amolesh Sen. Sen said they had started badly in the early stage of the league, but recovered from bad patch following tremendous efforts from the players. Abahani's long-serving coach said that they would try to keep this combination intact in the AFC President's Cup at home. Captain Nazrul Islam said that three things -- good understanding among the team mates, team spirit and hard work -- helped them clinch the title. bd
