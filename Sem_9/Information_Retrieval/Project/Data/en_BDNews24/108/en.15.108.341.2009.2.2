 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has issued a contempt of court ruling against Prothom Alo assistant editor Mizanur Rahman Khan. A two-judge bench of Syed AB Mahmudul Huq and Moinul Islam Chowdhury also issued a show-cause notice on Khan ordering him to reply within two weeks as to why punitive measures should not be taken against him. It directed Khan to attend the next hearing on Feb 18. The Bangla-language daily published a report by Khan on Jan. 29 that said the incidents centring around the extension of bail for former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar's were "unique scandals". The report also alleged that a dual bench of the High Court deviated from the direction of the Appellate Division, as noted lawyer Rafiq-ul-Huq and his junior counsel Ehsanul Huq concealed information in the case. At Monday's hearing, advocate Ahsanul Karim, representing Rafiq-ul-Huq, said the Prothom Alo report, based on "false and wrong information", was contempt of court. No information was concealed at any stage of Babar's case, Karim said. He said the High Court awarded Babar six-month bail, and the Appellate Division reduced it to 3 months and asked him to surrender within that time. Babar surrendered accordingly and was awarded three-month bail, though a petition was made from the attorney general's office for re-evaluation, said Karim. He said that the misleading report was published while the petition was under consideration. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq filed the contempt of court case on Feb. 1. bdnews24.
