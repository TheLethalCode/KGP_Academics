 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will not publish results of 40 out of 475 Upazila elections in a "first phase" gazette, in wake of allegations of irregularities during the January local body polls, said an election official on Wednesday. "The results of 435 Upazila will be out within a couple of days, having already been sent to the government press for printing," said the EC Secretariat's senior assistant secretary Md Abdul Baten. The 3rd Upazila Parisad polls were held on Jan 22 to 475 of the 481 local government bodies across the country. The EC suspended polls to six Upazila on charges of irregularities and violence, on or before election day. The Commission halted results of seven more, ordering judicial probes into charges of misconduct. "The EC has since decided not to publish results to another 33 Upazila until further scrutiny," said Baten on Wednesday. "After scrutiny, the Commission will decide whether these results are sound, and may be published in a 'second phase' gazette, or whether judicial enquiries will be required," said Baten. "Of the 435 to be gazetted in the first phase, some six Upazila will show only partial results. The rest will give all three results for chairmen, vice-chairmen and vice chairwomen," said Baten. bdnews2
