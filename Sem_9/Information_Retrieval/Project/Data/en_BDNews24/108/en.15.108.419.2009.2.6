 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh strike bowler Mashrafee Bin Mortaza says his being sold in auction to Indian Cricket League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders at nearly Tk 4.2 crore was a result of hard work he had put in over the years. "Obviously I am pleased. I feel this is a result of all the hard work I have put in over the years and also a reward for being consistent this season," said Mashrafee in his immediate reaction. "I have a lot of friends and fans in India. That's why I am excited. I love being there and it is a pleasure to play in India," said an excited Mashrafee. Kolkata Knight Riders, led by former India captain Saurav Ganguly, dramatically bought Mashrafee for $ 600000 in the most sensational bidding for the crickters in the IPL auction in Goa on Friday. Bollywood star Shahruk Khan-owned Kolkata roped in Mashrafee for 12 times his floor price of $ 50000 as Kings XI Punjab stake-holder Bollywood actress Priety Zinta also locked horns to get the all-rounder. Mashrafee said he had often conversations with Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh, who had promised to bring him to his side. The right-handed pacer said he never thought he would be valued as much and said he had expected to be sold at a maximum of $ 1 lakh. The 25-year old said his teammate Tamim Iqbal had called to break the news to him when he was about to say his Juma prayers. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful was also picked by Mumbai Indians at his base price of $ 75,000, but Shakib Al Hasan, world's number one allrounder in ICC one-day ranking, and Tamim Iqbal, the left-handed opener, however remained unsold in the auction. "I would have been a lot happier if Shakib had got a team because he truly deserved it for his sensational form with the bat and the ball," said a gloomy Mortaza. Mashrafee is now the eighth in the ICC ODI ranking for bowlers and he wants to prove his worth in the Twenty20 league. "Kolkata is just next door and I know how much people over there admire Bangladeshi cricketers. The auction is over now and my challenge is to go over there and prove my worth." Ashraful said Mashrafee and his move to the IPL was an encouraging sign for Bangladesh cricket. "Shakib missing out was a bit of a shock because he is one player who has dominated in both forms of international cricket this season. But I guess luck is also a factor in auctions. "Nevertheless I am very happy for Mashrafee. It is also positive for our cricket that two of us have been chosen after stiff competition." The Bangladesh captain also revealed that signing for Mumbai Indians would allow him to realise a childhood dream. "It's no secret that Sachin Tendulkar has been an idol for me and as a youngster I dreamt of playing alongside Sachin some day and now we are in the same team.
