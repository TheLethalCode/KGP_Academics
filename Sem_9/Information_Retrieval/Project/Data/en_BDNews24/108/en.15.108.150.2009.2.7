<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel has said the government is ensuring security for opposition leader Khaleda Zia in line with the law. "If necessary, more steps will be taken to provide extra security but the home ministry does not have the power to dispatch SSF (Special Security Force) as it's not within the ministry's jurisdiction," said the state minister, popularly known as Sohel Taj. He was speaking to reporters after a meeting on law and order chaired by home minister Sahara Khatun. The state minister said security measures for Feb 21's Ekushey celebrations were discussed alongside regular law and order issues. "We can never say that the law and order situation is perfect, but we must never be complacent and work to ensure that the situation is always under control," observed Tanjim Ahmed. On a special five day anticrime crackdown in Dhaka, which began from Feb 5, the state minister said, "The drive is still on, we cannot yet assess its successes and failures." "We shall evaluate the results of the drive in due time and present it before the people as this government believes in transparency." Asked whether the government was "fearing any attacks", Sohel Taj said: "We have no specific information on particular threats. But we are always taking measures to stay one step ahead." bdnew
