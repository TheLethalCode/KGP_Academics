 COLOMBO, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gautam Gambhir smashed a career-best 150 to lead India to a 67-run victory over Sri Lanka in the fourth one-day international and a 4-0 series lead on Thursday. Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the leading wicket-taker in one-day internationals but his team were bowled out for 265 chasing a huge 333-run target following Gambhir's sixth one-day international century. Gambhir shared a 188-run partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored 94 from 96 balls, and Suresh Raina chipped in with 49 not out. Sri Lanka made a bright start to their chase with Tillakaratne Dilshan (38) and Sanath Jayasuriya (27) adding 55 for the first wicket. Both openers fell in quick succession but Kumar Sangakkara added a further 61 with Mahela Jayawardene (28). Wickets started to fall at regular intervals with Jayawardene caught behind, Thilina Kandamby (10) trapped lbw and Sangakkara caught in the deep for 56 and Sri Lanka offered little resistance after that. Muralitharan, also the highest wicket-taker in tests, passed Wasim Akram's 502-wicket limited-overs record when he had Gambhir caught behind in his last over. The 36-year-old off spinner, who reached the milestone in his 328th match, finished with figures of one for 66 from 10 overs. India, riding a wave of confidence having won their last eight games, lost the early wicket of Virender Sehwag but Dhoni and Gambhir weathered a tricky spell against the new ball before accelerating smoothly. Gambhir struck a six and 14 fours and faced 147 balls
