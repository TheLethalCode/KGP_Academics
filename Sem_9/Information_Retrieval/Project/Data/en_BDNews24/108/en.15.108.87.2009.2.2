<TITLE> Sri Lanka expected to host Champions Trophy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com) - Sri Lanka is the ICC's preferred venue for the Champions Trophy after it removed the tournament, which is scheduled for September and October, from Pakistan during its meeting in Perth. The safety and security situation in Pakistan was considered too risky and Haroon Lorgat, the ICC's chief executive, expected a decision on the new host would be confirmed "shortly". "There are a couple of issues to work through in regard to the weather in Sri Lanka at that time of year," Lorgat said in the West Australian. "The dates are confirmed and, given the heavy scheduling, there is no way they could be changed. There are no issues of safety and security there." The 2008 Champions Trophy was postponed by a year due to the problems in Pakistan and this year's tournament is scheduled to run from September 25 to October 5. While Pakistan will not be the hosts, the PCB will receive the revenue from the event. Sri Lanka hosted the Champions Trophy in September 2002 and the prize was shared after the final was played twice and washed out both times. Australia are the defending champions after winning in India in 2006. Courtesy: Cricin
