 LONDON,Mon Feb 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on Monday there was "light at the end of the tunnel" but called for strong and effective stimulus plans to boost economies hit by the global financial crisis. "In some places people are disappointed, people are frustrated and people are pessimistic. They are quickly unsettled by the current situation," Wen told a business conference in London. "There is light at the end of the tunnel....I am calling for confidence, cooperation and responsibility, I've been calling for that all along because if we do that we can save the world." The conference was also attended by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is preparing to host a summit of world leaders in April at which new measures to tackle the effects of the global credit crisis will be outlined. The Chinese government has already pledged 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) over the next two years to help boost domestic demand. Work is under way on projects including rebuilding earthquake-hit southwestern China and improving road and rail links. Wen told the Financial Times that more might be needed. "We may take further new, timely and decisive measures. All these measures have to be taken pre-emptively before an economic retreat," he said in an interview published late Sunday. Wen did not comment specifically Monday on whether China was planning additional measures to boost its economy. "We need to have very strong and effective stimulus plans, mainly fiscal stimulus plans. It is not (too) late if we do that now," he said. Wen said China planned to send delegations to Europe to buy commodities, goods and technologies. China has faced calls to boost domestic demand in order to help pull the global economy out of recession
