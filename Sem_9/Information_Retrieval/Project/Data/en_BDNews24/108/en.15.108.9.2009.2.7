 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24)  The government will take all necessary measures to gear up the capital market, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Saturday. "We want to raise the lion's share of funds needed for 25 percent investment growth, promised in our electoral manifesto, from the capital market," said Muhith. "For that we'll more than double the number of BO accounts to 50 lakhs from the existing 19 lakhs," said the finance minister. "The book-building system for IPO processing will be introduced by month-end or the first week of March to ease public offerings by fixing face value of shares," he said. He also announced that more state-owned entities would be floated on the market soon. He however admitted shortage of skilled manpower. "We must groom skilled manpower to revamp the capital market into a high-tech sector." Muhith said the government would work hard to expand the market and make it more participatory. Emerging from an emergency meeting with the boards of directors of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange on Saturday, the finance minister told reporters, "The government will make all-out efforts to boost the capital market." On the impact of the global crisis, Muhith said, "Falling prices in world markets caused bank shares to slide a bit." bdnews
