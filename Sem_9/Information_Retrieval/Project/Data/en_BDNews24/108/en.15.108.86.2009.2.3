 Tehran, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran launched its first home-made satellite into orbit on Tuesday, state television reported. "In another achievement for Iranian scientists under sanctions, Iran launched its first home-made Hope satellite into orbit," said the television, which carried footage of the launch. "(The satellite was) carried into orbit by Iran-made satellite carrier Safir," it said. Iran is under U.N. sanctions because the United States and other Western powers suspect Tehran is amassing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Tehran says its nuclear ambitions are limited to the peaceful generation of electricity to meet the demands of its economy.
