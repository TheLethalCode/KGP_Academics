 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited look to celebrate their B. League title triumph on Thursday against Sheikh Russel KC in their penultimate second-leg match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Reigning champions Abahani are just one point off the title with 44 points off 18 games, way ahead of second placed Sheikh Russel and Mohammedan Sporting Club, who have 35 points from 17 matches. If they fail to collect a point against Sheikh Russel, they would have to wait until the last match against Rahmatganj MFS to lift the prestigious professional football league title. Spirited Abahani, however, are flying high in the second phase of the league with seven consecutive wins under their belt and they have already overcome the hurdles of Mohammedan and Brothers Union in the second leg. The Dhanmondi-based outfit go to the match on the back of 3-0 drubbing of Brothers Union and are looking forward to fielding a full-strength squad against Sheikh Russel. Abahani coach Amoles Sen played holding midfielder Arif Khan Joy and playmaker Mamunul Islam in the latter part of the game against Brothers Union after his side were leading 2-0. "We have already completed 99 percent job on the way to retaining the title and waiting for the celebration on Thursday," said Sen. "We will go for win, not keeping the thing of draw in mind and the players are also ready for the battle," said Abahani's long-serving coach. The sky blues' boys can also get inspiration thinking of their 3-0 win over Sheikh Russel KC in the first-leg match. However, Sheikh Russel are looking forward to finishing second in the 11-team point table by winning all three remaining matches against Abahani, Rahmatganj MFS and Farashganj SC. "It is true that we are not in the race, but we are still hoping to finish second in the league and to complete the task, we have no alternative but to winning all three matches we have in our hand," said Sheikh Russel coach Wazed Gazi. The new football powerhouse, Sheikh Russel, are also enjoying an excellent run in the second phase with five wins out of seven and two draws against Mohammedan and Brothers. "We know Abahani are just one point away from the title. But, my boys will play for victory to finish second in the league," said Gazi. Gazi, however, will have to rely on his ace striker Alfaz Ahmed, who jointly leads the top-scorers list with 14 goals alongside Abahani's Nigerian striker Emeka Christina, as Sheikh Russel will miss the service of Moroccan striker Sami due to injury. Yet, it is Abahani's attacking pair of Emeka and Jahid Hasan Emily (11 goals), who are still potent in the opponents' box having together struck 25 goals
