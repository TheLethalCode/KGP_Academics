 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea have signed Portugal winger Ricardo Quaresma on loan from Inter Milan until the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday. Quaresma, a member of Portugal's Euro 2008 squad when Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge, failed to settle in Serie A after being signed by Inter boss Jose Mourinho five months ago. The 25-year-old, Chelsea's only signing of the January transfer window that closed on Monday, joins five compatriots in the first team. Quaresma began his career with Sporting before a move to Barcelona in 2003. He returned to Portugal to play for Mourinho's Porto, then the European champions, the following year. Signed for 18.6 million euros ($23.76 million) from Porto in September, he made a dreadful start to his Inter career and was heckled by the team's fans during the 1-1 home draw with Torino on Sunday. Also omitted from Inter's Champions League squad on Sunday, he was named 2008's worst Serie A player in December when he won a famous Italian radio award called the 'Golden Bin'. Mourinho bought him in a bid to recreate the three-pronged attack that was so successful for the Portuguese coach when he was at Chelsea but after a couple of months he dropped Quaresma and reverted to a diamond formation in midfield.
