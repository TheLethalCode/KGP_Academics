<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has asked the government to follow a go-slow policy on TIFA, transit and the proposed South Asian anti-terrorism task force, party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Wednesday. Demands for dialogues with the political parties before signing such deals were also made. "We are not against any international agreement, but the government is making haste on TIFA, transit and the South Asian anti-terrorism task force," the BNP leader said. "The government must not hasten to make such deals but discuss the issues with others and scrutinise the pros and cons," he argued. Delwar said, "The country's best interests must be given top priority before signing any such deal." While briefing reporters on the agenda of the BNP standing committee meeting at the party's Gulshan office in the evening, Delwar said the meeting discussed present law and order, possible TIFA with the USA, likely transit deal with India and the governmenmt initiatives to form a South Asian antiterrorism accord. The one and a half-hour meeting chaired by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expressed resentment at the 'government's reluctance' to provide adequate security for the opposition leader, he said. The BNP secretary general said the present security measures taken for the opposition leader were scanty compared with the safety provided to the former leader of the opposition in the eighth parliament. "There is not even close protection for Khaleda," he complained. Delwar said, "The home minister admitted that law and order had deteriorated but did not take measures for protecting the BNP chief." "The government gave a cold shoulder to our request for adequate security for our leader." About the transit Delwar said, "The government, though enjoying absolute majority in the parliament, must heed opposition opinions." "We want the treasury bench to take advice of the experts and of the opposition political parties in the interest of the country." "We ask the government to rise above the party interests," he said. The BNP standing committee meeting was also attended, among others, by former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Dr RA Ghani, Moudud Ahmed, former army chief Mahbubur Rahman and M Shamsul Islam. b
