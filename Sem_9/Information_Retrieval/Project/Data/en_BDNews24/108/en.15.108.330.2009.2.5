<TITLE> High inflation adds to Nepal Maoists' woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Thu Feb 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's inflation has reached its highest level in a decade as hikes in fuel and food prices prove the latest headache for a Maoist-led government struggling to win popular support. Year-on-year inflation to mid-December was 14 percent, more than double the same period a year ago, Nepal's central bank reported this week. Prices of staples jumped 17 percent in the month to mid-December. High inflation is a big setback for the government which was elected on promises to create a "new Nepal" after a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006. The Maoists laid down arms and won elections by promising to help the one third of Nepalis who live on less than a dollar a day. "This is a blow to the government," said Bishwambher Pyakuryal, who teaches economics at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu. The setback highlights Nepal's fragile transition to democracy after the civil war, where political parties may struggle to meet the high expectations of voters who had hoped the end of the monarchy would herald economic improvements. Nepal also has a crippling electricity shortage and has imposed power cuts of up to 12 hours a day, triggering some anti-government protests last month in Kathmandu. The Maoists have been criticised by other political parties for failing to return property seized during the conflict to owners and continuing violence and intimidation despite heading the government. Analysts say inflation has spiked because the country struggles with supply bottlenecks and has to import large quantities of consumer goods including food. Many of these imports come from neighbouring India which has also seen rising prices over the last year. Officials said higher global food and fuel prices had also contributed to higher inflation. "Prices of all items of daily consumption like rice, lentils, vegetables, cooking oil and kerosene have increased," said Kumar Gurung, a construction worker in Kathmandu. "But our wages have remained the same and it is hard to find work." A 30 kg bag of plain rice which cost less than $10 until two years go costs more than $15 now, he said. Gurung earns $2.5 dollars a day when work is available
