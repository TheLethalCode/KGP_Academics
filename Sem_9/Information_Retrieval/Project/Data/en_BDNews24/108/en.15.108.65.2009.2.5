<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Ekushey Boi Mela has some 60 stalls that cater to children's tastes this year, though they spread throughout the premises rather than giving a special 'corner' to kids literature. Bangladesh Computer Samity is drawing the most children with its array of cartoon CDs in addition to books. "The CDs here are entertaining as well as educational," Tazrina Ferdaus, with her young daughter, told bdnews24.com Wednesday after purchasing some 'fun' CDs on teaching the alphabet. Among the stalls with children's books are: Adiganta, Shabda Shaily, Mukta, Ankur Prokashani, Fulkali, Chotoder Mela, Hashi Prokashoni, Kishore Bhuban, Melam Shikar, Shabda Shilpa, Jatiya Grantha Kendra, Genius Publications and Bikash. Although there are 'corners' of the fair for other genres of books, however, there is no special corner just for children's books. "The publishers do not demand any corner for children's books," said Bangla Academy director Syed Mohammad Shahed. Adult visitors were seen to be stall-hopping, and making few purchases on Wednesday, as many said they could not find their choices. A total of 87 titles hit the fair on its fourth day. Organisers said a total of 23 novels topped the list. Of the others, 11 were collections of short stories, 7 were biographies, 3 of poetry, 3 political, 3 were compilations of articles, 1 was a travelogue, 1 research, 9 were children's literature and 2 of children's rhymes. bdnew
