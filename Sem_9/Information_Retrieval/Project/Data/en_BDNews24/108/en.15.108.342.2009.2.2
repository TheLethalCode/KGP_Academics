<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Digital land survey, expected to revolutionise land management, will take its first step outside Dhaka on Tuesday with a pilot project in Savar on the outskirts of the capital. "Digital land survey, which will gradually spread across the country, will relieve ordinary people of untold harassment as all land records will eventually be available online," land minister Rezaul Karim Hira told bdnews24.com Monday. "It will do away with uncountable irregularities," said Hira, who is expected to inaugurate the digital survey pilot scheme at a school in Savar. The Savar-based pilot project is expected to end by June this year, he said. The minister said many more pilots were being initiated throughout the country. "We hope the countrywide digital survey will be complete by the tenure of this government," he said. "The work of digital land survey has also started of almost all Mouja in the capital," Mahfuzur Rahman, director general of land department, told bdnews24.com. The layout of the Mouja and the documents of land owners that have already been published in the land department came from a digital survey that was first initiated in Tejgaon's six Mouja. "The digital survey of Dhaka's 190 Mouja, all except for one, will be complete by June this year," said Rahman hopefully. "We will then be able to upload a proper city land record on the land department's site," said the director general. The work for modernising traditional land management was firstly initiated in 1991 in the city, in association with Asian Development Bank. Rahman said the latest land survey in Dhaka city started in 1995-96 and came to an end in Dec. last year, while land surveys in 10 larger districts that began in 1985 were still continuing. "We'll recommend to the government that countrywide digital survey is conducted every five years," he said. bdnew
