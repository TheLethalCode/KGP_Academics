 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Newcomers Gazi Tank Cricketers stormed into the final of Premier Division Twenty20 with an emphatic eight-wicket win over holders Abahani Limited at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. Opener Imrul Kayes blazed an unbeaten 70 as Mohammad Ashraful's side raced to 137 for two with 17 balls to spare after bowling Abahani out for 134 in 19.3 overs. Mohammedan Sporting Club booked the final berth with a comprehensive five-wicket win over Biman Bangladesh Airlines in the second semifinal at the same venue. Opener Shamsur Rahman Shuvo struck 43 to guide Mohammedan to reach 101 for five in 16.4 overs after bundling Biman out for a paltry 99 in 18.5 overs. Losers Abahani and Biman lock horns in the place-deciding match before the final match takes place on Wednesday at the same venue. State-run BTV will telecast the final live from the venue. Abahani vs Gazi Tank Being asked to bat first on the flat wicket, opener Rony Talukdar gave Abahani a fine start smashing a 29-ball 49, but the reigning champions lost the way in the face of a fierce spell from pacer Rubel Hossain, who returned four for 24 . Muktar Ali drew the first blood for Gazi Tank, dismissing opener Imran Ahmed for three while left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior struck in his first over to uproot Sahagir Hossain's stumps for nine, leaving Abahani at 43 for two in 6.3 overs. Nasir Hossain edged first-change bowler Rubel to wicketkeeper Mithun Ali and in the next over Mohammad Younus removed Rony, who hit eight fours and one six. Captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was bowled by Rubel in the first delivery he faced. Later, Nadif Chowdhury chipped in with 30 off 32 balls while tailenders Rezaul Karim and Ziaur Rahman contributed 14 and 10 to take Abahani beyond the 100-mark. Gazi Tank, in reply, never seemed in trouble as Imrul Kayes played a fluent innings after opener M Mithun fell to Arafat Sunny for a nine-ball 16 and one-down Nafis Iqbal was trapped leg before by Rezaul for a run-a-ball 17. The left-handed opener drove Arafat for four to steer Gazi Tank home as he put on 72 runs for the unbroken third wicket with Ashraful, who remained unbeaten on 29 off 23 balls featuring three fours. Imrul's 56-ball innings was decked up with six sixes and four fours. "All credit goes to the players, who have been playing better since the start of the tournament though Imrul gave us a good start today like in the previous matches," said Ashraful. "Except in the fielding department, we have been bowling and batting better and hope to come good in all three departments in the final," said the Bangladesh national team captain. He added his target was to play good cricket after the failure against Zimbabwe. Mohammedan-Biman Biman, who chose to bat first, were reduced to 16 for five in 3.5 overs in the face of a vicious spell from pacer Sajudul Islam, who removed Jahurul Islam (5), Sanwar Hossain (2), Shakib Al Hasan (0) and Javed Omar (6) in his first two overs. Strike bowler Tareq Aziz Khan, however, made the inroad, bowling opener Nazmus Sadat out for one in the very fourth delivery of the innings. Biman could manage only 99 runs, riding on some contributions from late-order batsmen Mahbubul Alam (22), Abdur Razzak (17) and Shahadat Hossain (15). In reply, openers Shamsur Rahman and Nasiruddin Faruque gave Mohammedan a blistering start, milking 43 off 30 balls and 34 off 36 balls respectively. Mohammedan suffered a mini collapse in the middle with spinner Nabil Samad taking three wickets for 11. However, captain Suhrawardi Shuvo (10) and Marshal Ayub (one) remained unbeaten to take Mohammedan home
