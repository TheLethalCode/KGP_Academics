 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham returned to the England squad on Saturday when coach Fabio Capello named him in his 23 for Wednesday's friendly away to Spain. Beckham, who turns 34 in May, was left out of the squad for the friendly against Germany in November but now looks set to equal Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an outfield player by playing some part against the European champions in Seville. Capello is without several regulars, including injured midfielders Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole, while Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is also recovering from a hamstring strain. West Ham United's uncapped striker Carlton Cole is included after scoring six goals in his last eight club games while midfielder James Milner, also still to play for the senior team, joins five of his Aston Villa team mates in the squad. "(The game with Spain) is very important because it will be a different style of play," Capello told the FA website (www.thefa.com). "Against Germany they were the runners-up in the European Championship, but this will be different," he added referring to England's 2-1 win in Berlin last year. "I'm very interested in this game because Spain play fantastic football, very quick. But we are strong and I think England will be strong in Spain. "I am very confident in my team." Former England captain Beckham, who has 107 caps, has been in impressive form for AC Milan since joining the Italians on a two-month loan from American club Los Angeles Galaxy. He has started all five games since arriving at the San Siro, scoring two goals, and Milan are keen to make the deal permanent if they can agree a deal with Galaxy. Squad: Goalkeepers: David James (Portsmouth), Robert Green (West Ham United), Joe Hart (Manchester City) Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Manchester City), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), Glen Johnson (Portsmouth), John Terry (Chelsea), Matthew Upson (West Ham United), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Luke Young (Aston Villa) Midfielders: Gareth Barry (Aston Villa), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), James Milner (Aston Villa), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Stewart Downing (Middlesbrough), David Beckham (LA Galaxy), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City), Ashley Young (Aston Villa) Forwards: Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa), Carlton Cole (West Ham United), Peter Crouch (Portsmouth), Emile Heskey (Aston Vill
