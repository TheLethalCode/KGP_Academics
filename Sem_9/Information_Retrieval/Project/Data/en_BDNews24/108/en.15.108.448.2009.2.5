<TITLE> Man City keeper Given fires parting shot at Newcastle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shay Given has said he deserved better from former club Newcastle United following his transfer to Manchester City. The Ireland keeper moved to City last week and should make his debut at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday after a transfer saga which dragged on throughout January with Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear saying the club would not let Given go. "I felt Newcastle could have dealt with it a little bit better to be honest but I am delighted to be here now. It is a great opportunity for me," Given told Sky Sports News on Thursday. "I just felt after being there nearly 12 years and the service I gave the club, the regime could have looked after the whole thing a little bit better and they made me do things I didn't want to do in the end. "It is nearly 12 years of my life. It is a long time and I would like to thank the supporters and fans. The support they have given me over the years has been absolutely phenomenal." Given said he was not certain he would leave but eventually thought he had more chance of silverware elsewhere. "The last six months it's been fizzling out, it's not been enjoyable going into training. Maybe it was selfish but I felt I deserved a bit better, than that I could be at a club challenging for honours," he said. "You have a short career and I didn't want to finish and regret not taking up this opportunity. "I'm an ambitious guy and want to do the best I can. I think it's a lot more stable at City. The manager is there in the interim at Newcastle and the club is up for sale." Given said he reached rock bottom when Newcastle were thrashed 5-1 at home by Liverpool in December, despite him making a series of great saves in the opening half hour. "It was probably the low point of my career," he said. "You come off the pitch and I felt like never seeing a football again I was that low." "But this is a new chapter in my life and I am very excited and looking forward to the challenge.
