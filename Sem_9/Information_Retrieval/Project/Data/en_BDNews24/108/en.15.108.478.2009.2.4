 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) The proposed 'Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (Tifa)' with the US and transit with India are awaiting cabinet scrutiny, the commerce minister said. "The cabinet will take decisions on the issues considering whether these will serve the best interests of people or not," Faruq Khan was quoted by the state-run BSS news agency as saying at the monthly meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham) Tuesday. The minister said he would not speculate whether the agreements would be ready for signing during the forthcoming visits of a US assistant secretary of state and the foreign minister of India. India's Pranab Mukherjee and US assistant secretary Richard Boucher were both scheduled to be in Dhaka in Feb. The minister said he believed Bangladesh had excellent relationships with both the countries. "The transit proposal was mooted in 1978 when General Ziaur Rahman was president," the former lieutenant colonel was quoted by BSS as saying. "An agreement was signed between the then Indian Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee and former state minister for commerce of Bangladesh Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui." The agreement proposed for establishing rail, road and waterways between the two countries. Faruq Khan said the BNP government approved the agreement in March, 2006. US Ambassador James F Moriarty was also present at the luncheon. b
