<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP on Thursday demanded the government publish the latest draft of the proposed Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the USA for discussion, "We're not opposing the TIFA agreement. But let there be discussion on the issue," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "Signing the deal out of people's sight without publishing the draft is not acceptable," said the BNP leader after a meeting of the party's national standing committee. "Access for Bangladeshi products to the USA market may be hampered if Bangladesh meets certain conditions imposed by US. The country's garment, medicine, ceramics, textile and shrimp exports could face hindrances," Delwar said. The previous BNP government had foregone signing such a TIFA agreement considering the national interest, even after meeting thrice with the US, said Delwar. "Given access of Bangladeshi products to the USA market will not be reduced under the guise of various conditions, and Bangladesh's developing industry will not be hampered, and Bangladesh will be protected from the negative impacts of US investment, the BNP will not oppose signing an agreement such as the TIFA," said Delwar. "BNP will not have no objection if it is signed upholding the best interests of the country," he said. BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia chaired the extended meeting of the standing committee at her Gulshan office Thursday night. The meeting also discussed the transit facility that India wants. Delwar criticised the cabinet's renewal of a transport agreement with India. He said that there could not be any constructive discussion in parliament on the controversial agreements with India and US, as the government was reluctant to give any voice to the opposition. bdnews24.
