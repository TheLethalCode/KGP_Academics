<TITLE> Gayle, Sarwan carry fight to toiling England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan's unbeaten 142-run partnership for West Indies against England on Thursday came as a vital lift for two men shouldered with the responsibility of taking the fight to the tourists. Going into Friday's third day of the opening test on 160 for one, the hosts will be hoping the pair can help chase down England's first innings total of 318. Skipper Gayle had been without a century for three years until his 197 in a drawn test against New Zealand in December and he picked up where he left off with an unbeaten 71 on a slow track. Sarwan had a disappointing time in New Zealand, where he managed just 21 runs in three innings over the two tests, but appeared to have rediscovered his touch by building a stylish 74 before the close. Throughout the past year, West Indies have been over-reliant on the dependable Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who too often has come in to bat in tricky situations or has been left without support. Sarwan and Gayle are regarded as the two other world class players in the batting line-up and they carried that responsibility well against a tame England attack. "When I came back from injury I had two series, against Sri Lanka and Australia, and I thought I did pretty well," Sarwan said. "Unfortunately, I didn't keep up the pace in New Zealand, I thought I took a bit of a backward step. "I've had two weeks to reflect on my game after coming back from New Zealand. I tried to put in a bit of work as well although I couldn't do much because of the rain. "I just wanted to start the series really well and hopefully carry on the same sort of form I've started with here," he said. NEW GAYLE While there is an air of predictability about the little Guyana right-hander's return to form -- few ever doubted the lack of runs was but a blip for a man who averages 39.8 in tests -- there appears to be a more significant change in Gayle's batting. In his near double-century in Napier, Gayle batted with the kind of disciplined responsibility that his critics have maintained was lacking from his hard-hitting approach which often saw him dismissed with loose strokes. The more-careful Gayle was in evidence again on Thursday and even though he hit three sixes, he was more circumspect in his shot selection and did not offer a chance throughout his innings. Those who have followed his career from youth cricket say the new Gayle is in fact a return to the way he used to bat before he was swamped with one-day cricket as part of the West Indies team. As with another West Indian left-handed strokemaker, Clive Lloyd, the added duty of captaincy has brought a more prudent approach at the crease. On a slow wicket against an England attack lacking an obvious threat apart from Andrew Flintoff, Gayle and Sarwan have a chance to build big hundreds on Friday and give Chanderpaul the rare luxury of entering the fray with his team in control of a match
