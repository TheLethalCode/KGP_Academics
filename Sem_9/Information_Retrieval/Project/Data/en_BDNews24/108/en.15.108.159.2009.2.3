<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Book lovers were flocking to the Ekushey Boi Mela on Monday, with stall owners saying book sales had picked up compared to the previous day. The Shabda Shilpa Prokashona stall said their sales had been poor on Sunday, the first day of the Mela. Organisers said a total of 22 books were launched at the book fair Monday. But some browsers at stalls said they found certain books missing, citing perennial favourites such as "English-Bengali dictionaries" and "Nazrul works". "We hope we solve that particular crisis within a few days," Dr. Syed Mohammad Shahed, director general of Bangla Acedemy, told bdnews24.com. "Some shortages have occurred as the Karnafuly paper mill stopped giving us paper," he said. "They diverted their paper production to the government from around the start of November, to print election materials and government books," said Shahed. "We are buying paper through tenders to print our books," he added. He also added the Academy had supplied a total of 1,200 copies of English-Bengali dictionaries to various stalls on Monday. bdnew
