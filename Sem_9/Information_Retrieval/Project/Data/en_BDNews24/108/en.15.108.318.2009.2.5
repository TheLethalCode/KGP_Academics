 LONDON, Thu Feb 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low on Thursday to help Britain out of recession, while dire German industry orders and Spanish industrial output confirmed European businesses were struggling. The British central bank cut its base rate by 50 basis points to 1.0 percent, the lowest since its creation in 1694 and the latest in a series of aggressive cuts designed to stimulate the flagging economy. "The global economy is in the throes of a severe and synchronized downturn," the bank said in a statement accompanying the decision. "Output in the advanced economies fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008, and growth in the emerging market economies appears to have slowed markedly," it added. Policymakers have cut interest rates sharply in an effort to stimulate demand and get credit flowing again after a financial crisis that began with a collapse in risky US home loans, has devastated the banking sector and pushed the United States, the euro zone, Britain and Japan into recession. The International Monetary Fund says Britain's economy, heavily dependent on the ravaged financial sector, could be the worst-hit in the industrialized world, shrinking by 2.8 percent in 2009. UK new car sales crashed 30.9 percent year-on-year in January, their worst performance since 1974. But an unexpected rise in house prices that month led some analysts to suggest the market could be stabilizing. Governments and policymakers worldwide are scrambling for policies to beat the worst financial crisis since the 1930s as consumption falls and unemployment and social unrest rise. The global downturn has hit major exporters like Germany, where manufacturing orders posted their biggest fall since 1990, tumbling 6.9 percent in December month-on-month. That was far beyond the 2.5 percent consensus forecast and the fourth steep drop in succession. The outlook for the euro zone's second biggest economy remained "extremely subdued" the Economy Ministry said. Adding to the gloom, Spanish industrial output in December fell 19.6 percent year-on-year, its sharpest slowdown on record. Business lobbies blamed banks for Spain's severe recession and demanded state intervention if banks fail to boost lending. The data could increase pressure on the European Central Bank to trim its rates. It reviews policy later on Thursday but was expected to leave its key rate untouched at 2 percent after four months of cuts. But financial markets will be looking for signals of what further steps it might take to shore up the euro zone economy. European shares fell in early trading on a large writedown by insurer Swiss Re, while rising bad loans at Spain's biggest bank Santander and a bleak outlook at Deutsche Bank fueled concerns about the wider economy. CORPORATE WOE Global uncertainty prompted consumer goods giant Unilever to abandon all its targets, despite a forecast-beating 7.3 percent rise in Q4 underlying sales. Glum figures from U.S. corporate stalwarts such as Kraft Foods stoked fears of deepening recession, the U.S. Senate voted to soften a "Buy American" clause in a $900 billion stimulus plan that President Barack Obama said could spark a trade war. Atsushi Mizuno, who sits on the Bank of Japan's rate-setting policy board, said new policies might be needed. "It's not too much to say falling exports are triggering a downward spiral of production, incomes and spending, and it looks as if the Japanese economy is in a hard landing," he said. "The Bank of Japan should be prepared to act promptly, including taking measures that could be considered unconventional in normal times. Deutsche Bank was pessimistic about the global economy, reporting a net loss of almost 4 billion euros, versus a 6.5 billion profit in 2007, on heavy writedowns and a slump in revenues from debt trading and other products. "Looking forward, we see continuing very difficult conditions for the global economy," said Chief Executive Josef Ackermann. US investor Warren Buffet shored up Swiss Re with a 3 billion Swiss franc ($2.6 billion) investment, as the world No.2 insurer wrote down twice that sum in toxic assets. US STIMULUS Underlining the depth of the downturn in the world's biggest economy, Kraft and Sara Lee Corp cut their profit forecasts for the year on Wednesday, as consumers turned to lower priced competitors. "Consumer spending is the lion's share of the economy," said Anthony Conroy, head trader for BNY ConvergEx in New York. "When consumers stop spending, the economy comes to a halt." The US private sector cut more than half a million jobs in January, a report from ADP Employer Services said on Wednesday. The figure was lower than expected and markets awaited the more comprehensive official data out on Friday. Japanese stocks fell more than 1 percent in the face of the gloom from the United States. But shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai gained on hopes the Chinese economy would avoid a severe downturn. A mammoth stimulus bill is expected to be pushed through the US Senate this week, and lawmakers approved an amendment requiring the "Buy American" provisions be "applied in a manner consistent with US obligations under international agreements. The change eases fears in Canada, Mexico, the European Union and certain other major trading partners that their firms will be frozen out of public works funded by the stimulus package
