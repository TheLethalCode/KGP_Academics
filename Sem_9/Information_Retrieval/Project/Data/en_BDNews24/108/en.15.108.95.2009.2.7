<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com) Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Saturday Awami League's 'Vision-2021' will face impediments if the education system does not undergo radical change. "Implementation of Vision-2021 will be obstructed if the education system cannot be overhauled totally," he told a seminar on the role of youth in the implementation of Vision-2021. "The education system has to be taken out from the traditional mould. Inequality in education has to be removed and the nation has to be presented with applied education of global standard. The government has started work with this objective in mind," said Nahid. For this, he said, "The primary education system will be brought under the same syllabus and curriculum." "The country has to be made free from illiteracy by 2011 and the rate of dropout brought down to zero," said the minister. "Fifty per cent population of the nation, which sacrificed lives for its language, are still illiterate." "This is very sorrowful.". New vice chancellor of the Dhaka University, AASM Arefin Siddiqui, said, "Words and slogans on changing policy will not do. To build a 'Digital Bangladesh', all have to bring about changes in their mental makeup and thinking". "The main obstacle to realising a Digital Bangladesh is corruption. This must be dealt with ruthlessly and people are to be on their guard in this regard," Arefin told the seminar at the National Press Club, organised by an organisation of young professionals. Presided over by president of the organisation, barrister Zakir Ahmed, others who spoke included Sheikh Afiluddin, MP from Jessore, and editor of Bhorer Kagoj Shaymal Dutta. bdnew
