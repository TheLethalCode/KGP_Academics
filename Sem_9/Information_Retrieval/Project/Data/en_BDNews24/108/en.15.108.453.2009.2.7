 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com) - The industries minister on Saturday said the country could only benefit from trade agreements with other nations. "They cannot harm, but rather benefit our industries as the government will strike or renew any such deal only after proper scrutiny," Dilip Barua told reporters, after launching a workshop on the role of information technology in flourishing small and medium enterprises. The minister stressed the need to prepare for long term impact of the global recession, at the workshop organised by the SME Foundation. "We ourselves have to find ways to face all the difficulties emanating from the global economic slowdown," said Dilip Barua. He said his government would craft a well-coordinated industrial policy to "activate the wheel of the national economy", which would protect all stakeholders' interests. The minister also said priority was being given to develop the SME sector in the country to face economic challenges. "Massive employment could be generated by building up information technology-intensive SMEs. The country's economists and development experts are placing emphasis on building our own economic safety net through such a measure," said Barua. He hoped effective strategies and recommendations would emerge form the workshop in further developing the SME sector. The minister also felt the need for a stable political atmosphere to change the national economic scenario and, "above all, political unity for the sake of national interests". "Bangladesh could become a middle-income country with the concerted efforts of all by 2021," he said. He called private entrepreneurs to come forward from an attitude of corporate responsibility. "If we work together, we can carry the country forward by facing the challenges of globalisation." President of DCCI Zafar Osman, honorary president of IEB Dr. Nazrul Islam and Mujibur Rahman of the SME Foundation were present among others at the opening ceremony. Professor M Kaikobad presented the key article in the workshop held at the Dhaka Sheraton in the city. Bdnews
