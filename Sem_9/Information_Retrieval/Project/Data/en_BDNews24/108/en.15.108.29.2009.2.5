<TITLE> Sweden to lift ban on new nuclear reactors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Thu Feb 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden will lift a decades-old ban on new nuclear power developments and allow the construction of reactors on existing sites as part of a new climate and energy policy. The government aims to present a bill on the new policy on March 17, a government spokesman said on Thursday. A 1980 referendum voted to gradually phase out nuclear power and no new reactors have come on line over the past two decades. Opinion polls in recent years have shown Swedes warming to the idea of nuclear power, which unlike fossil fuel-based production emits virtually no carbon dioxide. "It shall be possible to give permission to gradually replace existing reactors as these reach the end of their economic life," the government said in a statement. Sweden's 10 nuclear reactors at three plants -- Oskarshamn, Ringhals and Forsmark -- supply roughly half of its energy needs. Two reactors, both at the now shuttered Barseback plant, have been closed over the past decade. The reactors currently in operation all came on line between 1972 and 1985, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority said on its Web site. The energy package also included bids to expand wind power. The government said its new policy included a set of targets to be reached by 2020, such as a 40 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions. "To reach the target the government will present proposals on developed economic steering measures, among other things a raised carbon dioxide tax," it said, adding it may also raise energy taxes. "These developed economic steering measures will in all give a contribution of 2 million tonnes in reduced climate gases." The government also set a target of lifting the portion of renewable energy consumption to 50 percent of the total. In the transport sector alone, the target was set at 10 percent
