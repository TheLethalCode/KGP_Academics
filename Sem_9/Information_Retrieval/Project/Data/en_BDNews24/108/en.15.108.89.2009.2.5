 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government is planning to allow public and private sector foundations to be floated on the capital market, finance and planning minister AMA Muhith said on Thursday. "We are contemplating a policy for floating numerous foundations like the Palli Karma Shahayak Foundation, NGO Foundation, and others, on the share market as they face a shortage of funds for sustainable investment," he said. "The foundations could raise funds through the market," the finance minister said at an NGO Foundation meeting at CIRDAP auditorium. Muhith also suggested the foundations could capitalise on the market through Mutual Funds. Cheques amounting to Tk 73.50 lakh were distributed among 50 NGOs in the meeting. NGO Foundation chairman and former adviser M Hafizuddin Khan and executive director Shahriar Parvez also spoke at the meeting. The minister urged NGOs to work with farmers. "They have done nothing for agricultural output," he said. bdnews
