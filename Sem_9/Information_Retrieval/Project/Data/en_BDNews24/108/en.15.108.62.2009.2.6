 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Prices of rice, flour, vegetables, sugar and some other essentials have fallen, but those of eggs and pulses soared. Sellers on Friday said the prices of eggs rose Tk 2-3 a quartet last week. A number of poultry farmers said price hike of poultry feed pushed the prices of eggs. Akter Hossain, a retail egg seller at Sheurapara kitchen market, said poultry egg was being sold at Tk 28, while other varieties of eggs were being sold at Tk 30-32. Akter said they bought eggs at a higher price from the wholesale market. Shafiqul Islam, a wholesale egg seller and owner of Janata Egg Warehouse in Tejgaon, said egg supply from farms had reduced, hence the hike in the egg price. Due to the price hike of poultry feed, poultry production decreased leading to the higher egg prices, Tejgaon poultry market's former president Fazlul Haq Mridha said. The prices of pulse variants also soared last week. Farmgate market's pulse seller Nazrul Islam said the prices of pulses had risen Tk 5-20 a kg. bd
