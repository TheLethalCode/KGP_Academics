 Chittagong, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Leading citizens have demanded Chittagong City Corporation halt its plans to demolish two of the port city's most noted girls' schools to replace them with multi-storied structures. They called for immediate compliance with the prime minister directive for the two schools, Aparnacharan and Krishna Kumari, at a solidarity rally in the city. The PM on Monday directed the education minister to halt any plans to demolish the schools. Chittagong's city unit of Samajtantrik Chhatra Front, a minor left wing political party, organised the solidarity rally at the Chittagong Central Shaheed Minar. Scientists Dr. Jamal Hossain, poet and journalist Arun Dashgupta, freedom fighter Dr. Mahfuzur Rahman, Chittagong University professors Abul Mansur, FM Imam Ali, Syeda Tahera and Hossain Kabir, activist Noor Jahan Khan, engineer Subhash Barua and architect Jerina Hossain spoke at the rally. Chittagong Mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury placed an advertisement recently in a local daily defending the city's plan, saying that "an education-friendly multi-storied building and complex is being built for the Aparnacharan and Krishna Kumari schools". "Those who look to this great initiative in any other way than the development of an education-friendly modern complex for these two historic schools have taken a condemnable role to tarnish the successes of the Chittagong City Corporation," said the advertisement. "This role is not desirable from any quarters interested in education. So I want to let you know with firmness that the proposed education-friendly complex will be built." Centenarian and veteran activist 'Biplobi' Binod Behari Chowdhury took to the street in protest last week to protect the schools. He said: "The mayor has taken a unilateral move to demolish the schools." He lashed out at those who are taking the initiative to construct "commercial buildings" by demolishing the schools. "They have acted like madmen by undertaking such a project," he said. Claiming that the mayor had taken up the initiative only for business interests, Binod Behari said: "Money is needed for development of the city, but the need for money can be met through other means." He announced that the people of Chittagong would resist the move to build commercial buildings on the site. Local personalities and organisations have joined the cause. Protestors say trade and education cannot co-exist, and their movement will continue until the city corporation stopped the project. bdnew
