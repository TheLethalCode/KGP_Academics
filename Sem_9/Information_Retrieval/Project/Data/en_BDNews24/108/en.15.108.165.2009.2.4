 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition BNP adjourned its parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday until Feb 9, in the hope of receiving an acceptable proposal from the speaker on seating arrangement in the House, said a senior BNP MP. "Citing the postponed meeting of our parliamentary party meeting to the speaker, we demanded a specific solution to the seating arrangement problem," senior MK Anwar told reporters after a delegation of opposition MPs met with speaker Abdul Hamid. "He did not yet inform us about any decision in this regard," Anwar added. BNP has been absent from parliament since Jan. 28, as a row was sparked by Hamid's revision of the outgoing speaker's seating arrangement giving BNP fewer seats on front row benches to reflect the ratio of seats they hold in the House. Anwar said BNP is ready to talk if they get any "specific proposal" on the issue. "As opposition, BNP wants to join parliament and work with the government," he said. "Ruling party MPs including Abdul Jalil and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir have spoken about the serious matter of torture they suffered during the interim administration. We also could have added our voices if we were in the parliament," Anwar said. The former minister said there should a parliamentary probe into the torture inflicted on politicians during the caretaker government's tenure. In Wednesday's meeting with the speaker, the BNP MPs also raised the issue of Special Security Force protection for opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, deployed for the pre- and post-election period, which came to an end earlier in the week. "SSF has been withdrawn although the threat on [Khaleda's] life has increased against the backdrop of country's deteriorated law and order situation," said Anwar. Prior to meeting with the speaker, a BNP parliamentary party meeting presided over by Salauddin Quader Chowdhury MP was held at the opposition deputy leader's room in parliament. bndews24.
