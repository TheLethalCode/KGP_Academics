 Los Angeles, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 4-year-old California girl died after she climbed into a washing machine and her toddler brother turned it on, authorities said Wednesday. Kayley Ishii, who lived with her brother and parents in Mission Viejo, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles, died Monday of blunt force trauma inflicted by the machine, Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said. Amormino said it wasn't clear how or why Kayley got into the washer but that the controls were only about 20 inches off the ground, within reach of her 15-month-old brother. "The boy could have easily bumped into it or turned it on," Amormino told the Orange County Register for a story on its Web site. "The injuries are consistent with what happened in the washing machine." bd
