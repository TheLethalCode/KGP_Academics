 WASHINGTON, Fri Feb 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Democratic-led US Senate will again try on Friday to pass a $937 billion economic stimulus package even as moderate lawmakers sought to broker a deal to trim proposed spending some criticized as too much. A group of about 18 Democrats and Republicans worked late on Thursday to slice about $107 billion from the plan, which President Barack Obama wants on his desk by February 16 to help reverse the economy's downward spiral. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was "cautiously optimistic" they could finish up on Friday, but warned that if progress stalled he would file a motion to set up a showdown procedural vote for Sunday on the White House-backed measure. A wildcard that could push the senators to quicken their pace is the release Friday of January unemployment data, which is expected to show the private sector had purged another half a million jobs. Reid said on Thursday that he had hoped to be able to pass the bill within hours, but he later abruptly halted debate and said the senators would resume work on Friday. Republicans have blasted the package as doing little to create jobs and boost the economy, which has been in a recession since December 2007. Democrats so far have fought off most Republican attempts to alter the bill to add tax cuts and slash spending. Democrats control the Senate with 58 seats. They would need 60 votes to bypass potential Republican procedural roadblocks and therefore need at least two Republicans backing them. The package was originally designed to be about $775 billion with 40 percent going toward tax cuts, but it has grown with the addition of incentives to boost flagging home and automobile sales and increase medical research funding. Even as moderate Democrats and Republicans worked to clinch a deal, Senator Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, said they have to "do it in a way that we don't lose the entire Democratic caucus." Obama has ramped up pressure on Congress to complete the stimulus measure and has sought bipartisan support for it to show he can end the partisan bickering that has stalled most legislation over the last few years. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed its $819 billion version of the stimulus measure last week without one Republican vote. Obama has engaged in personal lobbying to pick up some Republican votes, but he has refused to bend on adding large tax cuts. "We can't embrace the losing formula that says only tax cuts will work for every problem we face," Obama told House Democrats on Thursday at a retreat in Williamsburg, Virginia
