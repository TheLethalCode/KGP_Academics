 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com) - Finance minister AMA Muhith on Monday promised steps to trim the 'negative list' of commodities stipulated by India, to reduce a yawning trade imbalance against Bangladesh. "I have promised necessary government steps to reduce the 'sensitive commodity list' imposed by India," Muhith told reporters after a meeting with an India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry delegation. "The IBCCI representatives have made several recommendations including more container terminals, railway transshipment, organising Bangladeshi commodity fairs in India and cutting the negative list," said the minister. "But I have only promised steps on slimming down the negative list." Abdul Matlub Ahmed, president of the Dhaka-based IBCCI, said he believed a solution lay in his recommendations. "Bangladesh exports to India could reach $100 crore ($1bn) if the government implements our suggestions." Current Bangladeshi exports to India are valued at just $25 crore ($250m), according to the IBCCI. "India initially produced a 'negative list' of 700 Bangladeshi commodities, which through negotiation came down to 400," said Matlub Ahmed, chairman of the Nitol-Niloy Group. "But barriers are still there against our products." The IBCCI chief said he requested the finance minister to raise the issue with Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee during his upcoming visit later in February. Dhaka's trade deficit with New Delhi stood at $3.03 billion in FY 2007-8. Bangladesh exported just $358.1 million, while India sold $3.39 billion worth of products that year. The deficit against Bangladesh in the preceding fiscal was $1.98 billion, with India's exports amounting to $2.27 billion against Bangladesh's $289.4 million. The deficit figure was $1.62 billion in FY 2005-6. bdnews
