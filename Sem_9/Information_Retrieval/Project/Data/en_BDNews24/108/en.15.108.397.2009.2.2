 NEW DELHI, Feb 2(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was taken to a hospital in New Delhi on Monday after complaining of "a mild discomfort" in one of his arms, his spokesman said. "The doctors have said it is not serious at all. They thought it is better to have an evaluation before he travels to Europe on Feb. 8," Chhime Chhoekyapa told Reuters. "He is fine and in perfect health." The Dalai Lama was admitted to hospital in August with abdominal discomfort and underwent successful gallstone surgery two months later. The exiled leader was taken to New Delhi's Apollo Hospital from his headquarters in Dharamsala. Chhoekyapa said the 73-year-old leader would return to Dharamsala on Tuesday and prepare for a trip to Italy and Germany. "Then he goes on an extensive tour of south India," Chhoekyapa said. In November, the Dalai Lama said he would not retire, putting an end to speculation about his future after the surgery. He also said he was losing faith in the Chinese government's desire to resolve the issue of Tibet's autonomy. Chinese troops occupied Tibet in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled the mountainous region in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
