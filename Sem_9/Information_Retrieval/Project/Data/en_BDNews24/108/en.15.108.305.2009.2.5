 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)The law minister has ruled out legal measures against those responsible for the extended two-year term of the 2007-8 caretaker government. Taking questions from reporters at his office Thursday, Shafiq Ahmed invoked "the doctrine of necessity". "You cannot say all their actions or activities were within the bounds of the constitution," the minister said. "So we are not giving legal cover to all their actions, we're not validating all their ordinances. "They tried to work within the ambit of the constitution. Whatever they did, they did responding to the necessity of the time. "But if anyone suffers or is adversely affected (as a result of the interim government's actions), the law will take its own course to remedy that," the law minister said. "Not only these two years, we have been through extra-constitutional rule before. "(Through changes) in 1975 and 1982, we suffered long periods of government without any constitutional validity. "We failed to try those (perpetrators)," the minister said. "This time, the caretaker government took some extra time to get us photo ID cards and hold a free and fair elections. We have to validate these actions for obvious reasons." The minister declined to say whether the government would take any action against the Anti-Corruption Commission chairman. "I cannot comment on this. This is not under my ministry. "But the prime minister has spoken of steps to strengthen the ACC. If necessary, we'll amend the laws governing the ACC." Replying to a query on the 10 High Court judges who did not get confirmed during the BNP rule, the minister said the government will not pursue an appeal against an HC verdict ordering their reinstatement.
