 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com) - The National Board of Revenue will overhaul its tax and tariff structure in the new budget, with a view to boosting jobs and output, the NBR chairman said on Monday. Poverty reduction and a business-friendly environment will be the main philosophy of the budget for FY2009-10, said Mohammad Abdul Majid. "The new budget will see a balanced commodity- and sector-wise tariff structure. Tax payment and collection procedures will also be streamlined," he told a pre-budget meeting. "Pro-business and taxpayer-friendly process will be ensured," the NBR chief said as he exchanged views with representatives from agriculture, fisheries and livestock sectors. "The prime objective of the next budget will be to attach priority to poverty alleviation for exploring new avenues of employment generation and to encourage investment in industry, trade and commerce," he said. "Tax incentives will be included in the structural policy." "Procedures for imports of capital machinery and raw material will also be restructured," Majid said. "Import of luxuries and 'unnecessary' items will be discouraged," said the NBR boss. bdnews
