<TITLE> Govt mulls 'alternative dispute resolution' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government is contemplating introducing an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system to reduce case-jams in court. "The system would relieve justice seekers of untold sufferings," law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters on Wednesday. "Defendants and plaintiffs can settle their disputes outside the court with the mediation of a lawyer under this system," he said. The minister said there are many countries including the US where cases are resolved between defendants and plaintiffs outside court. Shafiq said he had already discussed the issue with the chief justice, and the law ministry would form a committee soon to get the ball rolling. "I have served as a lawyer for a long time. I know how long people have to wait for justice. They face financial losses too," said the lawyer-turned minister. There are well over a million cases pending in the country's courts, said the minister. "The system will be introduced both in lower and higher courts where civil and less serious criminal cases may be settled through ADR." On the past BNP-led government's failed efforts to introduce the system in Bangladesh, the minister said, "They secured the funds, but failed as they did not apply the funds correctly." Shafiq also spoke in parliament earlier in the day about his ministry's steps to bring about an alternative system to dispose of backlogged cases. bdnew
