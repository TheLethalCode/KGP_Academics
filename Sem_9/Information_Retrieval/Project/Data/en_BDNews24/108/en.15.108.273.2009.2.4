 By Arshad Mahmud Washington Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)Since taking office two weeks ago, President Barack Obama suffered the biggest embarrassment on Tuesday after two of his high-profile nominees withdrew due to 'tax troubles', raising serious questions about his judgment. The latest embarrassment followed the much-publicised withdrawal of commerce secretary-designate Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, on corruption charges in December. Tom Daschle, nominee for the Department of Health and Human Services, and Nancy Killefer, incoming head of the White House Performance Office, a new position created to ensure accountability in the government, withdrew their names after revelations that they failed to pay taxes in time. Obama himself acknowledged in several television interviews on Tuesday that it was a big embarrassment for his administration, taking full responsibility for the distractions they have caused at a time when the country is facing serious economic challenges. "Anytime one of your nominees pulls out, that's an issue and, you know, as I've said publicly, ultimately, I take responsibility for the situation that we're in," Obama told ABC News anchor Charles Gibson in the Oval Office, referring to Daschle. "I think that all of these were honest mistakes, but ultimately, there's no excuse for them." When Gibson asked if it had been an embarrassing day for the White House, Obama replied: "I think it has." Daschle withdrew his nomination because of failure to pay $140,000 in income taxes. A few hours earlier, the president's chief enforcement officer also stepped aside, for the same reason, though her unpaid tax bill amounted to less than Daschle's. Obama said this sends the wrong message about responsibility. "The most important thing, from my perspective, is making sure that the American people understand we don't have two sets of rules here, that everybody has responsibilities. In this situation, I take responsibility for it." Obama also told Gibson he was angry that news of his tax-troubled appointees has taken the focus away from the goal of passing the economic stimulus bill and putting Americans back to work. "We can't afford glitches, because right now, what I should be spending time talking to you about is how we're going to put 3 to 4 million people back to work," said Obama. "This is a self-induced injury that I'm angry about, and we're going to make sure we get it fixed." Despite these challenges, the new president said that he is "surprisingly comfortable in the job." "I think I've got a great staff," Obama said. "We've got a great team. The challenges are big ... not just an immediate economic crisis but a long-term budget issue in terms of the amount of debt that we're accumulating. Trying to square all those circles is a challenge. But one thing that I'm absolutely convinced about is that you want to be president when you've got big problems. If things are going to go smoothly, then this is just another nice home office." bd
