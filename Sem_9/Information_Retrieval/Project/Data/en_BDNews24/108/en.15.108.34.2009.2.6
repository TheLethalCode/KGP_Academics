<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza has been dramatically sold for $ 600000 (nearly Tk 4.2 crore) in the Indian Premier League auction to Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders on Friday. The 25-year-old allrounder became the first Bangladeshi cricketer sold from Pool F in the official Indian Twenty20 league. He will play under the captaincy of former Indian skipper Saurav Ganguly. But his teammates Mohammad Ahsraful (Pool C) and world's number one all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan (Pool D), Tamim Iqbal (Pool E) remained unsold in the auction. The Bangladesh captain, Ashraful, however, was later picked by Mumbai Indians at his base price of $75,000 after 15 players out of 17 vacant slots were sold through bids. Shakib Al Hasan, world's number one allrounder in ICC one-day ranking, and Tamim Iqbal, the left-handed opener, however remained unsold in the auction. England stars Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff were at the pick of auction to be sold for $ 1.55 million for Bangalore Royal Challengers and Chennai Super Kings respectively, making them the most expensive players in the IPL, scheduled to be held from April 10 to May 29. However, it was Mashrafee, Bangladesh's strike pacer and vice-captain, who stole the show in Goa after being sold by 12 times his base price of $50,000. IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi said all the auctioned players will be contracted for two years. There were no bids for Mashrafee initially but just before the hammer went down, Kolkata made a bid at the base price of $50,000. It was the start of the most dramatic sale at the auction. Kings XI Punjab threw themselves in the fray, locking horns against Kolkata, for Mashrafee. The bids spiraled slowly towards $400,000 and the auctioneer asked Punjab if they want to go $410,000, Bollywood actress Priety Zinta nodded. The raises were slow and the bidding went on and on and on. Kolkata touched the $500,00 mark. Punjab went further at $550,000. The atmosphere in the room grew quieter as the bids rose and the auctioneer attempted to speed up the process. Kolkata was the first to bid $600,000 for Mashrafee at which point Punjab bowed out of the race. It was the longest lot in the auction, almost as long as a short chess game. A bit similar to Ishant Sharma's surprise $950,000 tag at fag end of the auction last year. Mashrafee became the second Bangladeshi cricketer to be bought by the IPL after left-arm-spinner Abdur Razzzak, now suspended by the ICC due to his illegal bowling action, played for Bangalore Royal Challengers in the inaugural IPL Twenty20 meet. After losing Mashrafee, Kings XI stake-holder Preity Zinta said she desperately wanted Mashrafee. "Mortaza is a great player, an all-rounder and we wanted him. But you win some, you lose some," the Bollywood star was quoted by the IPL official website as saying
