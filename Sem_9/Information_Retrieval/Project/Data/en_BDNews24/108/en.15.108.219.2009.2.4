 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The foreign minister told a human rights review in Geneva that her government will deal with extra-judicial killings and torture/death under custody with a 'zero tolerance' policy. "We do not condone any such incident and will bring the responsible officials to justice," said Dr. Dipu Moni. The country's first female foreign minister made these comments while responding to queries at Bangladesh's Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council, said a statement of Dhaka's permanent mission in Geneva on Wednesday. As many as forty nine member states overwhelmingly expressed their support for the transfer to democracy and the ongoing efforts to strengthen the institutional framework for promotion and protection of human rights, said the statement. Most delegations appreciated the efforts made by Bangladesh to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and improve the socio-economic situation of the people. "Poverty is both a cause and consequence of violation of human rights. Eradication of poverty, therefore, is the top priority of the government," Dipu Moni was quoted as saying. She enumerated the steps, including the National Human Rights Commission established in 2008, her country had initiated to protect and promote human rights. She said her government had initiated the process to try war criminals as a signal to end a culture of impunity. "We realise that, as long as the matter remains unresolved, it will continue to disrupt and fracture the politics of the nation." The foreign minister also responded to questions relating to human trafficking, death penalty and rights of religion and ethnic minorities. The Bangladesh delegation at the UPR included, among others, attorney general Mahbubey Alam and member of National Human Rights Commission Mrs Munira Khan. Human rights activists and members of the Bangladesh media were also present at the meeting. bd
