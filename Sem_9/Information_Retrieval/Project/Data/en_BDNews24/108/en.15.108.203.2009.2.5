<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  Amid howls of protests by the civil society, the construction of a multi-storied commercial complex by demolishing a historical school has been suspended, said the acting mayor on Thursday. The decision has been taken after a long discussion with mayor ABM Mohiuddin who is in Switzerland at the moment, added SM Iqbal Hossain at a press conference. Extolling the project of constructing a multi-storied building in place of a school, the acting mayor said, "A particular group of the city has instigated the people and so, the work has been suspended." The city corporation recently took the decision to knock down the historic Aparnacharan and Krishnakumari School, linked to the early 20th century anti-colonial revolutionary Pritilata Wadedar, to build a multi-storey complex. But, different quarters, including cultural bodies and organisations, strongly protested the move and launched a protest movement. On Sunday, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, annoyed at the imminent demolition of the historic building, ordered the education minister to take steps to preserve the school. Based on the prime minister's wishes, the acting mayor, after consultation with the mayor, put the multi-storied construction on hold. bdnews24.
