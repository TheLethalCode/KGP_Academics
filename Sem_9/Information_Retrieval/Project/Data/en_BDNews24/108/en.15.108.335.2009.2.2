<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 02 (bdnews24.com) Post and Telecommunications minister Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju was absent for an MP's question in parliament on Monday. According to the rules of procedure, ministers must remain present and accountable while MPs question them. Speaker Abdul Hamid termed the minister's absence "sorrowful". Hamid, after recess for Maghrib prayers, gave the floor to Awami League MP Tajul Islam to table a starred question, number 57, on digital telephone exchanges. But, Rajiuddin Ahmed Raju had failed to turn up though the House resumed its businesses with Hamid in the chair. Both the speaker and Tajul Islam remained silent and MPs started looking around the House to locate the minister. "His absence is really sorrowful," Hamid told the House. The chair later gave floor to ABM Abul Kashem who asked a question of the finance minister. Raju returned to House later. Earlier in the day, the telecoms minister gave contradictory answers to the House on awarding further licenses for mobile phone operators. In a written reply to a starred question, number 53, Raju said the government had no plan to issue more licenses for mobile phone companies. But he reversed this stance while replying to a supplementary question on the same issue. "We are thinking of bringing in more companies," Raju told parliament in reply to a supplementary question from Jatiya Party MP Fazle Rabbi Mia. Replying to another question, the telecoms minister said the government was working to stop illegal VoIP operations. bdnews
