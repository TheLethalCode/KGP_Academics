 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) - The unauthorised BGMEA Bhaban, built on the Begunbari canal, is one of the major hindrances to the Begunbari-Hatirjheel development project in the city, say experts. "The papers of the building will be examined properly," the state minister housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan said Tuesday, when asked by reporters if the building would be demolished to complete the ambitious. ""Any decisions will be taken through discussions with the lawyers and other concerned officials," said Khan. BUET professor Mujibur Rahman had earlier briefed the new state minister on the progress of the Tk 1,481 crore (Tk 1.48 billion) project. Housing and public works secretary ASM Rashidul Hye and Rajuk chairman Shafiqul Islam also called the building as unauthorised. "If necessary, laws will be amended to remove the hindrances to the Begunbari-Hatirjheel project," the state minister said after the meeting. "The government will take necessary steps against any other irregularity or graft concerning the project," he said. Citing the project as inevitable for capital dwellers, Mujibur Rahman said they were pressing for completion of the project as soon as possible. bd
