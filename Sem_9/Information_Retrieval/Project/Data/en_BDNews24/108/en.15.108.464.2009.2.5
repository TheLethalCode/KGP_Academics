 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to renew the bilateral goods transport deal with India, said a spokesman on Thursday. A cabinet meeting earlier approved the renewal of the agreement for three years, and also a new agreement on investment promotion and protection, said the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. "The goods transport deal was signed in 1980, under president Ziaur Rahman, and was renewed most recently on March 21, 2006, by the then finance minister Saifur Rahman for three years," added the press secretary. Stating that the deal has 13 clauses, he elaborated on Clause 8 that specifies "mutually beneficial agreement for the use of waterways, railways and roads for commerce between the two countries for passage of goods between the places in one country to territory of the other". On the investment promotion and protection agreement, Azad said, "The government already has such agreements with 24 countries, and this is the 25th." He said the prime minister had backed the agreement saying the government would secure more such beneficial deals in the days to come. bdnew
