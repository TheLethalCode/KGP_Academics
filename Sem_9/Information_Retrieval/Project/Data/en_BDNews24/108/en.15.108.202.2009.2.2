 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Mon Feb 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taliban suicide bomber killed 21 police in southern Afghanistan Monday, the government said, one of the deadliest attacks on the force in recent months.

"As a result of the suicide attack on a police unit ... 21 police were martyred and eight more wounded," the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack.
