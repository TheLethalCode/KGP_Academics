 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government may weigh up the option in the next budget of allowing undisclosed income to be invested in the capital market, the finance minister has said. "We want to raise the lion's share of funds from the capital market to achieve 25 percent investment growth a year, promised in our electoral manifesto," AMA Muhith said on Saturday. "For that we'll more than double the number of BO (Beneficiary Owner) accounts to 50 lakh from the existing 19 lakh," he said, emerging from an emergency meeting with the boards of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange. "Book-building system for IPO (initial public offering) processing will be introduced by month-end or first week of March to ease IPOs and fix the value of primary shares." He also announced shares of more state-owned entities would be offloaded on the market 'soon'. He, however, admitted shortage of skilled manpower to do the job. "We must develop skilled manpower to revamp the capital market by using advanced technology." Muhith said the government would work hard to expand and justify the market and make it more participatory. The finance minister told reporters, "The government will make all-out efforts to that end." About the impact of the global crisis, Muhith said, "Falling prices in the world markets made bank shares to slide a bit." DSE president Abdul Haque recommended government moved to legalise undisclosed assets through the share market. Haque told bdnews24.com, "This issue topped a series of recommendations we made to the minister." The minister said, "The issue of investing the undisclosed incomes in the share market might be considered in the next budget." Explaining 'Book building system of IPO processing' SEC chairman Faruq Ahmed Siddiqi said, "When a company applies to float shares on the capital market, a merchant bank or an authorised firm will buy the shares through bidding, determining the primary share value." "The system encourages sound companies to get registered with the market," said Faruqui. The two stock markets  DSE and CSE  showed downtrends recently with the DSE falling to 2,634.48 points on Thursday from 3207.08 points on June 1 last year. DSE closed at 1,656.83 on Jan. 14 in 2007. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, CSE president Nasir Ahmed Khan and officials from the securities watchdog and the two stock exchanges were present at the meeting. bd
