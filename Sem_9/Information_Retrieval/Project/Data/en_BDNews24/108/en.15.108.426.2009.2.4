 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP and its associate organisations on Wednesday protested against the government's withdrawal of Special Security Force protection for party chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Khaleda's three-month long SSF protection, deployed by the caretaker government to ensure safety and security during the election period, came to an end Monday midnight. The party was holding a rally Wednesday afternoon at Muktangon demanding the government should continue maximum security protection for the opposition leader. BNP's associate bodies were also planning similar rallies. The demand came from a joint meeting held at the BNP office in Naya Paltan chaired by secretary general Khadaker Delwar Hossain. "The government has taken a short-sighted policy by withdrawing Khaleda Zia's security," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told reporters. "The current security for Khaleda Zia is risky. The government did not pay any heed even after we sought continued SSF protection for her," he said. The meeting also chalked out programmes for marking International Mother Language Day on Feb 21. bdnew
