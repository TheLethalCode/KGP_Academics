 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com) - Main opposition BNP will chair four parliamentary standing committees, a first in the country's history, chief whip Abdus Shahid said on Friday. No opposition party chaired a standing committee  parliamentary watchdog on ministries  in the previous eight parliaments. "Proportionately, the main opposition BNP will get four chairs of the standing committees. We've already asked for names from them for the positions," Shahid told bdnews24.com. "Besides, grand alliance government's key ally Jatiya Party will get chairs of three standing committees," he added. In its election manifesto, the Awami League had promised to allow the opposition, if voted to power, to chair standing committees. The ongoing parliament session will form standing committees for 37 ministries and 11 parliament-related standing committees, two of which have already been constituted. During the previous parliament, the then opposition AL demanded chairmanship of standing committees proportionately, only to be refused by the then BNP-led coalition government. A separate 10-member standing committee is formed in each ministry to ensure transparency and accountability. The standing committees, termed as "mini parliament" examine the bills placed before the House. bdnews
