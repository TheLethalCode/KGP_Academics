<TITLE> Abahani one point off B. League title </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited were just one step away from the B. League title after an easy 3-0 win over Brothers Union in their second-leg crucial match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. Emeka Christiana struck twice while Abul Hossain netted the other in front of some 2000-strong crowd at the big bowl. With the seventh straight win, Abahani raised their point tally to 44 from 18 matches, nine points clear of joint second placed Mohammedan SC and Sheikh Russel KC, who played a match less than the leaders' 18 outings. To retain the professional league title, the sky blues now need one point from two matches that means the Dhanmondi-based outfit have to make a draw against Sheikh Russel KC or Rahmatganj MFS. If Abahani can secure a point against Sheikh Russel on Thursday, the sky blues will celebrate a fiesta with a match to go. But, if Abahani lose in their both matches and Mohammedan and Sheikh Russel win their remaining all three matches, then three teams have an equal 44 points and two play-off matches will be needed to decide the title. In the match, it seemed both teams were playing aimless with no sign of planned game in the field and both sides struggled to control the midfield with playing a plenty of miss-passes. Brothers Union, who had a miserable run in the second-leg matches with no record of a single win in the last five matches, launched the first attack with Arup Kumar Baiddya whipping a right-side cross for Nicodemus, but Abahani defender Samad Yousuf cleared it at the cost of corner in the 28th minute. Three minutes later, Abahani went on attacking when Ghanaian playmaker Awudu Ibrahim whipped a fine cross for Emeka, who headed powerfully, but Brothers goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman thwarted the attempt. The Nigerian striker, Emeka, finally gave Abahani a lead in the 35th minute when Wali Faisal whipped a cross from the touchline for Jahid Hasan Emily, who failed to connect the ball, but Emeka jumped high to head the ball home. In the stoppage time of the first half, Abul Hossain doubled the lead as the midfielder taking a fine through pass from Awudu and darted into the box to slash a placing shot that kissed the upper net of Brothers Union. After the lemon break, players from both sides looked tired and they hardly chased for the ball, though Brothers Union looked a bit shining in the latter part of the game. Emeka struck his second to join top-scorer Alfaz Ahmed and sealed the match in the 86th minute as the tall striker danced past three Brothers' defenders along with substitute goalkeeper MN Shakil to find the back of the opponent net with a tap. Alfaz has 14 goals including a hat-trick against Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra. Brothers Union's regular goalkeeper Ziaur Rahman left in the 67th minute as he fell unconscious after getting a head injury during the early second half. bd
