 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The foreign minister has called upon the international community to divert excessive expenditure on armaments towards development efforts and poverty alleviation, Bangladesh's permanent mission in Geneva said on Wednesday. "We can ill afford to continue such spending as our people are hungry, without basic needs and vulnerable to disease, climate change and natural disasters," Dr. Dipu Moni told a conference on disarmament in Geneva. "Bangladesh would like to see early progress on agreements to move ahead with negotiations on nuclear disarmament, peaceful use of outer space and security assurance for non-nuclear states," a statement of the mission quoted Dipu Moni as saying. She urged all the countries to show more flexibility in non-proliferation negotiations, especially the major armament producing and procuring countries. She reiterated Bangladesh's abiding commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and said the country has also been on the forefront of the fight against landmines. Bangladesh's first female foreign minister met with Sergei Orzonikidze, director general of the UN offices in Geneva and special representative of the UN secretary general to the conference on disarmament. Orzonikidze appreciated Bangladesh's active participation in the disarmament negotiations. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and Bangladesh ambassador in Geneva Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya were also present in the meeting. bd
