 CAPE TOWN, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa captain Graeme Smith will play in the three-test series against Australia starting this month after missing the two teams' recent one-day series through injury. Smith sustained a fracture to his left hand during the test series victory in Australia and aggravated a long-standing elbow injury. In a statement released by Cricket South Africa on Friday, Smith said the team's medical team had told him he could resume playing. "They are very happy with my hand injury and they feel they can manage my elbow through the home series against Australia," he said. The first test is scheduled to start on Feb. 26 in Johannesburg. The tour includes two Twenty20 internationals and five one-day matches
