 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Priyanka Gandhi, daughter of Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi, landed in Dhaka Tuesday afternoon for a two-day trip. "Priyanka Gandhi's plane touched down just after 4pm," said immigration officer at Zia Internationa Airport Mustafa Kamal. Born to the late Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia, and granddaughter of former Indian premier Indira Gandhi, Priyanka is being provided maximum security throughout her stay. Special Security Force officers were in place with three-tier security arrangements as she landed, said airport officials. Priyanka is visiting Bangladesh at the invitation of BRAC, one of the largest NGOs in the world, with wings in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Africa. The 36-year-old Priyanka is scheduled to tour a BRAC school in Savar and meet prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her Sudha Sadan residence. She is the first high-profile Indian dignitary to visit Bangladesh since Hasina's new government came to power in early January. Priyanka's brother MP and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi came to Bangladesh on a similar visit in August last year. Rajiv Gandhi Foundation Secretary Gyanendra Bagdaiya and Trainer Sonia Phillip are accompanying Priyanka during her visit. bdn
