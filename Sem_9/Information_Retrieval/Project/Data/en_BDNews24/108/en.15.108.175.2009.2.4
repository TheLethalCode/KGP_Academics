<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh sets a unique example in tackling climate change disaster, says the visiting Danish climate and energy minister. "One of the biggest challenges right now for Bangladesh is adaptation to climate change," the Danish minister, Connie Hedegaard, said in Dhaka Tuesday. "During my visit here I have learnt that in Bangladesh up to 40 percent of the investment in development and infrastructure is likely to be affected by climate change." Bangladesh has invested some Tk 10 billion to tackle disaster management over the last two decades, a seminar was told Tuesday. "Denmark remains committed to assist with adaptation to climate change in these two sectors as already planned under theme one, 'Food security, Social Protection and Health', in your strategy and action plan for climate change," she said. Environment and forest minister Mostafizur Rahman said Bangladesh had already set up a climate change fund. "We have little time to lose to come to a global agreement on how to manage climate change, its causes and adverse impacts in all but most particularly, in developing countries and the least developed countries," said Rahman. Swedish ambassador Britt Hagstrom and DFID country representative in Bangladesh Chris Austin both said Bangladash was not just vulnerable to climate change, but was rather in a unique position to develop expertise to tackle climate change. Among others, Danish ambassador Rinar H Jensen, environment and forest secretary Rezaul Kabir and ERD secretary Mosharaf Hossain also spoke. Bangladesh Center for Advance Studies executive director Dr. Atiq Rahman delivered the welcome speech and moderated the conference. b
