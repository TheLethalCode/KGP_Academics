 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh women's cricket team lost to their Pakistani counterparts by seven wickets in the Tri-Nation Series opener at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra on Friday. Nain Abidi struck 65 to take Pakistan to 110 for three in 33.3 overs after bundling Bangladesh out for a paltry 109 all out in 46.1 overs. Opener Abidi struck 11 fours in her 96-ball knock and put on two fifty-run partnerships with Bismah Mahroof (12) and one-down Sajida Shah (17) before she was caught behind the wicket by Champa Chakma off Shuktara Rahman. After being put in to bat first, Bangladesh lost four quick wickets to be reduced to 30 and never recovered from the initial damage in the face of some disciplined bowling from the visitors. Javeria Khan was the pick of the attack with three for 20. Lata Mandal topscored with 26 followed by Shohely Akthar on 22. Opener Shathira Zakir and skipper Shathira Khatun chipped in with 16 runs each to help Bangladesh get past the 100-run mark. Pakistan will take on Sri Lanka on Saturday in the second match
