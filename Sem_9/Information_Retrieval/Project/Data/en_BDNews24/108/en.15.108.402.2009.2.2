 KARACHI, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A high court in Pakistan has suspended the national cricket board's ban on players who joined a rebel league in India. The Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) regulation under which players were banned from domestic cricket and the national team if they took part in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). "The honourable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect," Zahid Ibrahim, the legal counsel for the players, told Reuters. Ibrahim is representing around two dozen Pakistani cricketers in the case challenging the PCB ban. Former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq, Rana Naved, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami, Taufeeq Umar, Azhar Mahmood are among those affected by the ban. Ibrahim said the players had termed the ban a violation of the PCB and national constitution. "The court has directed the PCB to file its reply on Feb. 10 when the next date of hearing is set," he added. Saleem Altaf, the chief operating officer of the board, said the PCB would immediately honour the court decision. "We have no objections to the players appearing in domestic cricket as per court orders but our lawyers will be preparing their appeal," he said. The International Cricket Council executive board meeting held in Perth at the weekend deferred a decision on the ICL's application for recognition
