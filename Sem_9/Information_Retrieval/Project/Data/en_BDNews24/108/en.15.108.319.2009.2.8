 MOGADISHU, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rebels fired mortar bombs at the presidential palace in Mogadishu Saturday hours after Somalia's new President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed returned to the capital following his election at UN-led talks in Djibouti. Ahmed has promised to build on his record of bringing security when his Islamist forces ruled much of the country, which has been racked by war for 18 years.

Ethiopia's military withdrew last month, clearing the way for Ahmed's election in Djibouti a week ago. Ahmed was then feted at a February 1-4 African Union summit hosted this week by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi -- whose army drove his Islamists from power just two years ago. He said he and Meles had agreed to work together for a better Horn of Africa and for an end to conflict in the region. The hardline al Shabaab group, which is on Washington's list of foreign terrorist groups, said before the vote it would start a new campaign of hit-and-run attacks on the government -- whoever came to power
