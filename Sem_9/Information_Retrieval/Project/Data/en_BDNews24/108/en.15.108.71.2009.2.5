 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government considers ensuring public security as a big challenge, the state minister for home said on Thursday. "Safeguarding law and order is a crucial issue in forming a modern and digital Bangladesh as per the government's election pledge. It is also a big challenge," Tanjim Ahmed Sohel told reporters at the Secretariat. "It is the responsibility of the government to ensure security of the people. The law-enforcers are working 24 hours to this end," he told reporters after a meeting on law and order ahead of the International Mother Language Day on Feb. 21. The minister, better known as Sohel Taj, said the areas of Dhaka including the Central Shahid Minar had been divided into red zone and green zone. People should cooperate with the law-enforcers to keep security normal in the two zones, he said. The red zone centring the Shahid Minar will be equipped with metal detector, CCTV, the Rapid Action Battalion and other security forces. Special plans are taken to keep traffic normal in the zone. On whether they had any security fears during the programmes of International Mother Language Day, the minister said such incidents might take place at any moment, not only on the programme of Feb. 21. "We are working keeping in mind such apprehension. The law-enforcers have been put on alert." On the evaluation of the government's maintenance of law and order in one month, Sohel Taj said: "Law and order in the country is better. But it is a big challenge for us." The meeting was chaired by home minister Sahara Khatun. Among others home secretary Abdul Karim, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, RAB director general Hassan Mahmud Khandaker and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Abu Nayeem Ahmed were present. b
