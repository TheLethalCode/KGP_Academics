 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24)  The Dhaka International Trade Fair ended Saturday, receiving a total of $3 million or Tk 21 crore in spot orders, and some 30-35 lakh people visiting the fair, said commerce minister Faruq Khan. "The value of the spot orders shows the event met with success," said the minister at the closing ceremony Saturday. He also expressed the hope that a permanent venue would be finalised soon. "The foundation of the proposed venue will be laid in three or four months and the construction of the complex will be completed within four years," said the minister. The Export Promotion Bureau has been arranging the annual fair with the commerce ministry since 1995, at the temporary venue in Agargaon. On the continued growth in garments export, despite a global recession, Faruq hoped that Bangladesh would top the RMG exporters of the world in coming years. Special guest at the occasion, FBCCI president Annisul Huq said, "We hope for apparel exports of $25 billion over the next five years, and that's possible. This, if materialised, will change the country's economic status." "Export orders for Tk 6 crore worth of leather goods and furniture were special features of the Dhaka International Trade Fair this year," he said. Huq said he hoped leather goods exports would multiply tenfold. "The figures for this year's fair indicate that the first such event after the new government took office is a special success." Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed said, "Export commodities should be diversified to boost the country's export markets." Over 450 companies participated in this year's fair, including those from twelve countries including the United States, UAE, Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, India and Pakistan participated in the fair. Sri Lanka was the partner country for DITF-2009. EPB vice chairman M Shahab Ullah and Sri Lankan high commissioner Bhadival Krishnamurty also spoke on the occasion. Krishnamurty said, "Small enterprise and private sectors have to be prioritised to further bilateral relations." President Iajuddin Ahmed inaugurated the month-long fair on New Year's Day, which was later extended for seven days. bdne
