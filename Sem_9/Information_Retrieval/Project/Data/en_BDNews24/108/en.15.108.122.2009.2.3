 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) - Priyanka Gandhi was dining with prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the latter's private residence Tuesday night, after arriving in Dhaka on a two-day trip. "The dinner is a purely private gathering at Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan home," said the PM's deputy press secretary Mahbubul Hoque Shakil. "They are having dinner and nothing else," he said. The daughter of Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi is visiting Bangladesh at the invitation of BRAC, one of the largest NGOs in the world, with wings in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Africa. She was welcomed by waving crowds earlier in the day as she visited two BRAC schools and a training institute in Savar on the outskirts of the capital. Hundreds of people lined the roadsides along the route waving and cheering to a smiling Priyanka on her way to the two schools at Charabagh and Kumkumari. The schoolchildren greeted her with a cultural show. Priyanka also spent time speaking with individual students, before going on to the BRAC training and resource centre at Khagan in Savar. Priyanka landed in Dhaka Tuesday afternoon for a two-day trip, the plane touching down just after 4pm at Zia International Airport. Born to the late Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia, and granddaughter of former Indian premier Indira Gandhi, Priyanka is being provided maximum security throughout her stay. Special Security Force officers were in place with three-tier security arrangements as she landed at the airport, said officials. The 36-year-old Priyanka is the first high-profile Indian dignitary to visit Bangladesh since Hasina's new government came to power in early January. Priyanka's brother MP and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi came to Bangladesh on a similar visit in August last year. Rajiv Gandhi Foundation secretary Gyanendra Bagdaiya and trainer Sonia Phillip are accompanying Priyanka during her visit. bdnews2
