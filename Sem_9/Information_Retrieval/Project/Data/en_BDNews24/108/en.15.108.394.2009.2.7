 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com) - The industries minister on Saturday said priority was being given to develop the SME sector to face long-term economic challenges brought by the worldwide recession. "We ourselves have to find ways to face all the difficulties emanating from the global economic slowdown," Dilip Barua told reporters after launching a workshop on the role of information technology in flourishing small and medium enterprises. The minister said his government was crafting a well-coordinated industrial policy to "activate the wheel of the national economy", which would protect all stakeholders' interests. He also said priority was being given to develop small and medium enterprises to face economic challenges. "Massive employment could be generated by building up information technology-intensive SMEs. The country's economists and development experts are placing emphasis on building our own economic safety net through such a measure," said Barua. He hoped effective strategies and recommendations would emerge form the workshop, organised by the SME Foundation, in further developing the sector. The minister also felt the need for a stable political atmosphere to change the national economic scenario and, "above all, political unity for the sake of national interests". "Bangladesh could become a middle-income country with the concerted efforts of all by 2021," he said. He called private entrepreneurs to come forward from an attitude of corporate responsibility. "If we work together, we can carry the country forward by facing the challenges of globalisation." President of DCCI Zafar Osman, honorary president of IEB Dr. Nazrul Islam and Mujibur Rahman of the SME Foundation were present among others at the opening ceremony.
