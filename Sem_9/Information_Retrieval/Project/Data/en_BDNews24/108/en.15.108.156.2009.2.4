 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday granted ad-interim anticipatory bail to former BNP minister Tariqul Islam and Orion Group Chairman Obaidul Karim in a corruption case. "The court enlarged them on bail for two months or until submission of the police report in the case, whichever comes earlier," Tariqul's lawyer Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan told bdnews24.com. It also issued rule upon the government to show cause within 6 weeks as to why the two should not be enlarged on regular anticipatory bail. A HC bench of justices Syed A B Mahmudul Haque and Mainul Islam Chowdhury passed the order upon separate bail applications of BNP leader Tariqul and Orion boss Obaidul. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on May 2005, with Joydevpur Police, on allegations against the two of grabbing land on the Bhaoal Estate. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan moved the petition for Tariqul and Advocate Ahsanul Karim appeared for Obaidul Karim.
