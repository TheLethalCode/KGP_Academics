 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Andrew Flintoff is hopeful of being fit for England's first test against West Indies at Sabina Park on Wednesday after missing the final warm-up match with a side strain. The 31-year-old Lancashire player played a full part in a net session on Monday and said a final decision on his fitness would be made after Tuesday's practise session. "We will see how I rock up tomorrow," Flintoff was quoted as saying on the England and Wales Cricket Board website (www.ecb.co.uk) on Monday. "I feel fine. I bowled some overs in St Kitts, bowled some more today but I have still got to get through tomorrow and make sure I am fit going into the first day. "I am hopeful and providing everything is alright, hopefully I will be fit." Flintoff had scans on his left side and although nothing serious was diagnosed said he would not risk aggravating the injury by rushing back too soon. "It is a bowling injury which probably no-one wants," said the all-rounder, who was troubled by a similar injury last year. "The one main concern with it is that, although on the scan it is fine, there is a risk of aggravating it. "I have got to prove tomorrow that there is no danger of doing that.
