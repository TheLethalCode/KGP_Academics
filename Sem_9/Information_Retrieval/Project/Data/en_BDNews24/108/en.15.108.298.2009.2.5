 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has asked Japan to make available more funds to implement the Padma Bridge, a minister said on Thursday. "The Bangladesh government has sought more assistance from Japan for the implementation of Padma Bridge," communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after a meeting with Japanese envoy Masayuki Inoue at the Secretariat. Japan has so far pledged $200 million for the key bridge connecting the south to the central region of the country, the minister said. "But more money might be required later. That's why we have requested them to increase the assistance and the envoy has ensured us to this end," Hossain said. The Japanese envoy told reporters his country provided Bangladesh financial assistance in various sectors and that would increase in future. Hossain said Japan was also keen on providing assistance to help improve vehicle and transport system of Dhaka City. The government gave a positive response, he said. Bangladesh also sought assistance in constructing three bridges including Chittagong's Karnaphuli Bridge, the minister said. The envoy said he would decide on the matter in consultation with other donors, according to Hossain. b
