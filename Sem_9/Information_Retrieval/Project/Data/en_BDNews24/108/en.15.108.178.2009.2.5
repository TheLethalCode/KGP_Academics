 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chief has dismissed as "not right" the prime minister's contention that the antigraft drive was used to shackle politicians. "The Anticorruption Commission has conducted its drive on specific information and evidence. The remark that the commission was used to shackle politicians is not right," chairman Hasan Moshhud Chowdhury said on Thursday. He negated prime minister Sheikh Hasina's remarks at a regular briefing of the commission at its headquarters in Segun Bagicha in the city. Hasina on Wednesday told parliament that the ACC should be "reconstituted" to ensure its accountability. During her weekly question-answer session, the head of government said the antigraft drive during the caretaker government's two-year tenure became an "anti-politician drive", and the ACC was itself tainted by allegations of corruption. The prime minister, who herself was detained in jail for 11 months until 2008 on graft charges brought by the ACC, said the commission itself was said to be involved in corrupt practices during the caretaker regime. "During the caretaker government's tenure we heard many stories. Some people were arrested on corruption charges, but later released in exchange for money," said Hasina. She said people had hailed the ACC's anti-graft drive, "but it came under suspicion when it was aimed at elimination of politicians". "Their anticorruption drive was called into question when they became involved in forming a new political party, executing the so-called Minus Two, Minus One formulas," Hasina said. But, Hasina also had some positive words for the caretaker government's antigraft drive. "During the caretaker government, people began to realise that none could escape trial for corrupt practices. They could be tried any time." The prime minister said she would examine the ACC's recommendations on elimination of corruption and subscribe to those that were "acceptable". The ACC boss said he had not been considering to resign his position. "I don't see anything to decide suddenly being hot tempered. I hope the matter will be clear in the coming days," he said. On the premier's comment that the ACC should be "reconstituted" to ensure accountability, he said, "I don't think I have any scope to comment on the prime minister's remarks, as I think that would be indecent. "If there is any necessity of any explanation of her remark, it is she who should give it." "Now our duty is to create a work-friendly relation with the government and to inform it about the ACC's working procedure." Replying to another query, Hasan Moshhud said he met the prime minister on Jan. 21 and discussed on ACC's management. "I hope the government would take appropriate steps on the basis of necessity." He denied the allegation that the ACC's activities during the last caretaker government had raised questions. "The allegation is not right. The cases during the period was filed on the basis of information and proof. It is yet to be proved that the ACC is under question," he said. Two ACC commissioners have been tasked to investigate allegations against Hasan Moshhud of money laundering at the Trust Bank, while he was chairman of the private bank. Whether the investigation against the ACC chairman by the ACC commissioners will be influenced, he said, "It is not correct that they are [under my influence]. Both of them are working independently." "They have interrogated me without any resistance on my side and they will do it again if necessary." On why the ACC did not press any charges against any Awami League leader since the party's win in the Dec. 29 general election, the chairman said, "We didn't do it willingly." An adviser to the former caretaker government, Hasan Moshhud said he was '51 percent satisfied' with his performance over the last two years since his appointment on Feb. 25, 2007. bdnew
