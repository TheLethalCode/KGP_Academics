<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her family moved into the state guest house Jamuna around noon Friday, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. Hasina is going to put up at the state guest house for the first time as prime minister. She had gone up to live at Gano Bhaban straight after being sworn in as the head of government in 1996. "Hasina wanted to shift to Gano Bhaban this time too, but it was not possible as the official prime minister's residence had remained unused for the last seven years, rendering the facility unlivable," said Azad. "The prime minister will be staying at Jamuna until Gano Bhaban is renovated and readied for her use." Before her personal effects were transferred to Jamuna, Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and daughter Saima Wazed Putul visited the state quarters to see if it was suitable for the premier's use. Hasina had last shifted to Sudha Sadan before the 2001 election and has since been staying there. bdnews
