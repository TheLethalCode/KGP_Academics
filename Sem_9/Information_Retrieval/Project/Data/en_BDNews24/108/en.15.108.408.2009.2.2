 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com) - BNP, frustrated over the speaker's statement on resolving the seat dispute in the next session of parliament, continued their boycott on Monday. "We are not going to parliament today," BNP's chief whip Joynal Abedin Faruq told reporters after a parliamentary party meeting at the opposition leader's meeting room. "We haven't received any dignified reply from the speaker. So the parliamentary party meeting was held to air our frustration," Faruq said. He said the BNP PP would meet again over the issue on Tuesday afternoon. "We are demanding the seating arrangement of the opposition bench that was in place at the beginning of the session. We are requesting the speaker to reconsider the issue," Faruq said. Presided over by senior BNP MP Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, MPs from allied parties - Jamaat-e-Islami and BJP  also attended the meeting. The BNP-led opposition boycotted parliament from Jan. 28 protesting speaker Abdul Hamid's decision to reduce their front row seats to four from the previous nine. They have said they would not return to parliament without getting a response from the speaker on their demand to restore three more seats to them on the front row. BNP has argued the left-side front bench is for the opposition and its MPs should get at least seven seats. Outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar gave his BNP party nine front row seats. According to the rules of procedure, the speaker is the authority on seating arrangements and MPs must accept the same. Hamid urged BNP to return to the House earlier Monday for the current session to settle the seat dispute for the next session of parliament. "We are considering the issue of a new seat arrangement for the next session of parliament," Hamid told bdnews24.com. "There could be a change in the seat order if BNP return during the current session so we can work things out." The current session of parliament will run until Feb 26. bdnews24.c
