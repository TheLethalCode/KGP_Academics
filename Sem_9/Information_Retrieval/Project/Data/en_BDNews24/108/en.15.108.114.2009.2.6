<TITLE> BNP prefers multilateral transit facilities </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Friday said they were for expanding multilateral regional transit facilities under SAARC, instead of going for a bilateral transit treaty with India. "It might prove suicidal for Bangladesh to actually afford India corridor passage in the name of bilateral transit," Delwar said on Friday. "On the other hand, if we try to establish an expanded multi-national transit network to be enjoyed by our neighbouring countries, looping in China, Myanmar, Iran and central Asia, it should benefit all the countries involved economically, through enhanced trade and commerce." Delwar briefed reporters at BNP chairperson's Gulshan office in the morning on his party's position on the Bangladesh-India transit and the renewal of goods transportation treaty with India. He claimed that the goods transport agreement renewed on Thursday had not been signed in 1980 during the regime of president Ziaur Rahman, rather on March 28, 1972. A 'copy of the original agreement of 1972' was distributed among reporters. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said on Thursday the goods transport deal was signed in 1980, under president Ziaur Rahman, and was renewed most recently on March 21, 2006, by the then finance minister Saifur Rahman for three years. The cabinet on Thursday decided to renew the bilateral goods transport deal with India for three years. Delwar claimed that no agreement was signed by president Zia's government and that the renewal was the continuation of the 1972 goods transport deal. "No government executed the clause 5 of the 1972 goods transport agreement as it explicitly stated the issue of transit facility," Delwar said. Both agreements spoke of use of waterways, roadways and railways of the two countries for passage of goods between two places in one country through the territory of the other. The wordings are same in clause 5 of the so-called 1972 agreement made available to journalists by BNP and in clause 8 of the 2006 accord signed by the BNP government. BNP's policymaking standing committee at a meeting chaired by party chief Khaleda Zia discussed the issues Thursday night. Delwar warned, "If India is allowed corridor facilities under the guise of 'transit', Bangladesh will lose India as a market for her commodities, increasing the already yawning trade deficit further." "We are terribly apprehensive about the government not sharing with the public the details of the envisaged transit treaty it plans to execute with India." Delwar alleged the recently renewed freight-carrying deal with India had been executed on March 28, 1972. Therefore, the commerce minister's claim that 'the agreement was executed during former president Ziaur Rahman's regime' is not true, he said. "No new trade deal was executed during Zia's tenure. It was all renewals of the 1972 agreement, article 5 of which was never implemented as it concerned the much-debated 'transit' issue." Delwar termed untrue the government's allegation that 'the BNP government in 1993 had given India transit facilities under SAPTA'. "SAPTA is a multidimensional cooperation treaty, a component of the SAARC structure. The corridor pact under the guise of transit is out-and-out a bilateral issue to be settled," he explained. Elaborating BNP's stance against 'transit', the BNP secretary general said, "The proposed transit treaty will jeopardise our sovereignty, national security and economic backbone, creating myriad socio-political problems." "The north-east Indian rebels may carry out target-practice exercises within Bangladesh territories in case they take the Indian goods carriers plying our highways and railways to be actually transporting arms and ammunition to quell rebellions in the east." Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, a BNP standing committee member, presented the 1972 Bangladesh-India Trade Treaty. "The said treaty was signed by the Bangladesh commerce minister MR Siddiqui and his Indian counterpart LN Mishra. The treaty had since been renewed as required, leaving its article 5 concerning 'transit' aside," he said. "But the present commerce minister hid truth and lied in the public saying that the treaty was signed during BNP's rule." Former BNP lawmakers Fazlul Haque Milan, Shireen Sultana, Habibul Islam Habib and others were present at the briefing. b
