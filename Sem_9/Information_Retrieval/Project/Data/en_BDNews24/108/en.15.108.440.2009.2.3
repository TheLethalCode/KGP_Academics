 COLOMBO, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan equalled the world record for one-day international wickets but was powerless to prevent India amassing a huge total of 363 for five in the third match of the series on Tuesday. Centuries by Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh rescued the visitors after they had slumped to 24 for two. Yuvraj was eventually out when he cut Muralitharan to Chamara Kapugedera at point, giving the off-spinner his 502nd wicket and tying the record held by Pakistan paceman Wasim Akram. The 36-year-old Muralitharan, playing in his 327th ODI, also holds the world record for most test wickets. Left-hander Yuvraj slammed 15 fours and one six as he made 117 off 95 deliveries. It was his 11th ODI hundred. Sehwag struck 17 fours as he reached his 10th ODI century, scoring 116 off 89 balls. The pair figured in a 221-run, third-wicket stand as they took full advantage of wayward bowling and poor fielding. It was India's highest third-wicket partnership against Sri Lanka, bettering the 175 made by Navjot Sidhu and Mohammed Azharuddin in Sharjah in 1995, and Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkar in Delhi a year later. Sehwag and Yuvraj produced a stirring fightback for the visitors after Tendulkar had fallen for seven and Gautam Gambhir for 10. Opener Sehwag, dropped off his own bowling by Sanath Jayasuriya on 72, was eventually run out by the same player after a direct hit from mid-off. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan then shared a breezy, unbroken stand of 85 in 64 balls for the sixth wicket. Pathan cracked a career-best 59 not out off 38 deliveries while Dhoni compiled an unbeaten 35. Sri Lanka are 2-0 down in the five-match series
