<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Ashraful has been renamed captain and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza his deputy of national cricket team on Saturday, a day after both cricketers were sold to the Indian Premier League franchises. "The Executive Committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board has reappointed Mohammad Ashraful captain and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza vice captain of the national team until the end of the Bangladesh tour of the West Indies in July and August," BCB media committee chairman Jalal Younus told reporters emerging from the meeting at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. That means Ashraful will lead the side in three series  a five-ODI home series against Pakistan in March, the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in England in June, and the two Tests and three-ODI away series against the West Indies. The two-year tenure of Ashraful and Mashrafee expired in December, but they were given a one-month extension in January during Bangladesh's two-Test series against Sri Lanka and a tri-nation one-day internationals tournament, also involving Zimbabwe. Before reappointing Ashraful captain, the board also considered two senior players Mashrafee and Mushfiqur Rahim but it finally pinned their hopes on him. "We had also considered Mortaza in terms of seniority and Mushfiqur Rahim for his maturity as prospective candidates for the captaincy. "Both are captaining their respective club sides in the Dhaka Premier League this season and the board wants to give them more time to grow in the role. Their captaincy in the Premier League will be monitored by the board," said Younus. Asked whether Shakib Al Hasan was discussed, Younus said, "The meeting also discussed Shakib after Mashrafee and Mushfiqur. But the board doesn't want to burden him with captaincy at a time when his performance is fine." The meeting, however, had yet to finalise the review of the players' contract, which expired in November last. "The process is going on as the players have some reservations and demands, and the board wants to consider those though we have almost finalised the review of the players' contract and their salary structure." A rise in the players' perks was discussed after six national cricketers scrapped their contracts with the BCB to join the rebel Indian Cricket League in October last year. Coach Jamie Siddons was summoned to the meeting and he made a presentation of his activities and team's progress. "One of the key features of his presentation was Shakib Al Hasan's transformation with the bat over the last year. The coach showed us Shakib's backlift when he (Siddons) first came in and his present state which is more technically correct and allows him to play shots more comfortably and freely," said Younus. He also added the coach had promised them that Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique would soon improve as he had been working with them. The meeting also decided to provide some Tk 7 lakh to the family of deceased Manjarul Islam Rana, who died in a road accident in 2006. The board raised the money from a benefit match between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in the Tri-Nation Cup at home. The meeting also decided to set up a BCB Welfare Trust to award benefits to the players, organisers, umpires, scorer and BCB staffers. Younus said they had a plan to raise Tk 1 crore funds for the Trust and some Tk 36 lakh will be initially put into the fund
