<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Thu Feb 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon has said that Pakistan's spy agency was linked to planners behind the Mumbai attack, the first time the government has directly named the organization over November's deadly raids. "The perpetrators planned, trained and launched their attacks from Pakistan, and the organizers were and remain clients and creations of the ISI," Menon said in a speech in Paris, referring to the military spy agency. The speech was delivered at a foreign affairs conference in Paris on Wednesday but was released to the media on Thursday by India's foreign ministry. Relations between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have been strained since militants killed 179 people in the attacks, and India has put dialogue on hold. Menon's speech steps up India's rhetoric against Pakistan. Menon in the speech accused Pakistan of "prevarication" in investigating the attacks and bringing the perpetrators to justice. India blames the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group for the attacks in its commercial hub and said there must have been support from Pakistani official agencies, but generally never mentions the ISI by name. Pakistan has denied any involvement by state agencies and says it is investigating a dossier of information from India. The dossier contained the confession of a surviving attacker, satellite phone intercepts between the attackers and their handlers in Pakistan, and a list of Pakistani-made weapons used by the militants, India said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday that Pakistan must fully investigate the attacks in India's financial hub and cooperate with the Indian government on the issue
