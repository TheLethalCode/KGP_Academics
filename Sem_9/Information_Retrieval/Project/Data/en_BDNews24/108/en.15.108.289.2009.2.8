 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com) - Students on Saturday at Kazi Nazrul Islam University in Mymensingh brought out a procession with sticks, which broke out into violence and vandalism, over semester fees and hostel charges. "Police tried to enter the campus as the situation deteriorated. But they had to return to barracks in the face of the students' resistance," officer in charge of Trishal Police Station, Abul-Al-Khaer, told bdnews24.com. The university was brought to a halt, with the vice chancellor, teachers, officials and employees unable to attend their offices, as the agitated students put locks on administrative and academic buildings. The students vandalised buildings and set fire to tyres on the campus roads. An emergency meeting of the university syndicate was called at 8pm, VC Dr. M Shamsur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The students began pushing authorities to lower test fees to Tk 1,500 from Tk 4,500 and hostel charges from Tk 300 to Tk 50. The VC said he and local MP Reza Ali had tried to sit in talks with the students, but they failed. "We tried up for the past few days to sit in a meeting with the students, but they did not respond to any call from us," said Shamsur Rahman. The students later held a rally at the university's central Shaheed Minar and vowed to continue their movement under their demands were met, said police officer Abul-Al-Khaer. bdnews24.c
