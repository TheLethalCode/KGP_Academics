 BOGOTA, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian FARC rebels freed four hostages held in jungle camps on Sunday in the first handover of captives by Latin America's oldest insurgency in a year, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. A Brazilian helicopter ferried a Red Cross delegation and a left-wing senator to pick up three captive police officers and one soldier in Colombia's southern jungles in the first of three planned releases this week. The new handovers have fueled speculation the weakened rebels will free more captives to seek political leverage and restore their battered image. But talks with the government appear far off as both sides are deadlocked over demands. "We are going to keep working for the other releases," Red Cross spokesman Yves Heller told reporters in Villavicencio town, where the helicopter was due to arrive. A FARC commander called Jairo Martinez told Telesur channel the release was delayed by Colombian military operations, but the government denied the military had interfered. The army had said earlier it would suspend actions in the area to guarantee safety for the handover. "There is no credibility to the guerrilla's statements," Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told reporters. A second flight on Monday plans to lift out a politician held hostage for more than seven years and a third operation later in the week will receive another captive lawmaker from jungles near the remote Pacific coast. BATTERED BUT SURVIVING Once a powerful army of 17,000 that held large swaths of Colombia, the FARC has been driven back into remote mountains and jungles after President Alvaro Uribe sent troops out to retake control and crush their four-decade-old insurgency. The FARC was battered last year by the deaths of three commanders, desertions and the rescue in July of a group of high-profile captives it hoped to use as bargaining chips, including three Americans and a French-Colombia lawmaker. The rebels have demanded Uribe demilitarize an area roughly the size of New York City as a safe haven to guarantee talks with the government over swapping around 20 political hostages as a first step toward peace negotiations. While violence in the cities has ebbed, the FARC remain a force in rural areas where state presence is weak and they get massive funding from Colombia's huge cocaine trade. Authorities believe a FARC extortion racket was to be blame for a bomb that killed two people in the capital this month. Wary of past failed attempts to broker deals with the FARC, Uribe refuses rebel conditions on demilitarization saying that would allow the rebels to regroup. But he has offered a smaller haven under international observation. "This is a move in vain by the FARC to try to regain the political space it has lost," Alfredo Rangel at the Bogota-based Security and Democracy think tank said of the hostage releases. "We need to see some sign they will give up kidnapping, seek an unconditional truce and not demand demilitarization ... and until we see that we are in the same situation.
