 MILAN, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham wants to stay at AC Milan after his loan from Los Angeles Galaxy finishes on March 9, the Serie A club's chief executive, Adriano Galliani, said on Tuesday. The 33-year-old midfielder, who has been in fine form for Milan, moved to Italy during the long U.S. close season on a two-month loan deal to try to stay in the frame for a place in the England side. Galaxy have insisted Beckham return in March but he has said he is torn. "We are working to keep him and I think he would like that too," Galliani told Gazzetta dello Sport. "Milan will do everything to have Beckham even after March. It is clear that it's our wish to have him until the end of the season or on a permanent deal." For technical reasons, his loan is actually until June meaning Milan can talk to Galaxy outside of the transfer window, which closed on Monday. However, there is a written agreement that he goes back to the United States in March. "There's a hope but contracts should be honoured," Galliani added. "If Galaxy want to talk, we would be very happy to try. But they are in the right. Beckham must return to America on March 9. Let's wait.
