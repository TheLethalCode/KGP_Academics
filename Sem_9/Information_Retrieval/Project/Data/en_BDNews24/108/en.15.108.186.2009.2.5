 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain does not see Bangladesh signing any transit deal during Pranab Mukherjee's Feb 9 visit to Dhaka. The foreign secretary told bdnews24.com on Thursday that Dhaka and Delhi, however, were set to sign two trade and economic deals during the Indian foreign minister's visit. A new agreement on mutual investment protection will give most favoured nation (MFN) status to each other, the foreign secretary said. The other will be a renewal of an old deal, originally signed in 1980 during the rule of Gen Ziaur Rahman. The deal has since been renewed every three years. Earlier in the day, the cabinet gave the clearance to the renewal of the 28-year-old agreement, which includes a clause dealing with water, rail and road transit. India has for long enjoyed water transport facility through the Bangladesh territory, but the part on road and rail transit has never been activated. "I don't see any possibility of signing a transit treaty during this visit," Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com at his foreign ministry office. "This is basically a goodwill trip." Officials say Bangladesh has MFN deals with 24 nations. Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee will arrive in Bangladesh on Feb. 9 for a day-long tour. The foreign secretary said the renewal of the bilateral trade deal will enable both countries to use their roads, rivers and railways for the purpose of business. "Security is also one of the issues to be discussed during Pranab Mukherjee's visit. Because, security is a common concern for both countries," said the foreign secretary. The Indian high commissioner last month said the Dhaka plans for a new anti-terrorism regional forum might be on the agenda. Touhid said the growing trade imbalance and border management would also come up for discussion. He said the problems of the Dahagram-Angorpota Bangladeshi enclave in Indian territory would also be addressed. "I hope the problems of the people living in Dahagram-Angorpota will be speedily resolved on humanitarian grounds, as a positive attitude has developed in both countries for resolving the problems," he said. b
