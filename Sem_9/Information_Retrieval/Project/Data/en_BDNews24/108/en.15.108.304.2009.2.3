<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has demanded the continuation of Special Security Force protection for party chairperson Khaleda Zia saying her safety is "at risk". "With the rise of fanatic militancy and terrorism, safety of the three-time [sic] prime minister and current opposition leader Khaleda Zia is threatened," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told a press briefing on Tuesday. "On behalf of the party I appealed in writing to the government on Jan 21for continuing her SSF protection, but to no avail." Delwar slated the government's silence on the issue. "The government will have to be responsible for any security breach that threatens Khaleda," he told reporters at the party's Gulshan office. In his letter to the government, the BNP secretary general said during her last five-year term as premier, Khaleda Zia took initiatives to tame militants and terrorists. "These evil-doers could try to retaliate on her and this is a matter of grave concern." He also cited the "abortive grenade attack attempt" on Khaleda at Chandina in Comilla during her campaigning ahead of the Dec. 29 national elections. The previous caretaker government deployed the 'three-tier' SSF to ensure maximum security for both Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia from Nov 2 last year for a period of three months to cover the pre- and post-election period. The three-month long protection ended for Khaleda on Monday. "A few police personnel only, led by an officer, are now guarding Khaleda. It is not enough to ensure the security of a former prime minister and leader of opposition in parliament," said Delwar. "We hope the government will make quick decisions to provide Special Security Force personnel to protect the former head of the government," he said. The briefing was also attended among others by BNP leaders Dr. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Dr RA Ghani, M Shamsul Islam, Selima Rahman, Abdullah Al-Noman and Rizvi Ahmed. bdnews24
