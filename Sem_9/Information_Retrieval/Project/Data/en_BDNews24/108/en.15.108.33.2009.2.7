<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  US assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs Richard A Boucher has climbed on board the idea raised by Bangladesh to commission a regional taskforce to tackle terrorism. "I saw that proposal. I think it's a very interesting idea," the visiting senior US official told reporters following his meeting with home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Tanjim Ahmed Sohel on Saturday at the home ministry. "I think we all understand that terrorists are trying to do international operations on the international community, [we'd better got organised and cooperated] with each other to prevent that," he said advocating the proposed regional taskforce. "So I think it is a good idea. We will see how other countries in the region react to it. "The United States will look for ways to support it," he said. The assistant secretary said the US and Bangladesh had cooperation in the many areas. "We have a lot of different kinds of cooperation, we will look for ways to expand and continue that cooperation. "We look to help the government with the quality of policing, with the quality of the RAB and its operations just in a variety of areas where we can," he said. Boucher, who arrived in the capital early morning on a two-day visit, urged Bangladesh to ensure its soil was not used for launching terror attacks or harbouring militants. "Obviously we all want to work in a way so that terrorists cannot use Bangladesh soil and that would be an important area of cooperation," he observed. State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, better known as Sohel Taj, told reporters after the meeting that they had discussed about the taskforce. He added that the government would do everything possible to combat terrorism. "We, on behalf of the government, have told him that we have kept all options open to combat terrorism and militancy," Sohel said to the waiting reporters. "Our prime minister clearly pledged in our manifesto for the Dec. 29 polls that she would form a regional joint taskforce, if necessary, to combat terrorism and militancy. We (Boucher and they) have discussed about it," he said. The proposed South Asian anti-terror body was included in the ruling Awami League's election manifesto. A British Airways flight carrying Boucher touched down at Zia International Airport at around 7am, with US embassy officials welcoming him at the airport. Boucher met BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition in parliament Khaleda Zia at the latter's Gulshan office at around 6pm. He is expected to call on prime minister Sheikh Hasina around 3pm on Sunday. Boucher is also scheduled to meet with foreign minister Dipu Moni and her deputy Hasan Mahmood on Sunday. The assistant secretary, who last visited Bangladesh in May 2007, wraps up his Bangladesh trip on Sunday night. His current visit is viewed as significant in the light of ongoing discussions on a proposed Trade and Investment Framework Agreement or TIFA with the United States.
