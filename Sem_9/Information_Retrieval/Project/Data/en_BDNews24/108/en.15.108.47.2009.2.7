 NEW DELHI,Feb 7(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Saturday it will construct a temple, that has been a flashpoint of tension between Hindus and Muslims for years, if the party is voted to power in the ensuing elections. Leaders of the BJP, the main Hindu nationalist opposition, are meeting in Nagpur in a last major gathering before taking on the Congress party-led alliance in elections to be held in April and May. "We will build the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and we are waiting for the right opportunity," Rajnath Singh, the party president, told about 8,000 BJP members on Saturday. "No one can alter our resolve." The BJP rose to prominence on the back of a Hindu revivalist campaign that sought the construction of a Ram temple on the site of a 16th century mosque torn down by mobs in 1992. About 3,000 people were killed after Hindu mobs destroyed the mosque in some of India's worst Hindu-Muslim riots. Singh said new laws could be formed to speed up construction of the temple, if it won the election. After winning the general elections in 1999, the BJP was forced to abandon plans of constructing the temple by its secular coalition allies. Experts said that move did not go well with its hardline supporters, and the party was now trying to woo them back before the biggest electoral exercise in the world gets underway. "They are probably beginning to believe that the temple issue can win them votes," Kuldip Nayar, a political analyst, said. "The shift to the Ram temple issue can hurt the BJP badly." Others said reviving the temple issue will not go down well with its allies. "The Ram temple was no longer a major election issue, but it seems the party is reviving it before elections," Anil K. Verma, a political commentator, told Reuters. "It could be self-defeating." Some analysts say a BJP victory could swing India to a stronger pro-market agenda after several years of reform stagnation that have investors worried about India's capacity to sustain growth. India is suffering an economic downturn and food prices have risen sharply, hurting millions of people.
