<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general on Thursday warned that people will not accept TIFA or transit agreements with the US and India if they are signed against the country's interests. "There must be discussions in parliament before signing any such deals," Khandaker Delwar Hossain reiterated while addressing a meeting organised by BNP-backed youth organisation Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal. Delwar said the ruling Awami League were "in too much of a hurry" to sign the agreements. He urged all, regardless of profession, to be united to protect the country's independence and sovereignty. Delwar came down hard on the government for withdrawing Special Security Force protection from BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. The BNP leader said the government had put the former prime minister's safety at risk. Reiterating BNP's eagerness to join parliament, Delwar said, "We want to play an effective role as opposition." "But the government does not want BNP to play that role and that's why it has made a crisis by rearranging the seats of the opposition in parliament." The meeting at the National Press Club, organised to protest the withdrawal of Khaleda Zia's SSF security, was presided over by Jubo Dal president Barkat Ullah Bulu. bdnews
