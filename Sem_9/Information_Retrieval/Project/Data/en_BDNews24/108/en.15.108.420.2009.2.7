 Chittagong, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The young generations can learn about their identity from books, which contain the true history of a nation, said shipping minister Afsarul Amin inaugurating the port city's Ekushey Boi Mela on Saturday. "The real history of a nation lies in its books," he said, launching a series of programmes that kicked off the fortnight long book fair. "But the Bangalees lack the zeal for reading, which carries a nation forward. We are lagging behind the advanced world for lack of reading habit," the minister told a book discussion. "Chittagong, home to lots of movements, with an educated population, can lead the way with this book fair that is a rendezvous for writers, publishers and readers," said the minister. Chaired by head of the fair's organising committee, industrialist Abdus Salam, the meeting was also attended among others by Chittagong Awami League general secretary Kazi Inamul Huq Danu and local PDB chief engineer Tulshi Das Saha. Kranti, a musical group from Dhaka, performed songs along with local artists. The book fair will continue through Feb 22, organisers said. b
