 Dhaka, Feb2 (bdnews24.com)The energy ministry has recommended creation of a 'gas development fund' using revenue generated from an increased gas price. "The recommendation came from an inter-ministerial meeting today (Monday), and the matter will now be taken up with other relevant government agencies," the energy secretary told bdnews24.com. "We will get in touch with the finance ministry and the National Board of Revenue," Mohammad Mohsin said. "A final decision will come only after that." The Monday's meeting brought together officials from the energy ministry and the Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), but none from finance or NBR. The state-owned Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) has long been insisting on hiking pricing and reducing the number of price slabs. On June 23 last year, Petrobangla proposed to the BERC that the gas rates for electricity generators and fertiliser producers be unified and raised from Tk 73.63 and 63.59 respectively to a common rate of Tk 93.73 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). Similarly, the Petrobangla said, the prices for captive power plants and small generators (Tk 105.59) and industrial production and tea gardens (Tk 148.13) be upped to Tk 182.25 per MCF. For commercial and domestic uses, the rates were proposed to be raised from Tk 233.12 to Tk 291.59 and from Tk 130 to Tk 208.28 respectively. The cost of gas for one burner would be Tk 550, up from Tk 350; for two burners Tk 600 from Tk 400. The BERC rejected the Petrobangla proposals in Nov, but said the prices could be "refixed" only if the extra revenue was channelled to ensure energy security. To create a gas development fund, a 10-15 percent increase would be acceptable, the BERC said. The gas price was last raised on Jan 1, 2005. Petrobangla has since suggested a rise in gas price at least five times, only to be rebuffed by the regulators.
