 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission has postponed the poll results of a dozen more Upazila on charges of irregularities, an election commissioner said on Monday. "On these allegations reaching the Commission, we considered deferment of election results of a few more Upazila," said Muhammad Sohul Hussain. "A final decision is expected on Tuesday and if no grave violation is found in the investigations, the results will be declared final," Sohul said on Monday. Fellow election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters departmental investigations would be carried out against code breach in the twelve Upazila and stern actions would be taken against those found responsible. EC officials said gazette printing of the Upazila poll results was already underway in phases, with those of some 32 districts going to press. The EC earlier decided to postpone the polls results in eight Upazila after allegations of irregularities by BNP. bdnews
