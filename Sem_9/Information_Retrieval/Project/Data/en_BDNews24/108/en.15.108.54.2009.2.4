<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Childhood Cancer Society will carry out a series of programmes to mark the World Cancer Day on Wednesday. A human chain will be formed and a rally will start at 10 am from the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and a press conference will be held at 11 am at the National Press Club, said a press release issued on Tuesday. "Since its inception in 2007, BCCS has been undertaking several programmes to mark the day every year on Feb 4," the press release said. "Mass wareness could drastically cut the rate of cancer deaths as strict hygiene is a must-do for the patients and their parents as viral and bacterial attacks by the uncontrolled visits cause cross infections that accelerate death," the statement said. "Only 500-600 children affected with cancers get treatment in the paediatric haematology and oncology ward of BSMMU, the lone full-fledged and recognised center in the country, whereas no less than 6000 children are attacked with the dreadful disease annually." "Medical care in the area is almost non-existent in the country except in Dhaka," said the statement. BCCS is striving to reach the treatment to the doorsteps of people across the country, the statement continued. The Society is setting up a Home for the Childhood Cancer Patients and planning a composite medical institute with a hospital, BCCS secretary general ADM Alauddin said. "We are planning to set up branches all over the country, and reach medical care to the ailing humanity," he said
