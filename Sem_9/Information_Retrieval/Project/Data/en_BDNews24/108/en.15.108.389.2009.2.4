 Wiesbaden, Germany, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Envoys from the world's leading powers met in Germany on Wednesday to discuss a new strategy for pressuring Iran to give up its sensitive nuclear work. Senior officials from the United States, Russia, Britain, China, France and Germany have met regularly over the years to discuss Iran policy, but the meeting in the western city of Wiesbaden has attracted more interest than usual because it will be the first since U.S. President Barack Obama took office. Obama has vowed to pursue direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, a move the last U.S. administration rejected, and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday the United States would put forward this new stance in Germany. "We are reaching out a hand, but the fist has to unclench," Clinton said after meeting British Foreign Secretary David Miliband in Washington. When contacted in his Wiesbaden hotel room, the U.S. point man on Iran, Bill Burns, declined comment on the talks. The U.N. Security Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions against Iran for refusing to suspend uranium enrichment. Western powers suspect the work is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran says it is for peaceful power purposes. A day before the meeting in Germany, Iran announced it had launched a satellite into orbit for the first time, a step timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution to oust the U.S.-backed Shah. The White House voiced "acute concern" over Iran's actions. In a contribution for the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier welcomed the Obama administration's readiness to talk with Iran, calling the current showdown unsustainable. "I call on those responsible in Tehran to seize this opportunity," Steinmeier wrote.
