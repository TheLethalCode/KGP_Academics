<TITLE> Former French warship heads for British scrapyard </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BREST, France, Tue Feb 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The stripped-out hulk of a decommissioned French warship is being towed to Britain to be broken up, authorities said on Tuesday, three years after the vessel was turned away as an environmental hazard by India. The former aircraft carrier Clemenceau, once the pride of the French navy but now a bare shell designated merely as "Hull Q790", is expected to take four days to reach the northern English port of Hartlepool. The old ship had been docked in the French port of Brest since 2006, when it returned from a 18,000 kilometre return voyage between France and India. Stripped of its equipment, the 27,000-tonne hulk had been destined for an Indian scrap yard but local authorities ruled the asbestos on board could pose serious health risks and blocked it from entering Indian territorial waters. The hulk has been partially decontaminated in France and has also been scraped to clear it of limpets and Japanese algae, which does not exist in Britain. Hull Q790 is due to be broken up by British ship recycling specialist Able UK, which won the contract last year. The Clemenceau case highlighted the risks linked with dismantling the hundreds of naval and commercial ships decommissioned each year across the world. Most breaker's yards are in Asia where wages are low and environmental groups have accused western shippers of exploiting lax enforcement of environmental standards. The International Maritime Organisation is preparing a globally binding convention to provide comprehensive control and enforcement on safe ship recycling. Negotiations for the convention are due to finish by May 2009, but it is not expected to enter into force before 2015
