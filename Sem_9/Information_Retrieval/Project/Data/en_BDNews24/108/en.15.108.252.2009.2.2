<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain has said that if the seat allocation dispute is not settled, the opposition's participation in parliament will be untenable. Saying that the BNP wants to rejoin parliament, he said, "It's the responsibility of the ruling party to bring BNP to parliament." "The problem with seat allocation has been created as the government does not want an opposition in parliament," he told reporters Monday afternoon at the grave of late president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman. "The actions and words of the ruling party are contradictory." Repeating that the opposition "wants to assist the government", the former chief whip said that the treasury bench has acted in a non-cooperative way in the first session of parliament." "If this goes on, then we have to consider alternatives." But, he added, "The matter could easily be resolved by the government". On the release of former communication minister Nazmul Huda, Delwar said, "All cases against him are false and aimed to harass." Huda was released on bail Sunday night from BSMMU Hospital, after securing High Court bail in some 20 pending cases. "The Anticorruption Commission has become corrupt," Delwar commented. bdnew
