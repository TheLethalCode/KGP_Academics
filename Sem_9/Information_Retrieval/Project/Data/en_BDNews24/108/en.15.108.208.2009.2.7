<TITLE> Doubters answered in tightly balanced test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On a day in which neither England nor West Indies could quite get the upper hand, both teams at least managed to answer some of their doubters. West Indies skipper Chris Gayle put the ghosts of his last test appearance at his home ground Sabina Park to rest with his first test century in Jamaica and his team's middle-order showed they have some backbone. England bowler Stuart Broad, whose credentials as a wicket-taker at his level have been questioned, picked up three top order wickets to ensure the tourists were able to restrict West Indies' third day total. West Indies go into the fourth day on 352 for seven with a 34-run lead over England after centuries from Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan. Gayle, the local hero to the patriotic Jamaican crowd, suffered a pair in his last test at Sabina against India in 2006 and the vagaries of fixtures and injury have stopped him from having a chance to put that experience behind him. "When I went out to bat a lot of things were going through my mind, given the last test match I played here I got a pair," Gayle told reporters. "There was a lot of pressure and as I was going out there I was very nervous, that is something that doesn't happen to me that often. "But at the same time I knew had to go out and get the job done so after a few overs things became natural." The left-hander was circumspect in reaching 71 on Thursday then became more aggressive as he came close to his century in Friday's morning session, blasting England spinner Monty Panesar for two sixes before bringing up his ton with a sweep. England's Kevin Pietersen had tried to produce the same grand finale but got out for 97 and Gayle said he was conscious of avoiding the same fate. "I thought about it - I told myself, 'don't make the same mistake, let's be smart about it'. To get past that milestone was very pleasing and eased a bit of pressure on me," he added. BATTING STABILITY Gayle was also pleased by the 66-run partnership between Denesh Ramdin and Australian-born Brendan Nash which guided West Indies through a tricky part of the day. Nash, who has brought some sorely needed stability to a middle order that has tended to collapse far too easily, ended the day unbeaten on 47. "I have to give him a lot of credit, he's been in good form with two half centuries from the two test matches he has played coming into this game and like I said it is good to see someone stepping up to play and against quality bowlers as well," Gayle said. Broad did some stepping up for England too. He claimed Gayle before lunch and then dismissed Xavier Marshall before capturing the vital wicket of Shivnarine Chanderpaul after the break. The promising 22-year-old, playing in his 11th test, has yet to have a four wicket haul at this level and while he will want to break through that barrier on Saturday as England take on the West Indies tail, he was pleased by his display. "It was pleasing to get the wickets at that stage. Gayle and Sarwan applied themselves really well and made us go to them," said Broad. "It proved difficult to get them out, but luckily we went bang, bang just before lunch.
