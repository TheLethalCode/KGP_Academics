 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's top-flight clubs have been granted a conditional extension to the transfer window deadline, the Premier League said in a statement on Monday. Three hours before the 1700 GMT deadline the Premier League said that in view of extreme weather conditions disrupting travel, the board would grant extensions to clubs sending an email confirming "that a deal has been agreed in principle". Heavy snowfall in Britain brought travel almost to a standstill and severe disruption to flights in and out of London, where Liverpool striker Robbie Keane had been expected to complete a transfer back to Tottenham Hotspur. "Clubs have informed us of the difficulties they are having in getting deals concluded," Premier League general secretary Mike Foster told the body's website (www.premierleague.com). "We are currently trying to gauge the level of activity and how many deals are in the pipeline." The statement said: "The Premier League has announced that it will grant applications from clubs to complete transactions after the 5.00pm deadline "The Board will take a decision on a case by case basis as to when the registration documents have to be submitted after taking into consideration weather conditions and ability to travel." The statement was issued after the Premier League discussed the matter with the Football Association and world governing body FIFA. Another potential last-minute deal was Russia playmaker Andrei Arshavin's transfer from Zenit St Petersburg to Arsenal. Sky Sports News showed pictures of Arshavin at a snow-bound hotel north of London after reporting he had flown in by private jet to avoid possible flight cancellations caused by the heaviest snow in southern England for almost 20 years
