<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  There should be discussions in the parliament before any agreement with India on transit is signed, BNP leader Moudud Ahmed said Wednesday. "Whether it is an agreement on transit, maritime boundary, gas, water sharing or any other issue; it should be made clear to the people as to why it is not against the country's interest," he said after attending a roundtable at the National Press Club. The former law minister said there should be discussions in the parliament on such issues to earn confidence of the opposition, as those issues involve people's interest. Asked if the international transits among Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan would boost trade facilities, Moudud replied, "Trade may be boosted." "But it is not always possible to establish relations based on money. Independence and sovereignty are more important for a country than money," he said. Asked what the opposition would do if the government provided transit to India, Moudud replied they would protest if any agreement against national interest was signed. "We'll launch agitation, if necessary," he said. Nagorik Forum, a non-governmental orgnisation, organised the roundtable titled 'Bangladesh-India transit: national security, trade deficit'. bd
