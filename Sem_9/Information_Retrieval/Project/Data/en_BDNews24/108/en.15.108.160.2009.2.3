 MOSCOW, Tue Feb 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov agreed on Tuesday to work more closely on key strategic issues, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. The two foreign ministers spoke by telephone at the request of Washington, the ministry said in a statement. "In the course of the discussion, the accent was given to the mutual interest of building a positive agenda for our relations after the arrival of the new US administration". "Especially noted was the importance of strengthening bilateral cooperation, including questions of strategic dialogue and economic cooperation, as well as current international problems such as the resolution of (the situation in) Afghanistan," the statement said. Moscow's ties with Washington sank to a post-Soviet low in August over the war in Georgia, but some diplomats hope relations could thaw under the new administration of US President Barack Obama. Russia's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has cautiously noted positive signals from the new administration and a Russian news agency reported last month that Russia had halted plans to deploy tactical missiles near the Polish border. Though unconfirmed, the report has raised hopes the Kremlin could be indicating it wished to boost cooperation after rows over a US missile defence system in Europe, the expansion of NATO and the war in Iraq. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev are set to meet for the first time on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in London in April. Both countries want to boost nuclear cooperation and discuss how to replace a key Cold War strategic arms control pact. Russian and US diplomats say they are confident Moscow could find a deal with the new US administration on replacing the START-1 pact, which expires at the end of this year. The START treaty, signed by Moscow and Washington in 1991, committed both to cutting their numbers of missiles and strategic bombers to 1,600 each. Both sides met limits set by the treaty by December 2001
