 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  The country's law and order situation has deteriorated after the Dec 29 elections, the home minister said on Tuesday. "Terrorism and use of illegal firearms has also increased. The police should take responsibilities to control the situation," Sahara Khatun told a training programme at Police Staff College in Mirpur. Sahara said criminals were currently well equipped with modern arms, and police required higher training to handle them. "That's why the Police Training Centre has been set up. The government will extend every kind of assistance in this regard," she said. State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel said police and other security forces were busy with election duties as one election took place after another. "That's why the crime rate has risen a little. But steps have been taken to control the situation," he said, also speaking at the programme. "Not only the election, the law and order also worsened as the country was released from emergency." Sohel said a special drive had been launched from Monday night against recovery of illegal arms and arrest of criminals, with Dhaka Metropolitan Police joining with Rapid Action Battalion and Criminal Investigation Department members. The move would also be against hijacking gangs, known as 'Malam party' and 'Ogyan party'. Lauding the role of the police in the elections Sohel said: "Your duty does not end here. You must work in your respective positions to safeguard democracy." Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad stressed the police must continue their work as they had done so far "with honesty". The training would help the police to increase their efficiency, he said. The special drive would spread to other districts of the country, as necessary, said the IG. Asked about moves against war criminals, the state minister said that they were fixing working procedures by holding discussions with top level officials. The law minister recently promised to help in this regard. Shafiq Ahmed said: "If the home ministry takes any innitiative against war criminals his mintisrty would extend all cooperation." bdnews
