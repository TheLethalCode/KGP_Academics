 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Haiti's electoral council on Friday rejected the candidacy of former rebel leader Guy Philippe and that of all candidates from former President Jean Bertrand Aristide's party in the nation's April senate election. Voting is scheduled on April 19 to fill 12 seats in Haiti's 30-member senate. Philippe, who led the bloody February 2004 rebellion that eventually forced Aristide from power, is reported to be the subject of a sealed international arrest warrant on drug trafficking charges, issued by the United States. The U.S. and Canadian embassies in Port-au-Prince have expressed concern about the exclusion of Aristide's Lavalas Family Party members from the election and called for a dialogue between electoral authorities and political actors. Some observers have raised concerns that the election might not be considered credible if Lavalas Family candidates are barred from running, and many feared unrest could result. Philippe, who escaped two previous raids from U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Haiti, last month submitted documents to run for a seat in the senate, which would provide him with immunity from prosecution. Sources close to the electoral council told Reuters Philippe's candidacy was rejected because he is wanted on drug trafficking charges. Philippe has repeatedly denied involvement in any criminal activities. The president of the electoral council said Aristide's party did not meet legal requirements, but did not provide further details. "The decision to dismiss the Lavalas Family party was not motivated by any political reasons, but by legal reasons," he told local media on Friday
