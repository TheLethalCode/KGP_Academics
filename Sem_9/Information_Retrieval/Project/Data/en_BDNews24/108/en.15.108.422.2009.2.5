 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission was not used to shackle politicians, the ACC chairman said on Thursday, in reply to the prime minister's comments the previous day that the anti-graft drive had turned into an "anti-politician drive. "The ACC has conducted its activities on specific information and proof. The remark about using the commission for curbing the politicians is not right," Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said in a regular briefing of the commission at its headquarters. Asked by reporters whether he was thinking of resigning his position, "under the present circumstances", he replied in the negative. "I don't see reason to make a sudden decision. I hope the matter will be clear in the coming days," said Chowdhury. bdnews24.
