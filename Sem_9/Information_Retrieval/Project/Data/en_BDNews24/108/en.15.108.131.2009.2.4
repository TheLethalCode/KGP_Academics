<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) denied on Tuesday that it had expressed an interest in hosting the 2018 or 2022 World Cup finals, despite world soccer's governing body FIFA stating it had. FIFA said on Monday the list of potential bidders to have expressed initial interest in staging one of the tournaments grew to a dozen after the late entry of Egypt and South Korea. But Samir Zaher, president of the EFA, told Reuters: "This has no basis in truth". The association later said in a statement on its website (www.efa.com.eg) it had received a letter from FIFA asking if Egypt was interested in bidding to host the tournaments. The EFA responded by asking soccer's world governing body about the conditions and requirements for the bid. FIFA answered back saying Egypt could only apply to host the 2022 finals, the statement said adding that the EFA then "sent a letter saying it would not submit a bid". A FIFA spokesman said the organisation had received two official responses from the EFAone to express interest and the other to say it woouldn't take part in the process. Egypt bid to host the 2010 World Cup but lost out to South Africa, which was the first African nation chosen to stage the event
