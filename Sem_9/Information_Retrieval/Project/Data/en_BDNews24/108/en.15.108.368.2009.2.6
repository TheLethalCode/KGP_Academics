<TEXT>
 MADRID, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: In-form Real Madrid winger Arjen Robben has returned to training after a bout of flu and should be fit for the champions' match at home to Racing Santander on Saturday (1900 GMT), the club said on its website (www.realmadrid.com). Coach Juande Ramos has a full squad available with the exception of the injured Guti and Christoph Metzelder and the suspended Fernando Gago as second-placed Real seek to cut the 12-point gap with leaders Barcelona. Real midfielder Wesley Sneijder said he is unhappy with his level of play since his return from a three-month layoff with a serious knee injury and is hoping to rediscover the form he showed last season. "I am not satisfied because I am not playing at the level I want to," the Dutch international said in an interview with As newspaper. "I want to play well and then I can smile again." The Atletico Madrid players were to blame for last week's sacking of Mexican coach Javier Aguirre and the appointment of Abel Resino, defender Tomas Ujfalusi said ahead of Sunday's match at Recreativo Huelva (1600). "There is a squad of 20 players that take to the pitch every match and we are the ones who have not won these games," the Czech international said on the club's website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). Fifth-placed Villarreal are still confident of winning a place in next season's Champions League despite a poor recent run of form, midfielder Robert Pires said ahead of Sunday's match at home to Numancia (1600). "It's more difficult after our recent results but we are only four points shy of third place," the Frenchman told the club's website (www.villarrealcf). "We are only in February and there are a lot of league matches left." Sevilla are in good shape for Saturday's derby against city rivals Real Betis (2100) following the 2-1 comeback win over Athletic Bilbao in their King's Cup semi-final first leg in midweek, forward Lautaro Acosta said. "We are well, full of enthusiasm and fully focused on a match that will be extremely hard," the Argentine told the club's website (www.sevillafc.es). "We have the team we need to carry on winning." Valencia's players are not worried about media reports detailing the club's financial woes and are concentrating on their football ahead of Sunday's match at struggling Osasuna (2000), winger Vicente said. "We are very calm and have full confidence in the club," he told Valencia's website (www.valenciacf.com). "We are very focused on sporting matters and we have a very important match on Sunday." Bottom-of-the-table Real Mallorca must forget Thursday's 2-0 King's Cup semi-final first leg defeat at Barcelona and concentrate on fighting for survival, coach Gregorio Manzano said on the club's website (www.rcdmallorca.es). "The league championship is fundamental for Mallorca," Manzano said. "We have 17 finals to play until we have our heads above water again in the Primera Liga, which is our objective.
