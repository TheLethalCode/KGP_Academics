 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian striker Jairo Castillo scored a hat-trick to help promoted Godoy Cruz to a stunning 4-1 win over Boca Juniors in the Argentine championship on Sunday. Estudiantes beat arch-rivals Gimnasia-La Plata for the fifth time in a row, winning the La Plata derby 3-1, and champions River Plate came from behind three times to draw 3-3 at home to Racing Club as Sunday's five games produced 23 goals. San Lorenzo, 2-0 winners over Arsenal on Saturday, lead with 19 points from eight games. Boca, Argentina's most popular club, stayed fourth, five points behind San Lorenzo, after their humiliating defeat in Mendoza, a city better known for its fine wines than its modest football team. Although Leandro Gracian gave Boca a 36th-minute lead, Castillo headed the equaliser three minutes later and Leonardo Sigali put Godoy Cruz ahead early in the second half. Castillo increased their lead on the hour with a clinically taken goal from the edge of the area after Boca lost possession and completed the rout with a replica effort five minutes from time. Strikers Jose Luis Calderon, 37, and Mauro Boselli scored superbly-taken goals in the last 10 minutes to give Estudiantes victory over Gimnasia. Agustin Alayes put Estudiantes ahead in the 17th minute but Sebastian Romero levelled for Gimnasia in the 55th minute, five minutes after they had Ruben Maldonado sent off for a shocking lunge at Juan Sebastian Veron. River Plate defender Facundo Quiroga scored at both ends in the sixth-goal thriller at the Monumental. Quiroga put through his own net in the 12th minute to open the scoring and headed the final goal of the game in the 73rd to salvage his side a point. Santiago Salcedo and Diego Buonanotte scored the other goals for River and Leandro Gonzalez and Pablo Caballero, with a deflected shot, were on target for Racing. "Today, we scored five goals but, regrettably, they were not all in the right goal," said River coach Diego Simeone
