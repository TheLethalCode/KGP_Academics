<TITLE> Dhaka takes a breather </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka is transformed for a few brief days during the festive period, into a city free of traffic gridlock, blaring horns and teeming crowds as its inhabitants make an exodus to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with their loved ones up and down the country. A trip from Gulshan-1 to Dhanmondi 27 by CNG-autorickshaw takes an unbelievable 15 minutes, or even less, compared to an hour or more on any other day of the year. The usual hot spots in the city, including the Gulshan-1 and Bijoy Sarani intersections, Airport and Mirpur roads and Mohakhali rail crossing, were almost empty of traffic on Wednesday. Few private and public vehicles, with only a smattering of rickshaws, were seen out on the hushed streets of the capital, allowing Dhaka to take a well-earned breather. Siblings Amit and Anita, who were unable to reach their village home this Eid as they failed to get tickets, were enjoying a walk without the usual jostling crowds. "We don't mind being left in Dhaka at this time," said Amit. But, as the saying goes, there is no pleasing some people. Taxi driver Hamidullah complained: "As people leave Dhaka for Eid, our income gets very low. We can't get any passengers." Drivers of CNG-autorickshaws were seen to approach people for farestaking prospective passengers, used to being snubbed most days, by surprise. Abdur Rahman, trying to get to New Market for last-minute Eid essentials, however, was another grumbler: "I faced a lot of trouble to get a rickshaw. The rickshaw pullers are all demanding extra fares!" Though the number of vehicles on the roads was thin, the markets were still bustling with shoppers. Sufia Khatun, emerging from Meena Bazar in Dhanmondi, said: "I finished my shopping hastily yesterday, thinking that Eid would be today. I forgot to buy some stuff in my hurry." Police constable Ariful Haque, remaining in the capital for Eid duty, was glad to bask in the pollution-free air and especially happy to reach his workplace in minutes. "It's nice during Eid vacations to remember that Dhaka can actually be a very pleasant city," he said. bdnew
