 BELGRADE, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former European Cup winners Red Star Belgrade were fined on Monday after their fans and players protested over a fan jailed for assaulting a police officer. The Serbian first division club was ordered to pay 600,000 dinars ($11,542) while players who took part in the protest and a staff member were also separately fined 120,000 dinars ($2,308) each. "These are the maximum fiscal penalties stipulated by the book of regulations," deputy first division commissioner Dragce Dimitrijevic said after announcing the verdict. Red Star, whose jailed fan was convicted of attempted murder for inflicting multiple burns with a flare to a plain-clothes policeman during last December's league match with Hajduk Kula, were also in danger of hosting Sunday's Belgrade derby with Partizan behind closed doors. But the fixture, which has a long history of crowd trouble, will go ahead under tight security measures after the soccer authorities refrained from imposing the additional punishment of a crowd ban of up to 12 home games. Earlier this month during a league match, many Red Star fans produced banners of support after the 20-year-old offender was sentenced while the players wore corresponding shirts before the kick-off. Several Red Star players, the club's interim president Dobrivoje Tanasijevic and director Ilija Ivic have been questioned by police about their role in the incident but no charges have been pressed. Red Star are fourth in the 12-team league with eight points from their opening six matches. They trail champions Partizan by 10 points after their city foes made a perfect start to the season
