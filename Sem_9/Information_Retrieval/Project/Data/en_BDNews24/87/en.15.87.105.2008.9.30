<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex trimmed sharp early losses on Tuesday as domestic institutions came to the rescue after sentiment was hammered by the collapse of US bailout plan to ease the panic in global markets. Shares in battered ICICI Bank were among the ones that rebounded. The bank, India's No. 2 lender, said in a statement it had a very strong capital position and rumours that were being repeatedly circulated about its financial strength were baseless and malicious. Many other Asian markets came off their lows as investors saw value in beated down stocks, with some still betting the US Congress would eventually pass the $700 billion bailout package for its troubled financial sector. "We are acting in line with the Asian markets," said Amitabh Chakrabarty, president of equities at Religare Hichens Harrison. "There's support from domestic funds, that's why some key stocks are holding up; also some of the shorts are being covered." By 11:25 a.m., the 30-share BSE index was down 0.54 percent at 12,527.48, with 11 components trading in positive. It had fallen as much as 3.5 percent to its lowest in two years. ICICI Bank was up 1.3 percent at 499.50 rupees, after falling to 458, its lowest since June 2006. Leading explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp rose 1.5 percent to 1,039 rupees as crude prices fell below $96 a barrel. Lower crude prices will help reduce the subsidy bill for ONGC, which is forced to sell fuel at state-set low prices. Traders said some domestic funds were buying to dress up their quarterly closings. The BSE index is on course to post its smallest quarterly loss in 2008 at about 7 percent, compared with a drop of almost 14 percent in the June quarter and nearly 23 percent fall in the March quarter. The benchmark is down about 20 percent in the financial year that began on April 1 and off 38 percent since end-2007. SEBI said on Tuesday institutional investors were not short selling and there were no plans to tighten rules. In the broader market, 1,823 losers were ahead of 395 gainers on volume of 80.2 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was down 0.65 percent at 3,825.10. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-share index was little changed at 9,179.35, but Colombo's All-share index lost 2 percent to 2,142.01
