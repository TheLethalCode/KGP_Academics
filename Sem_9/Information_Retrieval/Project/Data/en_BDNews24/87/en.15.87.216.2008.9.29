North Chandpur fire chief Mushfiqur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the fire broke out at 5am in the Batashapotti area of Puran Bazar, totally destroying the six establishments. As the news reached fire fighters, personnel from north and south Chandpur fire stations rushed to Puran Bazar, finally dousing the flames after three hours. Local trader Rafique Sardar, 52, fell unconscious as he watched the fire blazing during sehri . He was taken to hospital where doctors declared him dead of heart failure, said neighbouring shopkeeper Arif Khan. Rafique's shop, however, remained unscathed.
