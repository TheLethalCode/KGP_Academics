<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)  Tuesday will be a normal workday for government offices prior to the Eid-ul-Fitr, an official said Monday. "Government offices will remain open Tuesday, according to decisions taken earlier," establishment secretary Md Moslehuddin said to bdnews24.com on Monday. The secretary, however, said any change in the government decision would be notified through press releases. "Since the Eid vacation basically consists of three days and it has not yet been decided as to whether we should be completing 30 fasting days this year, it is still not possible to say anything about the Eid day specifically. "So, the offices are to remain open through Tuesday," he said. He, however, added that officials and employees whose attendance was not considered a must were granted leave on Tuesday. bdnews24.com
