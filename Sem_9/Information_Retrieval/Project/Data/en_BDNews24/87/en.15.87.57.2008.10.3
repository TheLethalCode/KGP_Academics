 New York, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Friday it reached a deal to buy Wachovia Corp for about $15.1 billion, thwarting Citigroup Inc's attempt to buy Wachovia's banking assets. Prior to receiving the Wells Fargo proposal, Wachovia had been negotiating with Citi to complete a transaction supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that included assistance from the government. Wells Fargo said it expects to incur merger and integration charges of about $10 billion. Wells Fargo intends to issue up to $20 billion in new Wells Fargo securities, primarily common stock, "to maintain its strong capital position." A Wachovia spokeswoman said neither Citi nor the FDIC is involved in the transaction. Citi officials did not immediately return calls for comment, although the Citi/Wachovia deal was still featured prominently on Citi's website Friday morning. "This deal enables us to keep Wachovia intact and preserve the value of an integrated company, without government support," said Wachovia President and Chief Executive Robert Steel. Wachovia's board approved Wells Fargo's offer Thursday night. Wachovia shareholders will receive 0.1991 shares of Wells Fargo common stock for each share of Wachovia common. The deal valuing Wachovia at just over $7, or a 79 percent premium over the Thursday closing price of $3.91. Wachovia shares surged 66 percent in premarket trading to $6.51 on Friday, while Wells Fargo shares edged up less than 1 percent to $35.50. Citi shares slumped 11 percent to $20. The combined company would base its East Coast retail and commercial and corporate banking business in Charlotte, North Carolina. St. Louis will remain the headquarters of Wachovia Securit
