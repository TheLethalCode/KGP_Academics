 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)The BTRC chief has dismissed suggestions that a future democratic government might put up barriers to his efforts to radically reform the country's telecommunications industry. "I don't think the new government will create obstacles. if I can't perform or I am not allowed to work, I'll just give up and leave the scene," retired major general Manzurul Alam told reporters at his office Monday. He said he would take internet to rural Bangladesh and bring all related businesses under a regulatory framework. The chairman listed the achievements in the past 18 months, prompting some reporters to ask if he would be able to continue with similar zeal in future. "We have acted in the interest of the public. Whoever comes to power, I believe, will not ignore public interest," he said. "We are just doing what we are supposed to be doing," the tough-talking former general said. "We have stopped unauthorised VoIP operation and unregistered mobile phone connections. "If anyone is engaged in such illegal activity, we'll go after them. "We want to play the role of facilitators. But others will have to regulate themselves," he said. The chairman said the BTRC was working to reduce the cost of bandwidth, hoping to decide by the end of October. "The government's objective is to take internet to the rural Bangladesh, reaching 30 per cent population by 2015." He termed neighbourhood-based ISPs illegal and announced plans to license internet cafes. "Everyone has to play by the law, regulations." PSTN business was bad the world over, he said referring to the companies' complaints. "We are trying to improve the situation ... we've reduced the license fee, asked NBR to lower tax rates. "By 2011, all licenses will be similar scope of business." The BTRC chairman said the IP telephony licenses would be given soon and the 3G licenses by early next year. Submarine cable offers from 13 private companies were being scrutinised, he said. Mobile content providers would also be licensed, and nationwide telecom transmission network would be given permission within a month or so. To prevent mobile phone theft, he said, IMEI numbers would be used to block stolen sets. Subscribers would be allowed to carry their mobile numbers across operators when mobile number portability would come into practice. The chairman also made public the allocation of spectrum which would fetch Tk 1400 crore from three mobile companies. The BTRC also earned more than Tk 130 crore as transfer fee from NTT DoCoMo which bought 30 percent stake in AKTEL. As many as 98,000 SIMs have been declared invalid due to non-registration, and BTRC pocketed Tk 9 crore that these subscribers paid in top-up charges. In Birmingham, where he took part in a two-day expo, Bangladeshi call centre companies struck deals with six foreign firms, the chairman said. b
