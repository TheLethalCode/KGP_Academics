<TITLE> Bank rescues in Europe as Citi to buy Wachovia assets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Mon Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities stepped in to rescue three European banks on Monday, Citigroup Inc set a deal to acquire most of Wachovia Corp assets, and US lawmakers prepared to vote on a $700 billion financial bailout plan. US stock index futures fell more than 1 percent, an indication that Wall Street would open lower after sharp declines in Asia and Europe. Speaking before the stock market opened, President George W Bush said the rescue bill was needed to keep the financial crisis from spreading through the US economy. Investors hung on every twist and turn in Washington as central banks in Asia and Europe pumped cash into the system to try to persuade fearful financiers to lend to each other. The US banking system also faced more upheaval. Shares of Wachovia fell 85 percent after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said Citigroup will acquire the bulk of Wachovia's assets and liabilities. The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg moved to partly nationalize Belgian-Dutch group Fortis NV with an injection of more than $16 billion. German lender Hypo Real Estate Holding AG secured a credit line from the German government and banks of up to 35 billion euros. British mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley Plc was brought under the government's wing. Shares in French bank Dexia tumbled on a report it might need emergency capital, and bank rescue deals also emerged in Iceland, Russia and Denmark. "A rescue plan worth $700 billion is simply not enough to overcome the crisis for the foreseeable future. If anything, all the real economy problems will escalate as a result in the foreseeable future," said Carsten Klude, a strategist at MM Warburg. The dollar climbed, mainly due to the euro and pound sliding about 1 percent, as the toll on financial firms spread in Europe and stirred expectations that central banks may have to respond by cutting interest rates. Money markets remained frozen with banks refusing to lend to each other for all but the shortest periods. MAIN OBSTACLE In the United States, House Republicans have been the main obstacle to passage of the bailout bill as they balked at spending so much public money just before elections in November. But a senior Republican, Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, threw his weight behind the deal, saying he expected the House to vote on the bill on Monday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Senate could take up the bill by Wednesday. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he was confident the program will be enough to unclog jammed financial markets. Congressional leaders from both parties said they had a tentative agreement on Sunday on a plan that would use taxpayer funds to buy up bad mortgage debt and other sour assets and restore confidence. In the Fortis rescue, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg agreed to inject 11.2 billion euros ($16.4 billion) into the banking and insurance company, which has 85,000 staff worldwide. Fortis will sell the parts of Dutch bank ABN AMRO it bought last year to Dutch rival ING Groep NV in a deal expected to be finalized within two weeks, sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. QUALIFIED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT Both U.S. presidential candidates, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, offered qualified support for the bailout proposal, an issue that has virtually overshadowed their campaigns with less than six weeks until the election. With many Americans struggling to save their homes from foreclosure, lawmakers braced for a grassroots backlash against a bailout for Wall Street banks, which contributed to the US housing bubble with reckless lending. The tentative congressional deal altered key parts of the Wall Street bailout program initially proposed by the Bush administration. In the final hours of talks, Democrats and Republicans rushed to add safeguards for taxpayers and provisions that would allow the government to recover funds if house prices recover and its holdings of bad debt gain value. The proposed legislation would disburse the $700 billion in stages. The first $250 billion would be issued when the legislation is enacted, while another $100 billion could be spent if the president decided it was needed. The remaining $350 billion would be subject to congressional review. Institutions selling assets under the plan would issue stock warrants to the government, a step intended to give taxpayers a chance to profit if markets recover. The plan would also let the government buy troubled assets from pension plans, local governments and small banks. In response to a clamor for limits on executive pay, no executives at participating firms would get multimillion-dollar severance packages known as golden parachutes. A board of top officials, including the Federal Reserve chairman, would supervise the program. Its management would also be under the scrutiny of Congress's investigative arm and an independent inspector general. The government could also use its power as the owner of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to help more struggling homeowners modify the terms of their home loans. "Passage of the plan is just step one. Step two is execution, and there remains considerable uncertainty about how assets will be purchased," said Michael Pond, a bond strategist with Barclays Capital in New York
