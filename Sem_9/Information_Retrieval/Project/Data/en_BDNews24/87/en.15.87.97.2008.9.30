 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court granted on Tuesday Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury bail in Bijoy TV graft case, clearing way for his release from prison, his lawyer said. The vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Jubayer Rahman Chowdhury passed the order on the appeal of the mayor. "The High Court has granted bail to Mohiuddin. As he has secured bail in all cases there is no barrier to his release now," barrister Amir Ul Islam told bdnews24.com. Another lawyer Hari Shadhan Brahma told bdnews24.com there were 22 cases against Mohiuddin, also an Awami League leader. "Of them the court set aside three cases while in four cases no specific allegations were found against him. He has secured bail in 15 cases including the Bijoy TV graft case," the lawyer said. Barrister Islam in the hearing said his client was very ill and his would be in critical condition if he did not receive proper treatment. Besides, his daughter diagnosed with cancer had been counting her last days, the court heard. "Considering all these circumstances he needs bail." He said that the High Court initially halted the proceedings in the case on Jan 17 but the Appellate Division overturned the order later. The Appellate Division, however, on July 30 stayed the trial. "It is uncertain when the trial will end in the case. So the Chittagong mayor should be granted bail," Islam said. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Abu Arif Siddique filed the Bijoy TV case with Chittagong Kotwali Police Station last June. The case centers on allegations that the mayor drew Tk 1.47 crore from city corporation funds without permission from the local government or information ministry. Mohiuddin also faces allegations that he did not float any tender for the new television station prior to spending more than Tk 1 crore for operations. Bijoy TV went on the air on Dec 16, 2006. On March 8 last year the government issued a show-cause notice on CCC, and closed down the station on March 15. b
