 BIRMINGHAM, England, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Britain's opposition Conservatives, trying to show he has what it takes to govern during a crisis, will warn his party on Wednesday it will have to take unpopular economic decisions if it wins power. Opinion polls have put the Conservatives ahead of the ruling Labour Party by as much as 20 points at some times this year, suggesting they are on course for an emphatic victory in a parliamentary election due by mid-2010. But that lead has halved in the last week since Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the global financial crisis was no time for a novice to be in charge -- a criticism mainly aimed at Cameron -- and pledged to protect hard-working families. Cameron, 41, who has repositioned his party at the centre of British politics, will try to shake off the novice tag and prepare party members for the fact that there will be little room for tax cuts seen by many as central to the party's appeal. "If we win, we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess...We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long-term good of the country," Cameron will tell his party's conference in the central English city of Birmingham, according to speech extracts released ahead of delivery. He will also highlight the economic problems the Conservatives would inherit after more than a decade of Labour rule, much of it with Brown as finance minister before he took over from Tony Blair as prime minister last year. "To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change." The Conservative conference this week has been overshadowed by the global financial crisis. Cameron will reiterate political parties "must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure stability". But the downturn could also be an opportunity to attack Labour, which has been in office since 1997. "People know that there is a need for change in this country," Conservative foreign affairs spokesman William Hague, a former leader of the party, told Sky TV. "People have had enough experience now of a Labour government to know they need a different sort of experience in the future." The Conservatives' poll lead is still enough to win but there are signs voters may prefer Brown, 57, at the helm during the current financial turmoil. One poll this week showed 43 percent of people felt Brown was best in a crisis, compared with 33 percent for Cameron. The credit crunch has hit Britain's economy hard, forcing the nationalisation of two banks and the private-sector rescue of the country's biggest mortgage lender. Many economists say Britain is on the verge of its first recession since the early 1990s, making it tough for any government to find room to reduce taxes or increase spending
