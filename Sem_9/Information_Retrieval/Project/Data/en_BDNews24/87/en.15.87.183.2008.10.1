<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia leg spinner Bryce McGain will miss next week's first test against India because of a shoulder injury, a team spokesman said on Wednesday. The uncapped 36-year-old had been included in the absence of seasoned spinners for the four-test series starting in Bangalore on Oct. 9. "He bowled in the nets yesterday (Tuesday) and felt some pain," team spokesman Matthew Slade told Reuters. "He won't be available for at least two weeks." McGain suffered the injury during last month's Australia A tour of India but had hoped to regain fitness before the series. The Australian selectors will decide whether McGain should stay with the squad or return home. Off-break bowler Jason Krejza is the other specialist spinner in the squad while vice-captain Michael Clarke is an occasional, but useful, left-arm slow bowler
