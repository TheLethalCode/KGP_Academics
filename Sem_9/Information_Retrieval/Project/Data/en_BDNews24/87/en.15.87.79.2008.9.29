 NEW YORK, Mon Sep 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks tumbled on Monday as investors worried about the stability of the banking sector after Wachovia Corp became the latest major US bank to succumb to fallout from the credit crisis. Additionally, investors worried if a US bailout plan would help stem the contagion that prompted rescues of two major banks in Europe and led central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to pump additional funds into world markets to thaw a credit freeze. Investors feared the troubles facing the banking sector might worsen the economy's outlook and constrain lending, a key pillar of business and consumer spending and vital for profits. The takeover of Wachovia's banking operations by Citigroup suggested that risks from the credit crisis were mounting, according to analysts. "With the news on Wachovia this morning, Washington Mutual last week, it just seems a lot of these banks are getting whacked," said Cleveland Rueckert, market analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc in Stamford, Connecticut. "People were hoping the bailout would be passed this morning. It still has to go to the House for the vote. People are apprehensive this morning that it might not get passed and we're going to continue to see bank failures." bdnews24.com/lq/2052 hrs. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 260.29 points, or 2.34 percent, to 10,882.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index tumbled 39.77 points, or 3.28 percent, to 1,173.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 88.43 points, or 4.05 percent, to 2,094.91. Shares of Bank of America Corp led financials down on the S&P 500, with a decline of more than 5 percent, while American Express was a drag on the Dow, with a slide of more than 8 percent. The S&P financial index fell 5 percent. Apple Inc , down more than 15 percent, was a top drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Apple drove the tech rout after several brokerages slashed their recommendations on the tech bellwether. Energy companies fell as U.S. front-month crude dropped $6.66 to $100.17 a barrel. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 3 percent to $78.33, while the S&P energy index tumbled 5.7 percent. Investors had fretted about the fate of Wachovia, pushing the stock down sharply last week following the collapse of Washington Mutual, the largest US thrift. "There's a monster amount of fear out there. This is global contagion. It's no longer just the United States," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. In Europe, the British government took over troubled mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and three European governments partially nationalized banking and insurance group Fortis. Congressional leaders in Washington said they had a tentative deal on a $700 billion US bailout to mop up bad mortgage debts on the banks' books
