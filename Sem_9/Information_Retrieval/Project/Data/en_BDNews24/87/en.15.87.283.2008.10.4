 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) - The University Grants Commission has recommended a National Training Academy for further training of university teachers, saying they should be "teachers in the real sense, not education racketeers". In a draft of its latest annual report, the commission said: "A National Training Academy is required for training teachers with a view to upgrading their basic and professional expertise." "There is no alternative to skilled teachers for improving standards of higher education," it stressed. UGC chairman Prof Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com: "At present, university teachers receive only rudimentary training. The academy will be set up to meet further training needs." The chairman said work is going on to finalise the commission's 34th annual report, containing a whole raft of recommendations, for publication and submission to the government in November. The draft report also spelled out the duty-bound performance of university teachers in the report. "Teachers will be teachers in the real sense, not education racketeers," it said. "There have been allegations that public university teachers are involved concurrently with two or more institutions." "There should be a law which stipulates that teachers seek approval from the concerned university and the UGC to change their place of service or be involved with two or more institutions at the same time." "To ensure teachers' accountability to the performance of their duty, it is also essential to evaluate teachers and officials periodically by their activities," said the UGC. "It is essential to bring teachers' experience, expertise and research articles published in national and international journals under consideration to appoint and promote them," it said. The commission also went on to recommend a central research centre in Dhaka, allowing researchers of different institutions world-standard facilities to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. bdne
