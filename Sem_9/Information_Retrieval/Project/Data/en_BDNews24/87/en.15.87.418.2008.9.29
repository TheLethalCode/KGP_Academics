<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Mon Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptians abducted in a remote desert corner of Egypt have been freed unharmed and half of their kidnappers have been killed, Egyptian officials said on Monday. The freed hostages arrived in Cairo aboard an Egyptian military plane. They descended the aircraft smiling, some holding bouquets of flowers, to be greeted by Egyptian military officers and government officials along with foreign diplomats. The 19 were liberated in what Egyptian media called a "rescue and recovery operation," although officials gave scant and contradictory details on how authorities secured the release or how the hostage-takers were killed. The arrival of the hostages in Cairo brought an end to a 10-day ordeal that was an embarrassment to the Egyptian government, which depends on tourism for 6 percent of its gross domestic product. "They have all arrived safely. No ransom was paid from any of the hostage countries," Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana told reporters at the military airport. "We will coordinate with security agencies to make sure this doesn't happen again," he said. Masked gunmen seized the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptians on September 19 from a desert safari near Egypt's borders with Sudan and Libya, then whisked them into Sudan and demanded a multi-million-dollar ransom. Military helicopters flew the freed abductees to a Cairo hospital for health checks, and officials handed the freed hostages mobile phones to call their families. "They seemed exhausted but said there was no ill treatment. They seemed elated to be free," said Omaima el-Husseini, a tourism ministry spokeswoman. The Egyptian government and political analysts have said the kidnappers did not appear to have political motives. Tour operators say acts of banditry in the area from which the hostages were snatched have been on the rise. PROFESSIONAL OPERATION One Egyptian security source speaking on customary condition of anonymity said Egyptian forces had ambushed and attacked the kidnappers around dawn on Monday, and that 150 people had taken part in the operation to free the hostages. Defense Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi said half the kidnappers had been "liquidated," state news agency MENA said without giving details. Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Italian special forces took part in securing the hostages' release, the Italian news agency Ansa reported. "It was an operation of excellent professionalism. We have to obviously thank our German friends who worked with us, Egypt as well as Sudan," Frattini told Italian television. News of the release came a day after Sudan said it had killed six hostage-takers and arrested two more in a gunbattle near the Egyptian and Libyan border. A Sudanese official gave a differing account of how the hostages were freed. Ali Youssef Ahmed, head of protocol in the Sudanese foreign ministry, said the two men captured on Sunday had told security forces the kidnappers planned to head to Egypt, and that Sudanese forces tried to cut off the remaining kidnappers near the border. But by that time, the kidnappers had abandoned the hostages, who then crossed into Egypt independently before being rescued, Ahmed said. "They were abandoned by the kidnappers. They left them somewhere and went away," he told Reuters. Sudan has blamed the kidnapping on a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army, a Darfur rebel group. But it has not said which splinter faction it believed was responsible for the kidnapping, and many rebels operate under that name. The remote region where the hostages were seized contains cave paintings thought to be about 10,000 years old. It is accessible by desert vehicle from the conflict zones of Darfur and eastern Chad
