 Patuakhali, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  While the nation's calendar marks Eid-ul-Fitr as a shopping extravaganza as well as a religious celebration, for many this year's festive period serves only as a reminder of the hardships of a hand-to-mouth existence. As the capital's shopping malls were bursting at the seams in the lead up to festivities, life has yet to return to normality for the inhabitants of Patuakhali's Charkhali village, one of many communities devastated by Cyclone Sidr in 2007. Villagers say this year's Eid-ul-Fitr brings little to celebrate. "I live from hand to mouth. My daily wage is just too little to meet even my family's basic needs," Shakur Khan, a still-struggling day-labourer from the village of Charkhali told bdnews24.com. "I have to buy two kilogrammes of rice each day to feed all my family, and I remain jobless much of the time." "Under these circumstances how can I hope to celebrate Eid?" asked Shakur. Ishrat Jahan, a housewife of the same village, regretted that she was unable to buy her children much-needed new clothes this year. "We have no means to celebrate Eid. We have not even been able to afford proper iftar this year," said Ishrat. Local fisherman Monir Hossain says his only hope lies in the river: "I am looking to the river. Only if I get a big catch of fish can I afford to buy new clothes for my children." Ansar Ali, a grandfather in his seventies, narrowly escaped death on the night of Nov 15, 2007, when Cyclone Sidr devastated much of southern Bangladesh The super storm claimed two of his granddaughters. "How can we celebrate Eid after losing so much? We will mark the day only with a little vermicelli and sugar," said Ansar. bdnews2
