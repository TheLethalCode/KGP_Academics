 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) The government will increase jail terms and fines in a bid to prevent the import and sale of substandard baby milk formulas, an adviser announced Monday. The government is amending The Breast Milk Substitute (Regulation of Marketing) Ordinance 1984, to raise fines and lengthen prison sentences, food and health affairs adviser MM Shawkat Ali told a press conference at the ministry of health. "The Institute of Public Health and Nutrition has finalised the ordinance. It will be presented to the advisory council for approval soon after its approval from ministry of law," Shawkat said. The conference was hosted in order to review the latest situation resulting from government steps in the wake of the China's melamine-adulterated milk scare. "At present, the maximum is two year's jail and fine of Tk 1 lakh under the existing 1984 ordinance," said the adviser. "In the proposed amendment, the fine is being increased to Tk 5 lakh. And if someone commits the same crime twice, the maximum punishment will be 5 years." Saying that baby milk imports have come down in the country, the adviser said: "Powder milk worth around Tk 748 was imported in 2004-05. It decreased to Tk 575 crore in 2005-6." But he could not put a figure on imported baby milk in for fiscal years 2006-07 and 2007-08. On Sept 21, commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed had said powder milk, amounting to around 42,587 tonnes was imported in 2007-08. On steps taken by the government and Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute for melamine testing, adviser said: "BSTI is yet to import the reagent needed for testing." Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research said they had apparatus to test melamine in milk, but it would be possible only after collecting the reagents from abroad. Three brands of Chinese milk powder, Yashili-1, Yashili-2 and Sweet Baby, have been banned in China. Bangladesh has also banned the brands without testing, due to the delay in collecting the reagent. Mobile courts also have been formed to prevent illegal sales of the banned products. bdne
