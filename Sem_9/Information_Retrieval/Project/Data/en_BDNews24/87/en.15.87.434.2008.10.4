<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)BNP is all for joining in general elections in December, but under the right conditions to ensure free and fair polls, the party's secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain said Saturday. Speaking to reporters at his residence, Delwar said his party will not take part in a 'nominal' general election that is held under a state of emergency. He reiterated BNP's five point demands, including withdrawal of emergency and release of political leaders. The BNP-led four-party alliance has already called for countrywide rallies to press for these damands. "We want to go to election, we are an election oriented party," the BNP leader stressed. "But we believe emergency is a barrier to a fair election. People cannot vote freely under emergency." He added: "Only an elected government can solve the many crises the country is presently faced with." Delwar also repeated demand for more space between national and upazila elections. The BNP secretary general greeted the Hindu community on the eve of Durga Puja, the largest Hindu festival in the Bengali calendar. bdn
