 Kabul, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three soldiers from a US-led coalition force in Afghanistan have been killed in a blast in the south of the country, the US military said on Tuesday. Violence has surged in Afghanistan this year with about 3,000 people, at least 1,000 of them civilians, killed in the bloodiest year since US-led and Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001. This summer has also been the deadliest period for foreign troops in the country, with the militants launching more daring and deadly attacks.

The US military did not release the nationalities of the soldiers and said the incident was under investigation
