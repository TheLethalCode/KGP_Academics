<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)  Zillur Rahman termed the High Court's denial of bail to Sheikh Hasina on Monday "indecent", and vowed that the party would begin its campaign to restore democracy once the party chief returns home. "A new course of action will be taken up," Awami League acting chief said. Zillur said the High Court declining Hasina's bail petition earlier in the day was "indecent", adding: "The incident frustrated and saddened us." "If everybody is getting bail, why not Sheikh Hasina?" Zillur was speaking as chief guest at an iftar discussion on "Democracy, humanity and non-communalism in the eye of Islam" organised by a faction of Islami Oikya Jote at the Sheraton Hotel. On the day's theme, Zillur said: "We believe in secularism and non-communal democracy. We do not believe in atheism. Religion is one and there can not be debate over religion." He added, however, that there were 70 political parties in Bangladesh speaking 70 different messages. Leads the IOJ faction Misbahur Rahman Chowdhury, saying he held the four-party alliance responsible for the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack on an Awami League rally, added: "I was in the four party-alliance. We left the alliance in protest at the grenade attack." "Controlled or Islamic democracy will never work," Misbahur stressed. "Democracy is democracy." Criticising certain member parties of the 14-party alliance, however, he added: "We have some friends who suffer from an allergy. Whenever they hear the name of Islam they think of communalism." Aiming at Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami, the IOJ leader said: "Mr Nizami and his friends claim that they will establish the sovereignty of Allah." "I have a question for them: Allah is very much able to establish his sovereignty so why should Mr Nizami have to fight to establish the sovereignty of Allah?" Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD-Inu) general secretary Syed Zafar Sajjad, former speaker and deputy leader of the opposition Abdul Hamid, Awami League central leader Ali Ashraf and Bikalpadhara leader Rezaul Karim were among those present. bdnews
