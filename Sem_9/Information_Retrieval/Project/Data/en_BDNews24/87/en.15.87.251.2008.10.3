<TITLE> AC Milan fret over Kaladze </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A. Georgia defender Kakha Kaladze is set to miss AC Milan's visit to bottom club Cagliari on Sunday (1830 GMT) and risks a long spell on the sidelines after the club said he injured knee ligaments in Thursday's 1-0 UEFA Cup win at FC Zurich. Andriy Shevchenko promised not to rest on his laurels after netting his first goal on Thursday since returning to Milan from two disappointing seasons at Chelsea. "It's important for a striker to score although I'm aware that I still have to work a lot," the Ukrainian told reporters. Shevchenko's goal completed a 4-1 aggregate win to take the seven-times European champions to the UEFA Cup group stage. It also gave them their fifth consecutive victory. Gianluigi Buffon is aiming for a start when Juventus bid to end a run of three draws in all competitions at home to Palermo on Sunday (1300) after the Italy goalkeeper resumed full training following a thigh injury. But defender Nicola Legrottaglie, who extended his contract by a year until 2011 on Thursday, is out for 20 to 25 days because he too has a thigh problem from Tuesday's 2-2 draw at BATE Borisov in the Champions League. Italy forward Vincenzo Iaquinta, who scored the goals that earned Juve a draw in Belarus, and defender Giorgio Chiellini are doubts because of their respective muscle and knee problems, the club said. If Iaquinta is fit he is likely to be in the starting line-up, as is Sebastian Giovinco, who set up both goals on Tuesday, in favour of Pavel Nedved and Alessandro Del Piero, according to media. Inter Milan's Marco Materazzi is expected to be out for 20 days with a thigh strain he suffered in Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen in the Champions League. He would not have been able to play in Saturday's home match against promoted Bologna (1830), who have lost their last four, anyway because he is suspended along with fellow defender Nicolas Burdisso. Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari is available for the Serie A champions after serving a three-match ban. Brazil defender Juan is tipped to return to AS Roma's squad for Sunday's visit to Siena (1300) after a thigh problem and Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi is back from suspension. But captain Francesco Totti is still struggling for fitness after knee surgery, while defenders Marco Cassetti and Max Tonetto and midfielder David Pizarro are expected to miss out again though injury. Lazio will not throw caution to the wind when the surprise leaders welcome Lecce to Rome's Stadio Olimpico on Saturday (1600), coach Delio Rossi said. "I'm convinced they'll stay quite tight. We must not make the mistake of throwing ourselves into reckless attacks," Rossi was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. Lazio have 12 points from five games, one point more than second-placed Napoli
