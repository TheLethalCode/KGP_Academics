 Dhaka, Sept29 (bdnews24.com)The BTRC will pocket a massive Tk 1400 crore from selling spectrum to three mobile operators, the chairman said Monday. "This is the first time we are selling spectrum in Bangladesh," Manzurul Alam said. The commissioners sat with top executives of Grameen, AKTEL and Banglalink Monday morning and decided to sell one megahertz for Tk 80 crore. GP will get 7.4 megahertz, Banglalink 5.1 and AKTEL 5, in a move that will bury charges against the regulators that they were not willing to help the operators to improve quality of service. "We will now wait and see how they perform. You know about the situation with companies like GP," he said, referring to allegations of quality of service. The operators will pay in phases. The chairman made public the allocation of spectrum at a meet-the-press in the afternoon. b
