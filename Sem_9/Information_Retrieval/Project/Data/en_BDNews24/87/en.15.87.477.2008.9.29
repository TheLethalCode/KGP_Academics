<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Juergen Klinsmann is under pressure to salvage something from a selection gamble that went badly wrong when Bayern Munich host Olympique Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday. Klinsmann left Bayern with next to no creative threat when he omitted Ze Roberto, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lukas Podolski and Franck Ribery from the starting line-up against Hanover 96 on Saturday and the result was a desperate 1-0 defeat. It left Bayern in ninth place in the Bundesliga, with two wins, two draws and two defeats from their first six matches under Klinsmann, and club boss Uli Hoeness has publicly complained about the situation for the first time. "I'm annoyed now when I look at the table," Hoeness told reporters in Hanover. "We were much too careless." Klinsmann's first job as a club coach is safe as long as Bayern continue to make progress in Europe. Bayern won their first Group F match 1-0 away to Steaua Bucharest but the coach knows he needs improvement in all areas if they are to make it two out of two against Lyon. "We lost our rhythm completely," Klinsmann said after the Hanover game. "Trying to turn the game around we lacked creativity, craftiness and movement off the ball." RIBERY RELIANCE Key to restoring those attributes could be Ribery, who has now made two substitute appearances after recovering from the ankle injury he suffered at Euro 2008. He came on for the second half against Hanover but showed only brief flashes of his ability and Klinsmann needs more on Tuesday, whether as starter or substitute. The other big question will be how struggling goalkeeper Michael Rensing performs against Lyon, who extended their lead in Ligue 1 to six points on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Nancy featuring Karim Benzema's sixth league goal in seven matches. Benzema was substituted in the second half with a sore ankle but coach Claude Puel said he would be fit to play. "Our goal is at least one point, ideally three," Benzema told reporters. The seven-times French champions, who started with a 2-2 home draw with Fiorentina, will be without Italy defender Fabio Grosso, still nursing fractured ribs, but should welcome back their captain, Brazil midfielder Juninho, after a groin problem. Forward Sidney Govou, who was suspended against Nancy but should play on Tuesday, said he feared a burst of Bayern pride. "Bayern are still a great team," he told reporters. "They can wake up and they will be at home. I would have been more confident if they'd had a great start to the season." Probable teams Bayern Munich: 1-Michael Rensing; 23-Massimo Oddo, 3-Lucio, 5-Daniel van Buyten, 6-Martin Demichelis, 21-Philipp Lahm; 17-Mark van Bommel, 31-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 15-Ze Roberto; 9-Luca Toni, 18-Miroslav Klose Olympique Lyon: 1-Hugo Lloris; 20-Anthony Reveillere, 3-Cris, 5-Mathieu Bodmer, 15-John Mensah; 28-Jeremy Toulalan, 17-Jean Makoun, 8-Juninho (captain), 14-Sidney Govo
