 Dhaka, September 29 (bdnews24.com)  Some 370 convicts have been released through general amnesty this Eid. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Monday: "374 prisoners convicted of minor crimes or who have served fifty percent of their sentences have been released on the occasion of Eid-ul-fitr." "They were released from Dhaka Central Jail and prisons across the country on Sunday." There are almost 20 female prisoners amongst those released, he added. Prisoners convicted of murder, rape, arson, robbery, bombings, acid terrorism and those convicted under the arms act are not considered for amnesty. A committee headed by each zila administrator in the country makes recommendations for the release of prisoners. These committees also comprise a public prosecutor, police super, jail superintendent and an official of the ministry of social welfare. The government gives orders for the release of prisoners based on the suggestions made by these committees. The government grants general amnesty each year to prisoners on the occasions of the two Eids, independence and victory days. bdnews2
