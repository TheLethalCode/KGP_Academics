<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anyone expecting Franck Ribery to perform a one-man rescue act for Bayern Munich should think again, the Frenchman said on Monday. Ribery has recovered from the ankle injury he suffered at Euro 2008 and after two substitute appearances he could be back for his first start of the season at home to Olympique Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday. Bayern are in need of his destructive brilliance after losing their last two league games5-2 at home to Werder Bremen and 1-0 away to Hanover 96but improving the team's attitude will be just as important, according to Ribery. "On my own I can do nothing," the French midfielder said at a news conference in Munich. "If we play like we did in Hanover, we have no chance against Lyon." Bayern won their opening Champions League game 1-0 away to Steaua Bucharest and a second victory on Tuesday would set them up nicely in a group that also features Fiorentina. "I can hardly wait," said Ribery. "All eyes will be on me back in France. "Victory will be down to having the greater will to win and being more aggressive. It's a very important game for us." Klinsmann, who is starting to feel the heat after two straight league defeats, has not said whether he plans to pick Ribery from the start against Lyon. Christian Lell and Hamit Altintop are both out injured, while Ze Roberto, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lucio should all return after being rested against Hanover
