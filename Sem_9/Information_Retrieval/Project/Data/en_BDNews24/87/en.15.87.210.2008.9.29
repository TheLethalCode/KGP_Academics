 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)  The New Zealand cricket team are scheduled to arrive Dhaka Tuesday night, by a Singapore Airlines flight, to play a series of three one-day internationals and two Tests against Bangladesh. The Kiwis are expected to touch down at Zia International Airport at 10:40pm, according to the time-scheduled given by the Bangladesh Cricket Board Monday. It will be the second full tour in Bangladesh for The Black Caps, who whitewashed hosts Bangladesh in three ODIs and two Tests in Oct 2004. The visitors will open their month-long tour with a warm-up match on Oct 7, before playing the first ODI on Sept 9 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka. The series comes at a time when Bangladesh is reeling from the country's top eight cricketers have retired from the international cricket to join the breakaway Indian Cricket League. But, the New Zealand cricket team is as focused as ever ahead of the tour, they said. "The expectations are on us to win and that's fair enough," Vettori was quoted by the New Zealand Herald as saying on Sept 24. "But Bangladesh can be a tricky country to tour." Bangladesh have already announced a 24-member provisional squad for the series against New Zealand and South Africa, calling on four experienced and six uncapped players after the eight left to join the ICL. Bangladesh provisional squad: Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Mahmud Ullah, Dollar Mahmud, Nafis Iqbal, Rajin Salah, Tushar Imran, Enamul Haque Jr, Imrul Kayes, Shamsur Rahman, Naeem Islam, Suhrawardi Shuvo, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Sahagir Hossain. New Zealand ODI Squad: Daniel Vettori, Grant Elliott, Daniel Flynn, Mark Gillespie, Gareth Hopkins, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Michael Mason, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Scott Styris and Ross Taylor.
