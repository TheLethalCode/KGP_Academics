<TITLE> LDP to go to polls under Grand Alliance: Oli </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party president Oli Ahmed has said his party will join the elections under the 'Grand Alliance' headed by Awami League. In an interview with bdnews24.com on Wednesday, Oli said he hoped the alliance would form a government represented by all its component parties through winning the next election. Asked whether they would join the BNP-led four-party alliance, the former BNP minister and standing committee member said: "We are now in the 'Grand Alliance'. We are not thinking of any alternative to it." "LDP will start pre-polls activities after Eid-ul-Fitr. My party is ready to throw in candidates in more constituencies this time in consultation with the alliance because the alliance will be a strong platform to form government," he said. "People will vote honest, qualified and experienced people to form government in the upcoming elections and I believe the grand alliance will form the government." On the condition of distribution of constituencies the LDP president said: "The grand alliance had allowed LDP 40 constituencies in the scrapped Jan. 22 elections (in 2007). This time we are targeting another 40 constituencies." "If the election is foiled many will have to stay behind bars for the whole of their life. The two major political parties will have to play positive role for the elections to be held properly." "If the parties do not get any lessons and change their attitude after the incidents over the two years democracy will be hampered," he said. He lauded the caretaker government and the Election Commission for declaring the election date. "The political parties and the politicians should co-operate the government in the process to restore democracy." Oli termed the amendment to Representation of the People Order a good initiative. "LDP has already submitted the application to the Election Commission complying with all conditions of registration." He thought the new electoral laws would go a long way in disciplining political parties. Oli formed LDP after resigning his former party BNP in Oct. 2006, in the last days of the four-party alliance government. The party has currently 33 district committees and over 100 Upazila committees. bdne
