<TITLE> Rioch ready for chance to outwit Ferguson </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Bruce Rioch became manager of Middlesbrough in 1986 Alex Ferguson had not even begun his glittering reign at Manchester United. More than two decades later their paths will cross on Tuesday when United travel to Denmark to face Rioch's Aalborg BK in a Champions League clash that they dare not lose. Their respective journeys to this point in their careers could not have been more different. While Rioch has been employed by seven clubs since leaving Middlesbrough in 1990, with varying degrees of success, Ferguson has become king of Old Trafford and one of the greatest managers of all time. Ferguson has won 10 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and five FA Cups in his 21 years at the helm. Former Scotland captain Rioch has pitched up at Millwall, Bolton Wanderers, Arsenal, Norwich City, Wigan Athletic and Odense. The 61-year-old was the last manager of Arsenal before Arsene Wenger arrived and while his season in charge was disappointing he will always be remembered as the man who signed Dutch maestro Dennis Bergkamp for the Gunners. It has been a low-profile existence for Rioch, but on Tuesday he will get the chance to share the spotlight and turn up the heat on European champions United who have begun the defence of their crown poorly. RELISHING CHALLENGE While Danish champions Aalborg won plaudits for drawing their opening Group E fixture against Celtic in Glasgow with 10 men, United struggled to a 0-0 draw with Villarreal at Old Trafford. They desperately need a win to kickstart their campaign. Rioch can boast victories on his previous two home fixtures against Ferguson's United, one with Middlesbrough and one with Arsenal and he is relishing the challenge of continuing that record after drawing with Celtic. "We've put the cat among the pigeons already" Rioch said in British newspapers in the build-up to Tuesday's match at the club's modest 16,000-seater stadium. United, who lost the last time they played in Denmark two years ago to FC Copenhagen, will be boosted by the return to fitness and form of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese has scored in United's last two games and will be key for Ferguson if the English champions are to become the first team to retain the Champions League. United have managed just six goals in five Premier League games so far this season, with big-money signing Dimitar Berbatov still to get off the mark. However, Ferguson believes the Bulgarian will soon start to repay a 30 million pounds ($55.15 million) price tag that illustrates the gulf between themselves and Aalborg. "You don't need to pass to him in space all the time," Ferguson told United's website after his team beat Bolton Wanderers on Saturday. "You can pass to him when he's marked  he's brilliant at that and he produced some great moments. His touch was fantastic at times." Berbatov will probably partner Wayne Rooney in attack after the England striker came off the bench to score against Bolton. Probable line-ups: Aalborg BK: 1-Karim Zaza; 4-Michael Beauchamp, 2-, 6-Steve Olfers, 3-Martin Pedersen; 14-Jeppe Curth, 8-Andreas Johansson, 9-Thomas Augustinussen, 21-kasper Risgard, 23-Thomas Enevoldsen; 10-Marek Saganowski. United: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 2-Gary Neville, 5-Rio Ferdinand, 15-Nemanja Vidic, 3-Patrice Evra; 7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 18-Paul Scholes, 8-Anderson, 13-Park Ji-sung; 10-Wayne Rooney, 9-Dimitar Berbatov
