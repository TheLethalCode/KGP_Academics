 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 2(bdnews24.com)  Five-year old Jannatul Ferdousi came to Dhaka Central Jail on Thursday with her mother to be with her father she has not seen for four months. The inmates were being allowed to see their children on the Eid day. Jannat was waiting for her father along with mother and younger brother in front of the jail gate. As many as 84,000 prisoners across the country are allowed to see their relatives on Eid day, deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. At around 8am, the prisoners were having baths for attending Eid congregation. The central jail held three congregations for inmates. A separate congregation was held for seven high-profile prisoners. The prisons officials including the inspector general of prisons and deputy inspector general of prisons also offered prayers at the central jail. A heavily-shackled Mufti Abdul Hannan, an accused of Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, came to offer his Eid prayers. He embraced other inmates after prayers. Jail authorities have arranged special food for the inmates including vermicelli and puffed rice for breakfast, rice, fish and vegetables for lunch and fine rice, beef and vegetables for dinner. The prisoners have published a wall magazine titled 'Dishari: Bondi Moner Mukto Kotha' marking Eid-ul-Fitr. Major Haider said Eid reunion would be held in all jails across the country on Saturday, where the inmates would take part in cultural functions. Of the total 84,000 detainees across the country, the inmates number 30,000, of whom 3,000 are female. bdne
