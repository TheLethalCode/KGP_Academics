 MADRID, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb left in a bag exploded outside a courthouse in northern Spain Saturday, damaging buildings but hurting no one shortly after a warning call claiming to be from Basque rebels ETA, a police spokesman said. The explosion in the Basque Country town of Tolosa ripped a hole in the courthouse wall and damaged nearby houses at about 1.15 a.m. (2315 GMT), the spokesman said. It came just two weeks after ETA killed a soldier and injured at least 12 other people with three bombs in just over 24 hours in what seems to be a renewed bombing offensive by the separatists, according to the Spanish government. ETA guerrillas have killed more than 800 people in four decades of fighting for the independence of the Basque Country from Spain
