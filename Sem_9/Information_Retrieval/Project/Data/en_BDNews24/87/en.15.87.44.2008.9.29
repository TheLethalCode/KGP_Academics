 RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Players brawled on the pitch during one Brazilian championship derby on Sunday and fans clashed with riot police on the terraces during another. The Internacional-Gremio match in Porto Alegre was marred by ugly scenes just before halftime following a tackle by Internacional defender Edinho on Gremio playmaker Tcheco. The two became entangled and others immediately joined in followed by members of the two substitutes' benches. Officials struggled to control the situation as players pushed, threatened and argued with each other, interrupting the match for nearly five minutes. When the situation calmed, Edinho and Tcheco were sent off. Internacional, inspired by Argentine midfielder Andres D'Alessandro, won 4-1, with all the goals coming in the first half, and enjoyed the added bonus of knocking their arch-rivals off the top of the table. D'Alessandro rifled Internacional in front after four minutes and provided the crosses for Indio and Nilmar to score two more in a five-minute spell before halftime. In between, Tcheco equalised for Gremio with an individual goal and Alex put Internacional back in front in the 28th minute. The crowd trouble happened in Curitiba when fans of visiting Atletico Paranaense fought with police on the terraces at the Couto Pereira stadium during the game against Coritiba. Television pictures showed riot police chasing fans on the terraces with Alsatian dogs and truncheons. Media reports said the trouble began when a Coritiba fan hurled a firecracker towards the Atletico supporters. Reports said rival fans also clashed at a bus terminal before the game, hurling sticks and stones at each other. Palmeiras, under former Brazil and Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo, went top of the table after drawing 0-0 at Nautico. Palmeiras and Gremio, who had led for 14 games, both have 50 points from 27 games but Palmeiras have won more matches
