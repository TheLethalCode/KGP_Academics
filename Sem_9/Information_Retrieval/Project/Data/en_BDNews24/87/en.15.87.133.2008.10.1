 New Delhi, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex faltered after a firm start on Wednesday and dropped 0.8 percent as investors turned cautious ahead of a US vote on a new version of $700 billion package to ease a global financial crisis. Uncertainties about the health of the world economy and a local holiday on Thursday added to the gloomy sentiment, a day after the market pulled back from a two-year low. Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel and ICICI Bank led the losses after gaining in the previous session as investors unwound their exposure. "When there's a holiday tomorrow, no one wants to take a two-day risk," said D.D. Sharma, vice president at Anand Rathi Securities. "Oil prices have also spiked after the recent fall, which is considered bad for the equity markets." At 11:25 a.m., the 30-share main BSE index was down 0.83 percent, or 107.38 points, at 12,753.05, with 17 of the components falling. It had opened 1.1 percent higher, extending Tuesday's 2.1 percent gain. The market is closed on Thursday for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary. The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday night on a new version of the $700 billion bailout package for Wall Street, two days after rejecting it. Hopes that Congress will pass something soon drove a 5.3 percent rally in the S&P 500 stocks index overnight, erasing more than half of Monday's market plunge. Stocks in Japan and Australia bounced higher on Wednesday on hopes that a salvaged Wall Street rescue plan in Washington could keep global equities rallying. But aggressive selling by foreigners in emerging markets has been a worry. Foreign funds have pulled about $9.3 billion from Indian shares this year, though they were net buyers of $96 million on Monday when the BSE index fell 3.9 percent. Shares in Reliance Industries fell 2.5 percent to 1,898 rupees, while Larsen & Toubro lost 4.6 percent 1,164.95 rupees.Top telecoms Bharti Airtel was down 2.3 percent at 762.90 rupees. Larsen and Bharti had risen more than 5 percent on Tuesday. Software exporters, who derive about half of their revenue from the United States, rose on hopes the bailout package would make things better in the world's top economy. Infosys Technologies was up 1.9 percent at 1,424.50 rupees, while Satyam rose 4.5 percent to 310 rupees. In the broader market, 1,089 losers were ahead of 980 gainers on volume of 59 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was down 1.06 percent at 3,879.50. The Karachi and Colombo markets were shut for local holidays. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Top car maker Maruti Suzuki rose after it reported a 5.3 percent rise in September sales. The stock was up 0.4 percent at 690 rupees, having risen as much as 2.9 percent. TVS Motors Co Ltd was up 4.4 percent at 34.10 rupees after India's third-biggest motorcycle maker said its two wheeler sales in September rose 19 percent from a year earlier.
