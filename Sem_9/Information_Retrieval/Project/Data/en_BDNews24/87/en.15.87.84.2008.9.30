 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will hear bail petitions of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina after Eid in two graft cases involving Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd and the setting up of barge-planted power plants, her lawyer said on Tuesday. The vacation bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Jubayer Rahman Chowdhury set the hearing for Oct 5. "The hearing on the two bail appeals will be held on Oct. 5 after Eid-ul-Fitr," Hasina's lawyer Sheikh Fazle Nur Taposh told bdnews24.com. The bail petitions in the two cases were filed initially on Sept. 22 and a High Court bench returned the pleas saying the court did not have the jurisdiction to hear them. The petitions in these cases were filed again on Sept. 29. Anticorruption Commission deputy director Md Anwarul Haque filed the Niko graft case with Tejgaon Police Station against Hasina and six others on Dec 9 last year, accusing them of causing the state losses of Tk 13,700 crore. The ACC pressed charges against the accused on May 7. ACC deputy director SM Sabbir Hassan filed the barge-mounted power plants case on Sept 2 last year with the same police station. Hasina and six others were charged with taking Tk 3 crore in bribes to allow installation of three plants. The graft-busters pressed charges against the accused persons with the court on Jan. 11. The High Court on Monday refused the Awami League chief bail in the extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. bdne
