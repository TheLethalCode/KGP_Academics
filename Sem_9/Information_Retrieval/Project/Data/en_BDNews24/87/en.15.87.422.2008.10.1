 MUMBAI, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian selectors have retained former captain Saurav Ganguly in a 15-player squad named on Wednesday for the first two games of the four-test series against Australia starting on Oct. 9. Ganguly, 36, had been under pressure to keep his place as the elder statesman of the team's four veteran batting stalwarts, along with Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Vangipurappu Laxman. The selectors also included middle-order batsman Subramaniam Badrinath, who has played three one-dayers for India, and leg spinner Amit Mishra as back up for captain Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. The pair replace batsman Rohit Sharma and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha from the side which lost the previous test series in Sri Lanka, 2-1. Wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni also returned for tests after skipping that series. The first test will be played in Bangalore from Oct. 9 with the second game of the four-match series starting in Mohali on Oct. 17. New Delhi and Nagpur stage the last two matches. Squad: Anil Kumble (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Saurav Ganguly, Subramaniam Badrinath, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra
