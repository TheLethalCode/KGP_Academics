 MULTAN, Pakistan, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirty-seven people were killed in Pakistan, most of them burnt to death, when the bus taking them home for Eid holiday collided with a milk tanker, a senior government official said on Tuesday. The accident occurred on Monday night in Muzaffargarh district, about 440 km (275 miles) southwest of the capital, Islamabad. Among the dead were nine children and three women. "Most of the deaths occurred as many passengers were sleeping and the bus caught fire," Tariq Javed, a senior district government official, told Reuters. The bus was taking 57 passengers from the southern city of Karachi to the northwestern town of Mansehra for the Muslim festival of Eid-al-Fitr, which is due to begin on Wednesday.
