 CLUJ, Romania, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unheralded Romanians CFR Cluj can make a lasting impact on European soccer by beating big-spending Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday, according to Luiz Felipe Scolari. "We have known about Steaua Bucharest and Rapid Bucharest for a while and we'll hear about Cluj for many years too if CFR win against us," Chelsea coach Scolari told reporters on Tuesday. "It would be good for Cluj and for Romania." The Champions League newcomers opened their campaign with a 2-1 win at AS Roma earlier this month and Scolari said it would be no shock if the Romanian league and cup double winners added Chelsea to their list of Group A scalps. "If CFR Cluj win tomorrow this will not be a surprise," added the Brazilian. "They are not a small team. "Their manner of play can cause damage. If we lose we will have to accept they were better than us." Premier League leaders Chelsea are unbeaten in all competitions this season and the coach said their good start was down to the respect they showed opposition teams. "Chelsea are undefeated in England because we have respected our opponents and we will respect Cluj tomorrow if we want to win," said Scolari. Goalkeeper Petr Cech said the London club were desperate to go one better than last season when they lost the Champions League final to English rivals Manchester United on penalties in Moscow. "Wins are important only to fortify your confidence," Cech said. "Wins mean nothing without trophies so our thought is only to win the Champions League this year.
