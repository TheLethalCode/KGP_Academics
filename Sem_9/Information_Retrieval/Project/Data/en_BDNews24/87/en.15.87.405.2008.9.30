He told Le Figaro newspaper Indian exports could be hit if the crisis caused a recession in the world's largest economies. "Even though the crisis is only affecting developing countries at the moment, it could extend to the rest of the world," Singh, who is on a visit to France, said. "If the financial crisis starts a recession in the main economies, that would compromise our exports," he added.

"The main responsibility is with the developed countries, but India and China can play a part in the solution," he said
