 MOSCOW, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zenit St Petersburg distanced themselves on Thursday from reports of an alleged attempt by Russian mafia figures to fix last season's UEFA Cup semi-final between the Russian club and Bayern Munich. Judicial sources in Spain told Reuters on Wednesday that a Spanish investigating judge had sent recordings purporting to reveal a match-fixing plot to German authorities. Russian champions Zenit crushed Bayern 4-0 at home in the second leg of their tie to win 5-1 on aggregate before going on to beat Glasgow Rangers in the final of the competition. "There is nothing to comment on because, even if there is some investigation, Zenit has nothing to do with this," Alexei Petrov, a spokesman for the St Petersburg club, told Reuters. "We have nothing to do with whoever it is that is alleged to be behind this, whether it is so-called Russian mafia or whoever," Petrov added. In a statement issued on the club's website (www.fc-zenit.ru) on Wednesday, Zenit said its performance in the matches against Bayern and Rangers "is the best proof the victories were achieved in an honest, uncompromising contest". Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who also serves as president of the Russian Football Union, said the allegations of match-fixing were another attempt to discredit the country's soccer. "This is not just an attempt to discredit Zenit but Bayern as well. Bayern have many great players, Kahn, Klose, Toni, Ze Roberto, Lucio  how can you bribe them?" Mutko, who was Zenit president from 1999 to 2003, said on Russian television. "I don't think you can buy a victory over Bayern." UEFA, European soccer's governing body, said on Wednesday it was aware of the reports about a match-fixing investigation. Bayern said on Wednesday they had no information about the reports
