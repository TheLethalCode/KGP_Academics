 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  New Zealand arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday for a series of two tests and three one-day internationals. Captain Daniel Vettori and the 16-strong squad flew in at 10:30pm at Zia International Airport. Vettori refused to tag Bangladesh as a weak side despite the hosts losing seven top players to the breakaway Indian Cricket League. "I believe the team that Bangladesh now have is also quite strong," he said to reporters at the airport. "We've a few new players in the team who have not played in subcontinent conditions. So playing here will be a learning curve for them. "Besides, Bangladesh will play in home conditions, so there's no way they can be taken lightly. I believe it will be an exciting series," Vettori said. New Zealand play one-day matches on Oct. 9, 11 and 14 and tests starting on Oct. 17 at Chittagong and Oct. 25 at Mirpur. A limited-overs warmup will take place on Oct. 7. bdne
