 LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal demolished a feeble Porto side 4-0 in the Champions League at the Emirates on Tuesday with two goals each from Robin van Persie and Emmanuel Adebayor firing them to the top of Group G. Dutchman Van Persie settled some early Arsenal jitters to slot the opener after 31 minutes before Adebayor headed the second shortly before halftime. Porto, who have never won in England, capitulated after the break and Van Persie waltzed through to make it 3-0 before Adebayor converted a penalty with 19 minutes remaining. The visitors had hit the crossbar through Cristian Rodriguez when the score was 0-0 but were outplayed as Arsenal recorded their first win in this season's competition after drawing their opener 1-1 with Dynamo Kiev. Arsenal have four points from two games, one point more than Porto. Dynamo Kiev are third with two points after their 0-0 draw away to Fenerbahce. Manager Arsene Wenger had been critical of his side's attitude after a shock 2-1 home defeat against Hull City on Saturday cost Arsenal top spot in the Premier League. But he had no complaints on Tuesday. "I didn't want to punish the players after the Hull defeat. Sometimes you give a team the chance to respond," he told reporters. "It was what I expected, we could have scored more but we responded in a convincing way. "I expect us to win the group from here." It could have been different if Porto had gone ahead when Uruguayan Rodriguez bounced a header off the sodden turf that skimmed off the crossbar. Argentine striker Lisandro Lopez also tested Manuel Almunia with a fierce drive and almost scored from the resulting corner as Arsenal stuttered. Once Van Persie beat Helton at the near post from Adebayor's perfect cut back Arsenal moved through the gears and they gained a comfortable cushion five minutes before the interval when Adebayor climbed to head a second goal from a corner. LOST CONFIDENCE "We were the more dangerous side when it was 0-0 but we had two great chances and couldn't score," Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira said. "After they scored we lost confidence." Ferreira sent on attacking midfielder Lucho Gonzalez at the start of the second half in place of the defensive Fernando but it made no difference as Van Persie brushed off a weak tackle to poke a shot past Helton and make it 3-0. Porto's minds appeared already to be on Sunday's Portuguese league clash with Sporting in Lisbon as Arsenal ran riot. Walcott missed a sitter and then set up Samir Nasri who also failed to hit the target with the goal gaping. Adebayor completed the rout from the penalty spot after substitute Nicklas Bendtner was fouled by Freddy Guarin
