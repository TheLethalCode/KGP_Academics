 MUMBAI, Mon Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian financial markets fell sharply on Monday, with the stock market slumping to a 1- year low and the rupee hitting a five-year low as a spreading global financial crisis triggered fresh bouts of risk aversion. The stock market fell as much as 5.3 percent to 12,402.84, its lowest since mid-March 2007, before partially recovering to end down 3.9 percent at 12,595.75, its second lowest close of 2008. Worries that foreigners were liquidating Indian investments to repatriate funds saw the rupee fall to 47.11 per dollar, its weakest since early June 2003, according to Reuters data. "There is a lot of uncertainty with the U.S. bailout package and now it seems the crisis has spread to Europe," said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Mutual Fund who manages assets worth $80 million. Dealers said a bank holiday on Tuesday, the fiscal half-yearly closing when banks balance their books, exacerbated the moves. Stock positions were cut and there was heavy dollar demand from importers, especially oil refiners, the biggest buyers in the local market, they said. Currency and debt markets are shut on Tuesday. There will be no stock settlement, although the market will be open for trade. Stocks in Asia and Europe declined heavily as fallout from the credit crisis hit Europe's banking sector, forcing partial nationalisation of two banks and leaving investors to ponder the impact of a U.S. bailout plan. In India, leading private bank ICICI Bank dropped 12.1 percent to its lowest close in more than two years. The partially convertible rupee closed at 46.95/96 per dollar, recovering some of its fall on heavy central bank intervention that some traders put at more than $1 billion, from Friday's close of 46.545/55. Heavy foreign fund selling has been a key factor for the stock market's near 40 percent fall and the rupee's more than 16 percent decline in 2008. Net sales by foreigners have topped $9 billion this year, including almost $2 billion in September, a marked reversal of record net buying of $17.4 billion in 2007. "I think we are dealing with a situation where there is a tremendous demand-supply mismatch in terms of capital flows and incessant dollar demand from companies," said P. Mukherjee, treasurer at Mumbai-based Axis Bank. The central bank's forex intervention, where it sells dollars and buys rupees, deepened a tight cash conditions in the money market, which is already struggling with extra bond and bill supplies. Overnight cash rates were near 16 percent, nearly doubling from the central bank's main lending rate of 9 percent and much above 6 percent where it is usually when cash is ample. Dealers said the rupee would remain under pressure as the global crisis played out, with the central bank's dollar sales the only supporting factor at the moment. "I think we may be close to the bottom on the rupee, but we have to wait and watch," said Axis Bank's Mukherjee
