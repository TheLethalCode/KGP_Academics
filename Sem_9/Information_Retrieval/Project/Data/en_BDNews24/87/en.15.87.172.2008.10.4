 LAS VEGAS, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - O.J. Simpson, who was famously acquitted of murder in 1995 after the so-called "Trial of the Century," was found guilty on all charges in a Las Vegas kidnap and robbery case on Friday. Simpson, 61, could face life in prison when he is sentenced for his conviction on the 12 charges at a later date. The former football star's conviction in Las Vegas came on the 15th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the Los Angeles murder case.
