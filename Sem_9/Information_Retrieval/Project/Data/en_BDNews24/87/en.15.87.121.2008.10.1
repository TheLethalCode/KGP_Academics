 LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sung the praises of midfielder Cesc Fabregas after his side's 4-0 demolition of Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Spaniard has made a slow start to the season compared with 12 months ago when he could not stop scoring goals but Wenger said he was back to his best against Porto even if he is still waiting to get off the mark.

First, though, Wenger wants his side to complete their recovery from the Hull debacle. "It was the response I wanted (against Porto)," he said. "It is half of the response of the week, the other half comes on Saturday
