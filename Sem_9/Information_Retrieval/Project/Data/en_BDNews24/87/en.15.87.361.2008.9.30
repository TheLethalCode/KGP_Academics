 Bhubaneswar, India, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than a dozen people were injured, some critically, after religious clashes in Orissa between Hindu and Christians, officials said. Violence broke out at Rudangia village in Kandhamal district after Hindus attacked Christians, setting fire to their houses and burning a church, according to district collector Krishan Kumar. The violence came after a string of attacks on Christians in three states which has left at least 33 people dead and dozens of churches damaged in the last month. Christians have responded with some violence in Orissa. The clashes were sparked by the issue of religious conversion in Orissa's poor tribal region, home to many Christian missionary groups. Clashes first erupted in Orissa last month after the killing of a Hindu leader linked to the main opposition Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Police suspected Maoist rebels but many Hindus in the region blamed Christians. More than 3,700 federal police have already been deployed in the area. The attacks on Christians in India have been condemned by Pope Benedict, and Roman Catholic bishops have urged the European Union to treat persecution of Christians as a humanitarian emergency. But violence has continued, especially in Kandhamal where thousands of Christians now live in government camps because their homes are destroyed or they are too fearful to return. Religious clashes have also been reported in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. India does not have a long history of attacks on minority Christians, but intolerance has risen in the past two decades with a revival of Hindu nationalism
