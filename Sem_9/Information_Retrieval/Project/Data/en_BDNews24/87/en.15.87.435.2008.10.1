 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Illuminations went up on civic buildings across the city on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, while people made ready for Thursday's festivities. While many of the world's Muslims celebrated Eid on Tuesday, the National Moon-Sighting Committee announced that it failed to see the Shawal moon in the sky over Bangladesh on the night, allowing Bangladeshi Muslims to observe 30 full days of fasting this year as in the last two years. The capital will see a total of 360 Eid congregations in the city's 90 wards this year, with the main congregation to be held at the National Eidgah premises. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in separate messages greeted the nation on the eve. "The appeal of Eid-ul-Fitr is eternal in establishing a friendly and peaceful society," the president said. "I hope the great lesson of Eid-ul-Fitr will prompt our national development and advancement." Fakhruddin also spoke of peace: "The holy Eid gives us an example of peace, unity and fraternity." "I call upon all to realise the significant message of Eid-ul-Fitr and implement it in every sphere of individual, social and national life." Political leaders also delivered Eid messages to their parties, supporters and the nation. The capital was bedecked and lighted, with major civic buildings Bangabhaban, Sangsad Bhaban, the Secretariat, Supreme Court and High Court gaily illuminated. Dhaka's major thoroughfares were also decorated with Eid Mubarak banners in Bangla and Arabic. While homes across the country were busy preparing Wednesday for the next day's celebrations, special arrangements were also being made for Eid meals in hospitals, prisons and orphanages. bdnew
