<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has deferred a final hearing on the writ petition challenging the gazette for delimitation of the Jatiya Sangsad constituencies. A High Court vacation bench of Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and Justice Md Rezaul Haque on Monday gave the order when the petitioner's counsel appealed for more time. The court on Sept 22 fixed Monday for final hearing of the writ petition. But advocate Joynul Abedin, lawyer for the writ petitioner, appealed for time saying their senior co-counsels were indisposed. The hearing has been deferred until the Supreme Court vacation ends on Oct 11. The Election Commission's counsel senior advocate Mahmudul Islam and Dr Shahdeen Malik opposed the plea for more time. They said the date for general elections has been announced and a schedule has to be declared. If the hearing is deferred, and announcement of the schedule thereby delayed, it might hinder the election. The court after hearing both sides dropped the writ petition from the day's cause list. Another counsel of the petitioner, barrister Nasiruddin Ashim, told bdnews24.com the High Court had wanted to fix a date for hearing the writ petition on any day between Oct 5 and 7 soon after the Eid vacation. "But we asked them to fix the hearing for the week after the Supreme Court vacation ends. The court then dropped the writ from the cause list." Former state minister and BNP lawmaker from Dhaka-2 (Nawabganj) seat Abdul Mannan filed the petition on Aug 6. The High Court on Aug 7 stayed for three months the gazette regarding delimitation of the Jatiya Sangsad constituencies. At the same time the High Court ordered the Election Commission and the government to show cause as to why the gazette should not be declared unconstitutional and void. The gazette was issued on July 10 re-demarcating the boundary of 300 parliamentary seats. bdnew
