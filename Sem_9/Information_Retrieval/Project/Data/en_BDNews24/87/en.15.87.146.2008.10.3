 MADRID, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Real Madrid Sergio Ramos has dismissed rumours that he intends to quit the club at the end of the season, he said in an interview with newspaper Marca. The defender scotched the suggestion that he was planning his exit due to an alleged dispute over a recent contract renewal. "I have a good contract with Real Madrid and have no intention of leaving," he told the paper. Injury-plagued Atletico Madrid are expected to face Barcelona in the Camp Nou on Saturday without Greek defender Giorgios Seitaridis and Portuguese winger Simao Sabrosa, who has strained a ligament in his right knee. Portuguese midfielder Maniche is doubtful. Maniche came on midway through the second half of Atletico's Champions League match against Olympique Marseille on Wednesday after being out with back problems. Uruguay striker Diego Forlan is still unavailable for Atletico though he has returned to training and hopes to be back for the Oct. 18 derby against arch-rivals Real Madrid. Valencia, undefeated this season, will defend their lead in the standings against mid-table Valladolid on Sunday, but with little time to prepare after their UEFA Cup win against Portugal's Maritimo on Thursday
