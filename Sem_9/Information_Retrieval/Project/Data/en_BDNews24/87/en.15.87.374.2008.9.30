 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)Eid ul-Fitr will be celebrated Thursday, marking the end of Ramadan, as the National Moon-Sighting Committee announced that it failed to see the Shawal moon in the sky over Bangladesh on Tuesday. Moon sighting in 64 districts began soon after iftar , but an unclear sky due to cloud cover prevented the committee experts from spotting the new moon. The committee sat at a meeting, presided over by law and religious affairs adviser AFM Hassan Arriff, at 6:30pm which ended just before 7pm.
