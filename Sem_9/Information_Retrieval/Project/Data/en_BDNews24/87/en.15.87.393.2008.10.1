<TEXT>
 VILLARREAL, Spain, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Villarreal captain Marcos Senna curled in a magnificent second-half freekick to secure a 1-0 victory over Celtic in their Champions League Group E tie on Tuesday. He swept a 25-metre effort from the left over the defensive wall and the ball dropped into the bottom left hand corner on 67 minutes with keeper Artur Boruc sprawling in vain. Boruc had kept the Scottish side in the game in the first half by making some fine saves. Midway through the opening half Boruc raced out of his goal to deny Giuseppe Rossi who had been sent clear by Senna. Boruc blocked with his legs and the rebound was blazed high and wide by Joseba Llorente. The Polish keeper then did well to cover a powerful header by Llorente from 12 metres as the Spanish side pressed for the opener. Boruc also pulled off a fine fingertip save to divert over a sweetly-struck shot by Rossi after a cut back from Santi Cazorla. Celtic had soaked up some intense pressure yet it was their Greek striker Giorgos Samaras who had the best chance of the first half when he pounded clear on the right only to flick his shot against keeper Diego Lopez. Celtic surged forward after the interval and skipper Stephen McManus came close with a back heeled shot from six metres which Lopez smothered on the line. But Villarreal hit back with Rossi ripping through the defence on a tremendous run before whipping a 20 metre low shot narrowly beyond the right post. Senna forced a good low save from Boruc before finally beating him with a swerving freekick. Villarreal have four points from two games with Celtic on one point. "We have given them a right good game," Celtic manager Gordon Strachan told Sky TV. "I think that was the best we have played away from home since I have been here." Celtic's infamous Champions League away record continues to haunt them. They have now lost 17 of 18, picking up one solitary draw
