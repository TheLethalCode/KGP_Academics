 KARACHI, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will raise Cricket Australia's policy not to tour the country over security fears but travel to India at the International Cricket Council (ICC) next month, sports minister Najamuddin Khan said. Khan will attend ICC's executive board meeting as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is without a chairman since August and is being monitored by the sports ministry. "Australia can play in India although even there, unfortunately, there have been bomb blasts but they're refusing to tour Pakistan," he told Geo News channel. Australia have refused to tour Pakistan over safety and security concerns for its players following a spate of suicide bombings. They were among the teams who declined to play in this month's Champions Trophy in Pakistan citing security fears, forcing the tournament to be postponed until late next year. However, Australia are in India to play four tests after accepting security assurances from the Indian board despite a series of bomb attacks in New Delhi, including one on Saturday. "I will raise this issue with the ICC and talk to the Australians also," he said. "I think they are opting double standards and following different policies for Pakistan and India which is unfair to our cricket." Khan said he would try to convince the other boards to give fresh dates for the eight-team Champions Trophy. "We'll try our best to keep Champions Trophy in Pakistan because we are assuring foolproof security to all teams and we want our cricket to flourish.
