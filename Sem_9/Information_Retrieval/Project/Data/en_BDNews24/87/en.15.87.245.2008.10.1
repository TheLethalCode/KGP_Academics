 LYON, France, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Lyon, who could pick only one point from each of their first two Champions League outings, now target victory in their next two Group F games, both against Steaua Bucharest. "We need six points against Steaua to put ourselves in a good position," defender Mathieu Bodmer told reporters after Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Bayern Munich, which followed a 2-2 home draw with Fiorentina in Lyon's first match two weeks earlier. "To do that we need to play the full 90 minutes the way we played in the first half against Bayern," Bodmer added. Lyon indeed played well in the first half, taking the lead courtesy of an own goal by Martin Demichelis, before suffering in the second, during which Bayern's Ze Roberto headed home the equaliser. The seven-times French champions were then left to rue a great chance missed by France striker Karim Benzema five minutes from time. "We had come to win and in the end a point is the absolute minimum we could hope for," said Lyon coach Claude Puel. "We moved ahead and then Karim wasted a match point." Benzema, who tried to be too clever in the box when he squandered his opportunity, insisted it was not all negative. "We saw a good, solid Lyon side," he said. "We can have regrets." Lyon, desperate to make an impact in Europe at last after never moving past the Champions League quarter-finals, lie second in the group, two points behind Bayern. "We were too passive in the second half," said Bodmer. "It's a pity because if we had put them under a bit more pressure, we would have had a chance to win it.
