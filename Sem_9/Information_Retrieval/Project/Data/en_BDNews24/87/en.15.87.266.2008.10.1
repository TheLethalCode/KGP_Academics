<TITLE> Xstrata ditches Lonmin bid due to credit crunch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Miner Xstrata Plc dropped plans for a $10 billion takeover bid for No. 3 platinum producer Lonmin Plc on Wednesday due to financing difficulties linked to the global credit crunch, sending Lonmin's share price plummeting. "The current lack of clarity and certainty regarding the future availability of credit introduces significant risks into the financing package available to Xstrata," Chief Executive Mick Davis said in a statement. Lonmin's shares, which had already shed a third since Xstrata made its 33-pound-per-share proposed offer on August 6, tumbled as much as 30 percent and was trading 18.7 percent weaker at 18.00 pounds by 0733 GMT. Xstrata shares, which had shed 46 percent since it made the approach, surged 10.7 percent to 19.00 pounds, compared to a 4.9 percent increase in the UK mining index. "This is certainly the outcome that the majority of (Xstrata) shareholders will have wanted in the short term. Xstrata had become a natural target for short sellers in the market," Cazenove said in a note. Xstrata said loan terms required it to refinance a substantial portion of the debt within 12 months. "Finalizing the bank debt necessary to implement the offer on those terms would not be in the best interest of Xstrata. As a result, Xstrata has no current intention to make an offer for Lonmin." Banking sources told Reuters last month that Xstrata had approached 22 banks to make commitments for a $15 billion loan to both fund the Lonmin takeover and refinance existing debt. STILL BULLISH ON METALS Lonmin, which produces platinum in South Africa, had spurned the bid as an opportunistic move that undervalued the firm and its assets. The UK takeover panel had issued a ruling requiring Xstrata to make a formal bid by Thursday or walk away for six months. Xstrata said the turmoil on financial markets did not change the fundamental outlook for the firm. "While the current instability of the financial markets has created an environment of great uncertainty, it does not change the fundamental robust nature of Xstrata's cash-generative portfolio and profitability." The firm, the world's fifth biggest diversified mining group by market value, was also still bullish about the medium term prospects for commodity prices, even though it said weakness may persist in the short term. Analyst Michael Rawlinson at Liberum Capital said Xstrata had the best earnings momentum of major mining groups based on metals prices over the past three months. Xstrata did not specifically refer to the price of platinum, which has tumbled by half since hitting a peak in March. The precious metal has been hit hard due to liquidations by funds and worries that weaker economic growth will curb demand from the metal's biggest consumer, the auto industry, for catalysts to clean exhaust fumes. Xstrata has argued it had the expertise to turn around the South African mines owned by Lonmin, which has repeatedly cut its production targets due to operational problems, smelter difficulties and power shortages. Analysts had largely supported the bid since Xstrata has a track record of improving performance of companies it has bought, such as Canada's Falconbridge and Australia's MIM. Rawlinson said Lonmin's shareholders might urge the firm to come to a deal with Xstrata at a price lower than 33 pounds per share. "It is clear Xstrata remain interested in closing a deal as and when financing conditions alleviate and remaining shareholders, a high proportion of which are arbs (arbitrage investors) will put pressure on the Lonmin board to reach an agreed outcome with Xstrata," he said in a note. Under UK takeover rules, Xstrata may not launch a takeover offer within six months unless it is an agreed deal with Lonmin. Lonmin said on Monday its CEO Brad Mills, who had been criticized for the firm's underperformance, was resigning and he would be replaced by Chief Strategic Officer Ian Farmer
