 BUCHAREST, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rapid Bucharest suspended Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro on Thursday after fans protested at the team's UEFA Cup exit, the Romanian club's owner said. Riot police detained 12 supporters after angry fans threw stones at club owner Fahti Taher and shareholder George Copos following the 1-1 first round, second leg draw with Germany's VfL Wolfsburg that sent them out 2-1 on aggregate. "We've decided that Peseiro is suspended," Taher told reporters, adding that the club's deputy coaches would lead the team until a new coach is appointed. He gave no further details on Peseiro, who signed a three-year contract in June that Taher told reporters at the time stated he cannot be fired unless Rapid pay him 500,000 euros ($697,400) compensation. Some 1,000 supporters protested against Peseiro and the club's officials, accusing them of incompetence, during and after the match. About 200 riot police then detained the dozen violent fans who will be fined, according to a police spokesman. Rapid are 11th in the Romanian championship on 13 points, nine points behind leaders and local rivals Dinamo Bucharest
