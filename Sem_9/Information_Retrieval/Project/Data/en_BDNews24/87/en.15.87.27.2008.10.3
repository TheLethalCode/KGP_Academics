 Eddie Evans NEW YORK, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The House of Representatives started work on a $700 billion bailout package for U.S. banks, under pressure from all sides as the effort to head off a spreading financial crisis hung in the balance. With a vote expected around noon, the White House, congressional leaders and even foreign leaders pressed wavering members to vote for the package, after the House defeated a similar one on Monday. The bill would allow the Treasury to buy toxic debt from U.S. banks, which many economists said is needed to head off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In Paris, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said the world stood on the "edge of the abyss." House leaders were still working the phones as the bill was being considered. "I'm optimistic about today. We're not going to take anything for granted," said House Republican leader John Boehner. "We're going to continue to talk to our members but it's time to act." Earlier, the United States reported its biggest monthly job loss in 5 1/2 years, coming on top of a pile of economic data pointing to an approaching recession. Data showed the U.S. services sector holding up. "The data has been horrible all week long. It absolutely does put pressure on them to get this rescue act passed," said Fred Dickson, market strategist at D.A. Davidson and Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "It's a bill with risks, but it's a plan and the market needs a plan." In a positive sign, Wells Fargo & Co, one of the strongest U.S. banks, stepped in to buy Wachovia Corp, saying it didn't need the government help that Citigroup Inc required for an earlier effort to rescue Wachovia. The House shocked world markets on Monday by rejecting a previous draft. With elections on November 4, lawmakers are wary of voter backlash in asking taxpayers to pay for Wall Street's mistakes. The Labor Department said there were 159,000 fewer jobs in the economy in September than in August, coming on top of manufacturing data this week suggesting a recession is approaching. Investors focused on hopes for the bailout vote and on the Wachovia deal and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.6 percent and the S&P 500 index up more than 2 percent. European stocks rose and the dollar gained. Action on the U.S. bailout was of paramount importance, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said. "(U.S. Treasury) Secretary (Henry) Paulson's plan obviously must be passed," he told Europe 1 Radio. "It must be. It is necessary." Late on Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the House would vote on the bailout bill on Friday, a sign that political leaders were confident of approval. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had said the bailout package would not be brought to the floor without the votes secured to pass it. Still, some Republicans who opposed it on Monday said they were not swayed by changes made to the Senate version, and some Democrats said they were put off by those changes. France's prime minister, whose country is hosting an emergency summit with Italian, British and German leaders on Saturday, said only collective action could solve the financial crisis. He said he would not rule out any solution to stop any bank failing. "The world is on the edge of the abyss because of an irresponsible system," Fillon said, alluding to widespread anger over past lax regulation of financial markets and excessive lending. Fillon said President Nicolas Sarkozy would propose at the emergency meeting measures to unfreeze credit and coordinate economic and monetary strategies. Bad news mounted in the European financial sector. In Switzerland, UBS AG, hardest hit among European banks by its exposure to subprime-related holdings, said it would cut 2,000 investment banking jobs -- on top of the 4,100 positions cut in the past year. Worries grew that even if Washington agrees on the package, it will not be enough to resolve deeper-rooted weakness. New data showed that a U.S. recession is nearing and Europe's economy is worsening. "Investors expect the U.S. House to approve the bailout, but even if that happens, it would have a neutral impact on the market as its effectiveness is still questionable," said Takahito Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in Tokyo. A collapse in the U.S. housing market and resulting bad mortgages has undermined confidence in the financial sector, with interbank lending and credit to businesses and private individuals all but seizing up. Central banks have injected billions of dollars to maintain some flow of funds. Divisions have emerged within Europe over the past week, with Ireland offering guarantees on bank deposits, prompting a flight of capital from British lenders to Irish banks, and Greece promising to safeguard savers' cash. EU partners said Ireland's move could break competition rules and threatened the unity necessary to ensure an ordered approach to turmoil ahead.
