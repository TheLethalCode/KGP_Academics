<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)Awami League has said runaway prices had taken the gloss off Eid festivities for ordinary people this year, as a drag on "happy celebrations". "Because of the high prices of commodities nobody, except the affluent, can celebrate Eid happily," acting party president Zillur Rahman told reporters on Thursday. He exchanged Eid greetings with party colleagues at his Gulshan home. "If we come to power we will bring the commodity prices to a tolerable level," he said. He reiterated the demand of releasing party president Sheikh Hasina, who is taking treatment in the United States after release on parole. He said they would continue to press on with the demand until she was freed. Asked about moves the party was going to make after the Eid to press for the demand, Zillur said: "The movement is the demand of time. We will announce moves when the time comes." bdne
