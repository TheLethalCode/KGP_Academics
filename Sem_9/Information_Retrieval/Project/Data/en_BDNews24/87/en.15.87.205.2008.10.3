 BUCHAREST, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Several prominent Romanian club officials and player agents have been indicted on charges of tax evasion and fraud over foreign transfers, the country's anti-corruption prosecutors said on Thursday. "Eight officials caused a shortfall of about $1.5 million for the state and more than $10 million in the case of four (first division) clubs," the anti-corruption prosecuting office (DNA) said in a statement. "Some of the money received from transfers was laundered through several off-shore companies." Since DNA investigations started in January, all eight officials have denied any wrongdoing. Former Romania international Gheorghe Popescu, who also used to be a player agent, will be tried for irregularities over striker Florin Bratu's move from Rapid Bucharest to Galatasaray in 2003. Prosecutors say Rapid received $1.6 million less than they were supposed to for the transfer and accuse Popescu and two other agents, Victor and Ioan Becali, of pocketing the missing money. Also indicted on Thursday were former Rapid owner George Copos, Dinamo Bucharest executive president Cristian Borcea and Gloria Bistrita president Jean Padureanu, former Otelul Galati director Mihai Stoica and former Dinamo Bucharest shareholder Gheorghe Netoiu. "All of them are accused of fraud, tax evasion and prolonged involvement in money laundering. But a date for the trial has yet to be set," DNA spokeswoman Livia Saplacan told Reuters. The investigation surrounds the transfer of 12 players, including Cosmin Contra, Paul Codrea, Florin Cernat, Nicolae Mitea and Ionel Ganea, to clubs in Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Ukraine, China and South Korea between 1999 and 2005. It is the first time in the post-communist era that authorities have investigated alleged corruption in the transfer abroad of Romanian players, despite widespread media reports of wrongdoing in the past 18 years
