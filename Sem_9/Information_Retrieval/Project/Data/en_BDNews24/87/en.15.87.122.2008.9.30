 Simon Cameron-Moore ISLAMABAD, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has appointed a new chief for the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Directorate, months after U.S. officials had questioned the reliability of the military's premier spy agency in the war against terrorism. A military statement issued around midnight on Monday announced a major overhaul of Pakistan's top brass by army chief General Ashfaq Kayani. The musical chairs at high command will come under intense scrutiny from the intelligence community in the United States and neighbors in the region. A September 20 suicide bomb attack that killed 55 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad underscored concern al Qaeda-linked militants and Taliban fighters could destabilize the nuclear-armed Muslim nation of 170 million people. Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shujaa Pasha, formerly head of military operations, has been appointed Director-General of the ISI, replacing Lieutenant-General Nadeem Taj. Often referred to by critics as a "state within a state," the ISI is feared by neighboring Afghanistan and India, as well as Pakistan's civilian politicians whose governments have been overthrown by military coups. The ISI helped the United States eliminate hundreds of al Qaeda fighters in the years since the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, but U.S. officials have been concerned about diminishing returns from the alliance. U.S. fears some ISI agents might be playing a double-game supporting Islamist militants came to a head after a suicide bomb attack outside the Indian embassy in Kabul killed 58 people in July. The New York Times reported then that U.S. officials believed Pakistani agents had tipped off Islamist militants ahead of U.S. missile strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets on Pakistani territory. After halting prior notification and increasing missile strikes, the United States went a step further in early September, carrying out a commando raid on a Pakistani village on the border with Afghanistan that provoked a storm of protest in Islamabad. The United States has privately urged Pakistan's six-month-old civilian government to exert more control over the ISI, according to officials who requested anonymity. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's government made a botched attempt to bring the agency under the ambit of the Interior Ministry in July, and backed off immediately rather than provoke a backlash within the army. While Kayani has been broadly supportive of Pakistan's return to civilian-led democracy, senior officials say he has made clear the army will look after its own affairs, while the government gets on with the business of running the state. NEW BROOM In his previous post, Pasha oversaw offensives against militants in the tribal lands bordering Afghanistan, and deployments to guard against cross-border militancy. He is expected to overhaul several sections of the ISI. "Two heads have been changed and some rapid reshuffling is expected soon, as these have been due for long time," a senior military security official, who requested anonymity, said. Taj had been ISI chief for less than a year, having been promoted to the sensitive post by former army chief Pervez Musharraf, who was forced to quit as president last month to avoid impeachment by parliament. During the past year, Kayani, who had been ISI chief until last October, has made a series of appointments to re-shuffle the top brass. Taj, who was seen as close to Musharraf, has been made commander of the Gujranwala Corps rather than sidelined. Kayani replaced four of the nine corps commanders and appointed a new chief of general staff. He promoted a former commander of Pakistan's crack commando force, the Special Services Group (SSG), to one of the most prestigious and sensitive posts. The ex-commando chief, Lieutenant-General Tahir Mahmood was appointed commander of the Rawalpindi Corps, the corps used to carry out military takeovers in nearby Islamabad.
