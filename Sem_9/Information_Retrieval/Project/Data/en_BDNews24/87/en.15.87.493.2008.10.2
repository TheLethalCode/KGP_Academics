 Baghdad, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suicide bombers struck two Shia mosques in Baghdad on Thursday as worshippers marked the end of the Ramadan fasting month, killing 12 people and wounding 31, police said. Police said a car bomber killed seven and wounded 21 at a mosque in the Zafraniya district, while an attacker on foot killed five and wounded 10 in the New Baghdad district. Both are Shia areas in the east of the capital. Police said the death toll could rise. For most of Iraq's Shia's, Thursday is the main celebration of the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of Ramadan, which Sunni Muslims already began celebrating earlier in the week. Government officials have warned that militants might launch attacks during the holiday, one of the most important in the Muslim calendar. Violence overall in Iraq is at four-year lows.
