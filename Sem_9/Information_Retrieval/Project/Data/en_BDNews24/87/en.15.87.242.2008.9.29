 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bus, train and ferry terminals have been teeming with homebound people leaving the capital ahead of Eid. The city's long haul bus stands, Kamlapur rail station and Sadarghat ferry terminal were packed to overflowing with departing holiday crowds through Sunday. At Sadarghat launch terminal, passengers were wrestling to occupy seats in launches plying 41 river routes of the country from early morning, though most of the launches were not scheduled to depart until evening. Mehedi Ahmed Rumi on his way to Barisal said most of the cabins were booked in advance, and to get any seat at all passengers were forced to turn up before 10am. By noon, it became difficult to set foot on the road in front of the terminal. Eid travellers said it was not possible to board the crowded launches even with a ticket by afternoon or evening. The whole of Sadarghat terminal has been brought under a police security cordon. Ten to twelve policemen were seen keeping guard at each of eight entry gates. Kamlapur rail station was teeming with people aiming for the 22 intercity trains that were departing Sunday and Monday, station master Jitendra Saha said. Four special Eid trains will be in operation Tuesday, while the 12 daily mail trains are operating as usual, he said. RAB personnel were deployed to boost station security for the holiday crowd. Station manager Rezaul Haq said rail passengers were served better this year than before. Tickets were sold correctly with no complaints received so far of black marketeers or of bad station management. Recently retired government official Raisuddin Ahmed said: "I'm travelling by train this Eid after many years. I've heard that train service has improved." Rail passengers rejected reports of tickets being sold on the black market, saying there were no black marketeers in sight. Most had bought their tickets in advance. bdnews24.c
