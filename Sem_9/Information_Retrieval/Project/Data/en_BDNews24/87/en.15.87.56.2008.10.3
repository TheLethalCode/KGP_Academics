 Barisal, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)  At least 30 people were injured in a clash between supporters of a BNP leader and a leader of the party's youth front Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal at Gauranadi in Barisal on Friday, a police official said. Traffic on the Dhaka-Barisal highway screeched to a stop for two hours, and scores of shops and vehicles were damaged at Gauranadi bus stand during the clash. It all started at around 10:30am when former BNP lawmaker Jahiruddin Swapan along with scores of supporters was heading for Gauranadi Press Club through the bus stand. Jubo Dal general secretary Bodiuzzaman Mintu and his supporters obstructed them, Gauranadi Police Station sub-inspector Masum Billah told bdnews24.com. Tempers got frayed, touching off a clash that went on for two hours during which brickbats were thrown. The police brought the situation under control around 12:30pm, Billah said. Of the injured people 17 were taken to Upazila health complex. "People outside of mainstream BNP who want to destroy the party have carried out the attack," Swapan told bdnews24.com: Mintu said, "When Khaleda Zia was behind bars, Swapon spoke ill of me. That's why we have resisted them today." Mintu wanted to hold a rally in the bus stand area with his supporters after the clash but failed. Swapan was led away from the place amid police cordon. Gauranadi Upazila BNP president Nure Alam Hawlader announced his resignation after the clash. "I tried to talk the two groups out of the clash. Such occurrences destroy the image of the party. But they did not listen," he told bdnews24.com "That's why I sent my resignation letter to the district BNP general secretary," Hawlader said. bdnews
