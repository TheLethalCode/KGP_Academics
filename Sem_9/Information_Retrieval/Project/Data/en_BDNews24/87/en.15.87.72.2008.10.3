<TITLE> US crisis may mean less foreign aid: Biden </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST LOUIS, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The $700 billion Wall Street bailout might force Democrat Barack Obama to reassess his promise to double foreign aid if elected president, his vice presidential running mate Sen. Joe Biden said on Thursday. "The one thing we might have to slow down is a commitment we made to double foreign assistance. We'll probably have to slow that down," Biden said during a debate with his Republican vice-presidential rival, Sarah Palin. Palin, who is running with John McCain on the Republican ticket for the November 4 election, said the financial crisis had not affected her campaign's policy agenda. "How long have I been at this, like five weeks? So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people," said Palin, the governor of Alaska. "I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either," she added.
