 Washington, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will visit India this weekend, officials said on Thursday, celebrating a foreign policy victory on a nuclear trade pact while encouraging India to buy American technology. Rice will also visit the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan, an oil-rich former Soviet republic that has maneuvered carefully between Russia and the West. She will talk to veteran Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev about security and energy issues as well as deliver a "tough" message about the importance of democratic reforms, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Human rights groups have accused Nazarbayev of tolerating no political dissent. Rice's victory lap to India celebrates Congress' approval this week of what she calls a "landmark agreement" on nuclear trade with the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, overturning a three-decade ban on U.S. nuclear trade with India. U.S. officials brush aside criticism that the deal erodes efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, emphasizing instead the importance of establishing deeper ties with a country that is a counterbalance to China's rise. The nuclear deal "bolsters our partnership with the world's largest democracy and a growing economic power," Rice, who lobbied Congress hard to pass the deal, said on Thursday. Analysts said her role as a persuader may now require urging India to let American companies like General Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric, a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp., tap into the burgeoning Indian nuclear market. "She is going to be trying to make the case that since this is going forward, India ought to consider buying American," said George Perkovich, director of the nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "But the Indians probably won't. Ultimately they will probably buy French," he said, because they may consider the French more reliable long-term suppliers. France and India signed an accord on Tuesday to cooperate on civilian nuclear technology. ENCOURAGING KAZAKHSTAN Kazakhstan, which Rice will visit after India, is destined to play the sort of influential role in Central Asia that India has played in South Asia, McCormack said. But he rejected suggestions that Washington was endorsing Nazarbayev's autocratic rule with the visit. Kazakhstan will chair Europe's main human rights watchdog, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in 2010 but human rights groups say the ex-Soviet nation has fallen short of its OSCE commitments. "We are also going to talk to them about the importance of instituting democratic reforms, instituting human rights reforms, instituting economic reforms in that country," McCormack said. Russia sees the Central Asian republic as part of its traditional sphere of interest. But Kazakhstan has tried to pursue an increasingly independent foreign policy, and Rice's visit is aimed at encouraging this independent streak, a State Department official said. "The message will be delivered just by her plane hitting the tarmac," he said. Moscow, already angry at NATO's support for Georgia after Russia's military conflict with the Caucasus state, has accused NATO of trying to poach its allies from the old Soviet Union. But Rice says the West must stand up to "bullying" from Russia. "The broader U.S. policy is going to continue to encourage those countries (in Central Asia) to have options other than Russia," said Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Analyst Martha Brill Olcott said she thought the Kazakhs would continue their fence-sitting between Russia and the West, not least of all because the Kazakhstan and Russia share a border thousands of miles long. "They have always tried to have an even-handed policy," said Olcott, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment.
