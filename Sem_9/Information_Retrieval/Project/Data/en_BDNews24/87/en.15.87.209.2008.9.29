 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) - Standard Chartered Bank CEO Osman Tarik Morad secured bail on Monday after surrendering to court in a car seizure case for which an arrest warrant had been issued against the foreign national. Morad appeared before the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court seeking bail after an arrested warrant was issued against him on Sept 22. Afroza Jamil filed the case against Morad and the bank's senior manager Zia Hasan Chowdhury on March 30. A TV station reported on Sept 21 that a Dhaka court ordered the arrest of Morad, after a client sued him for allegedly seizing her car by force. Quoting court documents, the TV report said that Afroza borrowed Tk 16,65,000 to buy a microbus and was to repay in 60 monthly instalments. She paid back Tk 7 lakh over 19 months and then missed three consecutive payments, the TV channel reported. She alleged the bank had not given any notice before seizing the microbus using "hired goons" of a debt collection agency called Credit Care. Police conducted a five-month inquiry. In the bail plea, Morad's lawyers told the court that their client was a Pakistani national, involved in activities relating to Bangladesh's economic development and policymaking in line with global markets. He is not involved with bank loan and loan recovery, the lawyers said. They also claimed that the plaintiff failed to make repayments as per the loan conditions despite repeated requests by letter. The car was seized according to the loan conditions, which the plaintiff agreed to at the time of signing the loan agreement, Morad's lawyers said. Metropolitan magistrate Saifur Rahman Siddique granted the CEO bail on payment of a Tk 5 lakh bond. Co-accused in the case Zia Hasan Chowdhury secured bail after surrendering to the same court on Sept 23. bdnew
