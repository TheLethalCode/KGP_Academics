 Dhaka. Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh is looking to a $165 million from Asian Development Bank to add 900MW to the national grid and promote renewable energy, through public-private partnership. Bangladesh will mobilise private sector funds to invest in energy infrastructure projects with the help of the ADB loan facility, the development bank said in a statement from Manila on Friday. "The Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility will catalyse private sector investments of up to $600 million to finance 15 to 20 projects, mostly in energy, adding at least 900 megawatts of power generation capacity in Bangladesh and providing electricity to about 100,000 more households through the renewable energy program" it said. ADB will provide $82 million to help finance large infrastructure projects worth more than $30 million each, $50 million to assist small and medium-sized energy projects and $33 million to promote renewable energy. Bangladesh's public investments in the infrastructure sector have remained stagnant in recent years, accounting for only 6 to 7 percent of the gross domestic product. At present, only 60 percent of urban households and 22 pecrent of rural households have electricity connections. "The facility will improve the infrastructure sector in Bangladesh through increased private sector participation, thereby promoting economic growth and reducing poverty," said Peter Marro, Senior Investment Specialist at ADB's South Asia Department. He added that private sector participation can potentially speed up the pace of infrastructure development, expand access, and deliver efficient services. The Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility is an integral part of ADB's sector strategy and complements ADB's parallel initiatives in governance, capital markets development, and promotion of public-private partnerships. It will be managed by state-owned Infrastructure Development Co Ltd (IDCOL), which will provide financing of up to 40 percent of each project and a loan repayment period of up to 20 years. Private investors are required to inject at least 20 percent equity in the projects they invest in. ADB, based in Manila, was established in 1966 and is owned by 67 members  48 from the Asia and Pacific region. In 2007, it approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and technical assistance amounting to $243 million. bdn
