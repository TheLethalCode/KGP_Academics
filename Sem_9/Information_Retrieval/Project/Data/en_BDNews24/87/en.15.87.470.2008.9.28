 Manikganj, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) - Hundreds of homebound people were stranded at Paturia Ferry Terminal Sunday as ferry movement remained suspended for stormy weather since the early hours. BIWTC sources said ferry movement on Paturia-Daulatdia river route stopped at 1am Sunday due to inclement weather. As a result hundreds of passenger buses and goods were stuck. BIWTC Daulatdia assistant manager Arpan Kumar Chanda also said a ferry travelling to Paturia from Daulatdia became stuck on a char near Daulatdia at around 4am, being buffeted by gales. The ferry was eventually recovered at around 9am and taken to Paturia but the unloading could not start until 2pm. All vessels at Paturia were delayed due to the jam. Ferry movement eventually resumed at 11am as weather improved and three landing stations became operative. But loading and unloading of transport continued to face delays and traffic remained backed up. BIWTC Aricha manager Bidyut Kumar Saha said the three landing stations were damaged by the storm, and became partially operational after repairs. "Ferry movement could not return to normalcy. The traffic pile ups continued till late afternoon as the vehicles coming to the ghat could not be taken on board vessels." Hundreds of passengers crossed the jammed area on foot and then by boat from morning. Normal launch movement resumed at 5pm. bdnews2
