<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) The recent focus on a meeting between the two former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia could have an adverse impact on the Dec 18 election, a senior Kallyan Party leader said Sunday. "The Dec 18 polls might be hampered if dialogue between the two former prime ministers gets too much attention. People are worried about this," chairman of Kallyan Party, retired major general Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, said to reporters at the party office in Mohakhali-DOHS. He urged national leaders to maintain the respectful attitude towards each other, which they have shown during Ramadan. "Kallyan Party does not believe in politics of violence. Kallyan Party has begun a new form of politics," he told party leaders and supporters at a programme earlier. The programme marked the joining of 50 new party members. "I think all of you will benefit by joining the party," Ibrahim told them. bdnews
