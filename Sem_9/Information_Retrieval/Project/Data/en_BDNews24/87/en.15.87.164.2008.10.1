 ISTANBUL, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fenerbahce and Dynamo Kiev played out a lacklustre 0-0 draw in the Champions League on Tuesday, leaving both teams with much to do to get their Group G campaigns going. Fenerbahce playmaker Alex worked to create chances up front with Daniel Guiza but the home side gave the ball away easily and Dynamo comfortably absorbed the pressure. The result piled fresh pressure on Fenerbahce's Spanish coach Luis Aragones. Last season's Champions League quarter-finalists are 10th in the domestic league. "Fenerbahce created some scoring opportunities on the pitch today. We were definitely the better team and deserved to win," Aragones told Turkish television after the game. "We were in control of the game while they played on the counter attack. What is important now is that we beat Arsenal," the former Spain coach said of his side's next test at home to the group leaders on Oct. 21. Fenerbahce, losers at Porto in their opening match, burst into life after halftime when Alex fired a shot just wide from the edge of the box in the 48th minute. A minute later Dynamo keeper Stanislav Bogush saved efforts from Guiza and Emre Belozoglu, who worked hard in midfield for the home side. Fenerbahce pressed hard for a goal in the final stages. Selcuk Sahin fired straight at the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area and Kazim Kazim shot wide with a long-range effort. But the Ukrainian side, who drew with Arsenal in their opening match, held firm in defence to remain third, a point ahead of the Turks and one behind the Portuguese champions. "Today we played a good game and succeeded in securing a point," Kiev coach Yuri Semin said. "Fenerbahce played very well. But our players created problems for them and were very successful in defence."
