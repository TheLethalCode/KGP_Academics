<TITLE> Japan PM pledges tax cuts, hits opposition in speech </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Mon Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, his eyes on a snap poll, went on the offensive Monday, pledging tax cuts, blasting the opposition for blocking policies and urging his rivals to help pass emergency economic steps. Aso also said his diplomatic priority was to strengthen ties with close ally Washington while working with China and other neighbors for regional stability, and called for extending a naval mission in support of U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan. Aso, an outspoken nationalist who took office last week after his predecessor abruptly quit, is expected to call an early general election to try to break a stalemate created by a divided parliament, where the main opposition Democratic Party and its smaller allies control the upper house and can delay bills. But Aso's new cabinet was backfooted this weekend when his transport minister quit over a series of verbal gaffes after just four days in the job, giving the opposition fresh ammunition for an election already expected to be a close fight. "The series of comments were extremely inappropriate and I apologize to the people and to those concerned," Aso said. In a harsh attack on the opposition rare in such speeches, Aso accused the Democrats of putting party interests first. "From start to finish, the Democratic Party's stance was to put political maneuvering first and the people's livelihoods second and third," Aso told the lower house. "The Democratic Party's motto is 'Politics is for the sake of protecting the people's livelihoods' ... To truly realize that aim, we must create rules to reach agreements," he said. "Is the Democratic Party prepared to do that? Or, by refusing to make decisions in this session of parliament and once again putting the people's livelihoods second, will it betray its own principles?" Opposition parties delayed a number of key bills in the last session of parliament and twice rejected the government's pick for Bank of Japan governor, leaving the seat vacant for weeks. BUDGET IN FOCUS The head of the small People's New Party, a Democratic Party ally, criticized Aso's speech for its unusually combative tone. "It sounded like he was provoking the Democratic Party ... the word came up about 10 times," Hisaoki Kamei told reporters. Aso, 68, pledged to implement temporary income tax cuts as emergency support for households struggling with an economic recession and high prices and said he would take extra steps if needed to deal with fallout from the U.S. financial crisis. He urged the opposition to help pass a 1.8 trillion yen ($17 billion) economic package to help ease the pain of high energy and food prices. "Once again, I ask the Democratic Party and other opposition parties for their cooperation in parliamentary affairs." The emergency steps, unveiled last month by Aso's predecessor Yasuo Fukuda, who quit suddenly shortly afterwards, include support for the elderly and credit guarantees for small firms But economists have said they will do little to boost growth. Analysts and domestic media have said Aso could use a refusal by opposition parties to pass the extra budget quickly as an excuse to dissolve the lower house and call a snap poll. Aso said he would put priority on economic growth ahead of efforts to rein in Japan's bulging public debt, a stance that has raised concerns among many economists. "Without economic growth there can be no fiscal reform," Aso said. "It is impossible," he said, adding he would "make efforts" to achieve a target of balancing the budget by 2012. He also pledged to eradicate public anxiety about pensions and health care for Japan's fast-aging population but stopped short of clarifying how to fund a creaking social welfare system. Most economists say a rise in the 5 percent consumption tax is inevitable, but politicians on both sides are wary of angering voters by spelling out their stance. Aso attacked the Democrats for opposing Japan's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan and questioned party leader Ichiro Ozawa's insistence on UN approval for overseas military missions. A law to extend the naval refueling mission expires in January. The government was forced to halt the operation for three months starting late last year due to opposition stalling. "The exit from the fight against terrorism is by no means in sight," Aso said. "At this time, Japan as a member of international society does not have the option to withdraw from such activities," he said. "Democratic Party, even so, do you think that is OK? I ask your views.
