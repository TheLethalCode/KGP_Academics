<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20(bdnews24.com) - Awami League's Suranjit Sengupta sees the High Court's refusal on Monday to grant party chief Sheikh Hasina bail in the Noor Ali extortion case as 'not a good sign'. "Allow Sheikh Hasina to return home or we will be forced to take to the streets. Don't drive us to the streets," the member of the AL's policymaking presidium said to the government policymakers. Speaking at a discussion on the occasion of Hasina's 62nd birth anniversary at the party's headquarters on the Bangabandhu Avenue, he also demanded withdrawal of all the cases against the former prime minister. His presidium colleague Amir Hossain Amu said, "A party is making conspiring sensing that Awami League is set to go to office. They were behind the Jan. 11 events. Now they have started conspiring over elections." "There will be disaster if elections are foiled." Suranjit claimed BNP has unveiled five-point charter of demands to make general elections uncertain. Asserting that the elections should be held on Dec. 18, as scheduled, he said, "There is no alternative to elections. So, elections have to be held." Motia Chowdhury, another party policymaker, said, "Doubts about the polls are yet to disappear although the schedule for the national polls has been declared." bdnew
