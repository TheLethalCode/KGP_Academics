 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com) - The contaminant melamine has been detected in the banned milk powder brand Yashli -1 imported from China, the director general of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution said Tuesday. Md Ajmal Hossain told bdnews24.com: "A melamine content of 72.77 mg per kg has been found in the Chinese Yashli-1 brand milk powder. There has been no melamine found so far in the other two banned Chinese brands." The BSTI chief said samples of Yashli-1, Yashili-2 and Sweet Baby-2 formula were being tested at three laboratoriesBSTI's own, Dhaka University's department of chemistry and private laboratory Plasma Plus in Uttara. Of the three, Plasma Plus had reported back so far with positive melamine content in Yashli-1, Hossain said. "The report has been sent to the laboratory of Bangladesh Scientific and Industrial Research Council for further confirmation," he said, adding that BSIRC has the most dependable reputation. "BSTI and DU's chemistry lab will report to the institution following the opening of their offices that are closed for Eid." "Then, steps will be taken in a body in the matter," said the BSTI head. "These three brands have already been banned from import and sale in Bangladesh," he said. The government banned the three brands in the wake of the Chinese milk scare, though at least two Bangladeshi firms were found marketing the milk products without BSTI approval and mobile courts have seized tins in open markets over recent days. The government said Chinese authorities had earlier informed Bangladesh of the existence of harmful substances in the products of the two companies Sun Care and Yashli, who manufacture 'Sweet Baby' and 'Yashli-1' and 'Yashli-2' milk powders. On Monday, an adviser announced that the government would increase jail terms and fines in a bid to prevent the import and sale of substandard baby milk formulas. The government is amending The Breast Milk Substitute (Regulation of Marketing) Ordinance 1984, to raise fines and lengthen prison sentences, food and health affairs adviser MM Shawkat Ali told a press conference at the ministry of health. "The Institute of Public Health and Nutrition has finalised the ordinance. It will be presented to the advisory council for approval soon after its approval from ministry of law," Shawkat said. The press conference was held in order to review the latest situation resulting from government steps in the wake of China's melamine-adulterated milk scare. bdnews24
