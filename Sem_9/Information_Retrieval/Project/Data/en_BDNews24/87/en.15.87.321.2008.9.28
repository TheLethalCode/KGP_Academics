 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com) League leaders Sheikh Russel KC and bottom-placed Muktijoddha Sangsad were fined Tk 10,000 each under the B. League bylaws. The League committee asked both the clubs to pay the fines immediately. In a bid to show the fair play spirit on the pitch, a new clause inserted in the league bylaw is that a team will be penalised if its four players in a match are booked and Sheikh Russel became the first team to be fined as their four players were booked against Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club on Sept 21. Besides, Muktijoddha Sangsad also were fined for the same reason as they committed the similar offense during their last match against Arambagh Krira Sangha on Sept 26. Meanwhile, Muktijoddha Sangsad facing financial crisis on Saturday applied for the payment of the remaining portion of the appearance money before the Eid-ul-Fitr. Before the start of the B. League on Sept 13, the BFF disbursed Tk 3 lakh to each of 11 participating clubs and the remaining money is scheduled for distribution next month, said B. League manager Abu Nayeem Shohag Sunday.
