 LONDON, Mon Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks tumbled on Monday, led by sharp falls in Europe as three European banks became the latest casualties of spreading credit strife, forcing partial nationalizations and overshadowing Washington's bailout plan. The euro fell nearly 2 percent at one point while the dollar and safe-haven government bonds surged as the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments rescued financial firm Fortis over the weekend to prevent a domino-like spread of failure. The UK government said lender Bradford & Bingley's branch network would be sold to Spanish bank Santander with the remainder of the group nationalised. Moreover, Iceland's government bought a 75 percent stake to take control of Glitnir after the bank's funding position deteriorated in recent days, knocking the crown currency to record lows against the euro. German lender Hypo Real Estate struck a last-minute deal with the government and a consortium of banks to resolve a refinancing squeeze. MSCI main world equity index fell 2 percent to its weakest in more than a week. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 3 percent, while a measure of banking stocks lost 5.8 percent. "The nationalizations have an incredibly negative read across the sector," said Mark Sartori, head of European sales trading at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. "The contagion is spreading to mainland Europe and everyone's asking: who's next?" The money market remained frozen with banks refusing to lend to one another for all but the shortest periods, prompting central banks in Europe and Asia to pump in more cash. U.S. lawmakers were due to vote later on Monday on a $700 billion toxic debt fund after more than a week of negotiations. "One sees now, that not only American but also European banks are affected and that the crisis is after all global," said Carsten Klude, strategist at MM Warburg. "A rescue plan worth 700 billion is simply not enough to overcome the crisis for the foreseeable future. If anything, all the real economy problems will escalate as a result in the foreseeable future." The December U.S. S&P 500 future was down 1.6 percent, reversing initial gains on news the bailout plan was set for a vote in the House of Representatives. EUROPEAN CURRENCIES UNDER PRESSURE Currency markets also felt the pinch of banking sector contagion, with the euro falling more 2 percent to a 10-day low of $1.4301. In addition, sterling dropped more than 2 percent to $1.7962, heading for its steepest one-day loss since mid-1993. The Icelandic crown lost more than 3 percent to hit an all-time low of 143.27 against the euro while it lost over 5 percent against the dollar to a six-year trough. As European currencies fell broadly, the dollar rose 1.2 percent against a basket of six major currencies. December Bund futures were 90 ticks higher, drawing in safe-haven demand. Highlighting escalating tensions in the money market, the interbank cost of borrowing euros for three months rose to all-time highs of 5.2250 percent at the London fixing, more than 100 basis points above expected interest rates. The closely-watched TED spread, or the difference between these market-based dollar rates and three-month US government borrowing rates, fluctuated in a wide range of around 280 to 440 basis points. Emerging sovereign spreads widened 3 basis points while emerging stocks lost 2.6 percent. US light crude fell 3.7 percent, reflecting growing concerns over energy demand as the financial crisis spread further to Europe. Gold ticked higher to $883.65 an ounce
