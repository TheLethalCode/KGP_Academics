<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped off-spinner Graeme Swann, batsman Owais Shah and wicketkeeper Matt Prior were named on Monday in England's 15-man squad to play two tests in India in December. Kevin Pietersen's first full series as test captain since taking over from Michael Vaughan during this year's home series against South Africa begins with the first test at Ahmedabad on Dec. 11 with the second at Mumbai starting on Dec. 19. England have already named a separate squad for the seven-match one-day series in India starting on Nov. 14. Shah, who has been preferred to Ravi Bopara, and Prior have been recalled to the test side after outstanding performances in the 4-0 one-day series win over South Africa this year under Pietersen. "Our decision to pick Owais Shah was based on the fact that he is an excellent player of spin who played a superb innings in India on his test debut two years ago," national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement. "Matt Prior has enjoyed an impressive domestic season with Sussex and, having re-established himself in the England one-day side, he will now compete with Tim Ambrose for the position of test wicketkeeper. "The inclusion of Graeme Swann as off-spinner provides us with a right-arm/left-arm slow bowling combination which we believe can be effective in India. "Graeme has bowled well in tandem with Monty Panesar when they were at Northamptonshire together and he will be keen to renew the partnership this winter." Miller said last week that Vaughan, who was awarded a central contract three weeks ago, would not be included because of his poor form. According to a British newspaper report, Vaughan plans to play grade cricket in Australia in a bid to find some form and push for selection for the tour of the West Indies starting in January
