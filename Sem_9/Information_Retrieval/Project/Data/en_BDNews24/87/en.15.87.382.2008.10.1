<TITLE> Wasteful Bayern held to 1-1 draw with Lyon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich put a nervous first-half display behind them to claim a 1-1 draw at home to Olympique Lyon in Champions League Group F on Tuesday. Bayern, facing trouble on the domestic front after two successive Bundesliga defeats, gifted Lyon the lead when Martin Demichelis headed a Juninho free kick back past his own goalkeeper in the 25th minute. The German champions had Franck Ribery back from his ankle injury and the Frenchman caused plenty of problems. After several near misses they got the equaliser they deserved when Ze Roberto arrived late in the penalty area to head home a Miroslav Klose cross shortly after the break. Bayern remain top of the group with four points from two games, followed by Lyon and Fiorentina on two and Steaua Bucharest on one. "We had enough chances to win the game," Bayern coach Juergen Klinsmann told reporters. "We would have loved three points instead of one but I think we're still well placed in Europe." The return of Ribery for his first start of the campaign gave Bayern just the sort of unpredictable threat they have lacked in Klinsmann's first season as a club coach. Ribery looked a constant danger as he buzzed around the Lyon penalty area but, sadly for Bayern, the forwards could not provide the finishing touch, with Luca Toni twice missing when through on goal after Lyon had taken the lead. Ze Roberto finally provided the cool head they needed for a nicely worked equaliser but despite regular chances none of the forwards could match his poise. Lyon were doing well just to hold on yet they very nearly snatched a winner, with Karim Benzema failing to get a shot on target after Philipp Lahm's mistake had given him a great chance five minutes before the end
