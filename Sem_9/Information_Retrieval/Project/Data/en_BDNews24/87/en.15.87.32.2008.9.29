 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has sought a $554 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank for four separate power and energy projects. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters Monday that he handed the proposal to IDB president Ahmed Mohammad Ali in Jeddah the previous week. The adviser said $96 million was being sought to set up a 150 MW power plant at Bhola, $191 million for upgrading Eastern Refinery, $90 million dollars for deep sea petroleum extraction, and $177 million for the second phase of the Teesta barrage. He said the IDB president was also handed a proposal to increase the bank's annual $1 billion crude-oil purchase loan to Bangladesh and lower the rate of interest on the amount. Mirza Aziz said the IDB president had shown positive reaction to the proposals. "The IDB president has said they want to further expand their projects in Bangladesh." Questioned about the decision to raise the price of power by 16 per cent for bulk consumers from Oct 1, the finance adviser said: "The Power Development Board is now forced to give high subsidies." "So there is a need to increase the price." He also said that by the end of the current year 350MW would be added to the national grid. On Sept 13, the finance adviser told reporters the government was considering lowering fuel prices in the background of falling oil prices in the global market. Asked about this, he said: "I do not know how far the energy regulatory commission has gone in this regard." Asked about the state of the economy in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, Mirza Aziz said: "I see no sign of any distress during the period." bdnew
