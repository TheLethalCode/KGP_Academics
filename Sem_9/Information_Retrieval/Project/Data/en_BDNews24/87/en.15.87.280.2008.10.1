 ST PETERSBURG, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid scored twice in the first half to defeat a spirited Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 on their home Champions League debut on Tuesday. An own goal by Zenit defender Tomas Hubocan and an opportunistic strike by Ruud van Nistlerooy gave nine-times European champions Real their second consecutive victory in Group H. Portugal international Danny, Zenit's record 30 million euro signing from Dynamo Moscow last month, was on target for the Russian champions midway through the first half but the home side wasted numerous chances after the break. The UEFA Cup holders, making their Champions League debut this season, are still looking for their first points in the competition after going down 1-0 at Juventus in their opener two weeks ago. The Spanish champions wasted little time to make their intentions clear, Gonzalo Higuain testing Vyacheslav Malafeyev with a powerful header which the keeper tipped over in the third minute. Less than a minute later the visitors broke through when Hubocan inadvertently redirected a Rafael van der Vaart low cross from the right into his own goal. After settling their initial nerves, Zenit began forays into Real territory with the inspirational Andrei Arshavin leading the fightback. The Russia playmaker had a good chance for an equaliser midway through the first half but fired straight at Real keeper Iker Casillas. DANNY EQUALISER Arshavin then set up the equaliser by crossing for Danny, getting in front of his marker, to volley home in the 25th minute. The home side pressed for more but another defensive breakdown by Zenit allowed van Nistlerooy to pounce on a loose ball and beat Malafeyev with a low shot into the far corner on 31 minutes. Hubocan could have made amends for his earlier blunder late in the first half but his point-blank header was cleared off the line by the Real defence. Zenit threw everything forward in the second half but once again poor finishing cost the Russians at least a point. Arshavin wasted their best chance with less than 10 minutes remaining when his low drive hit the far post. Arshavin was left to rue missed opportunities. "We have only ourselves to blame," he told Russian television. "We had so many chances but couldn't put them away while Real made them count. I don't want to put everything down to luck, probably their bigger class made the difference tonight.
