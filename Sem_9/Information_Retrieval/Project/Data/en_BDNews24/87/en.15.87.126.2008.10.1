 AALBORG, Denmark, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New signing Dimitar Berbatov scored twice to lead holders Manchester United to a comfortable 3-0 victory over AaB Aalborg in Group E of the Champions League on Tuesday. United lead the group with four points, ahead of Villarreal on goal difference after the Spanish side beat Celtic 1-0. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring for the visitors in the 22nd minute after Ryan Giggs threaded a pass through the Danish champions' defence to launch the England striker clear in the penalty area. Berbatov blasted home his first goal as a United player in the 55th minute after a poor touch by Thomas Augustinussen gifted him the ball on the edge of the box. The Bulgarian, who joined United from Tottenham Hotspur earlier this season for 30.75 million pounds ($55.69 million), doubled his tally in the 79th minute with a beautiful sideways scissors kick after a cross from Cristiano Ronaldo. "He's joined the club for the money he's joined, so it's always an issue getting that first goal," United manager Alex Ferguson said told Danish television. "Now that he's got it, he's on his way. His second goal was taken very well, a real goal scorer's goal." Berbatov came close to a hat-trick, but he volleyed wide in the sixth minute when the ball found him alone in the box after Ronaldo blocked a clearance by Aalborg keeper Karim Zaza. UNITED IN CHARGE United controlled the match, with right back Rafael making frequent dangerous raids into Aalborg territory to set up chance after chance for the holders. Zaza prevented a more embarrassing defeat for Aalborg with several good saves. In the 33rd minute, he managed to punch away a powerful shot from Ronaldo even after it had been deflected by a defender. Ronaldo had another golden chance to score in the 85th minute, but he shot wide when he found himself alone with Zaza after a quick counter-attack. "We missed a few chances, but before the game if you'd said 3-0 we would've taken it," said Giggs. "We created a lot of chances and could've scored more, so perhaps that's disappointing but we've got our first victory. If we play to our ability we can go all the way." Aalborg, who held Celtic to a goalless draw in Glasgow in their first match, tried to counter with speedy attacks on the flanks and long range shots. They suffered from poor finishing and managed only one shot on target to United's nine. "The second goal was the one that really damaged us," Aalborg manager Bruce Rioch said. "The ball bounced off our skipper's ankle and Berbatov finished it with a fantastic goal.
