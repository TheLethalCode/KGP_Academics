 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud Pilot has retired from international cricket as Bangladesh Cricket Board accepted a letter from the former Bangladesh captain on Sunday. BCB officials met with the country's most successful wicketkeeper, and accepted his decision to retire with considerable regret, a BCB press release said. "I intend to retire from all forms (Tests, ODIs & T20 Internationals) of international cricket with immediate effect," Pilot stated in the letter submitted to BCB on Thursday. "I have made this decision after a lot of soul searching and this is a very emotional moment for me," the 32-year-old keeper wrote. However, Pilot will be seen playing in local first class cricket for Rajshahi Division. Pilot was an automatic choice for the national Test squad when Bangladesh earned the status in 2000, playing 44 Tests before his last game in June 2007 against Sri Lanka in Colombo. He scored 1,409 Test runs playing 84 innings with an average of 19.04 runs. Despite having performed well in the last national league, Pilot was ignored when the selectors announced a Test squad for the home series against South Africa earlier this year, apparently hinting that Pilot's international career was over. For his contribution for to the national team, cricket pundits suggested Pilot be given a chance for an official announcement of retirement through an international match, but the Board did not agree. The right-handed middle order batsman was also a key member of the national ODI squad, scoring 1,818 runs in 126 matches with an average of 21.90 runs, but he was dropped from the one-day squad during the World Cup in the West Indies last year. He played his last one-day game against Zimbabwe at home in December 2006 after debuting against India in Sharjah in 1995. "For the last 13 years I have tried to serve the country to the best of my ability and I thank the Board for putting faith in my capabilities as a player and captain. "I would also like to thank all the cricketers I have been privileged enough to have as teammates, coaches and officials for their support during my career as a Bangladesh player. It has been an honour to play for Bangladesh," Pilot wrote. The Board's statement read: "The BCB gratefully acknowledges Mashud's immense contribution to the National Team for over a decade and is heartened by the fact that he has offered his unconditional commitment to Bangladesh cricket and the cause of the game's development in this country." bd
