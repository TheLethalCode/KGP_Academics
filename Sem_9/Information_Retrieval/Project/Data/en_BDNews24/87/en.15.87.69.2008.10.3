 PARIS, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patrick Vieira and Franck Ribery were recalled to the France squad on Thursday for a World Cup qualifier in Romania after recovering from long-term injuries. The 22-man squad does not include Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri, who has just recovered from a knee injury. "Samir is back playing but he is still not fully fit," coach Raymond Domenech told reporters. Vieira and Ribery missed France's first two World Cup qualifiers in September, a 3-1 defeat in Austria and a 2-1 win over Serbia in Paris. Former captain Vieira suffered a thigh injury in late May and did not play at Euro 2008 because of the injury, although he was in the squad. "We all know how important Patrick is. He is one of the best midfielders in Europe. When he plays at his best, he is indispensable to us," Domenech said. The inspirational Ribery left the pitch because of an ankle injury in the early minutes of France's last game in Switzerland in June, a 2-0 defeat by Italy that sent them packing after the group stage. Ribery made it back into Bayern Munich's starting lineup only during Tuesday's 1-1 home draw against Olympique Lyon in the Champions League. He was taken off eight minutes from time. "We saw he still had his speed although he cannot play a full game yet," Domenech said. Domenech, who was confirmed as France coach in July despite the team's first-round exit at the Euro 2008 finals, needs a good result in the Group 7 match on Oct. 11 in Constanta to make sure of keeping his job. "It is never an easy task to qualify (for a major tournament), especially when you are building a new team," he said. "After our visit to Romania, everything will still be possible." Squad: Goalkeepers: Steve Mandanda (Olympique Marseille), Hugo Lloris (Olympique Lyon) Defenders: William Gallas (Arsenal), Philippe Mexes (AS Roma), Eric Abidal (Barcelona), Patrice Evra (Manchester United), Bakary Sagna (Arsenal), Gael Clichy (Arsenal), Rod Fanni (Stade Rennais), Sebastien Squillaci (Sevilla) Midfielders: Patrick Vieira (Inter Milan), Jeremy Toulalan (Olympique Lyon), Alou Diarra (Girondins Bordeaux), Lassana Diarra (Portsmouth) Forwards: Thierry Henry (Barcelona), Karim Benzema (Olympique Lyon), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich), Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea), Yoann Gourcuff (Girondins Bordeaux), Florent Malouda (Chelsea), Florent Sinama-Pongolle (Atletico Madrid), Hatem Ben Arfa (Olympique Marseille)
