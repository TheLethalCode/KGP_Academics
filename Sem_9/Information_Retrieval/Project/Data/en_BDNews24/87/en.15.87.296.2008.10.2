 Dhaka, 2 Oct (bdnews24.com)  Three courts heard 31 cases including 15 bail prayers on Thursday, the day of Eid ul-Fitr as law stipulates that the accused persons must be produced before the court within 24 hours of arrest. Magistrates Konika Biswas, Moazzem Hossain, Kamrunnahar of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka conducted the court activities. Thirty persons, arrested on charges varying from pilfering, robbery, cheating, forgery, storage of drugs in the city, were put on the dock on the Eid day. The courts refused them bail and ordered them into jail. Advocate ASM Fazle Rabbi Khan, who stood for accused Inam Hossain from Cox's Bazar, alleged that the court had not granted his client a deserved bail in the case even on the Eid day. He said the court had not heard his arguments well, either. Egyptian Salam Mohammad Abbas was taken to the court in a case for staying around four years without passport.Judicial magistrate Konika Biswas set October 5 for next hearing. Three accused in two cases did not appeal for bail. Rahima, wife of accused Angur Ali, a CNG-van driver facing charges for possession of illegal drugs, was crying in front of the judge Kamrunnahar's court. "The case filed against my husband is false. My husband does not drink, even he does not do drugs. The van owner has appointed a lawyer but he does not come to the court. I cannot celebrate Eid this year," Rahima said. bd
