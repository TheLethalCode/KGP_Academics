 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com education correspondent Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The University Grants Commission has recommended a hike in tuition fees by public universities to let the students access quality education that comes at a cost. The commission made the recommendation in its latest report to be published next month and submitted to the government. "Work is going to publish the report next month," UGC chairman Prof Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com The report, however, calls for care to make sure the meritorious and poor students are not denied access to education. It suggests the government and the universities sit to fix to the increase in tuition fees. Income generation by the universities and financial austerity have been stressed. It says a committee led by the treasurer may be formed to monitor the expenses and accounts of the universities following the financial policies and budgets. It also recommends limiting the expenditure heads of the public universities to allotted budget and cutting costs on transport, power, telephone and other utilities. Accent was put on a prudent approach to appointment, promotions and financial benefits for the staff in the public universities that being autonomous bodies often make decisions without weighing the consequences. The report suggests a curb on opening new departments and appointing teachers without prior permission of the commission. bdne
