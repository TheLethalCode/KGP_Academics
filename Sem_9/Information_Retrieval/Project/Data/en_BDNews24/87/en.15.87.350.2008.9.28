 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Durham became England's County cricket champions for the first time on Saturday after dismissing Kent before lunch and then seeing Nottinghamshire lose to Hampshire at Trent Bridge. Durham, who were admitted to the competition in 1992, finished the 16-match season with 190 points, ahead of Nottinghamshire (182) and Hampshire (178). They held their nerve going into the last match as Nottinghamshire also had a chance of taking the title. Starting the day needing five Kent wickets, Durham were inspired by a career best seven for 88 from Callum Thorp and recalled England paceman Steve Harmison, who despite bowling with a cast on his left wrist took the last three wickets. Durham's innings and 71-run victory clinched them the title after Hampshire beat Notts by 203 runs. Cruelly, Kent's home defeat meant they were relegated for the first time since the two-division championship arrived in 2001. Kent went down and will accompany Surrey in the second division next season. Warwickshire and Worcestershire were promoted from Division Two
