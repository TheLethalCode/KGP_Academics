 Tony Munroe and Kevin Krolicki HONG KONG/WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (bdnews24.comReuters) - A darkening economic outlook fueled by the global credit crisis dragged Asian shares down on Friday and added pressure for the US Congress to approve a $700 billion financial industry bailout package later in the day. Worries grew that even if Washington agrees on the massive rescue package, it will not be enough to resolve deeper-rooted weakness as new data showed that a U.S. recession is nearing and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Europe's economy was worsening. Stocks in Tokyo dropped 1.5 percent while elsewhere in Asia they were off by 1.1 percent, despite optimism among U.S. House Democratic leaders that legislation to mop up illiquid bank assets would win approval. "Investors expect the U.S. House to approve the bailout, but even if that happens, it would have a neutral impact on the market as its effectiveness is still questionable," said Takahito Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in Tokyo. U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill to help rescue Wall Street will be sent to the floor of the House on Friday for debate and then put to a vote. Earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not schedule the floor debate until she thought there were enough votes in hand to pass it. On Monday, the House unexpectedly rejected a previous version of the bailout package, sending markets into a tailspin. Wall Street endured a dismal day on Thursday, as stocks dropped 4 percent and a seizing up in money markets drove a rally in the dollar. Latin American stocks and currencies tumbled on worries about the credit crisis and economic slowdown.
