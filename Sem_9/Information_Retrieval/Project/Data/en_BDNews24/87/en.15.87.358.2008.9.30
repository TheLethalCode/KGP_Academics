 Tangail, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)North-bound holidaymakers suffered long hours in a massive overnight tailback on the Tangail bypass to the Jamuna Bridge on Tuesday. Traffic movement resumed gradually at around 11am after a crashed bus was cleared off the road. bdnews24.com correspondent Golam Mortoza Antu said from the spot Tuesday morning that an overloaded passenger bus from Panchagarh had overturned on the bypass after losing control Monday night. The crashed bus held up hundreds of buses and cars loaded with vacationers in both directions throughout the night. Those who had been fasting through the month of Ramadan were unable to take early morning sehri being stuck on the highway without food or water. Eid gridlock between Chandra to Bishmail also affected north-bound motorists leaving the capital by the Ashulia highway. bdnews24.com/
