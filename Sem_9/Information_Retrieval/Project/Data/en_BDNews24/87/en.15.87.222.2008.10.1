 FLORENCE, Italy, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steaua Bucharest defended strongly to secure a 0-0 draw at Fiorentina for their first point in Champions League Group F match on Tuesday. The result leaves the Italian team level on two points with Olympique Lyon, who drew 1-1 away to group leaders Bayern Munich, who have four points, with the Romanian side bottom after two games. It was a poor match with many mistakes in midfield and both teams failing to build dangerous attacks, even if Fiorentina dominated for longer periods. "It was a good result which maintained our chances of qualifying," said Steaua coach Marius Lacatus, who played for Fiorentina in the 1990s. "I leave Florence with the regret that we failed to win, because we deserved it." Fiorentina's Romanian striker Adrian Mutu, who was kept on a tight rein for the most part, blazed the first opening over the bar and then a close-range shot from Alberto Gilardino was blocked by Steaua's Colombian goalkeeper Robinson Zapata. Steaua replied with a quick counter-attack putting striker Antonio Semedo through in a one-on-one situation with keeper Sebastian Frey but the Portuguese missed the target by inches. Mutu's freekick from distance flew narrowly wide after the break and the striker missed again from a narrow angle minutes later when his header went into the side netting. "Steaua defended very well, but both teams could have won," Mutu said. "This is a very tight group, anyone could qualify." Fiorentina launched a sustained assault in the final 10 minutes but Steaua's defence held firm. "This match showed that we can afford to be more adventurous in this group," said Steaua's central defender Dorin Goian
