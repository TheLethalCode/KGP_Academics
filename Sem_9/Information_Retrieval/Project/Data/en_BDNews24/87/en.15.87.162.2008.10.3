 MUMBAI, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia leg spinner Bryce McGain has been ruled out of the four-test series in India with a shoulder injury and will return home, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement on Friday. The 36-year-old failed to recover from the injury he suffered during last month's Australia A tour of India, dealing a blow to the tourists' inexperienced spin attack. "A decision on a potential replacement player for McGain would be taken in due course," the statement said. McGain had been included in the absence of seasoned spinners. Off-break bowler Jason Krejza is the other specialist spinner in the squad. The first test starts in Bangalore on Oct. 9
