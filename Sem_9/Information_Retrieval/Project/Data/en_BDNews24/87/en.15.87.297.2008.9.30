<TITLE> Asia reels over shock bailout failure </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tony Munroe HONG KONG, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Panic gripped markets after U.S. lawmakers unexpectedly rejected a $700 billion bailout plan for the financial industry, as Asian stocks tumbled on opening after Wall Street's biggest fall since the crash of 1987. A week that started badly with the rescue of three banks in Europe followed by the distressed sale of big U.S. lender Wachovia to Citigroup got worse after the U.S. Congress was unable to agree on a rescue package. Stocks in Asia dropped roughly 4 percent on Tuesday amid mounting fears about the health of the global economy, with China's two biggest banks opening more than 8 percent lower. Uncertainty about what comes next, and whether Washington can come up with compromise legislation to relieve the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression before adjourning ahead of the November 4 elections sent investors into safe-haven gold and Treasuries. Oil fell on fears of further economic slowdown. "It's hard to imagine what's going to happen. It's kind of scary," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities in Tokyo. "In particular, European banks were putting up a front that nothing was wrong, but now they're falling one after another." Investors worried that the collapse in financial markets would tip the United States economy into a painful recession that brings the rest of the world with it. "We do not rule out a U.S. recession being deep and long and having a severe global impact," said Gerard Lyons, chief economist and group head of global research at Standard Chartered in London.
