 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan was admitted on Monday to National Heart Foundation after meeting with chief election commissioner over the DemocracyWatch issue. "My father was having irregular heart beats on our way to Sirajganj to enjoy Eid-ul-Fitr and he was brought to Heart Foundation," son Anik Islam said to bdnews24.com. "He has been kept in the coronary care unit. The doctors say nothing can be said before 24 hours." The BNP leader was admitted to Heart Foundation in the first week of this month for the same complaint and stayed there for a few days. Earlier in the day, Nazrul saw ATM Shamsul Huda, the chief election commissioner. "I came to meet the chief election commissioner to tell him that the commission should not drop DemocracyWatch from the election observers list," he later said to reporters. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia recently went to journalist Shafik Rehman's house to hold a meeting of the four-party alliance. She was received there by his wife chairperson of DemocracyWatch Taleya Rahman, kicking up controversy over the role of DemocracyWatch, which had monitored polls in the past "Khaleda Zia went to that house due to personal relationship with them. There is no relation between BNP and DemocracyWatch. I met the chief election commissioner to clarify the matter," Nazrul said. bdne
