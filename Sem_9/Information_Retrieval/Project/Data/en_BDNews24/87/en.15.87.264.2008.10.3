Ballack was among the senior players to miss Germany's first two Group Four matchesa 6-0 win away to Liechtenstein and a 3-3 draw away to Finland. The 32-year-old captain has recovered from his foot injury and is back along with his preferred central midfield partner Frings, who missed last month's games with a broken nose. Centre back Mertesacker and full back Arne Friedrich also return from injury. Missing from the squad for the games against Russia in Dortmund on Oct. 11 and Wales in Moenchengladbach on Oct. 15 is the Real Madrid centre back Christoph Metzelder.
