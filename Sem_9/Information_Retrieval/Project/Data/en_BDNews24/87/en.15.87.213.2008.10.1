 TOKYO, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Large Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first in five years and prepared to tighten capital spending budgets as a financial crisis swept through crumbling export markets, a Bank of Japan survey showed on Wednesday. The tankan survey's index of big manufacturers' sentiment has turned negative around the time Japan entered its last two recessions, and the minus 3 reading in the September survey suggested the world's second-largest economy is again in recession. Economists had forecast the index would fall to minus 2 from plus 5 in June. The tankan also showed the upheaval on Wall Street was stifling global economic growth, although analysts said many firms may have responded to the survey before investment bank Lehman collapsed on Sept. 15, shattering confidence in the world's financial system. "I'd say the figures probably factor in half of the credit crisis," said Soichi Okuda, chief economist at Sumitomo Shoji Research. "The outlook index shows a minor deterioration in sentiment in December, but that may prove too optimistic." EXPORT MARKETS The Lehman bankruptcy heralded the grimmest phase so far of the 13-month-old credit crisis triggered by US mortgage defaults. Since then, bank failures and nationalisations in the United States and Europe have shaken confidence among consumers and businesses around the world. Japanese exporters are facing their weakest markets in decades. In August the country posted its first trade deficit for any month since 1982, excluding the traditional export slowdown every January. Exports to the United States recorded their sharpest ever decline. Exports and capital spending were the main drivers of Japan's longest postwar economic expansion, which appears to have ended with a contraction in the second quarter. "The data confirmed the widely held view that the Japanese economy is already in recession," said Okuda of Sumitomo Shoji. The big manufacturers index has now fallen for four quarters and is at its lowest since June 2003, when Japan was emerging from the last recession caused by the collapse of a bubble in technology stocks. The gauge has turned negative roughly at the start of the last two recessions -- June 1997-January 1999, and December 2000-January 2002. In Japan a recession officially begins when growth starts to slow. A more widely used definition is two quarters of economic contraction. Big manufacturers in the tankan forecast the index for December at minus 4, suggesting they expected conditions to worsen over the next three months. "Such business sentiment reflects weakness of the economy and uncertainty over the outlook," Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura told a news conference. "We need to monitor developments carefully." CAPITAL SPENDING Companies responded to the bleak outlook by cutting back on capital spending. Big firms plan to raise capital spending by 1.7 percent in the year to March, compared with a 2.4 percent rise forecast three months ago. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2.5 percent rise in investment budgets. "The most alarming aspect is the relatively weak reading for capital spending plans," said Naoki Iizuka, a senior economist at Mizuho Securities. "Previously, it was widely expected that the current downturn in the economy would be short and not severe, but the tankan's capex reading throws cold water on that view." The tankan, meaning short-term economic outlook, also showed big firms expect recurring profits to fall 9.4 percent this fiscal year. In June they had predicted a 7 percent fall. The sentiment index for big service-sector firms stood at plus 1, down from plus 10 three months ago and below economists' forecast of plus 5. They also expect conditions to worsen over the next three months. In a sign that worsening business conditions are spreading to households amid high fuel and food prices, separate government data showed wage earners' total cash earnings and overtime pay both fell in August from a year earlier. The sentiment index for financial institutions fell to its lowest since comparable data started in December 2003, a reflection of the global financial turmoil. The tankan index is made up from the percentage of firms reporting a favourable business environment minus those reporting unfavourable conditions. Financial markets showed little reaction to the tankan. The Nikkei average .N225 climbed after a Wall Street surge on hopes that Washington will revive a plan to bail out the US financial sector. The government has effectively acknowledged that Japan is in recession, ending a growth cycle that began in early 2002
