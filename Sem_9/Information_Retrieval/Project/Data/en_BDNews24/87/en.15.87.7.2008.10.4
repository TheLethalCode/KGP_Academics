<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said there is no room for doubt now, following the chief adviser's address to the United Nations, over national elections in December, adding that the election would be credible even without participation of the two top leaders. Speaking to reporters at Bogra on Saturday en route to Rangpur, Ershad said: "A country cannot remain in the hands of an unelected government for long." Asked whether a national election would be accepted at home and abroad without the participation of Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, Ershad said: "Why should it not be accepted? The country is not owned by anybody." "An election can be held without [the two leaders] and still have acceptability". He said Jatiya Party would have its own manifesto, though it would go to elections under the 'grand alliance' headed by the Awami League. "We are in the grand alliance, we will remain there." On the seat distribution among the alliance parties, he said a final decision would be taken on Sheikh Hasina's return from abroad. Asked if he was invited to join the alliance led by BNP, Ershad said there was no possibility of JP joining the four-party alliance. Praising different reforms of the caretaker government, Ershad said: "This government has done what we could not do in the last thirty years." He cited the reform of the judiciary, Election Commission and Public Service Commission as examples. bdnews24.
