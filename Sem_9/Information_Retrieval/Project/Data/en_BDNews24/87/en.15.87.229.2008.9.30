 New Delhi, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's main stock index fell 3.3 percent at the start on Tuesday after a $700 billion US bailout plan collapsed hammering stock markets in Asia and on Wall Street, but then recouped some of the fall. By 9:58 a.m., the 30-share BSE index was down 1.96 percent at 12,349.45, with all but two components falling. It fell as low as 12,153.55, below its 2007 low of 12,316.10. Shares in No. 2 lender ICICI Bank opened 7.2 percent down at 458 rupees, extending Monday's 12.1 percent loss even as the bank said its UK unit had no exposure to subprime credit. The stock later bounced back and was down 0.7 percent at 490 rupees. The 50-share NSE index was down 1.81 percent at 3,780.30
