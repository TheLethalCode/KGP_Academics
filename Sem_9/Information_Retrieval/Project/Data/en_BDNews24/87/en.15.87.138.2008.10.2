 Agartala, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Five serial explosions rocked the northeast Indian town of Agartala on Wednesday night, killing at least four and injuring 73 others, police said. The explosions ripped through busy markets in Agartala's Maharajgunj Bazaar, GB Bazaar, Radhanagar bus stand and Lake Choumani Bazar  all within 30 minutes . "The markets were full of shoppers as the big Hindu festival of Durga Puja is only a few days away," a police official said. Two unexploded bombs were found from the town later, adding to the panic. Many of the people were injured in the stampede that followed in some of the explosion sites. It was not yet clear who was responsible for the explosions. Tripura has a history of ethnic tribal insurgency but they have rarely used explosives in crowded places and have mostly used them to target security forces. Intelligence officials say they could not rule out involvement of Islamic militants such as the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) who have been entering northeastern states regularly on their way to other Indian states. Seven HuJI militants were killed late last month in an encounter with the Indian army in the neigjhbouring state of Assam. bd
