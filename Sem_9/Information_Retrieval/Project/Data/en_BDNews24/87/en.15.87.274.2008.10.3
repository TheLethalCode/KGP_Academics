 MANCHESTER, England, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injured striker Wayne Rooney will join up with England's squad next week with the blessing of Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager said on Friday. Rooney has resumed light training after picking up an ankle injury in Tuesday's Champions League win at Aalborg but is unlikely to play against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. England's squad meet up on Monday for their World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus and the United manager expects Rooney to be involved. "I have no issues with him joining England," Ferguson told reporters. "The games they have they should cope even if Wayne was not to make next Saturday's game. "That's (England coach) Fabio Capello's call and how he progresses in the next few days but I have no problems with that." United are also without Owen Hargreaves, Michael Carrick, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes against Blackburn when Ferguson will come up against one of his old players. Former England international Paul Ince played in midfield under Ferguson before launching a managerial career which has taken him up the league ladder from Macclesfield to Blackburn via Milton Keynes Dons. "I like to see that. It shows you have the confidence to go and manage anywhere and take your chance in the game," said Ferguson, whose side have chalked up three wins in a row. "I have been impressed with Paul. He was a player who was always determined and a stubborn lad. "He was a fighter on the pitch and I think he's taken those qualities into management. They are good qualities to have, that determination to do well and I'm not surprised he's doing well.
