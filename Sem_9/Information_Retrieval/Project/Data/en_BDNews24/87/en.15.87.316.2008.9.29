 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Quader left Dhaka for New Delhi Monday morning to seek medical treatment after he was stopped flying two days before. Quader's lawyer AKM Amin Uddin told bdnews24.com that his client flew from Zia International Airport at 8:30am Monday on a Jet Airways flight. Quader and his lawyer had protested after he was stopped from flying to the Indian capital on Saturday. The AL leader was forced to return to BSMMU Hospital after being barred from boarding a Jet Airways plane. "There is no legal impediment to my travelling abroad, as reports of the medical board were submitted to the court. The home ministry had given permission for me to go abroad for treatment," Quader told reporters back at the hospital. Party official Tareque Shams Himu, who was to accompany Quader, had said: "An immigration official, after making us wait for one and half hours, told us that he (Quader) cannot travel abroad." Lawyer Amin Uddin said they had applied to the home ministry on Sept 17 seeking permission to send Quader abroad for treatment. "We were verbally informed by the ministry that he could go abroad," the lawyer had said. Quader has been suffering a number of serious ailments, including a neurological disease causing muscle wastage and weakness. He was released on bail at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital on Sep 5, where he remained for treatment. He was arrested on March 9, 2007 on graft charges. bdnews2
