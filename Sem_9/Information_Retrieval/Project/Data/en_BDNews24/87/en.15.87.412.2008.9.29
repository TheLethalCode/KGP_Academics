 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) Army chief general Moeen U Ahmed said on Monday he hoped the next elected government would settle the issue of the trial of war criminals and described the announcement of an election date as good news. The army chief spoke to reporters after a pre-Eid gathering at the Mohammadpur war-wounded freedom fighters rehabilitation centre. He distributed funds to families of 33 wounded freedom fighters for Eid. The war-wounded freedom fighters made a request for lifetime housing arrangements. The army chief assured them that he would discuss the matter with the government. He told reporters later: "The future government must take the issue of war crime trials into consideration, according to the wish of our freedom fighters."

"Action can be taken in this regard under the common law of the country. It must be decided through the legal process." b
