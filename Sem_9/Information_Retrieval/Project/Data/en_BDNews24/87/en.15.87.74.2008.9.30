<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex is set to open sharply lower on Tuesday after US lawmakers rejected a $700 billion package to end financial panic, knocking down markets in Asia and on Wall Street. Fear gripped markets as investors dumped emerging market assets, sought stability in government debt and confronted the prospect that the crisis of confidence in the bank industry will persist, further damaging the global economy. The US S&P 500 index suffered its biggest fall since 1987 stock market crash and Asian bourses fell 4 to 7 percent. The BSE Sensex should open 3 to 4 percent lower and trend downwards, traders said. "There is a problem of liquidity. There's a feeling that stocks will go further down," said Ambareesh Baliga, vice president at Karvy Stock Broking. The 30-share main BSE index fell 3.87 percent on Monday to 12,595.75, its lowest close since July 16 and its second-lowest finish this year, taking its losses in 2008 to almost 38 percent. By 0324 GMT, Japan's Nikkei was down 4.6 percent touching a three-year trough, while MSCI's measure of other Asian stocks fell 3.7 percent. Nifty futures traded in Singapore were down 3.7 percent.
