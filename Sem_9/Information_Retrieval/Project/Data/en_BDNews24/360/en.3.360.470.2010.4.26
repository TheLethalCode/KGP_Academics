 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Radical Islamists belonging to the Khatme Nabuwat Movement obstructed the burial of a Ahmadiyya on Sunday. The incident took place at Nakhalpara of Tejgaon, when a grave had been prepared for the burial at the local Rahim Metal Jame Masjid graveyard. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat followers, commonly called Ahmadiyya, are not considered proper Muslims by the Khatme Nabuwat, because of their belief that the world will see another prophet after Muhammad, by the name of Ahmed. Omar Faruk, OC of Tejgaon Industrial Police Station, told bdnews24.com the relatives of the deceased had dug a grave. But almost at the end of their work, Khatme Nabuwat supporters, including those from a madrassah adjacent to the graveyard protested against the burial. The police went to the spot upon being informed as the situation became unpleasant. After a number of incidents throughout the day, body of Akimun Nesa was buried in the graveyard of Roads and Highways at Nakhalpara under police cordon, Faruk said. Her son, Nadim Hassan, alleged that his mother's burial was also protested at the Roads and Highways graveyard. Nadim said a Khatme Nabuwat procession headed towards the burial party chanting slogans against the burial. The body was finally buried with the help of councillor of ward 38, he said. bd
