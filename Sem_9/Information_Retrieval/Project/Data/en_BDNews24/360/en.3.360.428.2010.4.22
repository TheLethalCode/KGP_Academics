Sajjad is the son of Ayub Khan of Mujdia village. Abul Kashem and his lawyer Eskandar Azam Bablu said that Rupsha was married to Sajjad in 2008. Rupsha's in-laws began to torture her for dowry soon after the marriage. She came to her father from her in-laws three months ago. A month ago she filed a case against her husband and other in-laws with the Magura judicial magistrates court. A week ago Rupsha went to her in-laws after the two families resolved the problem mutually. But they began to demand dowry and pressured her to withdraw the case.
