 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, who was hospitalised four days ago at the United Hospital, is now "doing fine". The party's presidium member, Kazi Firoz Rashid, told bdnews24.com on Thursday that Ershad was much better and will return home on Friday. He is still in the intensive care unit to keep him away from the rush of visitors, Rashid said. Ershad also instructed his party men to arrange a meeting on May 1 at the Institute of Engineers marking May Day, he added. The former president was admitted to the hospital on Sunday. Ershad had just returned from Singapore a few days before he was admitted to the hospital.
