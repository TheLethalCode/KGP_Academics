 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday quashed another criminal case against prime minister Sheikh Hasina  making it the seventh such quashing. The case related to alleged corruption involving the Meghnaghat power plant. The bench of justices Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui gave the order on Thursday following a petition filed by Hasina challenging the proceedings. The court held that there were no grounds for Hasina to be included in the chargesheet. Her name was not initially included in the first information report. The now defunct Bureau pf Anticorruption had initially filed the case against former state minister for power Rafiqul Islam in 2001 alleging that he had caused the state to lose Tk 17.84 crore. Hasina and three others were later added to the chargesheet on Oct 14, 2002. Hasina filed the petition challenging the legality of the case in the same year. Her lawyer Mehdi Hasan Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that next week there would be hearings relating to two other graft cases. bd
