<TITLE> New gadget launches lift outlook for TSMC, UMC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - TSMC and UMC, the world's two largest contract chipmakers, probably made strong profits in the first quarter on robust chip sales, and the launch of new high-tech gadgets are fuelling optimism on their earnings growth this year. The two Taiwanese companies are riding on a global outsourcing trend, winning more orders from clients who are selling more powerful chips for new PCs and consumer products, including Apple's newly launched iPad. A wider customer base and early investment in advanced technology could help TSMC book record sales and profits for the whole of 2010 as it enjoys higher profit margins than UMC and other smaller rivals, analysts say. "Scale and advanced technology are key to success in the foundry market, and TSMC has them all," said Andrew Deng, an analyst at Taiwan International Securities. Cash-rich companies such as TSMC usually have the ability to spend more on new, more cost-effective production technologies, while second-tier rivals including China's SMIC have limited research spending. TSMC is expected to earn a net profit of T$30.76 billion ($977 million) in January-March, sharply higher than a year ago. UMC could have returned to profit in the same quarter from year-ago losses. News from some big U.S. tech firms has been upbeat -- Intel gave better-than-expected revenue and margin forecasts for the second quarter and 2010. And Apple's quarterly results blew past market expectations. However, cellphone chip supplier Texas Instruments, one of TSMC's clients, has forecast lower-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. "That's just an individual case and the overall semiconductor market will be doing well for the rest of the year, so we don't have to be panic," said John Chiu, a vice president at Taiwan's Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust. Investors have bought into TSMC's bright earnings prospects, pushing its shares to a more than three-month high last week. TSMC shares have risen 8 percent since the year's low in early February, helping Taiwan's main TAIEX up 10 percent in the same period. UMC shares were flat in the same period. According to StarMine SmartEstimates, which predicts future earnings by putting more weight on recent forecasts of top-rated analysts, full-year net profit of TSMC could show an upside surprise of 5.4 percent while for UMC it could be a downside surprise of 4 percent.
