<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com) Mobile phone importers are pressing for a flat tax of Tk100 on all handsets as a means to curb illegal imports of mobile phones in the country At the moment, phones are taxed at 12 percent of their cost The Bangladesh Mobile Phone Importers Association (BMPIA) called for a flat Tk 100 specific duty inclusive of VAT on each handset imported. "The imposition of Tk 100 tax would result in increased legal imports and the government would get more revenue," said the BMPIA Secretary General Faisal Alim at a press conference, Sunday. Figures provided by the trade body, indicate that 6.43 million handsets were legally imported in the 2008-09 fiscal year, a 21 percent growth from the previous fiscal when a uniform Tk 300 duty was prevalent on handeset imports. The BMPIA claim that when the Finance Minister AMA Muhith set 12 percent as a duty on handsets last year there was a decrease in the level of legal imports of mobile phones. The trade body suggested that 0.56 million handsets are imported legally every month against a demand of 0.75 million, which is met through the grey market. According to BMPIA statistics, legal imports have decreased by 4.66 percent in the current fiscal year. The cost to bringing in a handset into the country through illegal channels is between Tk 100-150 which encourages illegal imports and, according to BMPIA secretary general, causes the government Tk 600-700 crore in lost revenues annually. While admitting that a Tk 100 duty did not appear justified for high-end mobile phones, Alim said that "there is no other way to curb illegal imports." Alim estimated that there were about 200 businessmen in Dhaka, relying on 10-15 importers, who deal with illegally imported mobile phones. However, he said, the BMPIA could not play a role to curb such activities because it was the responsibility of the BTRC to take action. The number of mobile phone users in Bangladesh now stands at 55 million and the BMPIA estimate that the figure would cross 70 million by 2011. b
