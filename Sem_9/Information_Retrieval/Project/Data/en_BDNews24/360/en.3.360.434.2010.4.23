<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  Labour leaders have demanded a monthly minimum wage of Tk 5000 for labourers and workers. The Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (SKOP), a national platform of labourers and workers, made the demand at a roundtable discussion on minimum wage and poverty at the Dhaka Reporters Unity on Friday. Addressing the discussion, Wajedul Islam Khan, SKOP coordinator and central general secretary of the Bangladesh Trade Union Kendra, said that the minimum wage should be such that labourers and their families may lead a decent life. "The minimum wage should Tk 5,000 in the context of the present situation." Roy Ramesh Chandra, general secretary of the National Sramik League, the labour wing of the ruling Awami League, delivered the keynote on the issue and termed the present wages very low. He also said that the price hike of the essential commodities has been eroding the buying capacity of labourers and workers. "They are leading miserable lives." Ramesh Chandra said that given the situation, thousands of children from these families were compelled to take up begging. "Or they become child labourers." He also urged the government to provide cheaper and subsidised essential commodities like rice and cooking oil through open market sales for garment workers, fishermen, rickshaw-pullers, day-labourers and farmers. Zafrul Hasan, secretary general of Jatiyabadi Sramik Dal, labour wing of the main opposition BNP, said that the government should fix minimum wages in such a manner that the interests of both workers and owners are preserved. Jatiya Sramik Jote president Abdul Kader Howlader, Mukto Sramik Federation general secretary Mojibur Rahman Bhuiyan and Sramik Front secretary general Razekuzzaman Ratan also addressed the meeting. bdn
