 Dhaka, Apr 25(bdnews24.com)  The police failed to make the fourth deadline for submission of a probe report of an attempt on late professor Humayun Azad's life. The Criminal Investigation Department's inspector, Mustafizur Rahman could not submit the report on Sunday. Ali Hossain, judge of the Dhaka's First Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court, set May 30 as the new date for submission of the report. Additional public prosecutor Saiful Islam Helal said four designated dates have passed. On Oct 20, 2009, plaintiff of the case, Manzur Kabir, younger brother of late Humayun Azad, petitioned the court for further investigation as the real culprits, he claimed, were not implicated. On Nov 14, 2007, writer and Dhaka University professor Humayun Azad faced a lethal attack on his way home from the Ekushey Boi Mela held on the Bangla Academy premises every year through February. Manzur Kabir filed a case with the Ramna police accusing anonymous persons. On Nov 14, 2007 two chargesheet were submitted accusing JMB leader Shayekh Abdur Rahman, Ataur Rahman Sunny, Mizanur Rahman and Anwar Alam Khoka. As the case moved to the First Chief Magistrate's Court, Manzur Kabir petitioned for further investigation. The case stated that Humayun Azad was attacked for his novel 'Pak Sar Zameen Sad Bad'. It also stated that Azad held Jamaat leaders Delwar Hossain Sayedee, Ali Ahsah Mohammad Mojahid and Motiur Rahman Nizami responsible for ordering the attack but they were not implicated. bdnews24
