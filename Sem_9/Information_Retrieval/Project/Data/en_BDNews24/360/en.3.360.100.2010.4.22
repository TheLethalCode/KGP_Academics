 Chittagong, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com) A special BDR court in Chittagong began the trial of 35 members of 10 Rifles Battalion on charges of mutiny on Thursday. The special Court-4, set up at Baitul Ijjat BDR Training Centre in Satkania, began at around 8:30am, with outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam as the head of the judges'. Subeder Sultan Ahmed of 10 Rifles Battalion presented charges against 35 members of the battalion, located in Bolipara under Thanchi upazila, Bandarban, who are currently in jail in connection with a seperate sedition case. The head of the court, Islam, ordered that these men should be brought to the court on 24 Apr and 'shown arrested' in relation to the mutiny case. 75 other members from the same battalion are also detained in the same jail on charges of sedition, but they have not been charged with mutiny. The same court will also hold the trial of the men belonging to the Satkhania BDR training centre and Bandarban's Naikhyangchhari's Rifles Battalion-15. All the border guards are accused of siding with the Dhaka Pilkhana mutineers during the bloody events on Feb 25-26, 2009 that saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. The six special courts have been trying charges of mutiny, loot and arson. Four courts in Panchgarh, Thakurgaon, Feni and Satkhira have already delivered a verdict. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. Those accused of being involved in the Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts.
