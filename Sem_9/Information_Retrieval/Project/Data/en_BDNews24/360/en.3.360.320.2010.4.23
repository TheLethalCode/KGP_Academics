 BANGKOK, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai riot police confronted anti-government protesters at a barricade in Bangkok's business district on Friday, a day after grenade attacks in the area killed three people, but later pulled back without violence. In tense scenes, Thai television said police went right up to the barrier and demanded the "red shirts" dismantled it. They made no move to do so, and a Reuters photographer said protesters poured fuel on to the barricade, made up largely of tyres. But the police later pulled back, and the protesters also retreated to the camp they have set up behind the barrier in the capital's Silom district, he said. The government said the grenades late on Thursday, which also wounded 75 people, were fired from the red shirt protest area. Leaders of the red shirts, who have been demonstrating in Bangkok for six weeks seeking new elections, denied they were to blame. The grenade blasts came 12 days after clashes between troops and protesters killed 25 people and wounded more than 800 in the country's worst street violence in 18 years. The central bank said on Wednesday that the political crisis was affecting confidence, tourism, private consumption and investment, although exports, which are crucial to economic growth, have been little affected by the unrest. Thailand's currency, the baht , fell about 0.5 percent in early trade to 32.31 per dollar at 0159 GMT against 32.20 late on Thursday. "It is clearly a reaction to the blasts last night. The baht is hit by this abnormal situation despite its earlier resilience. If the violence drags on and subject to the degree of chaos, it could slide further to 32.40-50," a Bangkok-based dealer said. The stock market, which has swung widely in recent sessions in reaction to protest developments, opens at 0300 GMT. CASUALTY RISK The protesters, supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have also been occupying an upmarket shopping area for three weeks. Any attempt to disperse them risks heavy casualties and the prospect of clashes spilling into high-end residential areas. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said on Thursday night there would be no crackdown because women and children were in the area. Adding to the volatile mix, a new "multi-coloured" group is planning a demonstration of 50,000 people in Bangkok's old quarter on Friday to demand the "red shirts" end their rally. Demonstrations by this group have increased the tension in the Silom business district this week. "There are now two conflicting groups and this kind of confrontation could create havoc and turmoil," said Somjai Phagaphasvivat, politics and economics professor at Thammasat University. Under growing pressure to restore order, the army warned the red shirts on Thursday their "days are numbered". Leaders of the red-shirted supporters of twice-elected and now fugitive Thaksin say they will only leave when the military-backed government announces an early election. They say the British-born, Oxford-educated Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva came to power illegitimately in late 2008, heading a coalition the military cobbled together after courts dissolved a pro-Thaksin party that led the previous governm
