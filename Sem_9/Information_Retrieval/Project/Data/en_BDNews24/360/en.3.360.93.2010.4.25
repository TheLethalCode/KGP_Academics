<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP on Sunday announced that it would hold a protest rally demanding cancellation of Bhola-3 by-polls result and resignation of the election commissioners. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain made the announcement at an assembly in the capital's Muktangan. "What happened in Bhola, was not an election. It could be rather called vote rigging," the BNP leader said. He said that election commissioners violated their oath by holding the election and had no right to stay on. "They should resign." The senior BNP leader also criticised Awami League for its one-party mentality. "They do not believe in democracy. The government, in collaboration with the Election Commission and the Awami League, has violated voters' rights." He also said that the people of the country had not accepted the Bhola election result. Moudud Ahmed, another BNP standing committee member, said, "I have not seen such an election in 50 years." Ruling Awami League's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon won the Bhola by-election on Apr 24 bagging 93,209 votes while his rival from BNP, Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, got 41,489 votes in 77 centres out of 86. The EC declared the constituency vacant on Feb 3 as AL's Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated waiting period. Electoral law stipulates that a government official cannot run in the election within five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat against BNP's Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, with a lead of 12,000 votes in 2008 national polls. Dhaka City Corporation mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, BNP standing committee members Rafiqul Islam Mia and Abdul Moyeen Khan, vice-president Abdullah Al Noman, joint secretary general Amanullah Aman and other top-ranking leaders of the party also spoke. bd
