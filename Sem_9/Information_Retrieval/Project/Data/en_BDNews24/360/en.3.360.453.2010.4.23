<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP alleged that the ruling Awami League was out to stage a farcical election in Bhola on Apr 24 in collusion with the Election Commission (EC). Khandaker Delwar Hossain, secretary general of the main opposition, said told reporters on Friday that his party would launch a tough movement if the government and the EC refrained from ill-motivated activities. "Certain defeat has led the government and the EC to stage a farcical drama in Bhola on Apr 24," he said. Concerning the latest situation of the polling area, Delwar said: "The government has become desperate to prove its public support in Bhola. They are asking the voters not to go to the polling centres if someone wants to cast his vote for BNP." The BNP senior leader revealed a list of 'injured party leaders' in Bhola who were attacked by the 'activists of AL candidate Nurunnabi Shaon'. "Awami League joined the parliament in 1986, doing an entente with military dictator Ershad. They, however, had to resign in 1988. AL's history is of deception," Delwar said. Severely criticising the government for attack on a BNP protest rally, Delwar said, "The prime minister said that only BNP is protesting the crises of power, gas and water. She said that BNP has no public support." "I want to ask the prime minister to come out to the streets and see with her own eyes, whether people are protesting or not," Delwar said. He also criticised the BCL attack on a rally of the National Committee for the Protection of Oil, Gas, and Mineral Resources, and Power and Ports. He said, "BNP is a political party. But the oil-gas committee was not a political one. They were also attacked. It was dreadful." Standing committee members MK Anwar, Rafiqul Islam Mia, advisory council member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and other were also present at the conference. bd
