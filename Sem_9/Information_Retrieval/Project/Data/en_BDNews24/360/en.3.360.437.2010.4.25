 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Bhola, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Newly elected MP of Bhola-3 Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon on Sunday expressed his gratitude to the voters and reiterated his pledge to work for development of the locality. Meanwhile, he also urged his contender to accept the people's mandate and act like a 'wise politician'. In an exclusive interview with the bdnews24.com correspondent, after the official declaration of poll results, he said directions had already been given not to be carried away and engage in violence. In Saturday's by-election, Shaon won over BNP candidate Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed by a large margin of over 50,000 votes. Returning officer of Bhola-3 constituency (Lalmohan-Tajumaddin), Nuruzzaman Talukder, formally declared Shaon the winner Sunday noon. He said that 67.17 percent people of the 234,926 registered voters in the constituency had cast votes in the by-election. Of the 136,531 votes cast, Shaon received 93,873, while his rival Maj Hafiz got 42,658 votes. Voting was suspended at nine out of 86 centres, which represents just over 10 percent. The nine centres account for some 31,000 votes. In his reaction after the victory, an overwhelmed Shaon said, "I'm delighted." "I've become indebted to the people," he said emotionally. He explained that the people had attached much priority to the development of the locality, which was his election pledge. "I'll do accordingly." Shaon conveyed his gratitude to the voters, locals, party leaders and supporters as they had given him opportunity to represent the constituency. He also thanked prime minister and AL chief Sheikh Hasina for nominating him. Meanwhile, BNP candidate Hafiz Uddin alleged vote rigging and demanded cancellation of the election. Hafiz won the parliamentary elections in the constituency six times before he lost to AL candidate Jashim Uddin in the ninth parliamentary election on Dec 29, 2008. BNP rejected the election result and demanded resignation of the election commissioners. The main opposition alleged that there were massive irregularities. Shaon said, "He's making baseless and irrational demands." "Observers from home and abroad, mass media and common people termed the election fair." The local people will evaluate his claims in which he ignored popular verdict after a fair election, he said. Shaon said BNP leaders and supporters launched barbarous attacks on AL supporters after the eighth parliamentary elections. He also said that he had directed his party workers not to oppress the opposition. "We don't believe in being vindictive." bdnews
