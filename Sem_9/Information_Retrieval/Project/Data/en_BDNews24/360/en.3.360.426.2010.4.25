 Sudan, April 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hard-pressed Sudanese election officials told staff to save time and stop entering results into a safeguard computer system, leaving vote counting open to fraud and error, international sources said on Saturday. Sudan is days late in announcing the results of its first open elections in 24 years, a complex process already marred by boycotts and opposition accusations of vote rigging. The elections, set up under a 2005 peace deal that ended more than two decades of north-south civil war, were designed to help transform the oil-producing nation into a democracy ahead of a key 2011 southern referendum on secession.

One observer said the software had a number of "red flags" built in that would show up obviously wrong or suspicious figures, for example a voter turnout of more than 100 percent. "My understanding is that in various places, almost every result was going into quarantine because there was a query on it for some reason or another," the observer said. A second international source close to the voting system said the computer system had already shown up discrepancies.
