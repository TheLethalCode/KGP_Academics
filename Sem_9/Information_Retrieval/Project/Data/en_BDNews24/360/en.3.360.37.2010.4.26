 Naryanganj, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  Garment workers on Monday blocked a section of Dhaka-Chittagong highway for nearly two hours demanding arrear wages, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded. Witnesses said workers of SF Garments at Kanchpur-Nayamati area of Sonargaon upazila first demonstrated on the factory premises but later they took to the streets and continued their protests till 10.45am. Police went to the scene immediately after they came to know of the incident and tried to calm the situation, said Sonargaon police chief Md Yunus Ali. But the protesters did not pay heed to the initial call to clear the highway that connects the capital Dhaka with the south-eastern parts of the country, including the main port of Chittagong. Finally, they ended their protests after owners pledged to meet their demands through dialogue. Ali said the protest was peaceful, and traffic came to normalcy after the workers left. bd
