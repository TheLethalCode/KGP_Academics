 Dhaka, April 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court gave the police four more days to interrogate Hizb ut-Tahrir's chief coordinator in Bangladesh, Mohiuddin Ahmed. Metropolitan Judge Roksana Begum Happy gave the order on Sunday to question the radical Islamist outfit's leader in a case filed under Anti-terrorism Act and two other cases. The court also rejected Mohiuddin's bail plea. General recording officer of police in the court, sub-inspector Nowajesh Ahmed confirmed bdnews24.com about the custody order. Earlier the police questioned Mohiuddin for three days in two cases. He was brought before the court by the investigation officers of the cases. The investigation officers appealed for seven more days for questioning in the two cases and Nurul Amin, sub-inspector of the detective branch pleaded for another seven days in the new case. The judge permitted two days for the case filed under the anti-terrorism law and two days for other cases. The police appeal mentioned that Mohiuddin was involved in planning large-scale destruction. It also noted that he was involved in anti-state activities. It also mentioned that he had contacts with Dr Nasim Gani, leader of Tahrir's United Kingdom chapter and through him maintained a regular connection with the international terrorist circle. In the application, the police said that they need more time to quiz him and glean more information. Mohiuddin was arrested on April 20 from Dhaka. Besides acting as the radical Islamist outfit's spokesman, he is also an associate professor of the Institute of Business Administration of Dhaka University. The university authorities sent him into forced retirement after the government banned Hizb-ut-Tahrir on Oct 23, 2009. Tahrir had become active recently. It had brought out a procession in Chittagong two weeks ago and put up posters in a number of localities of Dhaka. bdne
