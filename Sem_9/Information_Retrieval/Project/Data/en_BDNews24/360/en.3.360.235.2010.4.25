<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Leading opposition party BNP called a protest meeting at the capital's Muktangan on Sunday to demand cancellation of the Bhola-3 by-election results. The meeting, due to start at 3pm will also condemn what the BNP say is the continuing violence and subjugation of the opposition by the government. BNP office secretary Rezvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com "The meeting will be held demanding withdrawal of the results of Bhola-3's farcical polls. It will also protest the earlier attack by AL terrorists on the BNP meeting at the capital that was demanding solution to the power-gas-water crisis." Ruling Awami League's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon won Saturday's Bhola by-election obtained 93,873 votes in comparison to his BNP rival Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed's 42,658 votes. Hafiz Uddin Ahmed demanded the elections be declared null and void, due to widespread irregularities, violence and intimidation by ruling party activists. He alleged law enforcers, Election Commission and the ruling party of colluding to defeat the BNP. BNP leaders in Dhaka echoed Hafiz saying they would not accept the results and demanded a new schedule for the election. Moreover, BNP also demanded immediate resignation of chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and two other commissioners. Although Awami League leaders claimed that the election was conducted fairly and peacefully, suspension of voting at nine out of 86 centres - a little over 10 percent - lent some credence to BNP's allegations of irregularities. The nine centres where voting was suspended account for some 31,000 votes. Voting ended at 4pm on Saturday with strong allegations from the main opposition BNP. AL joint general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif brushed off the allegations made by Hafiz Uddin in a press conference after the polls saying, "It is completely out of the question." Hafiz Uddin Ahmed carried the seat in 1991 (44.9 percent votes) as an independent and, as a BNP candidate, won in 1996 (with 59 percent of the votes) and in 2001 (with 65.8 percent votes). However, he lost in 2008 with 45.7 percent votes while the AL candidate, Jashim Uddin won with 52.8 percent. However, after the 2008 election, the Election Commission (EC) declared the Bhola-3 constituency vacant after finding the elected MP Md Jasim Uddin's candidature invalid. Jasim Uddin had been sent into forced retirement from the army, as a major, in 2004 - and electoral laws do not allow a person holding public office to contest in elections within 5 years of leaving the service.
