<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews4.com)  A criminal case lodged against the chief election commissioner, charging him of hurting religious sentiment, has been dismissed. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Court magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque ordered the case to be quashed Sunday evening. The dismissal was confirmed by Shakhawat Hossain, an employee of that court. The judge, in his order, said that the case statement had not mentioned any element that hurt religious sentiments. Moreover, such cases need approval from the concerned authorities of the government, which the plaintiff did not have, the order added. Earlier in the morning, Mohammad Hossain Akand, a businessman of the capital's East Basabo area and also a Khelafat Andolan leader, filed the case. The petition claims that newspapers reported on Apr 16 that the CEC had said about the Bhola by-elections, "The armed forces are not divine beings that they can fix everything. Forget the army, not even God can do everything." The case alleges that Huda had intentionally made this statement to challenge the Almighty and hurt the religious sentiments of millions of Muslims in the country. bdnew
