 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Forest and environment state minister Hassan Mahmud admitted that government funds for environment protection were being wasted due to lack of coordination between various ministries. He said, "Various government ministries are implementing different types of work plans to save the environment. However, lack of coordination between them means that there is a wastage of funds." "If the actions can be coordinated, money can be saved," the state minister said. The state minister was speaking on Sunday to journalists about the various steps he has taken in the last seven months since taking over ministerial responsibility for the environment. In the meeting, he also revealed that an initiative is being taken to establish a 'Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Safari Park' over an area of four thousand acres at Gazipur. It will first require the eviction of illegal occupants of the land. A proposal regarding this initiative might receive approval at the next ECNEC meeting, the state minister said. The government will also announce for the first time in the country, a national award for preserving wildlife. The award titled 'Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Wildlife Preservation National Award' will be given for the first time this year. He also highlighted that in comparison to 338 cases filed in the previous seven years, the government has filed 117 criminal cases involving the environment since he started in office. The state minister also said that the drive against polythene bag usage is also being made stricter. Environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder was present at the meeting. bdn
