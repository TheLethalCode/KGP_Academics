 SANAA, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion near the convoy of the British ambassador to Yemen on Monday killed one person, believed to be a suicide bomber, but the envoy was unharmed, a security source and British officials said. Ambassador Tim Torlot was on his way to the embassy when the blast occurred, the security source told Reuters. Three people were wounded, another security source said.

Theodore Karasik of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis said he assumed the attack was carried out by al Qaeda and was a reminder the group was still active in Yemen. "I think this shows al Qaeda is not disappearing and it has been plotting and planning attacks in Yemen and abroad and I think this is a new campaign of targeted assassinations," Karasik said. The Yemeni authorities were investigating the area of the blast which has been cordoned off, security sources said. A spokesman for the US embassy said it was still open to the public. The German embassy was also open for business, a spokesman said, while a staff member at the French embassy said they also remained open.
