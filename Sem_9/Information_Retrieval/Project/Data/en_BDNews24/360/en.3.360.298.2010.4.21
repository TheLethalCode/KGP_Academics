<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Papua New Guinea has shown significant interest in taking Bangladeshi workers for gas excavation and construction work, labour and employment secretary Zafar Ahmed Khan said on Wednesday. The country is also interested in taking college and university teachers. Khan was talking to reporters after meeting with Papua New Guinea's labour minister Mark Maipakai. Khan said Maipakai had also proposed that Bangladesh should open a labour wing in its embassy. At present, 13 out of 48 Bangladesh embassies have labour wings, he said. He said that the government was planning to open six additional labour wings in foreign embassies around the world. There should be labour wings in all the countries where there are Bangladesh embassies, the secretary added. This would help the country find more labour markets. At present, 500 Bangladeshi workers work in Papua New Guinea compared to 1 million Chinese workers, 2 lakh Indian workers and 30,000 Philippines workers in the country. bdnew
