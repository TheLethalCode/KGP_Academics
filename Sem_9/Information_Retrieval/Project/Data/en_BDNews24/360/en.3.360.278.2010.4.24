 Sunamganj, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  Locally elected public representatives of Sumanganj have urged the government for exemption of agricultural loans in the district. The upazila chairmen and vice-chairmen, municipality mayors and councillors, union chairmen and members called for the exemption on Saturday in a meeting at the disctrict's municipality auditorium. They also sent a memorandum to the deputy commissioner in this concern. The public representatives said that the government should declare Sunamganj as an affected area and exempt the agricultural loans disbursed in the district under a special plan to give people some reprieve. They said that the district depended on boro crops, most of which have gone under water. The people of the district were leading a very miserable life having lost their only crop. They claimed that the boro crops of the low-lying lands in the haors went under water due to the irregularities of the Water Development Board and contractors who were responsible for building and repairing the dams to keep out rising river water. They alleged that there had been an allotment of Tk 12.60 crore for repairing and constructing dams but the work was not completed in time. Local people of the haor areas voluntarily worked to secure the dams and embankments with the initiatives of the local public representatives but all their attempts went in vain. The water board or its contractors were of no help. The haors came under serious threat of flooding at the beginning of April when water level of the rivers typically increases. They said that the district's boro harvest contributed significantly to the country's demand and catered to the local demand as well. This year, boro was cultivated on about 2 lakh hectares in the district. b
