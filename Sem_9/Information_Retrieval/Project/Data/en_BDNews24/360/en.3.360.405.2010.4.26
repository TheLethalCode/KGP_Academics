<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  Producers and actors on Monday demonstrated in the capital to protest against a government decision to allow screening of Indian films in cinema halls. Following a review of its import policy, the government is proposing that films from India and other South Asian countries should be allowed to be screened. The decision has, however, not been made effective yet. But representatives from Bangladesh's already-ailing film industry, popularly dubbed as Dhallywood, say that such a decision would be devastating if it comes into effect. The ban on import and display of Indian films in the country's cinema halls was imposed in 1972. Bangladesh Chalachchitra Oikya Parishad, a platform of the local film industry, organised the protest on the premises of the Film Development Corporation (FDC). Popular actors including Razzak, Anwara and Mizu Ahmed took part. They said the government had taken this decision without any consultation with those involved in the industry. They claimed that such a decision would destroy Bangladesh's own film industry and hoped that the government would not take such a decision. Bdne
