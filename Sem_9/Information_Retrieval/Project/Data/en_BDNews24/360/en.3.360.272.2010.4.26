 NEW DELHI, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian Premier League chief Lalit Modi was suspended, officials said on Monday, after a scandal in cricket's richest event ensnared top politicians, Bollywood stars and strained the ruling coalition. Tax authorities are probing the three-year-old Indian Premier League franchise, valued at an estimated $4.1 billion, after a junior government minister resigned after allegations of improper influence. The widening scandal has sparked off tensions between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a key ally whose chief is seen close to Modi, ahead of a possible confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday over high fuel prices. The cricket board axed Modi immediately after the final match of the series, past midnight, saying he had "brought a bad name to the administration of cricket and the game itself." The distraction over cricket also imposes further difficulties on a government struggling to capitalise on its re-election to promote policies that would boost investment and ailing infrastructure, as well as reform welfare and subsidies. The IPL helped revolutionise cricket with its short, television-friendly format combined with lucrative advertising and cheerleaders in packed arenas, but it upset many of the sport's traditionalists. Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man and head of Reliance Industries, Vijay Mallya, who controls United Spirits, the world's second largest maker of alcohol, superstar Shah Rukh Khan; all were there in the hall to outbid each other and pay astronomical sums for teams and their players. At the top end, West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard was snapped up for $2.75 million by Ambani while the rights to set up a team in the western city of Pune went for $370 million. THE GAME'S HUGE POPULARITY Modi was replaced by a vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Chirayu Amin, a businessman who is also on the IPL governing council. Modi was given two weeks to respond to the board's charges. On Sunday night, he reiterated his innocence. "We have had some off-field unpleasant dramas only based on innuendos, half-truths and motivated leaks from all types of sources," Modi told the crowd that had come for the closing ceremony, ahead of his suspension. Parliament has been disrupted on multiple days as opposition demanded a probe into the IPL, with some lawmakers going so far to call for the BCCI and the IPL be taken over by the state. The enormous popularity of the game in India has made the BCCI one of the richest sporting bodies in the world and brought to its board politicians, businessmen and royalty. Farm minister Sharad Pawar who is also the head of the Nationalist Congress Party skippered the cricket board for three years till 2008. Arun Jaitley, who leads the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in the upper house of parliament, serves as a vice-president. Pawar's links to the game and his earlier support for Modi habe caused friction with the Congress, especially after Junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor was forced to resign after Modi accused him of using political muscle to influence teams
