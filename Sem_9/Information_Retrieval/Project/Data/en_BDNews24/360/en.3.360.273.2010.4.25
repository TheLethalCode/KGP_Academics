 Chandpur, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday said the people of Bhola-3 had given fitting reply to the main opposition BNP. "Our candidate in Bhola by-election got more votes than what the Awami League candidate had secured in Dec 29, 2008," she said. Of the 136,531 votes cast, AL candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon received 93,873 votes in comparison to his BNP rival Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed's 42,658 votes. The prime minster was speaking at a meeting at Chandpur Outer Stadium Sunday. Addressing the opposition leader, Hasina said that she tried to save the killers of Bangabandhu several times, but failed. "Now she's trying to save the war criminals by announcing movements." Hasina said the people in Chandpur awarded the ruling party four seats out of five, "but we will work in all the constituencies." "We've allocated Tk 15 crore to each of the local MPs to spend in development projects," she added. The prime minister also mentioned some development work that are set to be initiated in Chandpur, including the establishment of a technological institute, a university, a children's park, modern ferries in Chandpur-Shariatpur route and dredging to save the area from river erosion. Earlier in the day, Hasina laid the foundation stone for a 150MW combined cycle gas-run power plant at Chandpur's Balur Math grid substation. bdne
