 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday ordered BM Enamul Haque, the deputy commissioner of Rangpur not to play lawn tennis at night under floodlight. The court also ordered the government to explain why punitive measures should not be taken against the deputy commissioner for not complying with a government order prohibiting such activity. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain gave the order on a petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The High Court also ordered the government to form vigilance teams in city corporation areas to prevent power wastage. Human Rights and Peace filed the petition based on a newspaper report published on Apr 21. Advocate Manzil Morshed, who argued for the petitioner, said that many small shops use 20 to 40 electric bulbs. Besides, many business firms waste electricity, which is a punishable crime in line with the National Electricity Law. The Rangpur DC plays lawn tennis in floodlight even when the entire city is under blackout, Morshed said. The court ordered to form a probe committee in this concern and submit its report within the next 15 days. It also asked the government to submit its report on the vigilance team within the next 30 days. bdnews
