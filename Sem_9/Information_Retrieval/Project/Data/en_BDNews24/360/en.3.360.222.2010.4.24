<TITLE> PM's visit sees off load-shedding </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Apr 24 (bdnws24.com)  The absence of load-shedding in Chandpur since Thursday has come as a big surprise to its residents. But many link their good fortune to the up-coming visit by the prime-minister. Local power department officials are however denying such a link. Hasina is scheduled to visit Chandpur on Sunday, accompanied by Dipu Moni, the foreign minister and parliament member from the sadar constituency. During her visit, the prime-minister will lay the foundation stone for the 150 MW combined cycle power plant at Balur Math grid substation in the town. Executive engineer of Chandpur Power Department AK Dash Gupta admitted to bdnews24.com that the town "was getting the full demand of 16MW for last few days." He denied that it had anything to do with the prime-minister's visit. "This isn't true. The increase is only happening simply because the generation increased." The district however was still only receiving half of 66 megawatt required for the whole district. The residents are interested to find out what will happen when the prime-minister leaves their town. bdnews24.co
