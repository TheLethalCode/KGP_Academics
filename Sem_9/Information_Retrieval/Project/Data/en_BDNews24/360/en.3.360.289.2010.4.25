<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 25 (bdnews24.com)Serious talks have yet to take place between Bangladesh and Bhutan on the purchase of hydro-electricity from the kingdom to meet Dhaka's growing energy demands, Bhutanese foreign secretary has said. Following the prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Bhutan visit in November last year, Foreign minister Dipu Moni had told the media that Dhaka had raised this issue with Bhutan. Studies have estimated that Bhutan has the potential to generate over 30,000 mega watts of electricity using its steep rivers in the hilly region. The Bhutanese Foreign Secretary, Daw Penjo on Saturday night told bdnews24.com that Bhutan had already agreed with India to build a hydro power project by 2020 with the capacity to produce 10,000 mega watts for its neighbour.. "Investment for the export of hydro power has been done mainly with India," Penjo told bdnews24.com Saturday night. Presently, Bhutan exports services worth over US $ 100 million per year, 90 percent of which comes from sale of hydro-electricity to India, according to economists. "There are also some hydro electric power projects with other countries. We have set up one project with Austria. As far as the development of power projects with Bangladesh, we are not having any discussion," said Penjo. The secretary said his country has until now only exported about 2,000 mega watts of electricity to India. Any plan for Bangladesh to import electricity from Bhutan would be conditional on agreement with India, as Bangladesh will have to construct distribution lines through 34 kilometres of Indian territories to bring the power from Bhutan. Dhaka and New Delhi have already started connecting distribution lines to allow distribution of electricity between the two countries. In relation to the use of Bangladesh's ports for Bhutan's export-import business with countries other than India, the secretary said: "These are issues still under discussion". The secretary said his country hoped to be able to use Bangladesh's sea ports for exporting Bhutanese products to a third country through Indian territories. During prime minister's Delhi visit in January, Bangladesh had agreed to give India transit facilities to reach the Northeastern states. Dhaka had also said it would allow India to use the Chittagong port, which experts consider a big concession. In reply, New Delhi had agreed to let landlocked Bhutan and Nepal reach Bangladesh through Indian territories. But the Bangladesh-India joint statement on the visit of Sheikh Hasina did not make it clear whether Delhi would allow Kathmandu and Thimphu use its land to export their products to third countries through Bangladesh port
