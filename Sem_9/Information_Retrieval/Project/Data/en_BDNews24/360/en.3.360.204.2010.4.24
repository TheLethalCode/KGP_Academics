 Anupam Deb Kanunjna Jahangirnagar University, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  The controversially appointed Jahangirnagar University teacher has again come to the limelight by allegedly sexually harassing a female colleague. The victim, a teacher of international relations (IR) at the university, along with 29 other female teachers of different departments, lodged a written complaint with the vice-chancellor Shariff Enamul Kabir against her colleague Abdullahel Kafi on Apr 15. She complained that after she got appointed in 2007 on an ad-hoc basis, Kafi, the present chair of IR, harassed her in different ways. According to the complaint, she informed the university administration of the matter on five occasions, both verbally and in writing, as the harassment grew intolerable over the last one year. The university authorities, however, remained deaf to her complains, the victim told bdnews24.com, which she alleged was a bid to save Kafi. Later on Apr 1, the victim, in writing, lodged a formal complaint in this concern with the VC. As the VC kept ignoring her continuous appeals, she went to Shariff Enamul Kabir once more on Apr 15. However, this time, she took 29 of her female colleagues along. This time, the seemingly apathetic vice-chancellor accepted the complaint, albeit with a cool response, said Pofessor Nasim Akhter Hossain, one of the 30 signatories. The complain is now being investigated by a five-member complain cell, formed in line with a High Court verdict, led by professor Khorshida Begum of Government and Politics Department. Nasim Akhter, however, termed the cell-members 'politically biased' and being loyal to 'a teachers' group that supports Kafi'. She told bdnews24.com that the accusers are all in doubt whether they would receive a positive response from the complaint cell at all. Khorshida Begum, head of the 5-member probe committee, refused to say anything on the development of the probe 'for the sake of investigation'. The first instance of reported transgression of Kafi dates as far back as 1996 when he was an MPhil student of history at the same university. Lutfa Hossain, wife of an architect Akram Hossain, accused that Kafi tried alluring her into an illicit relationship. It was later revealed that Kafi identified himself to Lutfa as Shah Sufi Mustafizur Rahman, an assistant professor archaeology, who was that time preparing to go abroad for higher studies. Rahman, being informed of the incident from one Azgar Hossain, immediately reported the matter to the university authorities and demanded punishment. The administration formed a probe committee. The committee, even after 14 years, is yet to submit any report. Later in 1999, Aynal Haque, a resident of Mirzapur of Tangail, filed a criminal case (case no. 17) on charges of sexual harassment, making Kafi the main accused. The case is also yet to see any verdict. Kafi, along with nine others, was appointed in 1999 on an ad-hoc basis by the then vice-chancellor Alauddin Ahmed (currently the prime minister's education, social development and political affairs adviser) during an unscheduled vacation of the university. According to some reports published at that time in various newspapers, those 'unilaterally decided' appointments by Alauddin sparked great resentment among the teachers as there was 'no shortage of teachers'. The selection committee, nevertheless, chose Kafi despite his being the least eligible among the 21 vying for the post. Kafi was the only one to have just one first class in his entire educational background. Since then, Kafi was known as the right-hand-man of Alauddin Ahmed, the then VC, and now of Shariff Enamul Kabir, the current VC, several teachers accused. At present, Kafi is considered one of the most powerful teachers on Jahangirnagar University campus, holding some key posts like assistant proctor, provost of Al Beruni Hall, chairman of the provost committee and chairman of the IR department. The victim expressed her doubts to bdnews24.com whether such a teacher as Kafi, who wields great influence in the administration, could also easily influence an inquiry. Abdullahel Kafi, accused for sexually harassing his female colleague, denied all the allegations against him. He told bdnews24.com: "I have even taken a month's leave so that my offices may not influence the probe in any way." One of the complaining teachers, on condition of anonymity, expressed her anxiety to bdnews24.com: "But this might simply be another scheme to prove himself innocent." The JU vice-chancellor was not available for comments.
