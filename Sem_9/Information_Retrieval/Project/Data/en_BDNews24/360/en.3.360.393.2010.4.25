 LONDON, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hull City were resigned to relegation from the Premier League on Saturday after losing 1-0 at home to Sunderland while West Ham United beat Wigan Athletic 3-2 to move to the brink of safety. West Ham are 17th with 34 points while 18th-placed Hull remained on 28 with two matches remaining and a vastly inferior goal difference making their survival only the slimmest of mathematical possibilities.

Heavily-indebted Portsmouth, who are already in administration and relegated, came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Bolton Wanderers. Scott Parker secured the three points for West Ham with a long-range strike in the 77th minute after Wigan had taken the early lead through a Jonathan Spector own goal, heading a corner into his own net. "The boys really gave everything," said relieved manager Gianfranco
