 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League lauded the just concluded by-elections in Bhola as a free, fair and peaceful one. Awami League joint general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif said at a press conference in Dhaka, just after the votes ended on Saturday, that the result should be accepted no matter what. Hanif also urged the opposition BNP to accept the result regardless of who won. Regarding the BNP candidate's demand to cancel the polls, he said, "It is completely out of the question." Hafiz claimed that the BNP supporters could not caste their votes due to intimidation by the AL activists. "It is unfortunate that one demands cancellation of the elections whenever one looses. It has turned into a culture." Hanif brushed off the allegations made by Hafiz Uddin. "Major Hafiz was merely a toy," he said explaining that Khaleda Zia merely wanted to make a political issue out the election loss. Hanif suggested that Hafiz was never meant to win, rather Khaleda Zia picked him to lose. "But the AL supporters will not sit idle at home if they (BNP) try to harm people's lives and assets." "We'll counter them politically," said Hanif, the special assistant to the prime minister. He also claimed that many AL activists were severely injured in BNP attacks at the Bhola-3 constituency. bdn
