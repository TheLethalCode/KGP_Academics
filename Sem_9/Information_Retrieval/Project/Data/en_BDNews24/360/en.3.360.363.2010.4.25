 Chandpur, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stone of a 150 MW power plant at Chandpur on Sunday. The combined cycle gas run power plant is located at Balur Math grid substation in the town. Sheikh Hasina mentioned that the initiative to build this plant was taken during her party's last tenure in power and said, "We approved this project in the Apr 10, 2001 ECNEC meeting." However, no steps were taken for its establishment in the following five-year tenure of the BNP or the two-year tenure of the caretaker government. Even though it has been delayed, the plant is finally being built at Chandpur", the prime minister said. bdnew
