 Bhola Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has beefed up security measures at two upazilas of Bhola that are scheduled go to the polls on Saturday. Some 3,500 law enforcers have been deployed in the context of violence between the two main parties, the ruling Awami League and main opposition BNP. Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon of the Awami League, and the BNP's Major Hafizuddin Ahmed, set to run in the by-elections of Bhola-3 constituency. Voting is scheduled to begin at 86 polling centres of two upazilas of Bhola, Lalmohan and Tajumaddin, from 8am lasting till 4pm on Saturday when 234,926 voters are expected to take part. Returning officer Nuruzzaman Talukder told bdnews24.com Friday night that all necessary preparations for the next day's elections were completed. "I doubt that the voters' enthusiasm has been dampened despite reports of a few stray incidents of violence," he said. M Sakhawat Hossain, an election commissioner, said that all necessary preparations for a free and fair election had been ensured. The Election Commission (EC) declared the Bhola-3 constituency vacant after finding the elected MP Md Jasim Uddin's candidature invalid. Jasim Uddin was sent into forced retirement from the army, as a major, in 2004 but electoral laws do not allow a person holding public office to contest in elections within 5 years of leaving the service. The EC has declared 52 of the 86 polling centres as vulnerable and has installed a number of security measures including closed circuit television, some 40 EC officials deployed as observers in plainclothes, 21 strike teams and 24 mobile teams led by executive magistrates. Despite a number of allegations from the opposition camp that their polling agents are either being harassed or being threatened to leave the area, Bhola's police superintendent, Bashir Ahmed confirmed that situation was calm. He told bdnews24.com: "The constituency is entirely peaceful and measures have been taken to ensure a peaceful election at the upazilas of Lalmohan and Tajumuddin." Statistically, BNP's Hafiz Uddin Ahmed is a stronger contender having carried the seat in 1991 (44.9 percent votes) as an independent and winning in 1996 (59 percent votes) and in 2001 (65.8 percent votes). He lost in 2008 with 45.7 percent votes while the AL candidate won with 52.8 percent. bdnews2
