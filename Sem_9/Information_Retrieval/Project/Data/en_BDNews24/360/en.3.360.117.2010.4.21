 Bhola, Apr21 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed has rejected BNP demand to delay the Bhola by-elections by a week. The ruling party's chief coordinator for the by-election Tofail Ahmed rejected the BNP candidate's demand while addressing a rally in Lalmohan on Wednesday. Tofail said that one could not simply make a wish and expect that it would happen. Main opposition BNP's candidate Major Hafizuddin Ahmed, had demanded that the by-election, scheduled on Apr 24, be delayed by one week earlier in the day. Tofail also spoke of different activities of the opposition candidate including his alleged corruption during the tenure of the BNP-led government. Hafiz had said, "It's not possible to hold a fair election if outsiders remain in the area and the illegal arms are not recovered." bdnews2
