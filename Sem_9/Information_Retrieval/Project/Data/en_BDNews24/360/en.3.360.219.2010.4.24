 Bhola, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bhola-3 by-elections ended at 4pm on Saturday with strong allegations from the main opposition BNP. BNP candidate for the constituency, Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, demanded the elections be declared null and void, due to widespread irregularities, violence and intimidation by ruling party activists. He alleged law enforcers, Election Commission and the ruling party of colluding to defeat the BNP. "The Election Commission, RAB, police and local officials abetted the ruling Awami League to stage a farce of an election." Although Awami League leaders claimed that the election was conducted fairly and peacefully, suspension of voting at 9 centres, out of 86, which is over 10 percent, lent some credence to BNP's allegations. Mihir Sarwar Morshed, a deputy election commissioner issued an official to that effect at about 2.30pm. Commission officials said that they had suspended voting because of irregularities. The main opposition BNP has been alleging widespread violence and intimidation since this morning when by-elections began at 8am at Lalmohan and Tajumaddin upazilas of the district. The nine centres are Lalmohan Public Library and Women's College, Azharuddin Primary School, Bheduria Sherazia Senior Madrassah, Shatani Primary and Secondary School, Kishoreganj Primary School, Maheshkhali Ashrafia Primary School, North Annada Prashad Primary School, Lord Hardinge Fazil Madrassah and Syedabad Forkania Madrassah. Earlier in the morning at least six people were injured during a clash between the supporters of the ruling Awami League and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, witnesses said. The violence occurred outside Kishoreganj Primary School centre at Farazganj union when the supporters of ruling party candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon allegedly attacked the supporters of BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed. After voting at Lalmohan High School centre at 8.30am, Hafizuddin told reporters that he came to know that his agents had even been ousted from at least four centres. "The ruling party hooligans are creating obstacles to prevent my agents and voters from coming to centres," he said. His claim could not be verified immediately, but bdnews24.com correspondent reported that he found no BNP agents at two centres of Lalmohan. A team of BNP leaders led by BNP standing committee member MK Anwar met the Chief Election Commissioner Shamsul Huda in Dhaka and told him that in 37 centres there were no polling agents representing BNP. Returning officer Nuruzzaman Talukder said he had no knowledge of such incident, but, he said, authorities could not allow any agent who has no valid documents. "We cannot allow anybody as agent who cannot show his identity and other valid documents," Talukder said. Rafiqul Islam, a BNP agent at Azhar Ali School and College at Lalmohon area, told a roaming bdnews24.com correspondent that the ruling party supporters have snatched away national ID cards and other documents from some of the BNP agents when they were approaching the centres. Rafiqul's claim could not be independently verified. Hafiz Uddin Ahmed carried the seat in 1991 (44.9 percent votes) as an independent and winning in 1996 (with 59 percent of the votes) and in 2001 (with 65.8 percent votes). However, he lost in 2008 with 45.7 percent votes while the AL candidate won with 52.8 percent
