 WASHINGTON, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Bank President Robert Zoellick on Thursday urged global finance chiefs to set aside differences to reach an agreement this weekend on giving emerging powers a greater say in the aid-focused institution. Zoellick's call came amid tough talks as advanced countries, especially in Europe, quibbled over power shifts that amount to fractions of a percentage point worth of changes in their voting power. Addressing a news conference ahead of meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Zoellick said it was time to recognize shifts in the world economy, where the developing world was now driving global growth. "Discussions have been ongoing for months and are continuing among shareholders this week," he said. "I hope shareholders can bridge their differences and take this historic step." In September, G20 leaders agreed to a shift of at least 3 percent from developed to developing countries, effectively increasing developing countries' shares from about 44 percent to roughly 47 percent. Officials close to the talks said an agreement of 3.13 percent looked likely, which would amount to a contribution of $1.6 billion. The World Bank has 186 members that have the final say on voting shares. The proposed change is expected to pass, but not without some friction. Zoellick emphasized that the emerging economic powers were contributing more funding to the World Bank and those countries have said extra funding should come with greater influence. But even with developing countries giving more money, rich nations have yet to agree on how to divide up voting shares. "The Bank is talking about a new world order where poor countries are equal to the rich ones, but it can't even get a decent reform package agreed at its own board," said Caroline Pearce, spokeswoman for development group Oxfam International. RECORD LENDING World Bank member countries also will agree to boost the resources of the World Bank, which has lent heavily during the global financial crisis to help poorer countries cope with the sharp decline in world trade and tighter credit conditions. Since July 2008, the Bank has committed more than $100 billion to help developing countries. Member countries are set agree to $3.5 billion in new resources, the first capital increase in more than 20 years. Group of 24 emerging and developing countries, meeting on the sidelines in Washington, said the funding proposal was "inadequate and poses a severe constraint on post-crisis lending". Nancy Birdsall, head of Washington's Center for Global Development, said $3.5 billion was a "modest" amount given the vital funding role the Bank played in the crisis and will play in future development challenges, such as climate change. The World Bank's request for more resources also comes as developed countries grapple with mounting debt levels. "It is a pretty modest increase," Birdsall told Reuters, adding: "This reflects political realities not only in Europe but also in the US" While the rich world has long given lip-service to helping the poor and routinely jumps in when catastrophes occur, their budgets are squeezed and public debt is mounting. "It is rich countries' capital that has traditionally mattered and their legislatures are not feeling very friendly to requests for more money for international situations when their fiscal problems are so great and their debt so high," Birdsall added. IMF BATTLE HEATS UP Meanwhile, the battle for greater power by emerging economies in the IMF just begun, with a deadline of January 2011 to reach agreement. Brazil's Finance Minister Guido Mantega said IMF member countries should come up with a firm proposal sooner, which could be agreed by G20 leaders at a June summit in Toronto. In September the G20 leaders agreed to a shift of at least 5 percent from over-represented to other countries although the Fund's 186 members need to agree on such a shift. "Better five to guarantee...than nothing," Mantega s
