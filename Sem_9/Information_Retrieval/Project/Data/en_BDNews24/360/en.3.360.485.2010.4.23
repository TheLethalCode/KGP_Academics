 Kishorgonj, April 23 (bdnews24.com)  Two dikes used for protecting crops have been washed away in the Korimgonj upazila of Kishorgonj and 10 others are under threat. In the last 15 days at least 20 embankments in the Haor areas of the district have been washed away, submerging over 15,000 hectares of crop. These dikes were mostly built by local people to protect crops from floodwater. Bdnews24.com's Kishorganj correspondent reported that a sudden rush of water from the upper catchments of the Dhanu river had washed away the Shongail and Khaksri embankments in Karimganj upazila and submerged 300 hectares of Boro crop. 1,000 hectares has been submerged in the Sutar Para area of the upazila as water overflowed the Proyg Bil dike. The farmers were forced to harvest half-ripe paddy due to the sudden flood. Monjil Uddin, a farmer from the Behunda village told bdnews24.com that all his crops went under water as the barrier failed to stop the powerful water flow, and he was forced to start harvesting paddy early. Ruhul Amin, another farmer from Noaga village said that he had borrowed nearly Tk 100,000 and he was anxious about whether he could repay it as floodwater had destroyed his paddy. Sutar Para union chairman Sirajul Islam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that his fish firm had been flooded and he had lost Tk 10 lakhs. Korimganj upazila chairman Md Jonab Ali said that 10 other dams were also on the brink of falling apart. Lutfur Rhman Chan Mia, vice-chairman of the upazila, who is supervising the work on Roajani dam, said that if the embankment fails to withstand the water, and additional 40,000 hectare of crops would go under water. bdnews
