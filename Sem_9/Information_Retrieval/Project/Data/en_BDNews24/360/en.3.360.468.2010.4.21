 JOS, Nigeria, April 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sporadic violence in Nigeria's central Plateau state has killed at least nine people this week, police and residents said, as tensions remained high weeks after hundreds died in sectarian clashes. Seven bodies were found on Tuesday in shallow graves in the Riyom area, around 30 km (20 miles) south of Jos. Residents say they were killed after stopping at a road block set up by a local gang. In a separate incident, security forces killed two Nigerians suspected of planning an attack in a village near Plateau state's capital Jos, which lies at the crossroads of the country's Muslim north and Christian south.

People can come to visit now with no problem," said Gregory Anyating, spokesman for the state police. Residents agree that violence has subsided in Jos, but believe it is still dangerous in remote villages that are more difficult to police. "I won't say that things are back to normal.

Police have arrested more than 160 people over their roles in this year's sectarian clashes, but few have been prosecuted. Politicians, diplomats and rights groups have urged the authorities to punish the community leaders and gangs responsible for the fighting to prevent future conflic
