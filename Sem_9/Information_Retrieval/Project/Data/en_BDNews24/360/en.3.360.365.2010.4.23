 MADRID, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona must regroup after their humbling midweek Champions League defeat and turn their attention to domestic matters with the visit of basement side Xerez on Saturday (1600 GMT). Coach Pep Guardiola, who has watched city rivals Espanyol and Inter Milan shut down his side's passing game, has little margin for error as he pushes Barca towards the defence of their European and La Liga titles.

Manuel Pellegrini's side, who are effectively two points behind Barca due to the leaders holding the edge in the head-to-head record between the clubs, face relegation-threatened Real Zaragoza (16th) on Saturday (1800). Real hammered Zaragoza 6-0 at the Bernabeu back in December. "We are in a much better situation than we were last week. We are only one point behind Barca and anything can happen in football," Cristiano Ronaldo was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Thursday. "I am confident we can win our last five games and that if we do we will win the championship."
