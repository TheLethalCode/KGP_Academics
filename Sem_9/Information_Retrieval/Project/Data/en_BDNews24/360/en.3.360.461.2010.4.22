 WASHINGTON, April 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates said on Wednesday they will launch a global agricultural fund to boost food production in the developing world. In an opinion piece, Gates and Geithner said the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, which will be launched in Washington on Thursday, will help farmers grow more food and earn more from farming.

The fund, which will be supervised by the World Bank, will provide financing to poor countries with high levels of food insecurity and have developed sound agricultural plans to boost crop production. The fund will invest in infrastructure that will link farmers to markets, promote sustainable water-use management, and increase access to better seeds and technologies. A rise in world food prices in 2008 to record levels highlighted the chronic underinvestment in agriculture in developing countries, where three-quarters of the poor live in rural areas. Gates' foundation has long been active in providing funding for projects to increase agricultural production of small-scale farmers in Africa and elsewhere. It has particularly been interested in improving access to food, working closely with the United Nation's World Food Programme. The United States is the world's largest food aid donor. While enough food is produced in the world to end hunger, more than 1 billion people go hungry because they cannot afford to buy food or otherwise cannot access suppl
