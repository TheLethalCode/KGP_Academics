 Dhaka Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government will try and complete the Joydebpur-Narayanganj elevated expressway, the first in Bangladesh, by 2014. Transport minister Syed Abul Hossain said that the tender process will be completed by June. He said this after a seminar on traffic problem in Dhaka organised by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Bangladesh Council (CILT) in the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Saturday. Abul Hossain said the government would complete the expressway within its tenure. The plan to begin work for building metro rail is almost complete. It is expected that metro would resolve the increasing traffic problem of Dhaka substantially. A feasibility report has been submitted in this regard. The communications minister said that he was expecting about 80 percent financial support from Japan. To expedite the tender process, four companies have been selected and are deemed to have gone through the pre qualification bid successfully. The government has different plans, including constructing flyovers and increasing the number of public buses to resolve the traffic problem, said the communication minister. "But it will take a long time for these plans to materialise," said Abul Hossain. In the keynote, CILT vice president Karar Mahmud suggested reduction of private cars, removal of illegal rickshaws, removal of old vehicles, construction of flyovers in different places and increase in the number of traffic police. b
