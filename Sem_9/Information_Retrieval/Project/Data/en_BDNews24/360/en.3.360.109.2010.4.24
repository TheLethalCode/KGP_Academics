<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's top body of knitwear manufacturers and exporters has called for a control yarn price and formation of a monitoring cell by April 27. They also demanded that the government fix yarn price. "Price of yarn was never so high. It is increasing by the hour," said BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque. He alleged that a certain quarter of yarn manufacturers were exploiting the opportunity of the Indian government's decision to suspend cotton export and a price rise in the international market. BKMEA president pointed out that in February yarn cost $2.85 per kilogramme and on April 21 it stood at $4.20 per kg, increasing by just over 47 percent. He also said that over the last 10 days it had increased by 60 cents per kilo. However, Hoque said that cotton prices had not increased in a similarly corresponding proportion. In February, cotton price was $80.05 per pound and on April 20 it had risen to $86.01, he said. Cotton prices had risen by only 7.4 percent. He told that journalists that in neighbouring countries yarn was selling at $3.60 per kg. Hoque demanded that barriers on importing yarn through the land port be removed. He said that the apparel industry was under a severe threat due to the global recession and Bangladesh's domestic energy crisis. Costlier yarn threatens an industry that employs up to 30 lakh people, he said. b
