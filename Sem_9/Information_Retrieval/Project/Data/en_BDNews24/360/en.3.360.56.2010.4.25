The cabinet minister, chief secretary of the prime minister, national parliament secretary, law secretary and Dhaka City Corporation mayor were made defendants were made defendants. Petitioner advocate Manzil Morshed told bdnews24.com that hearing would be held on Monday. The appeal said that there are several regulations in the House Rent Control Act that direct the owners to provide rental receipts and eviction notice to the tenants. But owners increase rental fees according to their whim defying the law and even evict tenants without any prior notices, the statement said. Effective steps are also not being taken to ensure full implementation of the list of rental fees prepared by the Dhaka City Corporation, it added. Earlier on Apr 15, the rights organisation served a legal notice on the government. According to the Consumers' Association of Bangladesh (CAB) data, the rental fees increased in Dhaka by 8.4 percent in 2003, 9.96 percent in 2004, 7.89 percent in 2005, 14.14 percent in 2006 and 21.48 percent in 2007. bd
