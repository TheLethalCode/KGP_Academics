 BARCELONA, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juan Antonio Samaranch was given a send-off resembling a state funeral in his native Barcelona on Thursday, a day after the former International Olympic Committee president died at the age of 89.

Samaranch was admitted to the Quiron clinic in Barcelona on Sunday with acute heart problems and passed away on Wednesday after suffering "cardio-respiratory failure".
