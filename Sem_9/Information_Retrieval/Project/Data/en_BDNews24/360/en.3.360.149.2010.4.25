 BEIJING, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Li Xiaopeng, whose father former Chinese premier Li Peng is reviled by many as the "Butcher of Beijing" for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, will be promoted to a ministerial position, two sources said. His move will cement the family's position as one of the ruling Communist Party's most powerful dynasties, and is another sign that jockeying has begun ahead of the 2012 Party Congress, where President Hu Jintao's successor will be named. He will be promoted to governor of the southern province of Hunan, two sources with ties to the leadership told Reuters. He will replace Zhou Qiang, who will be Hunan party chief after his predecessor's move to restless Xinjiang. Li Xiaopeng, whose name means "Little Peng", is currently vice governor of the coal-producing northern province of Shanxi. A governor holds a rank equivalent to a minister in China. Now-retired Li Peng, as the adopted son of former Premier Zhou Enlai, is a "princeling", a term used in China to describe the children of incumbent, retired or late leaders. One of the sources said Li Xiaopeng's move into politics from the business field, where he had been active until 2008, would ensure Li Peng's legacy would be protected and any reversal of the Tiananmen verdict would be unlikely. The Communist Party regards the events around June 4, 1989, as a subversive plot against its power. "This is a family dynasty," said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to foreign media. "Both father and son are princelings." Neither source knew when a formal announcement would be made. More than two decades after issuing the martial law order on national television to crack down on weeks of pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, Li Peng is still seen in the West and among many in China's capital as the "Butcher of Beijing". But laid-off workers from state-owned companies, millions of whom lost their jobs in the late 1990s in the wake of economic reforms, still have fond memories of him because he opposed such radical moves. "The conservative elements within the party support Li Peng because he is against radical market reforms," said Wang Jiansu, a Hong Kong-based, China-watching political analyst. Li Xiaopeng worked in the power industry until 2008, where he was chairman of Huaneng Power, the country's largest power producer and one of its most lucrative. In his 2004 memoirs, Li Peng blamed then-leader Deng Xiaoping for the Tiananmen crackdown, said another source with knowledge of writings which the government banned from publication. The Li dynasty does not stop with Xiaopeng. His flamboyant sister, Li Xiaolin, who has a penchant for fine clothing and jewellery, is chairwoman of China Power International Development, and is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely ceremonial advisory body to parliame
