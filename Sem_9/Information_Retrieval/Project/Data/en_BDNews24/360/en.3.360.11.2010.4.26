 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  A special BDR court in Dhaka asked authorities to produce 675 border guards before it on Tuesday as their mutiny trial began on Monday. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, adjourned the court until Tuesday after proceedings began at 9:30 am at the Darbar Hall of the border force's Pilkhana headquarters. Most of the accused soldiers belong to the 44th Rifles Battalion, and all 675 are facing charges of mutiny that killed 74 people including 57 army officers, deputed to the paramilitary force, during the Feb 25-26, 2009 carnage. Some 405 accused are currently detained in a case with the New Market Police station, filed in April last year. The remaining 270 were arrested on Monday. They were on duty in the BDR headquarters. Lt Col AKM Golam Rabbani and Maj Sayeed Hassan Taposh assisted the BDR DG during the court proceedings. Deputy attorney general Mohammad Ullah Kislu was present in the court on behalf of the attorney general. Lt Col Kazi Aniruddha, commanding officer of the 44th Rifles Battalion, was the prosecutor. He was assisted by special prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, Mohammad Shahnewaz Tipu and Manjur-e-Alam. The government has formed six special courts to deal with mutiny cases while criminal charges including murder and arson will be tried in regular courts. bdn
