 Dhaka, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League leaders on Sunday said that the opposition party's past misdeeds resulted in their defeat in the Bhola by-election. The AL leaders were talking to reporters at a media briefing at the party chief Sheikh Hasina's political office in the capital's Dhanmondi. The AL leaders also urged people to remain conscious about BNP's 'political ill motives' and 'political malpractice' concerning the Bhola election. Mahabub-ul-Haque, acting general secretary of the party, said: "The tortures and oppressions done by BNP in their past ruling period between 2001 and 2006 has led the Awami League candidate to win in Bhola." Hanif also urged the opposition to accept the result of the by-elections and thus show respect to democracy. "We will prevent any actions against democracy," he said. "The election itself was not important to BNP. They wanted to create an issue. They had no intention of winning." "BNP candidate Major Hafiz wanted to delay the polls for seven days only because his political situation was very poor in the polling area," the AL leader said. The top-ranking AL leader also asked BNP chief Khaleda Zia to seek forgiveness for all the party's misdeeds done between 2001 to 2006. AL office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan, organising secretaries Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury and Abu Said Al Mahmud Swapan and others also spoke at the briefing. bdn
