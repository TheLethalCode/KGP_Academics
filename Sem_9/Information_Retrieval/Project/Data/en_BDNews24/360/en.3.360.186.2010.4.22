<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud secured bail in a defamation case on Thursday. Dhaka's Metropolitan magistrate Mostafa Shahriar Khan granted him bail in a case filed by Bangabandhu Foundation president Moshiur Malik. Malik filed the case against Maumud on Mar 25 for saying that state minister for law Qamrul Islam was not a real lawyer. He reportedly said at a meeting in Cox's Bazar that Islam was like "a lawyer under a banyan tree". Awami Ainjibi Parishad member PK Abdur Rob also filed another defamation suit against the Press Club chief in relation to the same set of facts. Mahmud also prayed for bail in the second case and the hearing will take place in the court of another metropolitan magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque later in the day.
