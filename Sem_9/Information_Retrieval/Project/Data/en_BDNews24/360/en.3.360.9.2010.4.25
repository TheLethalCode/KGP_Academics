<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, April 25 (bdnews24.com)  A 2.5km stretch of Sirajganj Sadr Upazila's western embankment on the Jamuna river has become very vulnerable to erosion. Over the last month the Jamuna has washed away 900 bighas (33 decimals = 1 bigha) in several villages. Locals said that 700 families were forced to move out of their homesteads. More than 100 houses and several educational institutions are under threat. The vulnerable villages are Chhotopiari, Biara, Morgram, Belotia, Kash-Belotia, Char-Sapri and Ghonapara. Erosion had begun in the western bank as water flow increased in March. Sirajganj Upazila Nirbahee Officer Muhammad Hossain said that the administration was preparing a list of the affected people to distribute rice and cash. Locals alleged that the Water Development Board had not taken effective measures in this regard. Sujoy Chakma, executive engineer of Sirajganj WDB told bdnews24.com, "The higher authorities have been informed about it." He added that they will start working after being allotted the necessary funds. Md Shujabot Ali, imam of Biara village, said that last month he lost 20 bighas with standing boro paddy. Md Jahangir Alam, president of Ghonapara village development committee, alleged that the water board had not taken any initiatives. He also said that if the WDB had dredged the channel on the eastern side of the village or taken necessary measures in due time, the villagers would have been saved from the misery. SM Ruhul Amin, assistant teacher of the Ghonapara primary school told bdnews24.com that school's building was auctioned off due to the threat of erosion. "But I am still worried about where to relocate the school and how the students' education will continue." bdnews2
