 MILAN, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho still found reasons to moan despite being on the verge of yet another extraordinary triumph after his side flattened Barcelona 3-1 in their Champions League semi-final, first leg on Tuesday. Barca's Spain midfielder Xavi complained about the referee at fulltime and was involved in a San Siro tunnel spat with Mourinho, who inferred the holders were bad losers and again slammed his own player Mario Balotelli for a lack of dedication.

Inter is now a great team in the Champions League," he said. "We either go to Madrid and play the final or we go home with our heads held high." Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola was gracious in defeat and had only one complaint about the sticky San Siro pitch, saying the Nou Camp would be watered for next Wednesday's second leg. "The pitch was not the one we wanted. At home we can choose, we have attackers who are very quick," said the dapper coach, whose side had to spend 14 hours on a bus to reach Milan because of flight restrictions caused by an erupting Icelandic volcano.
