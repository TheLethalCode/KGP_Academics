 Shamim Ahmed Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com) The recent outbreak of chicken pox has taken on an epidemic form due to scorching heat sweeping across the country. According to hospital sources in Dhaka, the number of people infected with chicken pox is mounting by the day and the doctors are simply overwhelmed due to lack of vaccines and other facilities. The affected people are reportedly crowding into different Dhaka hospitals every day and the specialists warned the situation could get worse if the high temperature persists. Because of lack of proper facilities patients are being shifted from Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Salimullah Medical College Hospital to Mohakhali Contagious Disease Hospital. Dr Ehsan Kader, assistant professor, Sir Salimullah Medical College, told bdnews24.com that patients are crowding into the outdoor of the hospital on a daily basis. The situation is getting worse, he said, because the virus responsible for chicken pox,Varicella-Zoster, becomes more active as the temperature rises. Kader said the patients are not admitted into the hospital until infection develops after virus attack. "The only remedy of the disease is extensive care. The patients need to be isolated and kept under treatment as per physicians' guidance," Ehsan said. He also suggested patients can take Varicell, a medicine, for temporary relief. Children, especially under age 12, fall prey to the virus but the adults can also be affected. "The incidence of virus infection soars usually from April to May. The number of infections may rise further until there is rainfall," Ehsan said. Dr. Imran Ali, physician at Contagious Diseases Hospital, also told bdnews24.com that at present the number of patients is high but patients without infections are not being admitted there. New born, pregnant and feeble people are more vulnerable than others and may suffer badly, Imran said. "In-home treatment is appropriate for them. The number of victims may rise if the virus becomes super-active in hot", he said. On a recent day, some 10-12 patients were admitted to the hospital. A patient named Arif, 14, said he got admitted to the hospital after his soars turned into infections. Patients usually recover from the disease within two weeks and in most cases, the virus attacks a person once in a life time, Ehsan said. Chicken pox vaccine can prevent the virus attack but the public hospitals do not haveadeqaute supply of the vaccine, Ehsan said. bdnew
