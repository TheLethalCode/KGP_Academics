 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Bhola, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Defeated BNP candidate Maj Hafiz Uddin Ahmed said he would counter the election irregularities politically. A six-time winner from the constituency, Hafiz said he would not initiate legal action against what he claims to be vote rigging in the Bhola-3 by-elections. Rejecting the election results, Hafiz said, "BNP will soon launch a movement against the government for what happened in Bhola." Hafiz was speaking to bdnews24.com exclusively at his Lalmohan residence on Sunday. "Bhola-3 by-election is a scandalous chapter in the country's history," he remarked. He said instead of an election, 'a farce' was staged on Saturday. "Up to 67 percent votes were cast within an hour of voting," said the BNP candidate. "It is clear that the election was rigged." Hafiz claimed that BNP agents and supporters were barred from entering the polling centres. Referring to a statement of the Chief Election Commissioner claiming that BNP could not appoint local polling agents and insisted on getting them from outside, Hafiz pointed out that he had carried the seat six out of eight times that he ran. "Is it believable that I couldn't appoint agents?" Hafiz carried the seat in 1991 with 44.9 percent votes as an independent. With a BNP ticket, he won in 1996 with 59 percent votes and in 2001 with 65.8 percent votes. However, he lost in 2008 with 45.7 percent votes while the AL candidate, Jashim Uddin won with 52.8 percent. Although Hafiz has so far had a base of about 45 percent votes, this time around he secured only 31 percent votes, while the Awami League candidate outdid even Hafiz at his best securing almost 69 percent votes. "We'll launch a mass movement soon against vote rigging. We'll not take any legal step as every institution, including the courts, has become politicised," Hafiz said. Hafiz was still rigid in his demand for resignation of the election commissioners. Regarding the election commissioners, Hafiz said, "They worked according to the government's directions." bdnews
