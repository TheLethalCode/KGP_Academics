<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Thursday as several major US firms issued disappointing profit outlooks, casting doubts on the strength of a global recovery, and as investors grew impatient for action on Greece's debt crisis, which weighed on the euro. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan shed 1 percent, led by a decline in raw materials stocks, while Japan's Nikkei fell 1.9 percent with microchip-related stocks giving up gains made the previous day. "The market has risen quite steeply lately and it is taking a break. Investors have also turned a bit more cautious before earnings results of major firms," said Won Jong-hyuck, a market analyst at SK Securities in Seoul. Disappointing outlooks from healthcare companies offset strong earnings from Morgan Stanley and Apple Inc, leaving Wall Street indexes little changed overnight. After the closing bell, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc gave a weak forecast for the current quarter and full year, while Internet auctioneer and retailer EBay Inc also gave a forecast that fell short of Wall Street expectations, casting doubts over what has been an otherwise upbeat corporate reporting season so far. Investors are scouring earnings reports for signs that global consumer demand is improving, which would boost sales and give a much-needed leg up to a flagging equities rally which began early last year. However, many market watchers have already priced in strong growth expectations, leaving markets vulnerable to profit taking if earnings and forecasts do not surprise strongly on the upside. In South Korea, shares of Hynix Semiconductor declined 0.5 percent despite delivering its best quarterly profit in more than three years thanks to strong chip prices and better-than-expected demand for personal computers. Shares in Samsung Electronics, the world's No.1 memory chip maker, fell nearly 1.7 percent, helping drag the broader stock index down 1 percent and farther away from its recent 22-month closing high. "Hynix's better-than-expected results give a good start to the technology sector earnings season, but the growing view is that all the good stuff is known and out already," Won said, adding that technology earnings will be solid through the third quarter, though growth momentum may get weaker. Asian firms are just starting their quarterly earnings season with investors optimistic for strong performances across many sectors, driven by the region's brisk recovery from the global downturn, in contrast to still-tepid economic growth in the West. GREEK CHORUS Meanwhile, the euro extended its overnight losses as mounting worries about whether Greece could finance its debt obligations in the near term drove investors to go short on the unit. The euro slipped to $1.3385 from $1.3392 late in New York on Wednesday when it lost 0.3 percent. It fell to as low as $1.3359 in the previous session. Greece started talks with European Union and International Monetary Fund officials on Wednesday on a potential aid deal that could offer Greece 40 billion to 45 billion euros in loans, but it would take several weeks before any plan could be finalised. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said a joint text will be agreed by May 15. The delay means the EU/IMF package may not be in place in time to allow Greece to roll over debt which is maturing next month, heightening investor anxiety about sovereign defaults. Gold held steady near $1,145 per ounce while U.S. crude futures fell 32 cents to $83.36 a barrel, dropping for the second day in a row, as the stronger dollar raised costs for market players using other currencies to trade the dollar-denominated commod
