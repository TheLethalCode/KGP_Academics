<TEXT>
 Satkhira, Apr 24(bdnews24.com)  Corruption has prevented the dams damaged by Cyclone Aila from being rebuilt or repaired over the last 11 months. Speakers at a discussion on reconstruction of dams in Aila-hit areas at the Sathkhira sadr upazila auditorium on Saturday also said that sufferings of the people had not been resolved. The coastal dams should be repaired with the assistance of the military they suggested during the discussion. Bangladesh Water Integrity Network and Transparency International of Bangladesh jointly hosted the discussion. Narrating their experience, the speakers said bureaucratic complexity and politics have caused much havoc. The speakers said the region abounded in paddy and fish before 1960s because there were no dams in the coastal areas during that time. So there was a normal ebb and flow of water, they said. They said, dams under the WDB were not repaired for over 25 years but crores of taka was plundered in the name of repair. The speakers spoke in favour of afforestation and were opposed to shrimp cultivation. Dams must be constructed and repaired on an urgent basis, without tender invitation, if needed, at times of disaster, they said. They said, dependence on WDB would not bode well adding that three phases of work plan would have to be created. They demanded that supply of pure drinking water be ensured for the Aila-hit regions. The keynote paper was read by Jakir Hossain and Monjur-e-Khoda. It stated that the emergency and long-term planning was very important for tackling disasters. The speakers said post Aila situation shows how lack of proper planning and negligence could bring disastrous consequences. They pointed out that although the sea level has risen over the years, the dams had not been raised. The discussion chaired by TIB executive director Iftekharrujaman was also addressed among others by local MP Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Satkhira deputy commissioner Abdus Samad. bd
