 BEIJING, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has replaced the top official in energy-rich Western Xinjiang region, hit last year by deadly rioting and a scare over syringe stabbings, the official Xinhua agency reported on Saturday. Zhang Chunxian has been made Communist Party Secretary for the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region -- a position which carries more power than the post of governor -- replacing Wang Lequan, who had run the remote region since 1994.

Han Chinese in Urumqi sought revenge two days later. At least 197 people died in the violence, authorities say. Widespread scares about stabbing attacks using syringes began around two months after the rioting. China in September sacked the top official of strife-torn Urumqi city as well as the regional police chief. Wang has been made deputy secretary of the Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, an apparent demotion. Zhang, 57, was previously Communist Party Secretary for southern Hunan region. He has also served as Minister of Communication, according to Xin
