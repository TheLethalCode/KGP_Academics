 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com) -- The environment department is initiating several steps to tackle environment pollution. Environment state minister Hasan Mahmud said on Thursday that the government had decided to create 466 new posts in the department towards that goal. "Appointments to the new posts will start very soon," he said addressing a meeting organised the by Dutch-Bangla Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Sonargaon Hotel in the city. The state minister said the cabinet had already approved the amended Environment Act and Environment Court Act, and hoped that the parliament would pass it in the next session. He said the existing Environment Act was not an effective enough to prevent pollution. At present, there are only three environment courts in Dhaka, Sylhet and Chittagong. If the amendment is approved, there will be an environment court in each district, he added. The department of environment now has its offices in six divisional cities. Another 16 offices would be opened soon, he said. Mahmud said about 7,000 industries on Dhaka's outskirts are continuously polluting the four rivers -- Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Turag and Balu -- surrounding Dhaka with waste amounting to 155 million cubic metres per day. A project, Buriganga-3, has been initiated to make the river pollution-free, he said. The state minister said the government had given private banks a fund of Tk 2 billion to disburse among industries for setting up environment-friendly facilities like effluent treatment plants. He urged private organisations to help the government reduce pollution. Dutch ambassador to Bangladesh AJAJMG Hennekens and Dutch-Bangla Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Rakesh Mohan, among others, spoke at the meeting. bdne
