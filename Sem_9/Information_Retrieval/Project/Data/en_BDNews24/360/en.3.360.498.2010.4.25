 Chandpur, Apr 25 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Sunday that 500MW of power will be purchased from India in the next two years. Hasina blamed the lack of steps to increase power generation during the tenure of the past governments for the current crisis and said that her government is now taking steps to increase generation. "We will be able to bring 500MW of power from India by 2012. The work to exchange power has already started by bringing a connecting supply line from Baharampur in West Bengal to Bangladesh's Bheramara and by establishing a substation there," the prime minister said. She said this while laying the foundation stone for the 150MW combined cycle gas-run power plant at Chandpur's Balur Math grid substation. Sheikh Hasina mentioned that the initiative to build this plant was taken during her party's last tenure in power and said, "We approved this project in the Apr 10, 2001 ECNEC meeting." However, no steps were taken to build this plant in the following five-year tenure of the BNP or the two-year tenure of the caretaker government. Even though it has been delayed, the plant is finally being built at Chandpur," the prime minister said. A total of Tk 1,200 crores is being spent to build Chandpur's 150MW combined cycle power plant  a task being undertaken by a Chinese engineering company ChengDa. The plant is supposed to contribute to the national grid from 2012 The prime minister criticised the former four-party coalition government and said, "Not only did they not take steps to increase power generation, they also did not buy any new gas rigs, explore any new gas reserves or dig any new gas wells to increase the gas supply." She also restated government's target to raise power production to 9,426MW by 2015. Hasina said, "Currently, we are scrutinising various options to increase power generation. We are actively analysing the option to establish a nuclear power plant." The prime minister's energy advisor Tawfik-e-Elahi, state minister of power Muhammad Enamul Huq and others were present at the occasion. This was the first visit of the prime minister to Chandpur after commencing office. She visited the area on Jan 27, 2002. Hasina had earlier visited Chandpur as the prime minister during her last tenure on Nov 28, 1998. bdnews
