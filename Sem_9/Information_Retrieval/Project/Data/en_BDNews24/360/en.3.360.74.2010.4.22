 Rajshahi, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  At least four students were injured in a clash between two groups of the Bangladesh Chhatra League of Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology early on Thursday. The injured were identified as Niloy Ahmed, Nixon, Shbho Basak and Shamim Hossain Khan. They were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain Khan said that supporters of BCL activist Al Amin Harun and followers of another BCL activist Rezaul Islam Reza, were locked in a clash at the university's Shahid Lt Selim Hall at around 12:30am. Police went to the spot on hearing the news and brought the situation under control, he said. Al Amin said his rival Reza had been sheltering activists of Chhatra Dal and Shibir. "We protested it, but Reza did not pay any attention," he said. Reza, however, denied the allegation, claiming that Al Amin's followers attacked his group as they were protesting against corruption and tender manipulation on the campus. Additional policemen have been deployed on the campus to avoid further untoward incident, police officer Khan said. Prof Ashraful Alam, director of student welfare, said that the situation on the campus is now under control. He said they would decide on what steps to take after the vice-chancellor returns from Rajshahi. bd
