 Dhaka, Apr 21(bdnews24.com)Manpower agents lamented the government's indifference towards them, saying that despite earning $10 billion every year, they hardly got any incentives. At a meeting with the acting secretary for expatriate welfare ministry, Zafar Ahmad Khan, on Wednesday they demanded stimulus package, partnership in the expatriate welfare bank, Commercially Important Person status. The five-member delegation of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA), headed by its president Golam Mustafa, called on the acting secretary at his office. After the meeting, Mustafa told the reporters, "Licence is being issued under the condition of sending at least 300 people within five years." "BAIRA doesn't consider this an obligatory condition." "It should be lifted," he added. Mustafa said the sector was never given foreign currency as stimulus although it earned $10 billion every year. "We've received the package after much effort." The manpower agents demanded immediate benefits from the package. BAIRA president said the opportunity of exporting domestic aid should be opened for all to ensure smooth competition in the sector. Only 10 agencies are now allowed to conduct such activity. On top of that, BAIRA leaders demanded handing over license to their heirs after death and investment of their deposited money (Tk 5 lakh) in bonds of defence welfare. Khan, the acting secretary said, "I listened to their problems." Positive measures will be taken in this issue, he added. bdnew
