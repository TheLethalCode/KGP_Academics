 Lalmohan, Bhola, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com) --- BNP central leader Moudud Ahmed and his companions were blocked from entering Lalmohan in Bhola. The police said that they tried to enter without the permission of the Election Commission (EC). Regarding the obstruction, Moudud said that the EC was only safeguarding the interests of the government by preventing them from observing the elections. RAB and police stopped the BNP leaders at Kunjer Hat, the entry point of Lalmohan, on Friday, one day before the election in Bhola-3 constituency (Lalmohan-Tajumaddin). BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed, also an MP, was accompanied by vice chairman Abdullah Al Noman, ex minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie, ex MP Majibur Rahman Sarwar, Khairul Kabir Khokon, Ahsan Habib Kamal, Juba Dal president Moazzem Hossain Alal, general secretary Saiful Alam Nirab and others. The high-level delegation of the main opposition of the parliament staged a demonstration at Kunjer Hat till 1.30pm after they were stopped from entry at 11:30am. There was a tussle between the BNP leaders and law enforcers when they tried to break through the cordon after the demonstration. The BNP leaders took position at a near by school building after heated argument between MP Annie and some police members. The constituency is scheduled to see a by-election on Saturday and the EC has issued strict orders to stop all unauthorised persons from entering the polling area. Bhola's additional police super Emran Hossain told bdnews24.com that there is restriction on entering the election zone without authorisation. That is why the team of observers was stopped. EC M Shakhawat Hossain told bdnew24.com: "According section 119 of the constitution, the EC can take any steps to ensure fair election." "We had issued strict instructions not to allow any outsider from entering the election zone after the deadline for campaign has expired." Both candidates, Hafizuddin Ahmed of BNP, and Nurunnabi Shaon of the ruling Awami League, agreed that no outsiders would be allowed in the election area without EC's permission in a meeting with the chief election commissioner last week. BNP was the first to allege that outsiders are engaged in criminal activity in Tajumaddin and Lalmohan. In the demonstration, Moudud said that they were not going to the election area for campaigning. They were going there to meet the candidate. "We also want to observe whether the election is held fairly." Moudud alleged that there were between 1000 and 1500 AL supporters in the area, including MPs. Criticising the government and EC, he also said that this shows the autocratic nature of the government. "And EC is a puppet." He said that the EC was not independent or neutral. "They are just following whatever the government is saying." He also warned that if the election was not held in a fair manner, the opposition would launch a strong movement to oust the government. bdnews24.
