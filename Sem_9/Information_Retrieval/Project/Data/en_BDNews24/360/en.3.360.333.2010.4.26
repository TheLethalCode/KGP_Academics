<TEXT>
 Rajshahi University, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com) -- A BNP-backed teachers' association of Rajshahi University has demanded that steps be taken for the return to Bangladesh of Tarique Rahman, who is currently residing in the UK. Some 147 teachers of the association made this demand in a joint statement on Monday. The statement said that after the changeover of 1/11, many "false politically motivated and harassment" cases were filed against Tarique and he was tortured physically. He should be allowed to return home for the sake of democracy and to be able to make important contributions to the development of the country and to the nation, it said. The teachers demanded that the government and relevant parties take the required steps for removing any obstacles to his return. Tarique, elder son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, is the senior vice president of BNP. bdnew
