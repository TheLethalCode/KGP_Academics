In South-East Asia the bank is working with groups to address the black market for body parts from tigers, common in countries like as China. "Part of what this is about is getting people not to see development and conservation as opposing poles but how you can try to connect them together," Zoellick told Reuters Insider Television.

A World Bank report in 2008 warned that "if current trends persist, tigers are likely to be the first species of large predator to vanish in historic times." A summit in September in Vladivostok, Russia, will try to push for conservation commitments for the world's remaining tig
