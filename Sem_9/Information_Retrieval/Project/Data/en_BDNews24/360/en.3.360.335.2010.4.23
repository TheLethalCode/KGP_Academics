<TITLE> 'Cricketgate' scandal hurts Congress party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A probe into the popular multi-billion dollar cricket league has ensnared senior politicians and billionaire businessmen in a growing scandal that is hurting an already weakened Congress-led government. The resignation of Shashi Tharoor accused of influencing a $333 million bid for an Indian Premier League team has led to a unprecedented tax investigation into the $4.1 billion sport franchise and its powerful chairman, Lalit Modi. The IPL distraction imposes further difficulties on a government struggling to capitalise on its re-election to promote policies that would boost investment and ailing infrastructure as well as reform welfare and subsidies. The scandal has again put Prime minister Manmohan Singh on the defensive as he confronts an emboldened opposition demanding a parliamentary vote of confidence over high fuel prices and tries to salvage bills sidelined by his opponents. For what began as a spat about Junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor spriralled into a media blitz, with taxmen entering offices of team owners that include Bollywood stars. It even led to the brief closure of parliament amid opposition uproar. "Congress gives the appearance of surviving from crisis to crisis," said political analyst Kuldip Nayar. "It hasn't settled down to any business." The opposition has demanded one senior government minister quit over allegations he also used his office to influence IPL bids and the scandal has tensed ties between Congress and a major coalition ally, the NCP, whose leader is close to Modi. This uncertainty comes days before what amounts to a parliamentary confidence motion over high fuel prices - the government raised petrol prices by about 6 percent and diesel by 7.75 percent in February to cut the fiscal deficit. High prices have already prompted two allies to quit the alliance. At least 13 regional parties, led by the Communists, have sought the special vote on Tuesday. And the Hindu nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has been emboldened by a 100,000-strong protest against high food prices on Wednesday. A MATTER OF SURVIVAL The confidence vote will make Congress nervous, given the confusing, fluid coalition parliamentary numbers, but most experts expect it to win. Bond and stock markets are unaffected, with traders anticipating the government will survive. "No party would want elections at this stage, just one year after the formation of the government. So we are confident," said a Congress leader, who asked not to be identified. But it will still complicate matters for Congress, which depends on two main regional parties to secure a majority of 272 seats. At last count, the Congress coalition had the support of roughly 274 lawmakers. "The government will be more nervous about the cut motion than it is about the IPL," said political analyst Amulya Ganguli. While it will likely survive the vote, the motion, plus the IPL scandal, have reduced the chances of getting key bills passed. Talk about legislation has been upstaged by discussion of a Maoist rebel attack that killed 76 policemen this month. A nuclear liability bill that would open up India's nuclear power $150 billion market to US companies, and a $14 billion food bill to provide subsidised grains to millions of poor families appear both to be on the backburner. In another sign of a backlash against the government, the media have criticised what is widely perceived as the political use of the tax agency to persecute the IPL as a vendetta against Modi and his supporters after Tharoor was forced to quit. Some critics said the selective use of the taxman against a major business sent the wrong signal to investors. "The central government seems to have launched a witch hunt", the influential daily The Hindu said in an editorial on Friday. There were signs the government may start to smooth over the row, with Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee playing down a parliamentary probe into the IPL. For some analysts, the heavy-handed response of the government to launch a nationwide tax probe smells of a second-term government increasingly out of touch politically. Prime minister Singh, 77, has also appeared distant over the scandal, a sign he may soon become a lame duck as Congress prepares for his likely successor, Gandhi family scion Rahul Gandhi. "You just don't see Singh in the picture," said Nayar. "He doesn't seem in an authoritative posit
