 Netrokona, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  About 61,000 acres of boro harvest has gone under water as two crop protection dam broke down in Netrokona's haor areas. About 1.5 lakh acres of boro paddy have become submerged in the last 15 days in Mohanganj, Khaliajuri, Madan and Kamlakanda upazilas in Natrakona. These lands went under water as two large harvest protection dams of Char Hizda and Chikadubi in Mohanganj upazila broke down under pressure of rising waters on Tuesday evening. Flood control dams and embankments of Netrokona, Sunamganj and Kishoreganj districts have broken down since the beginning of April due to the onrush of waters from the upper catchments. Mohanganj administration had been working day and night to secure the Charhaizda and Chikadubi dams with the help of local people for the last few days. But all their attempts went in vain faced with the strong currents of the Manu River. Anwarul Haque, the agriculture officer of Mohanganj upazila told bdnews24.com that boro was cultivated on about 434,000 acres in the district. Harunur Rashid, the executive engineer of Netrakona water development board, said that water level of the Monu River rose because of increased water flow from Meghalaya in India. He said that the six harvest protection dams of Kamlakanda upazila were also under serious threat. Some 370,000 acres of boro crops may become submerged if those dams collapsed. bdnews24.
