 Bhola, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  Central BNP leaders went to the Bhola polling area only to 'create a scene', Awami League leader Tofail Ahmed said Friday. Taofail was speaking to reporters at a press briefing in Bhola. Earlier on Friday morning, the police and RAB obstructed central BNP leaders including barrister Moudud Ahmed at 'Kunjer Hat' of Lalmohan upazila. Police said the BNP leaders did not have permission from the Election Commission to enter the polling area. The Election Commission had strictly restricted entrance of any outsiders in the Bhola-3 polling area after the last day of publicity that ended on Thursday, police said. BNP leaders, however, said that AL leaders who were outsiders still remained in the area even though the police obstructed only the BNP leaders. Refuting this accusation, Tofail said, "Awami League has no outsiders here. And I am working here as the chief publicity coordinator of the AL candidate." BNP wants to thwart the election since they are almost certain about their defeat. "But the government will not let them do that." bd
