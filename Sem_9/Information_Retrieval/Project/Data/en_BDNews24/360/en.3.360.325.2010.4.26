 Brahmanbaria, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Juba League, the youth front of the ruling Awami League, distributed sweets to celebrate Ashuganj Zia Fertiliser Factory's new name on Monday. 'Zia' has been dropped from the name of the company based in Ashuganj, Brahmanbaria. New sign-board's without the word 'Zia' appeared on the factory gate on Monday morning. At around 10am the president of local Juba League, Muhammad Hanif Munshi distributed sweets amongst a crowd of Awami League, Juba League and Chhatra League activists at Ashuganj Purba Bazaar. Osman Gani, managing director of the factory told journalists that all the sign-boards and official stationery have now been changed and that from today the company will be known by its new name.. BNP activists, however, brought out a procession and held a protest rally. The present government has renamed many installations including Dhaka and Chittagong airports. When it was first being built in 1973, the urea fertilizer factory was named, 'Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Industries.' However, its name was changed just months after it went into production in December 1981 to 'Ashuganj Zia Fertiliser Factory', bearing the name of slain president Ziaur Rahman, who was killed in a military coup d'tat in the same year. bdnews2
