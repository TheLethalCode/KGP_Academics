<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)Those who helped war criminals integrate into mainstream society will also be tried for offences, state minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku said on Saturday. According to Tuku, it was the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami who rehabilitated war criminals in this country. The discussion on the trial of the war criminals and their rehabilitators was organised by Bangabandhu Academy at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. "The BNP and Jamaat's comments regarding the trial procedure for those prosecuted for crimes during the 1971 war, will be countered both politically and socially," he said at the discussion. Tuku claimed that, "Ziaur Rahman and BNP assisted the perpetrators of 1971. "That's why BNP with Jamaat are threatening to thwart the trial." Junior law minister Quamrul Islam said, "Ziaur Rahman re-established the Razakars and Al-Badrs in Bangladesh. "After the killing of Bangabandhu, there was an attempt to establish a fundamentalist state with the help of the 1971 war criminals." Quamrul termed Zia, the commander of 'Z' force during the War, as an 'intruder', adding that: "He (Zia) participated in the War as a Pakistan spy." He alleged that the BNP-Jamaat led lawyers were trying to create confusion about the tribunal. Senior Awami League leader Suranjit Sengupta said, "BNP and Jamaat are the part of the same body." He said they were so integrated that an impact on one affects another. Suranjit, the head of parliamentary watchdog on the law ministry, said, "When Jamaat gets cold, BNP sneezes. "This is why, BNP is conspiring to foil the trial," he claimed. bdnews24
