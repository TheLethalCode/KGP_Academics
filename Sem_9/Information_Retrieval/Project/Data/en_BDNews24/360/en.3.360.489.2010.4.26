 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The key people behind the mutiny at BDR's Pilkhana headquarters came from 44th Rifles Battalion, the special BDR court in Dhaka heard on Monday.

He told the court that sepoy Selim Reza played the key role when a group of 30 riflesman from the battalion entered the Darbar Hall on the morning of Feb 25, 2009.

Later the court in Dhaka asked authorities to produce all 675 accused border guards before it on Tuesday. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, adjourned the court until then after proceedings began at 9:30 am at the Darbar Hall of the border force's Pilkhana headquarters. 405 accused are currently detained in a case with the New Market Police station, filed in April last year. The remaining 270 were arrested on Monday. They were on duty in the BDR headquarters. Lt Col AKM Golam Rabbani and Maj Sayeed Hassan Taposh assisted the BDR DG during the court proceedings. Deputy attorney general Mohammad Ullah Kislu was present in the court on behalf of the attorney general. Lt Col Kazi Aniruddha, commanding officer of the 44th Rifles Battalion, was the prosecutor.
