 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  False allegations of corruption may bring harsh penalties from now. The cabinet on Monday amended the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004 with a new provision for punishment for false complaint of corruption. The cabinet agreed in principle to punish such complainants with up to five years in prison as well as fines. The decision was made a meeting on Monday, said Abul Kalam Azad, press secretary to the prime minister. The ACC will now be allowed to utilise officials of any government agency for investigation, Azad said. The prime minister has asked everyone to cooperate with the activities of the Anti Corruption Commission, he said. The cabinet on Monday also amended the draft of Bangladesh Environment Preservation Act 2010. It also approved proposals on Bangladesh's involvement into the Youth Employment Network and signing the SAARC Convention on Cooperation on Environment. Azad said the cabinet held discussions on the short, mid and long term projects taken so far by the government in the power sector. The prime minister had apparently urged the countrymen to maintain austerity in consuming power and water, the press secretary said. He said 700MW have already been added to the national grid and another 400MW will be added within two months. bdne
