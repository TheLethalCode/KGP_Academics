 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  The war crimes investigation agency chief Abdul Matin said on Thursday that the special tribunal will prosecute people charged with war crimes even if they are not in the country. "If the accused try to flee, let them do so. They will be tried in absentia," Matin told reporters on Thursday. But the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973, under which the prosecutions will take place, has no separate provision for trials "in absentia"  the term given to trials when the accused is not present. Trials in absentia are allowed under the Criminal Procedure Code 1898  but the 1973 Act specifically states that the criminal code does not apply to these war crimes trials. Supreme Court lawyer Anisul Huq, who was lead prosecutor in the Bangabandhu murder case appeals, told bdnews24.com: "I cannot find any section which says that in absentia trials are allowed. That means they are not allowed." "Sections 16, 17 always contemplate a situation where an accused person will be present before the Tribunal," he said. Section 10(b) of the 1973 Act states: "the Tribunal shall ask each accused person whether he pleads guilty or not-guilty." Section 16(2) states: "A copy of the formal charge and a copy of such of the documents lodged with the formal charge shall be furnished to the accused person at a reasonable time before the trial; and in case of any difficulty in furnishing copies of the documents, reasonable opportunity for inspection shall be given to the accused person in such manner as the Tribunal may decide." According to Section 17 on rights of the accused: "During trial of an accused person he shall have the right to give any explanation relevant to the charge made against him." "An accused person shall have the right to present evidence at the trial in support of his defence, and to cross-examine any witness called by the prosecution." "An accused person shall have the right to present evidence at the trial in support of his defence, and to cross-examine any witness called by the prosecution." Matin could not be reached by bdnews24.com for further comment on Thursday evening. Earlier in the day, he said that the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee published a fresh list of 500 people it claims to be involved in crimes against humanity, mass killing and other war crimes during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The WCFFC had previously submitted a list of 1775 people on Apr 4. "The previous list included names of people who had died. So the committee has prepared and submitted a fresh list, which includes names of another 500 suspected criminals," committee convener MA Hasan told reporters. "Based on the updated list, at least 20 notorious criminals can be detained right now," he said. Hasan also told bdnews24.com that he had information that a number of these accused are now trying to flee, and they should be detained immediately. The 1973 Act in fact states that only a member of the tribunal  meaning one of the three judges appointed by the government  can issue a warrant for someone's arrest, and this can only happen if that person has first been charged with an offence under the Act. A person can only be charged when the court considers that there is sufficient evidence following scrutiny of an investigation report. Hasan told bdnews24.com that the men could, however, be arrested under the Special Powers Act. He also told journalists that Pakistan occupation forces committed 95 percent of the crimes during the war while the remaining five percent were committed by the collaborators -- Rajakar, Al-Badr and Al-Shams. bdnews2
