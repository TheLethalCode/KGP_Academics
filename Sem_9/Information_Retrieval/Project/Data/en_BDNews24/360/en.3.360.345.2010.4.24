 UNITED NATIONS, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran has withdrawn its bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council amid growing criticism of what one advocacy group said on Friday was Tehran's "appalling human rights record." UN diplomats told Reuters that Iran had informed other Asian delegations that it withdrew its candidacy for a seat on the 47-nation council based in Geneva that is responsible for monitoring rights around the globe. One Western diplomat said that Tehran had pulled out after it became apparent that it might not secure enough votes to win a seat, which would have embarrassed Iran when council elections take place next month.

"This shows that when there's a choice, it makes a difference," Hicks said. With the withdrawal of Iran, there are no longer any contested ballots, she added. The countries running for the four Asian seats are Malaysia, Maldives, Qatar and Thailand. The elections will take place during a meeting of the General Assembly on May 13. Last year the United States successfully campaigned for a seat on the Human Rights Council, a body the previous US administration had shunned as anti-Israeli and soft on a number of authoritarian governments.
