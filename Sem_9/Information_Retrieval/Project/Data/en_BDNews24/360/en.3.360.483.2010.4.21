 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque was granted bail in a defamation case. The CMM court gave him bail in a case filed by advocate Mashiur Malek on March 23 in reaction to a statement on the alleged involvement of the prime minister's son in the VOIP business. Farroque surrendered to the court on Wednesday and was granted bail by magistrate AKM Emdadul Huq. The High Court bench comprising justice Abdul Wahab Mea and justice Md Abdur Razzaque directed him to submit to the CMM court in eight weeks. The case stated that Farroque on March 11 at the Jatiya Sangsad and on March 12 at a press conference at Gulshan said that Sajib Ahmed Wazed, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, was involved in illegal VOIP business and BNP had information about it. Advocate Malek, president of the Bangabandhu Foundation, claimed that it had also defamed him. An arrest warrant was issued against the accused on the date that the case was filed.
