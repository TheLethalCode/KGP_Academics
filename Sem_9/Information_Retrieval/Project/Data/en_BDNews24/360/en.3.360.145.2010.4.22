<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP is no longer seeking a week's delay to the Bhola by-election even though its candidate had demanded so on Wednesday. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain made it clear at a briefing on Thursday that the party would be taking part in the polls due for next Saturday. "The BNP is attending the polls. If the government rigs the result, the situation will turn bad," he said at the briefing at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed has made no further comment about his previous day's demand. On Wednesday he demanded that the polls be delayed by a week since, he said, there were many outsiders and illegal arms in the area. A BNP delegation led by standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan went to the Commission on Thursday and alleged that supporters of BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami were being arrested in Bhola. The Commission in a letter issued on the home ministry asked it not to crack down on opposition activists without the commission's order. Delwar spoke of the 1994 by-polls in Magura which allegedly were rigged during the BNP government's regime, leading the then opposition Awami League to launch a street agitation against that government. "Awami League launched movement over the issue. We want to make it clear to the government that we will follow suit if the result of by-polls is rigged," he said. The BNP leader alleged that the Commission is not working neutrally. "The commission is working for the government. The same commission, appointed by the caretaker regime, staged the national elections on Dec 29 (2008) as part of a blueprint. The party has been critical of the Commission since it rejected its demand for army deployment. On Hafiz's demand for postponement of polls the day before, Delwar said: "I presume our candidate has demanded postponement of the polls by seven days for recovery of illegal arms. "We want a free and fair election there." BNP vice-president Abdullah Al Noman has said in Bhola on Thursday that they were going to vote. Earlier, he met with the district's returning officer in the morning to have the party's central leaders see the election. A 20-member team of BNP central leaders will monitor the election, he said. Returning officer Nuruzzaman Talukder said they had completed all preparations for the elections. bdn
