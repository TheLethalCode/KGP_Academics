 NEW DELHI, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian police said on Thursday they were taking seriously a specific US warning of possible attacks on New Delhi shopping centres, an alert that underlines challenges for a city hosting the Commonwealth Games in October.

"We had part of this alert already, and now with the US alert we have activated our forces further, especially in markets," special police commissioner Neeraj Kumar said. India raised security in the aftermath of a bombing that killed 17 people in western India in February, the first major attack in the country since the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 peo
