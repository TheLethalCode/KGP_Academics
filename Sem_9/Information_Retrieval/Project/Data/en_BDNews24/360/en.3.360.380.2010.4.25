 JERUSALEM Apr 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US Middle East envoy ended a three-day peace mission on Sunday with no sign of any breakthrough in efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but he said he would return next week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, briefing his cabinet on his meetings with George Mitchell, said it would soon become clear whether peace talks suspended since December 2008 would get under way.

On Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged US President Barack Obama to impose a solution to the Middle East conflict that would give the Palestinians an independent state. Abbas's appeal to Obama came amid widespread media reports that the US president was considering floating a proposal that would set the contours of a final peace deal.
