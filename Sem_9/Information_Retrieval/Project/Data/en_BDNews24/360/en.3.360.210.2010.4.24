 BARCELONA, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Catalans marked the festival of San Jordi on Friday by exchanging gifts of roses and books but the volume Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola was given might not be entirely appropriate before a week that could make or break the Spanish and European champions' season. Guardiola, who led Barca to an unprecedented six trophies last year, told a news conference he had received the book 'In praise of pessimism' by French philosopher and historian Lucien Jerphagnon. "I am serious," the 39-year-old said with a smile. It could be considered an unusual choice given Barca's task of overturning a 3-1 deficit in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Inter Milan.

We know it's going to take a lot of effort." "It's always difficult playing between the two legs of a Champions League semi-final," he said of the Xerez match. "For us it's very dangerous this game. We have been 11 months fighting for the league. We can't lose this chance tomorrow." Some of the book titles listed on Barca's website (www.fcbarcelona.cat) on Friday would probably be more appropriate San Jordi gifts, including "Leadership Guardiola", "Let's go Barca!" and one about the club's youth programme: "Heroes of the Masia". Guardiola noted there were several books out about him and commented: "It was good because even I didn't know I had done certain things. It's great being Barca co
