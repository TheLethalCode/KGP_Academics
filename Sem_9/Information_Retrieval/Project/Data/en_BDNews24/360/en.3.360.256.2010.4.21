<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University was paralysed on Wednesday as an indefinite strike called by the Bangladesh Chhatra League entered its fifth day. The strike was called due to the death on 16 Apr of a BCL activist Md Asaduzzaman during a clash with local people. The demonstrators on Wednesday prevented an empty university bound shuttle train from reaching the university, taking the driver away with them. University buses for teachers, and the private bus company taking students to the university also did not function fearing vandalism. Sadikur Rahman, a student of Public Administration department and resident of F Rahman Hall, told bdnews24.com that throughout the day the campus was almost empty. No classes were held in any department. The Public Administration department was forced to suspend its prescheduled exams on Wednesday for lack of students. BCL general secretary Ershad Hossain said that the students would not stop their strike until those responsible for their colleague's killing were arrested, the vice-chancellor resigned and there was improved security for students. bdnews24.
