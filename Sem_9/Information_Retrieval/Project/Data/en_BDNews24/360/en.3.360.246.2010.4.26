 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday stayed proceedings of four defamation suits against Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for three months. It also asked the home and law secretaries and magistrates of the related courts to explain within the next four weeks why the proceedings should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Hasan Arif gave the order on a petition filed by the BNP leader. The defamation suits were filed in Panchagarh, Narail, Khulna and Thakurgaon for his comment on the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Chowdhury on Aug 14 said in a meeting that the Aug 15, 1975 was necessary. Advocate Shah Manjurul Haque argued for the petitioner while attorney general Mahabubey Alam represented the government. bdnews24.co
