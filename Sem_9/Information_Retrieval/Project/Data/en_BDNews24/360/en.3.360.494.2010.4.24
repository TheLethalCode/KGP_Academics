<TITLE> Bhutan for common climate strategy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Thimphu, April 24 (bdnews24.com)Bhutan will call for a common SAARC position on climate change at the upcoming summit scheduled for April 28-29. The host would further like to strengthen that call with a proposal for a roadmap to implement the measures. Daw Panjo, Bhutanese foreign secretary, said this on Saturday at a reception for journalists in Thimphu. However, the Bhutanese proposal is unlikely to move forward as diplomatic observers fear that the SAARC member states cannot take a common position on legally binding emission cuts because of Indian opposition. Under the SAARC charter, any proposal must be adopted unanimously by all member countries. Although seven out of eight South Asian countries have been demanding a common position at the climate negotiations, the biggest SAARC member and emerging economy, India, has been against the legally binding emission cut at the United Nations Climate talks. It is worth nothing that the SAARC environment ministers at a conference on climate change in Dhaka in 2008 failed to agree on mandatory emission reduction. "The SAARC member countries will be heavily affected by climate change," Panjo told the reception, adding that his country was happy as climate change had been selected as the central theme of the 16th summit of SAARC. He said the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation should have a common position on the next climate change talks in Mexico. "Bhutan will propose a roadmap for collective response to this problem (climate change)," said the secretary. At the Copenhagen talks last year, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka demanded legally binding emission cuts from the major polluters such as China, US, India, Brazil and other industrialised countries. But China and India rejected the idea forthwith. Bangladesh has a bigger stake in the climate change issue because of widespread fear underlined by a report of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that a significant portion of Bangladesh would be inundated by the rising sea in addition to severe drought by the middle of this century. Besides, the Maldives is also likely to suffer as experts predict it would be wiped off the global map unless green house gas emissions are checked immediately. Bhutan, having 72 percent greenery, and Nepal fear that the temperature rise would result in more melting of Himalayan glaciers leading to environmental disasters. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will also be affected by climate change, experts say. b
