 Bhola, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP candidate for the upcoming Bhola by-election demanded that the poll, due to be held on 24 April, be postponed for one-week. Maj Hafizuddin Ahmed said on Wednesday that there are still many "outsiders" present around the polling area. He also claimed that there were illegal arms in the area. "It is not possible to hold a fair election if the outsiders are not ejected from the area and the illegal arms are not recovered," the BNP contender said. He was talking to reporters at a press briefing at his residence at Lalmohan in Bhola. bdnew
