 Dhaka, April 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's call for duty-free access of products to the US market received a boost according to a press statement from the Bangladesh embassy in Washington. A US Congressman said that the country had a "deserving case" to get preferential access to US markets, the statement says. The statement came following a meeting between a Bangladeshi business delegation and several US Congressmen to lobby for a bill called the New Partnership and Development Act (NPDA) which has already been placed in the US Congress. Bangladesh's ambassador to USA, Akramul Qader, was present at the meeting. The embassy statement said that US Congressmen Jim McDermott and Keith Ellison reassured the Bangladeshi delegation that they would work to get the bill passed.
