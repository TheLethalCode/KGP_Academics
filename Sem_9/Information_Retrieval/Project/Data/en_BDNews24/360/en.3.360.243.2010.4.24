 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  A group of lawyers and individuals, with noted Awami League leanings, has explained the recent confusions over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide during the Liberation War of 1971. The group, comprising of people like the law minister, head of the parliamentary standing committee watchdog on law ministry, Suranjit Sengupta, attorney general Mahbubey Alam, answered a many of these questions on Thursday at the Supreme Court Bar Council auditorium. After the formation of tribunal, prosecution panel and the investigating agency in line with the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973, opposition BNP and Jamaat have questioned the effectiveness of the Act. However, the lawyers' group stated, "Trial of the collaborators of the Pakistani army shall be a transparent, neutral and of international standard." BNP and Jamaat-backed lawyers demanded that justice could not be ensured under the 1973 act at a seminar on Apr 16. The National Forum for Protection of Human Rights (NFPHR), headed by former speaker and BNP leader Jamiruddin Sircar, hosted the seminar. They urged for amendments claiming that the convicts would not be able to appeal. Thursday's meeting was organised by Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee and Citizens' Commission on War Crimes, moderated by a stalwart of the committee, Shahriar Kabir, and presided by professor Kabir Chowdhury. The lawyers mentioned that questions from the BNP-Jamaat sections raised confusions. However, according to Section 21 of the Amendment to the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act, a party has the right to appeal to the Appellate Division against a sentence, conviction or acquittal within 60 days of the ruling. Regarding the AL's position on trying war criminals, law minister Shafique Ahmed said, "The accusation is not correct." "Earlier we have said that we would try the Bangladeshis who assisted Pakistan army during the war," he defended. He said the government was considering enactment of a law to provide security for the witnesses during the trial. "The home ministry has already taken measures to secure the members of the tribunal, prosecution panel and the probe agency," the minister added. Shahdin Malik contradicted with those who contended that tribunal was not of global standard. "My experience on law says, they had said so either out of ignorance or they were just lying." He elaborates: "An accused can defend, appoint a counsel, quiz the witnesses and even appeal if the charges are proved." Suranjit said, "Laws do not go old. It is not so late to conduct the trials even after 39 years." "Trials of the Second World War are still ongoing." He reminded that Bangabandhu initiated the trial of 60,000 criminals under the Dalal Act. "He did not award the general amnesty to the Razakars and Al-Badars. He said that post 1975 regimes and their coteries have rehabilitated these people. Professor Mizanur Rahman Khan said, "Appointment of judges is not a choice of the accused." He said that the state had the right to appoint judges as it saw fit. Countering Jamaat's claim, that 'no country could prove the complaints brought against them', justice Syed Amirul Huq said said, "People know what misdeeds they did in '71." bdnew
