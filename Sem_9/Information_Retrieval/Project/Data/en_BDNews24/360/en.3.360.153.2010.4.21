<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh should primarily focus on attracting investment in infrastructure, especially power, said speakers at a discussion on Wednesday. They noted that it was the key for attracting further investment in other areas. Although the discussion was supposed to be on investment, speakers deliberated mainly on the severe power and energy crisis. Leading businessman Mir Nasir Hossain, a former FBCCI president, pointed out that investments were on the rise from 2001 but there was a decline from the 2007-08 fiscal due to the unavailability of gas and power. "It's still decreasing." He said the industrial productivity had halved due to the power crisis. Touching on energy, Hossain emphasised that gas transmission needed to be improved along with an added urgency on exploration of new gas-field. Referring to Aggreko's deal of supplying 200 MW power by the next three months, he said that it was a laudable initiative, but a delayed one. "We hope that in future such decisions will come sooner." The Public Private Partnership (PPP) process should be expedited as it can bring further investments into power. Former central bank chief Salehuddin Ahmed echoed him. "It's very urgent to sort out all the details of PPP as it is hampering investments in the power sector," he said. Replying a query on the recent unsolicited contract awarded to Aggreko for rental power, Ahmed said that such a "short cut" was not necessary if the process had started a year ago. "However, the legal issues regarding this deal should be carefully reviewed." He added that the criteria of awarding such contracts along with its details should be made public to ensure transparency. The ex-governor of Bangladesh Bank pointed out that there was no constraint of funds at the moment. "It would be clear from the figures of national savings, remittance and the current account surplus." The task now, is to channel those resources properly, he added. Responding to the PPP issue, Syed A Samad, who heads the government's investment wing, said that the PPP guidelines have been "almost finalised". "It has been sent to the cabinet," said the executive chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI). He, however, said that at least seven projects under PPP were underway. "Four of them are energy sector projects." The only way out of the dismal investment scenario is through infrastructure development projects, according to businessman Waliur Rahman Bhuiyan. "If infrastructure is not satisfactory then there is no use of investment campaigns like road shows." The issue of coal extraction also came up in the question and answer session. Replying to a query, Bhuiyan said that a quick decision on coal was of prime necessity. He also noted that the strong opposition to coal extraction saying that people take to the streets whenever the issue arises. "As if they are more patriotic than us, businessmen." Mir Nasir agreed, saying that there was no alternative to switching to coal-fired power plants. Responding to another question, he said that he personally believed open pit mining was the only way for maximum extraction of coal. "But, it's important to address the environmental concerns along with compensating the loss of arable lands and ensuring proper water management." The discussion was co-organised by the Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund.
