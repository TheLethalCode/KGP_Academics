 Gazipur, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested a youth under suspicion of being a member of the banned militant Islamist outfit Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) at Munsipara, Gazipur on Monday. Abdur Rashid, OC of Joydebpur Police Station said that two journalists had suspected the youth having observed his behavior and attitude while he was taking breakfast at a small restaurant at Munsipara at around 9am. They informed the police immediately upon realising that the youth had a striking similarity with that of a JMB militant's photo published in the daily Sangbad on November 15, 2009. That issue of the newspaper, with a headline relating to the militant Islamist group's probable course of action in future, was lying on the table where the youth had his breakfast. Then the police arrested the youth and took him to Joydevpur Police Station for questioning. The interrogation was still underway at the time of filing this report at 1.30pm. The police said that the youth was giving them contradictory information. At times he claimed that his name was Rahat while at other times he said that he was Saiful. He has claimed to hail from Gafargaon in Mymensingh. bd
