 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Aaus-growing farmers in 51 districts will get government incentives to raise production under a project, according to the agriculture minister. The scheme aims to help to offset the losses of Boro crops in the districts with haors due to untimely flooding. Minister Matia Chowdhury told a press conference on Wednesday that the finance ministry approved the Tk 260 million project. She said the flooding damaged an estimated 56,000 tonnes of boro crop on 40,000 hectares in greater Sylhet, Netrakona and Kishoreganj districts. "The affected farmers will get financial support from the government... But it's not possible to recoup the losses by providing support to the affected. "So we've undertaken the project to give incentives to the Aaus growers to help offset the loss," the minister said. Under the project, 46,100 small and marginal farmers in the 51 districts will get 20 kg urea, 10 kg triple super phosphate (TSP) and muriate of potash (MoP) fertilisers each for Aaus crop. The ministry expects the assistance will raise Aaus production by 16,000 tonnes. Chowdhury said the government will buy 6,922 tonnes of urea, 3,461 tonnes of TSP and 3,461 tonnes of MoP fertilisers, which will be distributed by the deputy commissioners and district agriculture offers. She, however, said they have information from the grassroots level that despite the crop loss, this year's overall Boro production would not fall behind the previous year. On ensuring the fair price of agriculture products for the farmers, she said the government has fixed procurement prices of paddy and rice at Tk 17 and Tk 25 a kg. The ministry will monitor the procurement process to ensure that the farmers get the prices. Agriculture secretary CQK Mushtaq Ahmed, additional secretary Kazi Akhtar Hossain and seed wing director general Anwar Faruque were present at the press conference. b
