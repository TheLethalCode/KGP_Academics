 Bhola, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP candidate for Bhola by-polls, Hafiz Uddin Ahmed alleged his party representatives were not allowed to enter the polling area. Hafiz made statement at his house at Lalmohan Upazila in Bhola at a briefing on Friday afternoon. Hafiz claimed that criminals were moving about with arms but the law enforcement agencies did not arrest. "But they attacked BNP supporters." He also claimed that about 300 BNP supporters had been injured in attacks by the ruling party men in the polling area. The media and national leaders have been to ensure that the elections scheduled on Saturday may be rigged, he said. A team of the main opposition, BNP, led by Moudud Ahmed, was obstructed from entering the polling area. Echoing the central leaders of the BNP, he warned that the movement to oust the ruling AL government will begin from Bhola-3 if there was any kind of rigging or if the supporters are obstructed from going to the polling centres. He also criticised the Awami League's election coordinator for Bhola-3, Tofail Ahmed's comments. He demanded that there should be no polling agents appointed from outside the polling area. "Polling agents have been employed according the public representative order. But criminals are threatening our agents not to go to the polling centres," he said. Regarding Tofail's briefing session, Hafiz pointed out that Motijheel Juba League president Saif, Munir of Bhola Juba League, Majnu Molla, Munna and Shawpan were present behind the senior leader of Awami League. "But they come from outside the polling area." Tofail Ahmed had said that he did not even allow the Bhola Awami League president stay in the polling area while the central Awami League leaders were staying in Bholaa and well outside the polling area. Hafiz said he was certain of winning the by-elections if the elections were held in a free and fair manner
