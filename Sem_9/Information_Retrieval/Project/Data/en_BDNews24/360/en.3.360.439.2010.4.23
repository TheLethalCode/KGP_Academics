 Dhaka, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com) The BNP is using the Bhola by-election polls to initiate a movement against the government, and is not concerned about actually winning the election, ruling Awami League leaders said on Friday. Joint general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif said at a press briefing at Sheikh Hasina's political office in the capital's Dhanmondi that the opposition candidate knew that he would lose, and was only taking part to assist the BNP's high-command. "BNP's candidate Major Hafiz will face certain defeat. But Begum Zia will have certain triumph. She will have created the issue that she needed to start a movement," Hanif said. When Hanif was asked why he was so certain of the BNP candidate's defeat, he said, "We have reviewed Bhola people's sentiments. Major Hanif will surely be defeated." Hafiz formed his own criminal groups after wining the national election in 2001, Hanif claimed. "So the people, this time, will reject him." Hanif also alleged that after the military-installed interim government took power in 2007, the BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and the party's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed had accused Hafiz of being involved in Ziaur Rahman's murder. It was also alleged by Hanif that at least 500 activists of the BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and youth wing Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal had come from outside Bhola to hamper a fair election. Hanif also expressed his shame that BNP MPs Mujibur Rahman Sarwar and Shaheed Uddin Chowdhury Annie remain in Bhola despite the election commission requesting them to leave the constituency. The AL leader also accused BNP of creating tension in the country through the mass media. "BNP wants to misguide the people of the country providing false and manipulated information," Hanif said. AL organising secretaries AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury and Abu Sayed Al Mahmud Swapan also spoke at the briefing.
