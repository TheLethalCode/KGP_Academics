<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner has termed the Bhola-3 by-election fair and peaceful. "We think the result, whatever it is, reflects the people's mandate," CEC ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters Saturday evening. Meanwhile, regarding BNP's demand for resignation of the commissioners, he said, "The political culture of demanding resignation, whenever someone loses an election, needs to be changed." The two other commissioners were also present by his side. The CEC said, "There may have been some lapses. But these minor things could be ignored." Citing the example of the United States, he said, "No election is 100 percent successful, not even in the US." Hinting that there might be a slight margin of error, he said: "Those, who manage elections, are also human beings." "But regardless, elections must be well organised, and is exactly what has happened here." Regarding the demand for his resignation, Huda said, "I've heard of it several times before. I don't want to comment on this." The defeated party alleges of being driven out or tortured, he said. "But, why don't we accept the people's mandate?" The CEC urged for acceptance of an election result coming away from the prevailing culture of denial and rejection. "Otherwise democracy in Bangladesh will not be strengthened." Huda said that the commission tried its best to make the election a success. It appointed returning officers from within the organisation and brought presiding officers from outside the constituency. "There used to even murders in the by-polls. But, in this case there was no use of fire-arms this time." Regarding the absence of polling agents in 37 centres, Huda said, "A certain political party would not appoint their agents and demanded to bring in outsiders although it had been agreed that outsiders would not be allowed." "How is it possible if they can't manage agents from their own area?" The CEC said that the decision of not allowing outsiders in the centres was taken during an earlier visit to the constituency. The EC on Saturday suspended voting in nine centres, out of 86, "after investigating complaints from different sources." "We've suspended centres, wherever there was a problem. Many polling officers were disappointed at these decisions." BNP placed complaints against 30 centres, he noted. "But they have to be investigated." bdne
