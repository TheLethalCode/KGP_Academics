 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar, has injured a finger on his right hand during the semi-final against Royal Challengers Bangalore, making him uncertain for the final on Sunday, reports Cricinfo. Tendulkar, who was bleeding after attempting a low slip catch, rushed back to the dressing room and had five stitches. Despite the injury, Tendulkar hoped to feature in the final. "My right hand is not too great. Split my webbing and got five stitches. But hopefully I will recover for the final," he said. Tendulkar sustained the injury in the fourth over of Royal Challengers Bangalore's chase, when Rahul Dravid edged Zaheer Khan. Replays indicated a part of the ball had touched the ground as Tendulkar clasped it, and the batsman was ruled not out. Tendulkar was injured in the process, bleeding from his right hand, and immediately made his way to the pavilion for some medical attention. Zaheer, who led Mumbai in Tendulkar's absence on the field, said his team will take a call on his participation in the final in two days. "We are little bit worried but we will take a couple of days to decide (on his availability for the final)," Zaheer said. "Every team he has played for has relied on him. It was unfortunate he got out early today and got injured. But we have reached the final and all the credit goes to him. I hope he plays in the finals. We all expect him to play. We just have to remain patient." Tendulkar's was not the only injury worry for Mumbai Indians. Man of the match Kieron Pollard injured his knee while batting, but came back to bowl an exceptional spell to pick three wickets. He was confident of being ready in time for the big game. "After running the first two runs, I twinged my knee. But it feels good now, and hopefully I should be fit for the final," Pollard
