 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud secured bail in two defamation cases on Thursday. In the morning, Dhaka's Metropolitan magistrate Mostafa Shahriar Khan granted him bail in a case filed by Bangabandhu Foundation president Moshiur Malik. Malik filed the case against Maumud on Mar 25 for saying that state minister for law Qamrul Islam was not a real lawyer. He reportedly said at a meeting in Cox's Bazar that Islam was like "a lawyer under a banyan tree". In the afternoon, another metropolitan magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque granted him bail in a second defamation case, relating to the same same set of facts, filed by Awami Ainjibi Parishad member PK Abdur Rob.
