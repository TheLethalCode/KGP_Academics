 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, April 22 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will meet her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the 16th summit of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Thimphu next week. Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao on Thursday said that a bilateral meeting between Hasina and Singh in Thimphu had been finalised. Both Hasina and Singh will attend the 16th summit of the SAARC, which is scheduled to be held in the Bhutanese capital on April 28 and 29 next. Diplomatic sources said that the two Prime Ministers would review progress in the implementation of several initiatives to enhance bilateral cooperation announced in the landmark joint statement issued after their meeting in New Delhi in January this year. They are also expected to discuss Indian assistance in infrastructure projects in Bangladesh. During Hasina's visit to New Delhi; Singh had announced a Line of Credit of US $ 1 billion for a range of projects, including railway infrastructure, supply of broad gauge locomotives and passenger coaches, rehabilitation of Saidpur Workshop, procurement of buses and dredging projects. Hasina is also expected to request Singh to give a political push to the negotiation on an interim bilateral agreement for sharing of water of Teesta. A ministerial meet of the Joint River Commission in New Delhi last month failed to conclude negotiations on an interim deal and ended merely with the exchange of drafts. Both Singh and Hasina in the joint statement issued on January 12 underscored the role of the SAARC in promoting regional cooperation. They had "agreed to work together in making SAARC a purposeful organization oriented towards implementation, which can revitalize the region through positive measures, concerted action and mutually reinforcing cooperation."
