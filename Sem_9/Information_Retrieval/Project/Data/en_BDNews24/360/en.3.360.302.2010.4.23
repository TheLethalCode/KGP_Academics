 TALLINN, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO ministers on Friday met to discuss how to cut troop numbers in Afghanistan next year, but the alliance is struggling to send enough trainers to help Afghan forces take over security so foreign troops can go home. NATO's 28 members backed a plan by US President Barack Obama last year for a substantial boost in international troop numbers to allow time to train up Afghan forces. Obama's aim was to allow Washington to begin pulling some US troops out of the country by July of 2011, a goal that has always appeared ambitious given a widening Taliban insurgency. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen went into a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in the Estonian capital Tallinn saying the alliance was still short of 450 personnel to train Afghan security forces. "For transition to take effect, we need Afghan forces to play their part, which means we need trainers," he said. While 850 military trainers had been pledged in the past two months, hundreds more were needed, he said. "Those trainers have a big effect. I will encourage foreign ministers to see what they can do to free up these mission-critical resources." NATO officials have said that if Afghan security forces are to reach a target of 300,000 personnel in 2011, at least 1,000 more trainers will be needed on top of Rasmussen's figures. PRINCIPLES FOR TRANSITION Rasmussen said the meeting would agree the principles and decision-making process for the transfer of security responsibility to Afghan forces, a process NATO hopes to start in some more stable districts this year. "We will ensure that transition takes place when clear political and military conditions are in place," Rasmussen said. He told Friday's meeting the Afghan government was already taking more responsibility for running the country. "We are preparing to begin the process of handing over leadership, where conditions allow, back to the Afghan people. The future of this mission is clear and visible: more Afghan capability and more Afghan leadership." The Afghan government's past failure to deliver services and security in areas from which the Taliban have been pushed out is seen as a major threat to NATO strategy and the aim of cutting a foreign troop commitment that now exceeds 120,000. At a conference this week at the US Marine Corps University in Virginia, US and Afghan officials listed dozens of obstacles to boosting Afghan capabilities and the credibility of a government seen by many as inefficient and corrupt. They highlighted particular problems with the performance of the police, only about 30 percent of whom have any training. NATO has also struggled to persuade countries to provide funds to run the Afghan army. As of mid-April, only 274 million euros ($368 million) had been pledged or contributed to a trust fund for this purpose, against an annual requirement estimated at $1.8 billion (1.3 billion eur
