 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for power and energy Enamul Haque said that the present government has added nearly 700 megawatts of electricity to the national grid since it came to power. "The government is working to ensure a supply of fuel so that it can produce 9,426 megawatt of electricity by 2015," he added. "The country has a comprehensive energy problem," said the minister speaking at a 'meet the energy reporters' programme in the capital, on Wednesday. Shortage of electricity has forced the government to resort to 'load-shading'. He also criticised the last BNP-led government for not adding any power during its tenure. "No effective steps were made to explore oil-gas and to mine coal during that period. The result is this terrible energy crisis," he said. He said that the shortage of power during the summer could have been minimised had the power plants been supplied with required gas. At present the country is failing to generate 500-700 megawatt of electricity every day simply due to gas shortage, said the minister. He added that investment in the power sector will in the future come from public private partnership. He hoped that 40 to 50 percent of the total finance would come from the private sector. bdnew
