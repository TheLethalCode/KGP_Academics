 Dhaka, April 22 (bdnews24.com)  The threats and challenges of terrorism are of common concern. Visiting US deputy secretary of state James B Steinberg also said on Thursday that they should be fought collectively. He emphasised the importance of regional alliances in tackling terrorism. Referring to the development of Bangladesh's relationship with India and China, Steinberg added that bilateral understanding was important to address common issues. In response to a question, he said US companies would become interested to invest in the energy sector if the environment improves. "The US would like to improve relations with Bangladesh especially in the private sector through educational exchanges aimed at exploring economic opportunities," he said. He also said that more could be done between the two nations on issues like climate change, food security and counter terrorism. Earlier in a meeting with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the US diplomat stressed the need for closer ties and more concerted efforts between the two countries. Steinberg mentioned various sectors, including power and gas. Hasina told the US official that her government had taken bold steps in countering terrorism and is serious on eradicating corruption. She said, "We have already strengthened the anti-corruption commission." "Now we have accelerated our activities to strengthen the local government bodies and democratic institutions to attain expected development," she added. Steinberg also met Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition, on Thursday evening. During the hour-long meeting they spoke about a number of different issues include democratic processes and counter-terrorism. Steinberg is the most senior official of the Obama administration to visit Bangladesh since it came to power in January 2009. He arrived at Dhaka on April 22. He serves as the principal deputy to secretary of state and former first lady Hillary Clinton
