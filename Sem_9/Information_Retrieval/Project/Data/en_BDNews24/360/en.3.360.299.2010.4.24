 Dhaka, Apr 24 (bdnews24.com) Awami League's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon secured a commanding lead over his BNP rival Hafiz Uddin Ahmed after resultst of 54 centres. Shaon, with 69,528 votes was leading Hafiz by almost 40,000 votes as counting continued at the other centres. The nine centres where voting was suspended account for some 31,000 votes. The total number of voters registered under the constituency is 234,926 votes. Voting ended at 4pm on Saturday with strong allegations from the main opposition BNP. Hafiz Uddin Ahmed demanded the elections be declared null and void, due to widespread irregularities, violence and intimidation by ruling party activists. He alleged law enforcers, Election Commission and the ruling party of colluding to defeat the BNP. "The EC, RAB, police and local officials abetted the ruling Awami League to stage a farce of an election." BNP leaders in Dhaka echoed Hafiz saying they would not accept the results. Mirza Abbas, member of the party's standing committee, said, "BNP will reject the result of this election," at a press conference at its Naya Paltan office in the afternoon. The BNP leader demanded a new schedule for the election. Moreover, BNP also demanded immediate resignation of chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and two other commissioners. "We want the chief election commissioner and the two other commissioners to step-down," he said. Regarding Maj Hafiz's demand, Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif, the AL joint general secretary, from a press conference after the polls, said, "It is completely out of the question." "It is unfortunate that one demands cancellation of the elections whenever one looses. It has turned into a culture." Hanif brushed off the allegations made by Hafiz Uddin. Although Awami League leaders claimed that the election was conducted fairly and peacefully, suspension of voting at nine centres, out of 86, which is over 10 percent, lent some credence to BNP's allegations. Commission officials said that they had suspended voting because of irregularities. The nine centres are Lalmohan Public Library and Women's College, Azharuddin Primary School, Bheduria Sherazia Senior Madrassah, Shatani Primary and Secondary School, Kishoreganj Primary School, Maheshkhali Ashrafia Primary School, North Annada Prashad Primary School, Lord Hardinge Fazil Madrassah and Syedabad Forkania Madrassah. Earlier in the morning, at least six people were injured during a clash between the supporters of the ruling party and the main opposition BNP, witnesses said. A team of BNP leaders led by BNP standing committee member MK Anwar met the Chief Election Commissioner Shamsul Huda in Dhaka and told him that in 37 centres there were no polling agents representing BNP. Returning officer Nuruzzaman Talukder said he had no knowledge of such incident, but, he said, "We cannot allow anybody as agent who cannot show his identity and other valid documents." Hafiz Uddin Ahmed carried the seat in 1991 (44.9 percent votes) as an independent and winning in 1996 (with 59 percent of the votes) and in 2001 (with 65.8 percent votes). However, he lost in 2008 with 45.7 percent votes while the AL candidate won with 52.8 percent. bdnews24.com/corr/mhc/su
