 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com) - - The Petrol Pump Owners Association and the Tank Lorry Owners Association will start an indefinite strike from May 9 if eight demands are not met. On Monday afternoon, the Tank Lorry Owners' Association president Syed Sajjadul Karim Kabul declared this programme in a press conference at the press club. "We are submitting eight legal demands to the government," he said. He said that that he hoped the government will show good intentions in implementing the demands  but if they do not, from 6:00am May 9 they will stop, throughout the country, the transport of all kinds of fuels including that used for aircraft. The demands include starting accident insurance for drivers, stopping police harassment, construction of separate rest room for the drivers in the terminals and tank-lorry parking places, increasing the numbers of highway police, an exemption on the payment of VAT when they import chassis, and limitation on the import of lorries. He also demanded that the owners should be paid in accordance with a July 1 instruction from the fuel and mineral resources ministry. A written statement said that previously the government has made several promises and have signed agreements but they did not implement them. So the tank-lorry owners now feel discontented. "We have allowed the government a long time to meet our demands  but it appears that the government was not sincere." Despite difficult circumstances, the tank-lorry owners and workers have maintained continuous supply of fuel, the statement added. They hoped to receive the support of the public in meeting their just demands. Vice president of the association Shahajada Anowarul Kadir, central leader Abdul Malek, Mijanur Rahman Ratan, Abdul Mamin Dulal, Tofajjal Hossain, Mijanur Rahman and others were also present in press conference.
