<TITLE> Govt plan for tribal role on Pakistan border at risk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Apr 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After clearing some of Pakistan's most dangerous Taliban insurgents from their South Waziristan bastion, the army faces another decisive battle -- persuading tribal leaders it's safe to return. Ethnic Pashtun tribal elders have historically held sway in South Waziristan and their return would be a vote of confidence in the government, which is under mounting pressure to stabilise Pakistan -- a front-line state in the US war on militancy. Last October, a Pakistan army offensive destroyed Taliban bases, killed hundreds of fighters and forced many others to flee South Waziristan. But discussions between the state and members of South Waziristan's dominant Mehsud tribe on repatriation are stalled, said Senator Saleh Shah, who has taken part in the discussions. Tribal elders, mindful that the Taliban assassinated many in their ranks, are demanding security guarantees. The military has promised to help but it also wants their help in tracking down 370 Taliban "terrorists", raising concerns that the group still poses risks. "If security forces can't arrest them? How can we do that?," Shah, a prominent member of the Mehsud tribe, told Reuters. "How can we go back unless the area is cleared? This is not our land any more. It's a battleground." Establishing long-term security in South Waziristan, the biggest of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in the northwest, is crucial in efforts to stabilise both Pakistan and Afghanistan, where an Afghan Taliban insurgency is raging. The Pashtun border area is a global militant hub used by the Taliban and al Qaeda. Afghan militants operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan routinely cross the border to attack U.S.-led NATO troops in Afghanistan. Crackdowns have weakened the Pakistani Taliban. But they often melt away during army assaults and sometimes return to former strongholds such as South Waziristan, where the military may not have the resources to stay for long. "We have told them (state officials) that we are not going back unless we are completely sure that it is safe to return," said Malik Haji Mohammad, a Mehsud tribal elder. Pakistani governments have never had much authority in FATA, areas hostile to outside interference. So getting tribal leaders to go back could help pacify a region the U.S. believes could make or break the battle against militancy. Under a system inherited from colonial Britain, a government "political agent" administers through tribal elders. But upheaval has shattered tribal networks. In the 1980s, the impoverished area was swept up in the Pakistan- and U.S.-backed war against Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. After a U.S.-led invasion defeated the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, many fighters flocked to FATA and established bases. The Taliban nearly destroyed the traditional leadership structure, beheading and shooting of tribal elders. So elders who return have to start from scratch. Haunted by the carnage, people who fled have more pressing concerns. "I don't want to be killed. I don't want my children to be killed," said Qaisar Khan, who left a clothing business behind in South Waziristan. Tribal leaders also want compensation for damages inflicted by fighting. Shah estimates that almost one-third of the agencies' houses were destroyed. "How can you expect people to defend themselves and help the government capture militants while living in tents?," asked Shah. Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said each displaced person will be paid 25,000 rupees ($297) and two months of rations on their return to South Waziristan. But dozens of community meetings with the government over the past few months have made little progress, tribal officials said, delays the government can't afford as it struggles to end contain Taliban suicide bombings in other parts of the country. "The Taliban will definitely try to go back to South Waziristan. They are waiting for the army to withdraw or for the tribesmen to return and then they can hide among them. They are biding their time," said Rahimullah Yousafzai, a Taliban exp
