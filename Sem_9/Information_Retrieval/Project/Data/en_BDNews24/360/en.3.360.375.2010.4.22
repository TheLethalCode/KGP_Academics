 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Thursday ordered Kazi Morshedul Haque, the second in command of banned political outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir, to a three-day police remand. Following a police application for 7 days remand, and a bail petition lodged by Haque's lawyers, Dhaka magistrate Rokhsana Begum Happy, rejected the bail and granted the 3 day remand in relation to two cases filed under the counter-terrorism act. Advocates Mostafa Ahmed and Md Rezaul Karim Sarkar acted for the Tahrir leader. Md Sohail, director of RAB's law and mass media branch, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that on Tuesday, RAB's detective team had arrested Morshed, a real estate businessman, from his Mohammadpur house. RAB handed him over to Uttara Police on Wednesday afternoon. RAB had also seized a number of Jihadi books, a mobile phone and ready cash. Earlier on Apr 18, two Tahrir activists were arrested along with two petrol bombs. Two days later, Mahiuddin Ahmed, the Tahrir chief in Bangladesh, was arrested. Hizb ut Tahrir was banned on October 22 last year. Police arrested Mohiuddin Ahmed, the co-ordinator of the banned organisation on Tuesday dawn. Hizb-ut-Tahrir brought out a procession in Chittagong last week. bdnews24.
