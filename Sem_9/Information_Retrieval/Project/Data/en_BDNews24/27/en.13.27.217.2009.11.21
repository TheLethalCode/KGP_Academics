 Narayanganj, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)A Narayanganj court on Friday gave the CID three more days to grill BNP leader Abdus Salam Pintu in a case regarding the bomb attack on Awami League office in Narayanganj in 2001. Twenty people died and over 100 others, including former Awami League MP Shamim Osman, sustained injuries in the attack at Chashara Awami League office on June 16, 2001. The CID police presented Pintu before the court after grilling him for five days since Nov 15 and appealed to judge Aminul Islam of Narayanganj Judicial Magistrate's Court for seven days to remand him in their custody. The CID showed the former state minister in Khaleda Zia's 2001-06 administration arrested on the charges on Oct 10. Sub-inspector Badiuzzaman, lawyers Anisur Rahman Dipu and Khokon Shaha stood for the prosecution and lawyers Abdul Barid Bhuiyan and Khorshed Alam Bhuiyan for the defence. Khokon Shaha, the general secretary of the district Awami League Laweyers' Association, filed the case. The CID have already remanded banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami leader Mufti Hannan and Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebok Dal leader Shahdat Ullah Jewel a few times. During the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government, the police had dropped charges against Pintu. The court ordered the CID to revive the case upon the CID's appeal after the Awami League-led government to power. bdn
