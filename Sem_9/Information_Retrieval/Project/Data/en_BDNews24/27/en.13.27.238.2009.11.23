 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Detective Branch police have said Abu Motaleb, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba member arrested Sunday, is a recruiter and arms expert of the Kashmir-based militant group. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Munshi Abdul Majid granted police four days to grill Motaleb after he was produced in court Sunday afternoon. The remand petition said the arrested man was a recruiter for Lashkar in Bangladesh, to scout and train up militants for operations in India and Afghanistan. Police also told the court Motaleb was an arms and explosives expert, who took part in the Afghan-Russian war from 1987 to 1990. Including Motaleb, Bangladesh has arrested seven suspected Lashkar operatives since the start of November. Motaleb was arrested in the capital's Motijheel area on Saturday following information given by three LeT members arrested on Nov 13, on suspicion of plotting to attack the Indian and US embassies in Dhaka. The three Abdul Karim Azhari Sufian, Ashraf Hossain and Monwar Aliwere arrested from Uttara in the capital and Tongi in Gazipur. 3 more 'rearrested at jail gate' Another three Lashkar suspects, Mukti Harun Izhar, Shahidul Islam Sujon and Saiful Islam, were reportedly rearrested at Dhaka Central Jail gate late Sunday night. The three, arrested at the start of November, were released on bail, Chowkbazar superintendent Abdur Razzak told bdnews24.com. "They were rearrested from the jail gate by Detective Branch police," he said. DB officials would not immediately confirm the news. US arrests stoke fears Meanwhile, the arrest of the two suspected Lashkar members in the US last month has revived fears about the militant group's global reach and its ability to plot attacks in India and around the world. The group was founded in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir. It has since been blamed for the coordinated attacks on the Indian financial capital, Mumbai, in November last year that killed 166 people. Lashkar, also blamed for the late 2001 attack on Indian parliament, was banned in Pakistan in 2002. Lashkar-e-Taiba, however, says it is not associated with Islamist militant groups operating globally, and denies any links to the Pakistan government. "All our members are local Kashmiri Muslims and we have no network in America, or any other place," Abdullah Gaznavi, the spokesman for the group, told Reuters news agency on Sunday. "We are only fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir." The militant group, which security agencies say is mostly made up of fighters from Pakistan, first rose to prominence after it carried out a series of suicide attacks across the Himalayan region in 2000. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Kashmir since simmering discontent against government rule broke out in 1989. bdnews24.
