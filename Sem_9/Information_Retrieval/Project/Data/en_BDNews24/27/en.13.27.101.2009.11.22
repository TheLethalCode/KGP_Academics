 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Anisul Huq, chief state counsel in the Bangabandhu murder case appeals, has criticised Amnesty International for its call to commute the death sentences of the condemned killers. Amnesty, which seeks a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, has urged Bangladesh to give clemency to the killers, who face execution by hanging, in this high-profile case. Huq said Sunday he was surprised at AI's statement released on Friday. He said the organisation should consider the nature of the 1975 incident, in which the country's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed along with most of his family members. "Execution by hanging is carried out in different countries for the murders of innocent children and women." "And in this case, it was also the assassination of a renowned leader who earned love of the people of the country," said the lawyer. "Who is Amnesty, can they bring the dead back alive?" he asked. The Supreme Court on Nov 19 rejected the appeals of the five former officers sentenced to death for the murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members, sealing the long-drawn case proceedings more than 34 years after the killings. The long-awaited judgment cleared the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the August 1975 assassination, six of whom are fugitives, one of whom has since died. Amnesty International, in its statement, said the murder of Sheikh Mujib and his family members on Aug 15, 1975 were grave human rights abuses and the killers should be brought to justice. "However, bringing people to justice must not itself violate the human rights of the accused," the international human rights watchdog said. "Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner," said AI. It urged president Zillur Rahman to commute the death sentences "as a matter of urgency" and also urged prime minister Sheikh Hasina to request the president to commute the sentences. Anisul Huq said the convicts can seek clemency from the president within seven days. "If a response is not given within 15 days, the jail authority will request a decision." "The execution will be halted until the mercy petition is resolved." The execution will take place between 21 and 28 days of the final resolution of the mercy petition, he said. The execution may also be halted if the jail authority is informed about a review petition," he added. Lawyers of the condemned men say they are already moving to submit a review petition to the Supreme Court, which seeks to have the court records reviewed. bd
