<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)--State minister for law Qamrul Islam said on Thursday the Supreme Court verdict that rejected the appeals of five death convicts in president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's murder trial will be executed in January. "It will take a month and a half to implement the verdict on completion of all legal procedures. The verdict can be executed either at the end of December or at the beginning of January," Islam told reporters at the Secretariat. The defence said they will petition the Supreme Court to review the verdict. If the petition is rejected they can seek presidential clemency. If that is also denied, the execution will take place between 21 and 28 days of the final resolution of the case. The government will try to implement the verdict as soon as possible, the junior minister said. "The verdict was expected. The nation has erased its stains through it." The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The fugitive convicts are facing warrant from the Interpol. The state minister said: "Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin have been brought back home with the assistance of Interpol and have faced trial. "Others will also be brought back home through the same process," he said. bdne
