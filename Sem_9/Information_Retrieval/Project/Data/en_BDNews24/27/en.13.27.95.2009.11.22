 COLOMBO, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka said on Saturday it will allow greater freedom of movement to refugees held in military-guarded camps from next month, after facing pressure to speed up resettlement of thousands of Tamils displaced by war. The government's announcement comes two days after United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes voiced concern over the displaced Tamils' freedom of movement. Sri Lanka is due to hold elections by April and opposition parties are considering backing a possible challenge by the victorious army chief against President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who they blame for the failure to resettle many refugees after the end of the 25-year war in May. Rajapaksa's brother and head of the refugee resettlement body, Basil Rajapaksa, said the government will allow greater freedom of movement by Dec. 1 for 130,000 people who fled the final phases of the war.

The United Nations welcomed Saturday's announcement and urged Sri Lanka to continue to work with the UN and other organisations to help return people still displaced by the war. "These are steps which the UN has long been pressing for in its intensive engagement with the authorities in Sri Lanka, including during the Secretary-General's own visit in May," a statement from Ban's spokesman said. Rights groups have said people in the camps were treated poorly and were being kept there longer than necessary. Britain also welcomed the Sri Lankan government decision. "Granting genuine freedom to decide their own future will be a major relief for those still trapped in the camps," British International Development Minister Mike Foster said.
