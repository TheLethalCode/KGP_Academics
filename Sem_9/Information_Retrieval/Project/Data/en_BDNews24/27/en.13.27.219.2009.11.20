 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has urged private hospitals to cut service charge and treat at least ten poor people having deadly diseases free of cost every month as part of corporate social responsibility. "I think such a collective initiative is not expensive for a hospital. But, that will help ease sufferings of many people," she said on Friday. At the opening ceremony of third international conference for cardiology and cardiac surgery and First Dhaka Live-2009, she called on private hospitals to reduce treatment charge. Lab Aid Hospital organised the event at Sonargaon Hotel. Hasina said, "I will urge you to cut the treatment costs as the bill you charge is beyond what common people can afford." On private hospital, she said, "Many of the private hospitals are not furnished with adequate equipment, qualified doctors and hygienic atmosphere." "Allegations of deaths due to wrong treatment are rampant." Service charges by diagnostic centres are also too high for the common people, the prime minister observed. Her government has launched steps to modernise health and drug policy, and on top of that, initiatives for setting up a medical centre for 6000 people each and recruitment of 4000 physicians are under way, she said She portrayed alarming pictures of cardiac diseases in Bangladesh and other countries. "Casualties due to cardiac disease are on the rise. Heart disease is emerging as one of the major threats in the developing countries. Unhygienic lifestyle, excessive mental stress, smoking, unhealthy eating habit and lack of regular exercise are the causes of soaring heart disease, she said The programme was addressed by foreign minister Dipu Moni, managing director of Lab Aid Cardiac Hospital MA Shamim. bdne
