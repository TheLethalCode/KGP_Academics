<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)Some Hajj pilgrims were cheated by travel agents, a day before they were scheduled to catch a flight for Saudi Arabia, but they could finally manage tickets through government intervention. Angered by the incident, a Hajj official said: "Travel agency men cheating the pilgrims should be put under cross-fire," referring to killings without trial by law-enforcing agencies. Legal action is being taken against private Al-Mobarakat Travel Agency for cheating 62 pilgrims, Hajj officer Bazlul Haque Biswas told bdnews24.com. "The process of filing a criminal case against the agency and cancelling its aviation licence is underway," Biswas said. The agency staff allegedly went into hiding after taking all the money from the pilgrims who were scheduled to fly for Saudi Arabia on Saturday. RAB and police were on the lookout for the fraud travel agency staff, Biswas said. More than 58,000 pilgrims already reached Mecca under government and private arrangements to perform the holy Hajj. The Hajj flights to Saudi Arabia are scheduled to end on Monday. The return Hajj flights are expected to start from Dec 2. Some 8,216 pilgrims are performing Hajj under government management and the rest are making it under private arrangements through 250 agencies. According to the ministry of religious affairs' website, 54,189 pilgrims have already reached Saudi Arabia since Oct 21 when the flights started. Meanwhile, 20 Bangladeshi pilgrims have died in Saudi Arabia, available reports said. b
