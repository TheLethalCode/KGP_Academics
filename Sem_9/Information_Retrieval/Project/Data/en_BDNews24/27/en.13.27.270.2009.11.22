<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has adjourned until Dec 9 the hearing of a suo moto rule issued on the government and Rapid Action Battalion to explain the killing of two brothers in Madaripur. The bench of justice AFM Abdur Rahman and justice Imdadul Haque Azad ordered the adjournment on a government appeal on Sunday. The court also named human rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra as a party to explain the rule. Deputy attorney general Kazi Md Izarul Haque Akhand prayed for time to make preparations for hearing and reply of the rule. Earlier, Ain O Salish Kendra executive director Sultana Kamal appealed for inclusion of the organisation as a party. On Nov 16, brothers Lutfor Khalashi, 40, and Khairul Khalashi, 38, both alleged to be extremists, were killed in what RAB said was "an exchange of gunfire" in Madaripur. The HC issued suo moto rule the next day on the government and RAB to explain the shooting and killing of two brothers in Madaripur, asking why the deaths should not be ruled extra-judicial. Meanwhile, human-rights organisations have been expressing concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country though the government claims that no such killings are taking place. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called "crossfire" should not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings of suspects in custody or others. RAB has said around over 570 people have been killed in encounter/shootout incidents with the elite force around the country in the five years since its formation in 2004. According to rights group Odhikar, 322 people were killed in "crossfire/encounter/shootout" incidents during the two years of the past caretaker governmen
