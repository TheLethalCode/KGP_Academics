<TEXT>
 Habiganj, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The conference of Habiganj BNP was bungled on Saturday when the administration issued a Section 144 banning meetings and processions due to alleged internal feuding of the party. The followers of BNP district convener Syed Mohammad Faisal and joint convener GK Gaus, also mayor of Habiganj town, called separate conferences in the town on that day. The administration banned meetings and processions when the double announcements created tensions in the town, Nirmalendu Chakrabarty, Habiganj Police Station officer-in-charge, told bdnews24.com. "The ban was in force from 6am to 6pm," he said. Police were posted at different points of the town from daybreak Saturday, and a temporary pavilion was removed by police. BNP central leader Moazzem Hossain Alal had been scheduled to attend the conference. Further decision will be taken at a meeting of the district committee convener, president of the municipal unit Aminur Rashid, told bdnews24.com. District conferences are being held ahead of the BNP's national council to be held next month. But, already two district conferences were disrupted due to internal feuding among local party leaders. Two factions of local BNP clashed with each other at the Cox's Bazar conference on Friday. The same occurred in Chittagong earlier in the week. bdnews24.c
