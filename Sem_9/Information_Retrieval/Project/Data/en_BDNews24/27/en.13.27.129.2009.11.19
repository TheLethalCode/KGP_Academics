<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)Defence counsel Abdullah Al Mamun has said there is no scope to appeal against the verdict of the highest court but a review petition will be filed on the rejection of the appeals. "This is the verdict of the apex court. There is no scope to appeal against it. The convicts can file review petition according to article 105 of the constitution," said Mamun at a news conference after the verdict on Thursday. The petition will have to be submitted within 30 days in line with the Appellate Division Rule No. 26. The time will be counted after receiving the copy of the judgment, he said. The Supreme Court rejected appeals of five men convicted of killing Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a landmark verdict on Thursday, clearing the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the 1975 assassination. "The plaintiff has failed to prove the case on evidence. The convicts deserve to be acquitted. "The court in its verdict said the prosecution has proved the case without a doubt. We will be able to know in detail about the matter after we receive the copy of the verdict." On holding the trial in common law, Mamun said: "The four people killed in the event were army members. President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the commander-in-chief. So, their trial should have taken place under Army Act." He pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling on the mode of trial for the BDR mutiny. "The Supreme Court has said the trial will be held under the law under which the accused fall. "(But) In this case, the trial was held under the law under which the 'dead fell'." "The killers have the scope for self defence. That's why I have fought the case. "I also want proper justice. But the justice should be held by law." "According to Supreme Court rules the execution cannot be made effective until the completion of all legal procedures including review petitions. "The convicts can seek presidential clemency according to article 49 of the constitution. The president can either acquit them in the case or commute their penalty or pardon them. "All the legal procedures should be completed. The legal process should be upheld. "We will submit the petition to the Appellate Division after receiving a certified copy of the verdict," said Mamun. "We will file the petition as soon as we get the copy," he added. bdn
