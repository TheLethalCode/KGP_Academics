 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)The government has urged garment factory owners to pay workers all arrears due up to October, and half month's salary for November and festival bonus before the Eid-ul-Azha. Any industry owner failing to comply with the directive would be legally dealt with, warned labour, expatriate welfare and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain on Sunday. Asked what action was being taken to ensure payment of salaries and bonuses to the workers before the Eid, the minister said the crisis management committee (CMC) representing the government had a meeting with the factory owners and notified them about the government's stance on the issue. The factory owners appeared inclined to oblige and clear all dues they owe to the workers before the Eid, he said, which helped the workers to keep calm and await payments. The minister reiterated that in case the factory owners failed to pay their workers within the stipulated time, the government would take necessary action without hesitation.
