 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Rehana, one of the two surviving daughters of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in her reaction, said it was important that the verdict had been upheld by the Supreme Court. Rehana told bdnews24.com by phone from abroad: "I pray for the peace of the departed souls of those killed that day. I hope the shame of the incident will be erased from our history through this final verdict. In her first public remarks in many years on the Aug 15, 1975 killings, in which she lost most of her family members, Rehana said: "The trial has finally ended after 34 years. Justice has been established." The Supreme Court rejected appeals of five men convicted of killing Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a landmark verdict on Thursday. The long-awaited judgment has cleared the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the assassination, seven of whom are fugitives. "It's universal that there's trial and punishment if one commits a crime. Justice and truth have prevailed," added Rehana, , younger sister of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "Hopefully, none will face such agony and painful memories will fade. May peace exist in the country. I wish everyone's wellbeing," she said. bd
