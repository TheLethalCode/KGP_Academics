 Cox's Bazaar, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)--Supporters of a faction on Friday vandalised the stage during the council of opposition BNP's Cox's Bazaar district unit. Local BNP leader Nurul Bashar Chowdhury said former state minister for communications Salahuddin Ahmed was among those injured in the incident. The faithful of local BNP MP Lutfor Rahman Kajal attacked the council stage at 9:15pm when central leader Selina Rahman started announcing the new committee. MP Hasina Begum was also present on-stage. bdnews24.com correspondent said the chaos started soon after Rahman announced the name of president, vice president and general secretary. The activists started throwing chairs at rivals, assaulted leaders and vandalised their cars as they shouted slogans for general secretary candidate and MP Lutfor Rahman Kajal for at least 15 minutes. Selina and Salahuddin were moved away to Hotel Sea Palace for safety. Begum and newly announced general secretary Shamim Ara Swapna, however, took shelter inside the stadium office under siege before being ewcused by police after about half an hour. Later, some youths vandalised the vehicles of newly announced Cox's Bazaar BNP president Shahjahan Chowdhury and Nurul Bashar Chowdhury. Local BNP leaders quoted Salauddin Ahmed as saying that they would have to accept the decision of the central command. Shahjahan Chowdhury said, "The committee has been announced. The councilors have accepted the committee by raising their hands up." "No committee will be announced anew." On Nov 16, infighting and factional clashes caused the long overdue council of the Chittagong metropolitan unit to break up. The council dissolved in chaos as two factions faced off. Two groups of supporters, backing BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman and convenor of the metropolitan unit Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, fought as the Noman group tried to enter the auditorium. bdnews24.c
