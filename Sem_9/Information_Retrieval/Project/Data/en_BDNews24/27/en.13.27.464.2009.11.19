 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)The five jailed death convicts have been informed of the final verdict by the Supreme Court on Thursday. Deputy inspector general, prisons, Golam Haider told bdnews24.com that they had received the copy of the judgment before evening. Going by the rules, the jail officials told them that their appeals against the death sentence have been dismissed. They were also told that they could seek clemency from the president within seven days, he added. The Supreme Court earlier in the day upheld a High Court verdict that handed down the death sentence to 12 former army officers, sealing the gruelling and long-disrupted proceedings of 21 years and delivering justice more than three decades after the killing of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The five convicts on Death Row are retired major general Bazlul Huda, dismissed lieutenant colonel Syed Faruk Rahman, retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed and retired major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. Ruhul Amin, additional deputy police commissioner, told bdnews24.com that no convict was taken to the court premises from jails or police stations during the trial for security reason. Hearings took place in four courts in the absence of the accused, he added. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Golam Haidar told bdnews24.com, "For a 'special reason' the accused were not send to the court on Thursday." Amin said nearly 400 policemen were deployed at the Supreme Court premises alongside elite RAB personnel. bd
