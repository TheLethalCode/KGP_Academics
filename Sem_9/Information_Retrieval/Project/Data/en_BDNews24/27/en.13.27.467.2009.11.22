 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  At least 800 dwellings were gutted early on Sunday in a fire at a slum near Moghbazar wireless gate, killing one woman and injuring four people. The woman was killed and the people were injured when they were knocked down by a train during the blaze at the slum built along the railway track, witnesses said. Fire service sub-officer Nazma Akter told bdnews24.com that the fire broke out accidentally from a cooking stove at around quarter to five o'clock in the morning. Till 9am, 19 firefighting vehicles worked relentlessly and doused the blaze finally, she said. Some 800 shanties, including a garage, were gutted in the fire, causing huge losses to the slum inmates. People jostling near the scene of fire caused one Aleya Begum, 32, to be hit by a passing train and she died on the spot. Fire service director general Abu Nayim Md Shahidullah told reporters that the fire spread very quickly across the shanties, but they managed to douse it totally after hours of efforts. The injured were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. bd
