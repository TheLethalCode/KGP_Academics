<TITLE> Traffic signals bring no immediate relief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)There was no immediate improvement noticed on Dhaka roads following the launch of automated traffic lights in the capital on Sunday. Drivers complained that it took them even longer than usual to reach their destinations after automated signals replaced traffic police at many key intersections. Bus driver Ajgar Mia, on the Gulistan-Airport route, said angrily: "I had to drive at a snail's pace from Kakoli." Dhaka Metropolitan Police launched the new traffic control system with automatic signals on Sunday, on an experimental basis for seven days, as a measure to combat chronic gridlock. A decision on whether to continue with the new signal system will be taken after the initial trial, DMP has said. Drivers face strict penalties for violating signal lights, including a Tk 1000 fine and suspension of driving licences for up to three months. 'Not very effective' A traffic policeman at Bijoy Sarani intersection said there was a heavy rush of vehicles on Sunday morning as it was the opening of day of the working week. The newly automated signals were operating, "but they weren't having much effect", he said. "I had use hand signals to control the traffic," he added. Though the automated signals were launched with some fanfare, including TV spots and media reports, many drivers said they only came to know about the new measure after the fact. Nuru, a bus driver on the Gabtoli-Sadarghat route, told bdnews24.com: "I was not aware of it until I heard from a traffic policeman on the road." As usual, Mohakhali, Bijoy Sarani, Farmgate, Asad Gate, Paltan and Motijheel areas saw huge traffic snarls. But to many, the jams appeared worse on Sunday than ever. Roushan, a daily commuter from Mohammadpur to Motijheel said, "It took nearly two hours to reach Dilkusha from Mohammpur." Another office-goer said, "We have also heard that roads will soon have three lanes. This will make things even worse as existing lanes are barely broad enough for two vehicles to run side by side." "Police sometimes come up with peculiar ideas," he said. bd
