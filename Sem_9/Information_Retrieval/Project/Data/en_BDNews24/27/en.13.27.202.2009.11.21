 Dhaka, Nov20 (bdnews24.com)Jamuna Group chairman Nurul Islam Babul has claimed a "government within the government" stopped the transmission of Jamuna Television. "Jamuna Television secured a 'no objection' certificate on terrestrial and satellite transmission on Feb 5, 2002," he said at a press conference at the private TV station's office at Pragati Smarani in the capital on Friday. "But it was later cancelled on Mar 10 in the wake of a disagreement with the government." "The 'government within the government' is plotting the conspiracy," he alleged. "The higher authorities, including the prime minister, might not be aware of this." The Jamuna Group chief vowed to continue with the legal battle and sought the prime minister's intervention. Jamuna Television won the legal battle and was allowed to import machinery and allocated frequency on Nov20, 2008 in line with the Supreme Court order. "We launched transmission on Oct 15 as per the condition of going on air within one year of permission," the chairman said. On Thursday evening, the information ministry asked Jamuna not to go on air since their Oct 8 application for clearance has been under consideration. But Babul said they did not apply for a fresh no-objection certificate. He said, hours into the faxed message, police and Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission officials stormed into the station's office and forced a stop to the airing at 10:30pm without giving any time. They did not let any crew of the station in, he alleged, adding that police beat up the employees, dismantled some equipment, seized some machinery and sealed the link room. BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Thursday night: "The information ministry told both Jamuna Television and us about the need to have prior permission from the ministry to go on air. "When Jamuna continued with their transmission without the permission, the ministry asked us to cancel their frequency. We took measures in the evening," he said Zia said, "Jamuna Television has applied for fresh permission after the cancellation of previous license but they went on air without getting approval." bdnews24.
