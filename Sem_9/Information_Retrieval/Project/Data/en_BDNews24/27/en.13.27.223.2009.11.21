 Jhenaidah, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The alleged leader of a 'dacoit' gang was killed in a shootout with law enforcers on the Jhenaidah-Jessore highway on Saturday, police said. Jhenaidah police super Md Rezaul Karim identified the deceased as 30-year old 'Hazrat' of Patbila village in Kaliganj upazila. Karim said police came upon a gang of 'dacoits' as they were placing a barricade on the highway, by felling a tree, at around 5:15am, in order to halt vehicles and rob them. As the police patrol team arrived at the spot, the criminals opened fire forcing the law enforcers to retaliate, he said. The criminals eventually fled the scene leaving Hazrat's body behind, said the police official. Karim said the deceased was leader of a known network of inter-district bandits. Police recovered one shutter gun, two bullets and some locally made weapons from the scene, he said. He also said the dead man faced 16 cases, including two for murder and seven for robbery. bdnews
