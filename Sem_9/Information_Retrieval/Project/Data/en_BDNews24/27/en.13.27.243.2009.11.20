 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a verdict that handed down death sentences to 12 former army officers in the Bangabandhu murder case, sealing the gruelling and often-disrupted case proceedings of 13 years. People from across the social spectrum hailed it as a landmark verdict, closing a dark chapter in Bangladesh's past. The DSE benchmark index closed up, with experts putting it down partially to buoyant investor mood following the historic judgment. The killing of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family on Aug 15, 1975 changed Bangladesh's political landscape, leaving a legacy of bloodshed that reaches to the present day. The long-awaited judgment has cleared the way for hanging of all 12 men convicted of the 1975 assassination. A five-strong bench of the Appellate Division, headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, rejected the appeals of five of the convicts, to have their death sentences commuted, while seven are fugitives. The condemned men are Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. They can, however, apply to have the verdict reviewed by the Appellate Division, and if that fails, seek presidential clemency as a last resort. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the slain leader, expressed satisfaction at the final judgment on her father's killers. Hasina had cut short a visit to Italy to return home just hours before the verdict. She was at her official residence Jamuna when it was delivered. Sister Sheikh Rehana, in an exclusive reaction to bdnews24.com from overseas, said it was important that the 2001 High Court verdict had been upheld by the Supreme Court. Hasina and Rehana, whose father, mother and three brothers were killed, survived the fateful Aug 15 night as they were away in England at the time. Review sought The condemned men were not present in the courtroom when Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam presented the judgment at 11:47am. They were informed of the verdict in jail, and told they had 7 days to seek presidential clemency. A defence counsel, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, has said a review petition would be filed immediately on the rejection of the appeals. 'No legal error' Justice Islam, in his six-minute delivery, upheld the verdict of the third High Court judge made in 2001. He said the convicts were not in active service during the killings and that there was no legal error by holding their trial under civil law instead of army law. The judge said it was not a mutiny, but a conspiracy to kill Bangabandhu. He also said the trial court and the High Court gave valid reasons for the 21 years of delay in filing of case. The Appellate Division accepted their explanation in reaching the final verdict Thursday on the appeals filed by the convicts eight years ago, Justice Islam said. He said the prosecution had proved without a doubt the case against the five convicts, and therefore their appeals had been rejected. The verdict, handed down amid unprecedented security at the court premises, because of the political sensitivity of the case. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said the defence could not present any strong argument in to commute the death penalties of the convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case. "The court accepted the prosecution's deliberations on each point; it rejected those of the defence counsels," he said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam called Thursday's judgment "epoch-making". Long-pending The long pending appeals process of the five death convicts finally resumed on Oct 15, 34 years after Sheikh Mujib's assassination. The appeals court took 29 days to hear all arguments. The case's progress has depended upon political dispensation. Justice was denied immediately after the assassination, with the notorious indemnity ordinance. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. The case was finally filed on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. The trial resumed after a long gap with the return to power of Mujib's elder daughter, Hasina, in January this year. The trial had slowed down and came to a halt during her rival Khaleda Zia's rule between 2001-06. Khaleda's husband, Ziaur Rahman, himself a war hero, sent most officers believed to be involved in the murder conspiracy abroad on diplomatic assignments for many years. His successor HM Ershad maintained indemnity for the killers. Ershad, however, welcomed the verdict on Thursday. "The whole nation is proud today," he said. 'Landmark' Chief state counsel Anisul Haque, in a post-verdict press conference, said the defence had been unable to present any strong argument in their appeals to commute the death penalties. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said, "It'll be remembered as one of the greatest trials in history," he said. Senior opposition BNP leader Moudud Ahmed has said the final verdict on Bangabandhu murder trial came as a great relief to the nation. "With this verdict the rule of law has been established and the nation has got relief as well. People do not want to see such killings any more," he said on Thursday. Among a section of the public, Shamsul Huq, 65, a beggar on the streets of the capital, said, "He was a great person, a great leader among many others. He liberated our motherland. His killing cannot be justified in any sense. Today I am happy that the final judgement is given." Sixteen year-old Sumon said: "I have never seen Bangabandhu, but I have always known him as the father of the nation." Amir Miah, 47, of old Dhaka said: "Deep in my heart, I am looking forward to the day of execution. 'To hang by January' State minister for law Qamrul Islam said the five condemned men will be executed in January. "It will take a month and a half to implement the verdict on completion of all legal procedures. The verdict can be executed either at the end of December or at the beginning of January," he told reporters at the Secretariat. bdnews24.com/s
