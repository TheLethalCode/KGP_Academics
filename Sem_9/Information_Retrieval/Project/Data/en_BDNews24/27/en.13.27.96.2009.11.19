 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)--Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad has welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on Bangabandhu murder trial. "The whole nation is proud today," he told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Though the ruling Awami League has blamed the former military ruler Ershad in the past for abetting the killers, Ershad commended the ruling party. "The Awami League could have tried this murder by setting up a special tribunal. But they did not do that." This proved that it did not want to intervene in the judicial process, said Ershad, whose party is now the key ally in the AL-led government. This is a historic judgement, Ershad said. "The trial of the killing of the father of the nation has been held. The whole nation was waiting for it." The indemnity ordinance promulgated by Khandakar Mushtaq Ahmed's government was in force during the nine-year rule of Ershad. There were allegations also against Ershad of patronisation behind the floating of the Freedom Party by self-confessed killers Syed Faruq Rahman and Khandaker Abdur Rashid. Ershad said in Rangpur on Oct 15, "Ziaur Rahman, during his stay in power, gave all facilities including services to the killers of Bangabandhu. I only maintained its continuity." bdne
