<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said the nation has finally seen the justice in the Bangabandhu murder case. "The court had received appeals from the convicts for hearing on five specific points and accepted prosecution's deliberations on each point and rejected the presentations of the defence counsels," Haque told a press briefing after the verdict of Bangabandhu murder case on Thursday. "The court in its verdict said the defence could not present any point that might help commute the penalty of the convicts. So, the court has upheld the ruling of the High Court." Answering a question the chief state counsel said: "As per the jail code, the verdict will have to be executed between 21 and 28 days on receipt of the copy of the judgment by jail authority." "According to section 991 of the jail code, the convicts can seek presidential clemency. They are allowed to do that in the period between 21 and 28 days," he continued. On filing review petition by the convicts, Haque said: "The convicts can file review petition following the article 105 of the constitution. The petition should be filed within 30 days." Asked whether the Thursday's verdict implied for five convicts or all the 12 convicts he said: "Death penalty of the 12 convicts will remain upheld. The previous ruling given by the Appellate Division on halting execution has been revoked with the SC judgment." "The court has handed down the verdict rejecting the appeals of those convicts who had filed appeals against the High Court ruling. Those who did not file appeal the High Court verdict will remain effective for them." The five appellants are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). bdn
