<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)--The benchmark index of Dhaka Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, with observers putting it down partially to buoyant investor mood following the Supreme Court's historic judgment. In a landmark verdict, the court upheld death sentences of five former army officers convicted of the Aug 15, 1975 assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. According to DSE president Rakibur Rahman, investors were holding back in morning trade until the news of the long-awaited verdict came in. Trading followed the previous day's trend with an almost flat benchmark index for the first one and a half hours. A steep fall of more than 20 points marked the opening, but the index recovered immediately. The DGEN or general index started to rise once again at around 12.25pm and ended 66 points higher than Wednesday's closing. "It was after just the verdict that the market started to move positively," he told bdnews24.com. He said the judgement clears the country's path towards development. Institutional investors also felt the same but said buying in the wake of lower prices also contributed to the upward index movement. Mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed said that price movement and the trading volume were relatively low during the first one and a half hours as investors were uncertain about the verdict. "It (the verdict) definitely has contribution to the rise...the nation has been relieved of the stigma after 34 years," he told bdnews24.com. But, bargain-hunting also contributed to the rise as the market for the last few days was seeing lower prices in most of the sectors, added Sayeed, the top official of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. "Then again, trading was not happening that much before the news of the verdict came in...even we were sceptical about investing," he said. Small-scale retail investors however, find little relation between the verdict and the market movement. "I don't see its contribution to the market movement," Muhibul Islam told bdnews24.com at a brokerage house's trading floor. But, he said the verdict was much needed and the nation was now free from a curse. Asked about the market bouncing back around the midday, Islam said that he believes it happened due to the trend of buying at lower prices. But, middle-aged Nurul Alam, who has been in the market for 20 years, says the verdict gave a feeling of confidence among the investors, which perked up trading in the midday. "This market usually does not react to such incidents, but this time it was different since the government itself was on red alert for the last few days," he told bdnews24.com. Brokerage house officials echoed him. "The atmosphere was gloomy as security had been tightened for the last few days, so we were a bit sceptical about the whole thing," said Bashir Ahmed of brokerage firm Stocks & Bonds.
