 BEIJING, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gas explosion in a coal mine in China's northeast has trapped 139 miners underground, the latest accident to hit the world's deadliest mining industry, the official Xinhua agency said on Saturday. There were 528 people working in the mine when the explosion happened early on Saturday, but 389 escaped, the report said, quoting the provincial mine safety watchdog. The mine is in Hegang city in Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia, Xinhua said, but gave no further details. The safety watchdog's website carried no information about the accident. The top item was a report urging more training to strengthen coal mine safety. (www.hljmkaj.gov.cn). Lax safety standards and strong demand for resources have made China's mines the deadliest in the world, despite a government drive to clamp down on the tiny, unsafe operations where most accidents occur. More than 3,000 people died in mine floods, explosions, collapses and other accidents in 2008 alone.
