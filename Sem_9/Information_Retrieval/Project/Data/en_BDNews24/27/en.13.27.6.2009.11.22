 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested another alleged member of Lashkar-e-Taiba in the capital's Motijheel area on Saturday on suspicion of plotting to attack the Indian and US embassies in Dhaka. Detective Branch of Police assistant commissioner S M Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com on Sunday Abu Motaleb was arrested on Saturday following the information given by the three LeT members arrested on November 13. Abu Motaleb recruits militants from Bangladesh and sends them to India and Afghanistan after providing them training, Islam said. He also took part in Afghan war from 1987 to 1990, Islam added. The three -- Sufian Azhari, Zahid Hossain and Manirul -- were caught from Uttara in the capital and Tongi in Gazipur. A good number of Indians suspected to be LeT members have been arrested in Dhaka. The group was founded in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir. It was also blamed for the coordinated attacks on the Indian financial capital, Mumbai, in November last year that killed 166 people. LeT was also blamed for the late 2001 attack on Indian parliament and it was banned in Pakistan in 2002. b
