 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)---Grameen Cybernet Limited (GCL) is offering an internet phone service free of cost for the first time in the country. Anyone with an internet connection, through any Internet Service Provider (ISP), can make calls free of cost from anywhere in the country using a GCL router or 'IP phone'. Masum Billlah, GCL deputy manager (operation and technical), told bdnews24.com that a subscriber needs to purchase the router at a cost of Tk 5,000 to enjoy the free internet phone service. He said GCL was introducing the service for the first time in the country, to enable internet users to call home and abroad at no or low cost with improved voice quality. He stressed, "Internet users will be able to make free calls to each other." But, he said, calling land lines and mobile phones would require a minimum charge. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission is yet to set the charge and efforts are on to keep it below 10 paisa per minute, he said BTRC issued licenses on Aug 10 to 32 firms including GCL for launching IP phone services across the country. GCL is a joint venture of Grameen Bank and Cytecho Communication has been providing internet services in Bangladesh since 1996. bdnew
