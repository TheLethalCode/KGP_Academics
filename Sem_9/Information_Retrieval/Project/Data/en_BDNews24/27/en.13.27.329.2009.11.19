 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has agreed that South African runner Caster Semenya will keep her 800 metres world title, the country's sports ministry said Thursday. The 18-year-old Semenya, who stormed to victory in August's world championships in Berlin, underwent gender verification tests this summer in South Africa and Germany and a panel of experts has been studying the results for the IAAF.

Whatever she decides, ours is to respect her decision," the ministry said. South Africa had requested the IAAF to apologise at the way the Semenya saga had been handled. "Their response is: 'It is deeply regrettable that information of a confidential nature entered the public domain.' The IAAF is adamant that the public discourse did not originate with them," the ministry said. Australia's Daily Telegraph, citing an unnamed source, reported in September that Semenya was a hermaphrodite with both male and female sexual characteristics. The IAAF has not confirmed the report. Semenya and family members say the runner is female and that publicity surrounding the case has caused hardships.
