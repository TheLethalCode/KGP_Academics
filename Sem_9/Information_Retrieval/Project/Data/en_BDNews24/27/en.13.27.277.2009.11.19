 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)The long pending appeals process of five death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case finally resumed on Oct 15, 34 years after independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination on Aug 15 1975. The appeals court took 29 days to hear all arguments. The prosecution at the hearings opposed the defence's plea for commuting death penalties to life imprisonment since they have been languishing in jail due to delay in appeal hearings. The prosecution argued that in that event, the crime would be condoned. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The trial resumed after a long gap with the return to power of Mujib's elder daughter, Hasina, in January this year. The trial slowed down and came to a halt during her rival Khaleda Zia's rule between 2001-06. Khaleda's husband, Ziaur Rahman, himself a war hero, sent most officers believed to be involved in the murder conspiracy abroad on diplomatic assignments for many years. His successor H M Ershad continued rewarding the killers. Sheikh Mujib had imposed one-party rule, months before his assassination, and his critics accused him of corruption. But Hasina has insisted that her father would have returned democratic rule. The government of Khandker Mushtaq Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. The case was finally filed on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. The Appellate Division had accepted the appeals for hearing on five points on July 23, 2007. They are: the third High Court judge did not give his ruling lawfully, the filing of First Information Report was delayed, army mutiny was held on Aug 15, conspiracies were plotted and the High Court did not properly analyse evidence. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. The High Court on Dec 14, 2000 found 10 former army officers guilty of the murder. But the two-member high court panel was split over the guilt of five others who had also been convicted and sentenced to hang by a lower court two years ago. One judge--Justice A B M Khairul Haque-- retained death sentences of all the 15, while the second--Justice Mohammed Ruhul Amin-- acquitted five of them for lack of evidence. A third High Court judge--Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim--acquitted three of the 15 convicts. Four of them appealed for reprieve the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 2007. Five of the twelve convicts are in the condemned cells of Dhaka Central Jail. Of the remaining seven, one died and six are fugitives from justice in foreign lands. The still absconding Lt Col (retd) Khandaker Abdur Rashid is in Pakistan, Lt Col (retd) Shariful Haque Dalim is in Canada, Lt Col (retd) A M Rashed Chowdhury in South Africa, Lt Col (retd) S H B M Noor Chowdhury in the US, Risaldar Moslemuddin in Thailand and Capt (retd) Abdul Majed lives in Kenya. Maj (retired) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Farukur Rahman, lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (arty) have for long been detained in the condemned cells.
