 Pabna, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com) Unidentified criminals on Thursday night hacked and shot dead an Awami League leader in Pabna, police said. Santhia police chief Faruk Hossain said Rezaul Karim Dipu, 35, was the general secretary of Dhulaura Union in Santhia Upazila. Some 10 to 12 armed criminals waylaid him when he was returning home at 9:15pm after Esha prayers. They hacked him and then confirmed his death by shooting him several times, he said. Local underground operatives might have killed him, he suspected. He spoke at a public meeting several days ago against local underground operatives in presence of state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku, Hossain said. Tuku condemned the killing and ordered the arrest of the guilty. Pabna superintendent of police Nibash Chandra Majhi visited the scene. bdn
