<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked for people to remain calm and patient following Thursday's verdict. Hasina, eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, expressed satisfaction with the final judgment on her father's killers, deputy press secretary Nakibuddin Ahmed told reporters. She also asked all to offer prayers for the just verdict, Ahmed added. Hasina cut short her visit to Italy to return home just hours before the landmark verdict that upheld the death sentences of five convicts, rejecting their appeals. She was at her official residence Jamuna when the verdict was delivered. AL's advisory council members Amir Hossain Amu, Suranjit Sengupta, Tofail Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, presidium member Matia Chowdhury, general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and joint general secretary Dipu Moni were with her. Hasina offered Nafal prayers on hearing the verdict, a leader said. The long-awaited judgment has cleared the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the 1975 assassination, seven of whom are fugitives. The guiding figure of Bangladesh independence, Mujib was killed with 16 members of his family, including wife and three sons, on Aug 15, 1975. His daughters, Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, escaped death only because they were in England. Rehana, in her reaction, said the judgement testifies to the victory of truth and justice. bdnews
