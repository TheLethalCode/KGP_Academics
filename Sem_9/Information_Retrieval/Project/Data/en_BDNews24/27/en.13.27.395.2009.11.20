 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)--Lawyers for the five murder convicts say they have written to the government and jail authorities that they will seek a review of Thursday's final verdict by the Supreme Court. Advocate Nurul Islam and Nawab Ali sent letters by post. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun told bdnews24.com that the counsels had sent letters to the home secretary, deputy commissioner of Dhaka, attorney general and Dhaka Central Jail chief. "The review petition will be filed after getting the copy of the verdict," said Mamun, lawyer for retired major general Bazlul Huda and retired major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer). The court on Thursday upheld a High Court verdict that handed down the death sentence to 12 former army officers for killing the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He said there was no need to petition separately for a halt to the execution of the judgment. The verdict will not be executed until all legal procedures are complete. The five convicts on Death Row are retired major general Bazlul Huda, dismissed lieutenant colonel Syed Faruk Rahman, retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed and retired major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. bd
