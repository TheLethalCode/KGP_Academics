 Dhaka, Nov20 (bdnwews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited Bangabandhu Bhaban on Dhanmondi Road No 32 on Friday, a day after the historic verdict on trial of the murder of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hasina entered the house mingled with her memories at 6:10pm and offered Magrib prayers. A group of derailed army personnel stormed into the house on Aug 15, 1975 and assassinated president and independence hero Sheikh Mujib, popularly called 'Bangabandhu', along with most of his family members. Hasina and younger sister Sheikh Rehana survived the carnage as they had been in Europe. The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a High Court verdict on death sentences on 12 former army officers, sealing the gruelling and often-disrupted case proceedings of 13 years. Hasina strewed the stair with rose petals, in which the blood-stained body of Mujib was lying and offered prayers for the father, mother, three brothers and a host of close relatives, attendants and staffs. In tears, she spent sometime alone there. The premier returned to her official residence Jamuna after one and a half hours. bdnews2
