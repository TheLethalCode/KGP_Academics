<TITLE> Nation relieved: Moudud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)--Senior opposition BNP leader Moudud Ahmed has said the final verdict on Bangabandhu murder trial came as a great relief to the nation. "With this verdict the rule of law has been established and the nation has got relief as well. People do not want to see such killings any more," he said on Thursday. Moudud was law minister in Khaleda Zia's 2001-06 government that is accused of bringing to a halt the murder trial. He said he hoped that people would accept the final verdict. "All should accept the verdict of the highest court. It is the responsibility of the government to execute the verdict." The BNP policymaker said the assassination of independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with his family members was 'a tragedy for the nation'. "The verdict is a respite for the nation. It should be considered from legal perspective, not from any party angle." He said president Ziaur Rahman was also killed in a similar way though the trial was held in a different method. In reply to a query, Moudud said, "The allegation of Zia's involvement with the killing of Bangabandhu is baseless. The accusation is made on political ground." bdnew
