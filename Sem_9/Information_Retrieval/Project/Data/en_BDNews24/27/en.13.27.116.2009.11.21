<TEXT>
 Jhenaidah, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested 14 members of the blacklisted extremist group Allahr Dal, suspected of having links to outlawed terrorist outfit JMB, in Jhenaidah on Saturday. The men were arrested at a private residence in the Kanchanpur area of the district town, Jhenaidah police superintendent Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com. Police seized nine mobile phone sets and religious books, including a Quran and a Bible, from the scene of the arrest, said Karim. "The operatives were holding a clandestine meeting there," said Karim. Quoting locals, he said the house was being used as a centre for "organisational activities" for at least two years. Police also said they believed the 14 arrested men had direct links to banned terrorist group Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh. Allahr Dal's founder Matin Mehdi was among 20 terrorists given the death sentence in connection with the countrywide serial bombings of 2005. Authorities say Mehdi was also a key operative of JMB, which masterminded the bombings and was banned in 2005. Allahr Dal is on a government black list, meaning its members are under close watch by authorities, though not banned outright. Hizb ut Tahrir was the most recent extremist/militant group to be banned in Bangladesh, in October this year. It is the fifth such organisation to be banned in the country, according to the home ministry. bdn
