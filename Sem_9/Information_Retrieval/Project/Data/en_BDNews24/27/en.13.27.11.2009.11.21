<TITLE> Tarique will return to politics, says Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24)Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has said elder son Tarique Rahman, who was all but banished from Bangladesh by the past caretaker government, will return to politics once he fully recovers and returns home from the UK. "Please all pray for him. He will come back among you after recovering from illness," she said at a rally in Bogra on Friday marking the absent Tarique's 45th birthday. Tarique, still the party's senior joint secretary, went abroad for medical treatment, after securing bail in a raft of graft cases. The former prime minister alleged the past military-installed caretaker government had framed Tarique, tortured him and sent him abroad to make her party lose in the general elections. The BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal organised the rally at the Sultanpur High School ground, rounding off JCD's seven-day celebrations marking Tarique's birthday. Tarique Rahman, the eldest son of Khaleda and late president Ziaur Rahman, was born on Nov 20, 1965 in Bogra. The former prime minister had left Dhaka for Bogra in the morning in a motorcade of more than a hundred vehicles to attend the birthday ceremonies. At wayside rallies, Khaleda alleged that the Awami League-government wanted to stop Tarique returning to Bangladesh. She said her son did "a lot to develop the country", but a slew of cases had been filed to destroy him. Khaleda, accompanied by BNP vice chair Sarwari Rahman, secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee member Khanadaker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, former speaker Jamir Uddin Sircar and other senior BNP leaders and MPs, left the capital at 10am. Over a hundred vehicles comprising the opposition leader's motorcade also carryied members of BNP associate organisations Chhatra Dal, Jubo Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, Krishak Dal and Mohila Dal. bdnew
