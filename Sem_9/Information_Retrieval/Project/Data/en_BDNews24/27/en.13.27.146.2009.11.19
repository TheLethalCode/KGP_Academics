<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Johnny Depp was named People magazine's "sexiest man alive" for a second time on Wednesday, joining an elite club of double honorees that includes George Clooney and Brad Pitt. People magazine described the swashbuckling "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie star as "the king of cool with the killer cheekbones". Depp, who also took the title in 2003, succeeded 2008 winner Hugh Jackman. Asked why Depp, 46, had won a second time, People senior editor Kate Coyne told the CBS Early Show: "He was sexy ten years ago, he'll be sexy ten years from now. He appeals to multiple generations of women -- and for many different reasons to different kinds of women." Depp's recent roles include 1930s gangster John Dillinger in "Public Enemies" and the murderous London barber "Sweeney Todd". His next screen role is as the Mad Hatter in director Tim Burton's adaptation of "Alice in Wonderland" which is due for release in March 2010. In real life, Coyne noted that Depp, 46, was also a committed father of two. "He's sort of everything," Coyne said. "He's a guy's guy, kind of a bad boy, he's a respected artist and actor. You know, he's got a little bit of everything." People also gave a nod to the popularity of vampire-themed movies and TV shows, adding the likes of "Twilight" heartthrob Robert Pattinson and "Vampire Diaries" star Ian Somerhalder to its sexiest issue. Matt Bomer, star of the new USA TV series "White Collar" was named sexiest rising star. Other newcomers to People's 2009 list include "American Idol" runner-up Adam Lambert and "Glee" actors Matthew Morrison, Cory Monteith and Mark Salling. Past winners of People's sexiest man alive title include Matt Damon (2007), Matthew McConaughey (2005), Jude Law (2004) and Ben Affleck (2002).
