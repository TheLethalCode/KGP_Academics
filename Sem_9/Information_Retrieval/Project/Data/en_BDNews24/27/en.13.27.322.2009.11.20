 Baby Moudud and Sumon Mahbub Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said justice was served Thursday as the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences of her father's killers. Hasina was at her official Jamuna residence as the verdict was delivered at 11.56am, getting a call within minutes, said those who were with her. She burst into tears as she heard the news. "We got justice," said Hasina, whose mother, three brothers, uncles, aunts and cousins were killed alongside father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. AL's advisory council members Amir Hossain Amu, Suranjit Sengupta, Tofail Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, presidium member Matia Chowdhury, general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and joint general secretary Dipu Moni were with her as she heard the verdict. "She wept," said Ashraful. "We were beside her." "Sheikh Hasina believes that all such killings will be tried in Bangladesh," he told reporters later in the day. After the verdict, she spoke with younger sister Rehana, son Sajib Wajed Joy and daughter Sayma Wajed Putul, all three overseas, by telephone. Rehana told bdnews24.com by phone that it was important that the verdict had been upheld by the Supreme Court. "I pray for the peace of the departed souls of those killed that day. I hope the shame of the incident will be erased from our history through this final verdict, she said. In her first public remarks in many years on the killings, Rehana said: "The trial has finally ended after 34 years. Justice has been established." MP and barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, Hasina's cousin whose mother and father were also killed alongside Sheikh Mujib, arrived at Jamuna straight from the Supreme Court. The two embraced each other and wept, said those who were present. Ashraful left Jamuna at around 1:30pm. Right after that, other AL leaders and cabinet members left. A Milad was held there after Asr prayer. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque and attorney general Mahbubey Alam met with the prime minister in the afternoon. Apart from relatives, close friends and party leaders, Hasina met with few other people through the day. She was not in a situation to talk, those close to her said. bdnews24.c
