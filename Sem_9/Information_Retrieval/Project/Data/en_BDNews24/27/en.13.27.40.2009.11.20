 SEATTLE, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham, one win away from claiming the MLS title with L A Galaxy, said on Thursday that despite the troubles that have accompanied his time in the United States he had never considered abandoning the team. Beckham will line up against Real Salt Lake in Sunday's MLS Cup final but his first two seasons in the US saw little success for the team and plenty of controversy.

"At the moment we're enjoying the success of the club and it would be nice to win the game. "But there's still a lot of hard work to do before then.
