 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)A London court has sentenced a 70-year-old Bangladeshi mother and her two sons to a total of 21 years for the violent dowry-related kidnap of her estranged son-in-law in 2008. Southwark Crown Court on Thursday found Sufia Khatun and sons Abu Hasnath, 40, and Abu Jahangir, 28, of East London, guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm with intent and blackmail. Sufia Khatun, a grandmother, ordered her two sons to "finish off" estranged son-in-law Abul Kalam if he did not pay the family 25,000, dowry, the court heard. Kalam, who separated from wife Momataz Chowdhury months before the incident, was beaten so badly he was left with a broken nose and cheekbone, which had to be reconstructed, the court heard. Hasnath and Jahangir took turns to beat Kalam in front of their mother during a terrifying eight-hour ordeal. Khatun, Hasnath and Jahinger were each jailed for seven years; Hasnath was also ordered to pay the victim 1000 compensation. Giving sentence, Judge Anthony Beddoe told Khatun: "You were the one who directed your sons to do what they have done." "You were in my judgement the prime mover as far as these events are concerned. You were the head of the family, and in a position to have stopped your sons." "This was a wicked enterprise, carried out for monetary gain, involving the forced detention of another human being, who with good reason thought he might lose his life that day," said the judge. He added: "None of you has expressed any remorse for what happened that day." On 20 May 2008, shortly before midday, the 41-year-old Abul Kalam was walking along Barking Road to a bank when a car pulled over, the court was told. Jahangir got out of the vehicle and ordered his brother-in-law to get in the car, threatening that he would kill him if he didn't follow his instructions. The victim got in the car and discovered Hasnath in the driver's seat and Sufia Khatun in the rear, said the prosecution. He was taken to their home in Rosebery Avenue, East London, and whilst in the car he was again threatened that if he should shout or try to run he would be killed. The victim was taken inside the kidnappers' family home and Sufia Khatun told her sons to "hit him and kill him", the court heard. Both Hasnath and Jahangir took turns to beat and kick the victim, who pleaded with Khatun to ask her sons to stop but she refused to help him. The brothers continued to assault him through the afternoon, each taking it in turn, the court was told. During this time they demanded he pay them 25,000. They also made calls to the victim's family demanding they pay-up in exchange for his release. A proactive police operation was launched by officers from the Kidnap Unit when police received a call from the hostage's family reporting the incident on the afternoon of the 20 May. After a pro-longed period of violence, during the afternoon Khatun and her sons agreed to let the hostage go having been assured by his family that they would pay the ransom demanded. The two brothers were arrested at Rosebery Avenue later on the evening of the 20 May, Khatun was arrested on 24 June. The victim had written to the court begging for mercy for his in-laws. But Judge Beddoe said: "Obligation to obey the laws of this land transcends cultural, social or other pressures. Those pressures cannot excuse offending as serious or vindictive as this is." Detective constable of the Metropolitan Police, Colin Burnett, who lead the investigation, said: "This was a violent and organised kidnap where those responsible showed little concern for the welfare of the hostage, exposing him to violence. Their only concern was the payment of a ransom."
