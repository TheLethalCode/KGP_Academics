 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24)Opposition BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has sought blessings of the nation for elder son Tarique Rahman's return home from the UK. "You all please pray for him. He will come back among you after recovering from illness," she said at a rally in Bogra on Friday marking the 45th birthday celebrations of Tarique. Tarique, the senior joint secretary, went abroad after securing bail in a raft of graft cases. The BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal organised the rally at the Sultanpur High School ground. The Chhatra Dal's seven-day celebrations marking the event are being rounded off in Bogra Friday. The former prime minister left Dhaka on Friday morning in a motorcade of more than a hundred vehicles to attend the ceremonies. Accompanied by BNP vice chair Sarwari Rahman, secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee member Khanadaker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, former speaker Jamir Uddin Sircar and other senior BNP leaders and MPs, Khaleda left the capital at 10am. She is scheduled to stop at roadside rallies in Tangail town, Elenga and Sirajganj. Local BNP leaders and supporters thronging both sides of the highway greeted Khaleda's motorcade at Ashulia, Tongi and Gazipur along her route out of the city. Over a hundred vehicles comprising the opposition leader's motorcade were carrying members of BNP metropolitan wing, and BNP associate organisations Jubo Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, Krishak Dal, Mohila Dal and Chhatra Dal. Khaleda has a packed schedule in Bogra. She also present winter clothes and relief materials among the homeless, and attend award giving ceremony and cultural show there.
