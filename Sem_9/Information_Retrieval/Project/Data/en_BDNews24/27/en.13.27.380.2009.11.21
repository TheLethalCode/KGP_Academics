 Jhenaidah, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The alleged leader of an inter district 'dacoit' gang was killed in a shootout with law enforcers on the Jhenaidah-Jessore highway on Saturday, police said. Jhenaidah police super Md Rezaul Karim identified the deceased as 30-year old Hazrat Ali of Patbila village in Kaliganj Upazila. Karim said police came upon the gang of robbers as they were placing a barricade, by felling a tree, on the highway at Salabhara bus stand in Kaliganj, in order to halt vehicles and rob them. As the police patrol team arrived on the spot at around 5:15am, the armed gang opened fire forcing the law enforcers to retaliate, he said. Other members of the gang eventually fled the scene leaving Hazrat's body behind, said the police official. Karim said the deceased was leader of a known network of inter-district bandits. Police recovered one shutter gun, two bullets and some locally made weapons from the scene, he said. He also said the dead man faced 16 cases, including two for murder and seven for robbery. bdnews
