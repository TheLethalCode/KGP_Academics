 BAGHDAD, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - FIFA has banned Asian champions Iraq after the country's Olympic Committee disbanded the governing board of the Iraqi Football Association, the culmination of a feud over control of the sport that has lasted for at least a year. Iraqi sports authorities were "were not surprised" football's world governing body decided to suspend the country from international competition on Friday, and already have lawyers working on an appeal, an official said. Samir al-Moussawi, a senior official of the Olympic committee, said the actions were not arbitrary nor the panel's fault. "It was the misleading reports that they (the IFA) delivered to FIFA and the mistakes they committed which led us to this point," Moussawi told Reuters late on Friday.

They say IFA leaders exaggerate the dangers of staging matches in Iraq for political reasons. The Olympic committee also said it was unacceptable that the head of the IFA, Hussein Saeed, had lived in Jordan for the past three years. It demanded the IFA elected a new governing board but the football federation has refused. Olympic committee members were enraged when FIFA intervened to extend the board's mandate. "This is very unfortunate. We warned everybody (about this) not because we want to stay in our positions but because we wanted our country to escape such a decision," deputy head of the IFA Najih Hmoud said. "It is not just the reputation of Iraqi football that has been hurt but the reputation of all of Iraq at a time when it is trying to stand on its feet again." Iraq surprised everyone, including their own fans, by winning the Asian Cup in 2007 but have struggled since th
