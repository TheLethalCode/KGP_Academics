 COPENHAGEN, Nov 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sixty-five world leaders have confirmed they will attend a UN conference in Copenhagen in December that will try to clinch a new global climate deal, and many more are considering, Danish officials said on Sunday. Facing splits in the climate talks, Denmark 10 days ago formally invited the heads of state and government of 191 UN member states to come for the final two days of the Dec. 7-18 conference to push for a deal at the meeting, originally meant for environment ministers. Danish officials declined to provide a full list of those who had agreed to come to the Copenhagen conference, but noted some leaders, such as those from Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Australia, Japan, Indonesia and Brazil, had announced their intention to attend. A government official said Denmark would let world leaders make their own announcements. He said in a brief email statement that the Danish government considered it positive that so many had accepted and others were still considering whether to attend. The United Nations said this month about 40 leaders had indicated plans to attend, mostly from developing nations as well as from Germany and Britain, even before the official invitation. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said he would come. And US President Barack Obama has said he would attend if it could give impetus to a deal. Marathon talks since 2007 have failed to overcome differences between developed and developing nations on issues such as the depth of greenhouse gas cuts by industrialised countries by 2020 or extra funds to help poor nations. Rasmussen's decision to invite world leaders is a calculated risk, analysts say. Their presence can raise chances of a deal but the need for a summit is an admission that negotiations are in trouble after a final round of talks in Barcelona this month. Many developing nations want the rich to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 as a condition for actions by the poor to start curbing their rising pollution. So far, promises by the rich fall far short, at cuts of about 11 to 15 percent. And developed nations have yet to meet promises of extra aid to developing countries. The EU has promised to cut emissions by a unilateral 20 percent below 1990 levels and by up to 30 percent if others follow suit. A draft bill before the US Senate would cut emissions to about seven percent below 1990 levels by 2
