 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Road accidents took more than 100 lives in just 21 days which, police said, caused by poor visibility due to fog and rash driving. Nearly 500 people were also injured in road accidents throughout the country, which took place in the period between November 27 and December 18. In the accidents, 20 people were killed on December 20 in Faridpur, six people on December 13 in Mymensingh and another eight people killed on December 14 in Gaibandha. Most of the accidents took place on the Dhaka-Mymensingh and Dhaka-northern district highways. During the period, 13 people were also killed in four separate accidents on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway while at least 20 people were killed in six accidents on the Dhaka-northern districts highways. Reasons for accident Police have blamed traffic rush ahead of Eid day and fog as the main reasons behind those accidents. Besides, problems like inefficiency of drivers, inadequate roads and faulty vehicles are responsible for the rise in accidents, they said. Highway police chief Sohrab Hossain told bdnews24.com, "Countless people went home and returned during Eid vacation. This caused an added pressure on the roads. "Besides, thick fog continued to disrupt transportation, which resulted in higher rate of accidents." Blaming the extreme traffic jam on Eid days, Sohrab said, "There are few exit points from Dhaka. To get on to the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, vehicles have to use only one road, and it is quite similar for Sylhet and Mymensingh. "To cover the time-loss, drivers rushed towards their destination. Moreover, overloaded vehicles remain vulnerable and responsible for accidents and deaths," he said. Sohrab said, "Besides, building of circles and structures at inter-sections has restricted movement of vehicles, contributing to traffic jam. There is such a circle in Chandra inter-section on Dhaka-northern districts highway, which sees persistent traffic standstill. "Police cannot stop vehicles for a check on overloading or over speeding as even a two minutes' halt causes long standstill. "To prevent accidents is not a responsibility only of the police. The owners, workers, passengers and BRTA -- all should be alert in this regard. If the passengers travel on the roof of buses, it makes difficult for us," he said. "Another new reason of callousness on road has been added with the drivers talking on mobile phones while driving," he said adding, "We came to know that this was the reason of the accident that took place on December 6 in Faridpur, in which 20 people were killed." He opined, "If people want to go home on Eid occasion thy can split time for the journey and reduce pressure on traffic. For example, Students and housewives can go home five or six days ahead of such events." Moreover, the drivers also should go through motivational and institutional training, he said. The highway police chief said that the highway police do not have the authority to file a case or make enquiries in a case as the Highway Police Ordinance is yet to be passed. "As its consequence, the highway police members are not working cordially, losing their interests." Awareness campaign Film actor Ilias Kanchan is working for many years to prevent accidents. According to him, "Accidents cannot be stopped due to the existing but non-operational laws. The passengers are also not aware." "We got the highway police as an outcome of long movement. However, they do not do anything excepting extortion." "Previously police members used to extort money standing on the streets, and now they extort as they move on their cars, he said.' However, the highway police chief refuted the accusation of extortion. Drivers' statements Dhaka- Naogaon route Bus driver Hamidul said sometimes the passengers get on to the roofs despite their opposition. However, he also admitted that overloaded buses often run on the roads. Dhaka- Bogra highway bus driver Ruhul Amin said, "We drive carefully, never run in high speed on a crowded road. But, if someone suddenly appears in front of a running bus, it becomes very difficult to avoid accident." According to Amin, the private cars move in high speed on the highways and as the drivers are not much experienced on highways, cause accidents. bdnews2
