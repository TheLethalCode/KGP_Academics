 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)Awami League joint general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif has called upon the grassroots supporters to stand up to the wrong politics of BNP. Ahead of the Martyred Intellectuals' Day and the Victory Day, the young AL leader gave the call while he was addressing an extended meeting of Dhaka metropolitan committee of the ruling party as chief guest on Friday. "We have to make the present generation aware of the misdeeds committed by saboteurs during the liberation war," said Hanif. Slating BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, he said, "We had expected Khaleda would make apologies to the nation for her misdeeds at the BNP council held on Dec 8." "Instead, she shifted the blame on to Awami League and disappointed the nation." He alleged that the appointment of Tarique Rahman as the BNP's senior vice chairman has incited the corrupt and the criminals once again. AL organising secretary and state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak said, "There is no alternative to strengthening the organisation." Dhaka metropolitan AL's acting president MA Aziz presided over the meeting where state minister for law Qamrul Islam and Dhaka metropolitan AL's general secretary Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya also spoke.
