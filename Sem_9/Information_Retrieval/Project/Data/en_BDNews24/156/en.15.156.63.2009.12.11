 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.coms environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Representatives of indigenous communities from different countries targeted US climate policy and the "energy industry's war" on indigenous lands and livelihoods on Thursday, at a protest during the climate talks in Copenhagen. "It was aimed to deliver a clear message to US president Barak Obama and tell him that peace begins with just energy and climate policies that respect human rights and the environment," Nikke Alex, one of the organisers, said of the protest. The Indigenous Environmental Network organised a march from Osterport train station to the US Embassy at Dag Hammarskjolds Alle, in the Danish capital, as part of their protest. The United States is the world's No. 2 emitter of greenhouse gases after China, and the only developed country not in the existing Kyoto mechanism to lower carbon emissions. Obama, who was in the Norwegian capital Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday, urged leaders to confront climate change during his acceptance speech and warned of dire consequences if the world did nothing to curb rising carbon emissions. Back in Denmark, the indigenous representatives demanded action instead of rhetoric. "We need real solutions in Copenhagen," said one protestor. Ancestral ways of life and homelands are imperiled by devastating proposals for fossil fuel drilling and development, said Colleen Swan of Kivalina, Peru. "The entire economy of the world is fueled by the petro economy and exploration and production of petrochemicals and fossil fuels ... This must change." Erin Freeland, form Canada, told bdnews24.com: "We are also here to demand a binding treaty to go with ambitious targets. Because climate change across the world is an issue of human rights." "We need to stop infringements of human rights caused by climate change for every community of the world." "Climate change is a threat to every one, but specifically to the indigenous people. Because they are still connected directly to the earth, through their food, water and living," she said. Jemimah Naltei, from Kenya, said: "For me, the community I come from is mostly dependent on cattle, animals ... But prolonged drought over the last five years, as a result of changing climate, has killed our animals." "Nobody talks about the sufferings of indigenous people as a result of climate change. They might be a small group, but they are not outside of this world," she said.
