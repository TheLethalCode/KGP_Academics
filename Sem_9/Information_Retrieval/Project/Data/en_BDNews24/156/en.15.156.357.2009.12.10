 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)--Rapid Action Battalion chief Hassan Mahmood Khandaker says the elite anticrime force is not violating the law neither is it committing extra-judicial killings. "RAB is not doing beyond law. It is not taking any innocent or a recognised terrorist under custody and killing," he said in a views exchange meeting with the journalists at the RAB headquarters Thursday. In November, three people were killed and six took bullets in 'gunfights' with RAB, he added. Asked if the crossfire or gunfight incidents are violation of human rights, Khandaker said, "RAB personnel are trained on human rights and investigations are conducted on their activities. "However, we do not say we make no mistake." Around 750 RAB members had been punished for their offences so far, while some 350 suspended or facing jail, he added. Replying to a question on threats from the Indian insurgent United Liberation Front of Assam in Bangladesh, as some media reports suggest, he said his force was on the alert to tackle any threat. Tight security will be put in place on the Martyred Intellectuals' Day, the Victory Day and on the New Year's Eve, he added. Khandaker claimed the security order situation in November was satisfactory, and added that no major incident happened on Eid days, he said. In drives, the elite force recovered some 118 firearms and collected fines worth Tk 5.4 lakh for adulteration. It also launched operation to catch gangs who counterfeit bank notes and driving licences. High RAB officials including the additional director-general Mizanur Rahman attended the meeting. b
