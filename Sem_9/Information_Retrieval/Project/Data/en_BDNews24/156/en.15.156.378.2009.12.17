 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)Abul Kashem, who was stripped of his parliament membership by the High Court, secured on Thursday a six-week stay order from the Supreme Court against the ruling. Appellate division chamber judge SK Sinha issued the stay order on hearing the appeal, earlier filed by Kashem's counsel Shah Manzurul Haq. Huq said Kashem will now continue to pursue activities as MP during the period. The High Court on Tuesday ordered the Election Commission to cancel Kashem's parliamentary membership of Tangail-5, because of loan default. It also ordered the EC to declare Mahmudul Hasan of BNP , who was the runner up in the general election, elected. The district returning officer on Dec 4 declared the nomination of Abul Kashem legal. bdnews
