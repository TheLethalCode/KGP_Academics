 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka will host a weeklong international film festival from Jan 23-29. Festival director Morshedul Islam said they will be screening over 150 films arriving from 46 countries. The shows will be simultaneously hosted by 12 venues scattered all around the capital city. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has agreed to inaugurate the festival on Jan 23, he said. The festival organised annually since 2008 by the Children's Film Society Bangladesh this year will have the slogan: 'Future dreams in frames'. Unicef and Warid Telecomm are co-sponsored the event. "The festival aims at introducing Bangladesh children to the variegated culture and heritage forms in today's world through screening creative films from different countries and help them develop their potential, talent and creative faculties," Islam said on Thursday. The Central Public Library and its Shawkat Osman Auditorium will be the main focus of the festival activities. The other venues are Bangladesh Shishu Academy Auditorium, Star Cineplex, the British Council, German Cultural Centre, Russian Science and Cultural Centre, Iranian Cultural Centre and Alliance Francaise Dhanmandi and Uttara centres. The films will also be screened in three more auditoriums in Mirpur, Agargaon and Khilgaon. A total of 125 child delegates have been invited to the festival, including 10 disadvantaged and 10 disabled children, said Islam, a film maker. The delegates will spend the time participating in seminars, workshops and meetings with eminent personalities. The shows will be held every day at 11am, 2pm, 4pm and 6pm. They will be free for all children, but connoisseurs aged over 18 years will have to buy tickets priced at Tk 30 each. Artiste Mustafa Monwar, chairman of the festival advisory council, said, "Amid the commercial humdrum of the TV attractions, this festival will provide children with a refreshing and imagination-invoking break from the monotonous cable TV cultural melodramas." "Let's hope efforts of this genre will gradually spread to the greater Bangladesh lying outside the capital city." Muhammed Jafar Iqbal, festival co-chair and president of Bangladesh Children Films Society, said, "This festival will play an important role in activating the child's mental faculties in addition to proving simple and pure entertainment." "Delegates from other regions of Bangladesh are joining the festival. We are getting support from the government too. We hope that the movement will gradually spread throughout." Asaduzzaman, Warid representative, Unicef's Arifa S Sharmin and Transparency International Bangladesh's Rezwanul Alam were present at the news conference. bd
