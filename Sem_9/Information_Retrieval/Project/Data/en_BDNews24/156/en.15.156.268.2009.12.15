 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, 15 Dec (bdnews24.com)  Financing an expected adaptation fund remains a sticking point in climate talks at Copenhagen, as heads of state and government gather in the Danish capital for the crucial high-level segment and summit. Time is short if the talks are to ensure a result, organisers of the conference said on Tuesday, as ministers strived to break a deadlock just three days before world leaders are meant to agree a new global climate deal. UN climate chief Yvo de Boer said there was some progress but "an enormous amount of work" remained. "[Delegates] have to be extremely aggressive and focused over the next 48 hours if we want success," conference president Conne Hedegard a briefing at the Bella Centre ahead of the high-level segment. Hedegard, Denmark's energy and climate minister, said ministers were currently consulting on five main issues, including mitigation targets of developed nations, mitigation action for developing countries and securing finance for the long term. "They know that time is limited. They have been very busy." The difficult issue was the size of the expected adaptation fund, she said. "We still need progress on finance. Longer term finance as well including innovative sources. We will not get enough substantial finance to the table unless we also come up with some innovative ides." She said it was not enough just to talk about short term finance. "We must also have the other part of finance. Government structure for the finance is a huge issue." Boer said the talks had reached "a very distinct and important moment." There had been progress in a number of areas, the UNFCC executive secretary said. "But there is still an enormous amount of work and grounds to be covered if this conference is to deliver world people around the world expected to deliver." "Now it is time for world leaders to ensure a result here," he told the briefing. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina left for Copenhagen late on Monday, a day which saw the UN climate talks stall as developing countries accused rich nations of trying to kill the Kyoto Protocol. During her five-day stay, Hasina will attend the Joint High-Level Segment of the climate talks on Dec 16 and 17. On Dec 18, she will attend the opening ceremony of the main summit, to be addressed among others by the Danish prime minister and UN chief. She will join a discussion session after the summit, and attend the plenary meeting to adopt the agreed outcome on the same day. US president Barack Obama rang Hasina Monday night, just before her flight, to say that Bangladesh as a climate change-hit country plays a vital role in climate talks. Obama assured Hasina of his country's sincere efforts to help Bangladesh get due help to deal with climate change, a spokesman for the prime minister told bdnews24.com. The spokesman said Bangladesh has also convinced neighbours India and China--countries that have a bigger say in the ongoing talks-- to speak for her. Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh postponed a crucial December meeting to attend the Copenhagen talks. British prime minister Gordon Brown, meanwhile, also extended his country's support for Bangladesh on climate issues ahead of her departure. Speaking to Hasina by telephone last Saturday, Brown offered to meet her on the sidelines of the summit, according to the prime minister's office. Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Dec 7-18 climate talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal. The Bangladesh delegation already in Copenhagen has also been urging rich nations to contribute at least $100 billion a year for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, are among the high level delegation accompanying the prime minister.
