 (UPDATE 2: Adds quotes of prime minister's press secretary) Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)British prime minister Gordon Brown called his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina on Saturday to extend his country's support on climate change issues. Brown and Hasina discussed the UK's commitment to a climate fund for Bangladesh and other vulnerable countries, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. The two premiers agreed to a meeting on the sidelines of the Copenhagen climate summit, said Azad. A source close to the prime minister also told bdnews24.com, quoting Hasina: "The British prime minister assured Bangladesh of continuing support from his government in all areas, including climate change issues." Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, is urging rich nations to contribute hundreds of billions for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. The British premier has been among the few world leaders to back a global fund to the tune of $200 billion. Britain is also the first country to contribute 75 million pounds to Bangladesh's own multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation. The UK's international development agency DFID helped the Bangladesh government too in formulating its climate change strategy and action plan. Hasina thanked Brown for all of the UK's support, but said more was needed, Azad said. Meanwhile, the European Union on Friday made a commitment of 10 billion euros over three years to the global climate fund being negotiated at the Copenhagen climate talks. The Bangladesh delegation currently in Copenhagen has said this is not enough. Hasina is scheduled to leave Dhaka for the heads of government session in Copenhagen on Dec 14. bdnews
