 BANGKOK, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai authorities seized more than 35 tonnes of arms from a cargo plane they said had come from North Korea, and arrested its five crew members after the aircraft made an emergency landing at a Bangkok airport. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn told Reuters on Saturday the action was taken after the plane landed at Don Muang airport and "suspicious" cargo was found on board.
