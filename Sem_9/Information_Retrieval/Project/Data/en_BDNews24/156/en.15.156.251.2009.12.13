 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)It's not the climate conference now underway in Copenhagen, nor is it the war in Afghanistan dominating the front pages or the airwaves in America these days. For the past few days, the only news that is making headlines is the adultery committed by the world's richest and most recognizable athletegolf superstar Tiger Woods. On Saturday, for instance, two major TV networksABC News and NBC Newsstarted off with the news of Tiger Woods' unfolding extramarital affair that came to light after his SUV crashed into a tree in front of his Orlando mansion two weeks ago. The news of the accident first generated a lot of concern about his wellbeing from his fans and sport lovers all over the world but at the same time it raised a lot of questions as to what led Tiger to leave his house alone in the wee hours, apparently in a huff. The subsequent events made it clear that he had a fight with his wife over his extramarital affair, which she reportedly discovered from his cell phone text message. What followed in the days ahead had been the perfect fodder for tabloid press as a gaggle of buxom, sexy women emerged from hibernation claiming they had physical relationship with Tiger. To the horror of his wife and his legion of fans, as many as 13 women came forward in the past one week describing their tryst with Tiger in lurid details on television that captivated not only America but the rest of the world. The women whose names have been linked to the transgressing Tiger have been described, in part, by their physical attributes -- busty -- but also by their day jobs. The list of ladies has included both cocktail and pancake-house waitresses, a lingerie model and two porn actresses. Intriguingly, the man who is at the center of all these remained silent throughout, keeping the gossip machine running relentlessly. On Friday, however, Tiger issued a statement through his website, saying, "I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children. I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness. It may not be possible to repair the damage I've done, but I want to do my best to try. I would like to ask everyone, including my fans, the good people at my foundation, business partners, the PGA Tour, and my fellow competitors, for their understanding. What's most important now is that my family has the time, privacy, and safe haven we will need for personal healing. After much soul searching, I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf. I need to focus my attention on being a better husband, father, and person". Tiger's public apology might have put a stop, at least temporarily, to the unfolding sex saga but it is unlikely to end the story in the near future. Frankly, it's not the juicy part of the story that is generating so much interest as adultery on the part of celebrities is not uncommon in America. It's the billion dollar industry that Tiger Inc. represents that now seems to be the focus of all attention. As one of the world's most valuable pitchmen, Tiger is tied to a number of high profile companies that sell their products using his name and image. Moreover, a number of TV networks have in recent years made huge money by broadcasting live golf tournaments featuring Tiger. And that is what is at stake since he announced his departure from the game indefinitely on Friday evening. America loves comeback stories, but his future ad opportunities are likely to be limited to sports product endorsements, significantly reducing his earnings power, as well as the companies he representsNike, Gillette, AT&T, Gatorade, Accenture and others. No companies have cut ties altogether to Woods in the weeks since his marital troubles came to light, tarnishing the image of a man who spent 13 years in the public eye carefully cultivating a good guy image. But with the 33-year-old's decision to leave golf - at least temporarily - they're now forced to consider their future with him. On Saturday, Gillette announced that it won't feature Woods in its ads for an unspecified period of time. It was the first major sponsor to distance itself from Woods. Gillette, which uses the slogan "The best a man can get," said it won't air advertisements featuring Woods or include him in public appearances. Woods was hired by Gillette in 2007 and has been in ads for Gillette Fusion Power razors with titles like "Phenom" and "Champions" with other stars including tennis great Roger Federer and soccer player Thierry Henry. AT&T said it is evaluating its relationship with the golfer. Representatives from Accenture won't say what its plans are regarding Woods, whom the consulting firm has used to personify its claimed attributes of integrity and high performance. But its Web site no longer displays on its home page an image of the golfer that had been there as recently as Thursday. Nike Inc said late Friday it supports his decision. Gatorade, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., said previously it supports Woods and said Saturday it has no updated comment. EA Sports has been selling Tiger Woods video golf games for a decade, and its next edition featuring him comes out in six months, giving it time to see what happens. Before the Nov. 27 car accident that exposed Woods' alleged serial infidelity, 91 percent of the opinions expressed about him on the Internet were positive, according to Zeta Interactive. As of Saturday, Woods' positive rating online had fallen to just 41 percent. That's bad news for Accenture. The global consulting and outsourcing firm lauded its connections with Woods in a 2006 news release, saying its "Go on, be a Tiger" campaign had boosted its image significantly. Others at risk of becoming collateral damage include: the television networks that drove up the bidding to show golf tournaments and other professional golfers who have benefited from the quadrupling of prize money since Woods joined the PGA tour in 1996. The PGA's contracts with TV broadcasters NBC and CBS expire in 2012, with negotiations on a new deal likely to begin during the second half of next year. As a measure of Woods' importance to the PGA, the average television rating fell by nearly 50 percent for a host of 2008 tournaments that Woods missed while he was recovering from knee surgery, according to Nielsen Co.
