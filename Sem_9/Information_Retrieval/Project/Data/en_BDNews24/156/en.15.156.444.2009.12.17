<TITLE> Pakistan court ruling raises questions over Zardari </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani court decision to strike down an amnesty protecting politicians and officials has thrown President Asif Ali Zardari's future into question as US pressure builds for more Pakistani action against militants. The Supreme Court threw out on Wednesday the 2007 amnesty that had protected Zardari and top aides from graft charges, heaping pressure on the unpopular pro-American leader, even though he is still protected by presidential immunity. The United States is keen to see Pakistan widen its battle against homegrown Taliban as part of its efforts to stabilise Afghanistan, and will be dismayed if political troubles distract the government from the campaign. Immediately after the ruling, Zardari's spokesmen said the president's ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) respected the decision but there was no question of the president resigning. A senior leader of the main opposition party said Zardari should do the right thing and resign. "He should quit this office in his own interest as well as in the interest of his party and the system. He can get any member of his party elected to the post," said Khawaja Mohammad Asif of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party. "He will achieve the high moral ground," he said. Stock investors have been unnerved by both political uncertainty and militant violence. Trade was thin on Thursday but the main index was 0.6 percent up at 9,309.52 at 0820 GMT. The Supreme Court ruling means that all old cases covered by the amnesty, most of them corruption cases, have been revived. It also asked the government to seek the revival of cases lodged in foreign countries. Some legal experts say the danger for the president is that the legitimacy of his 2008 election as president could be challenged now that old cases against him have been revived. The amnesty was introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf as part of a power-sharing deal brokered with Zardari's late wife, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, with U.S. and British encouragement. Bhutto returned to Pakistan from self-imposed exile soon after the amnesty was introduced, but she was assassinated weeks later while campaigning for a general election she hoped to win. Instead, Zardari led her party to victory in the February 2008 polls and became president after Musharraf stepped down later that year. TARNISHED IMAGE But his image has long been tarnished by allegedly shady deals during Bhutto's two terms as prime minister in the 1990s. He says the charges were politically motivated. He has never been convicted but nevertheless spent 11 years in jail. Among those protected by the amnesty were the interior and defence ministers and several of Zardari's top aides. The News newspaper, a fierce critic of the president, said the court decision had ushered in a "moral renaissance" and signalled that corruption would no longer be tolerated. "Today he (Zardari) must be looking over his shoulder and eyeing his foreign investment portfolio -- not to mention future options as a place of domicile," it said. In another ominous development for the president, the Supreme Court ordered the government to inform Swiss authorities that a case against him there may be reopened. Swiss judicial authorities said in August 2008 they had closed a money-laundering case against Zardari and had released $60 million frozen in Swiss accounts for a decade, soon after Pakistan dropped out of all cases it had initiated there. Geneva judicial authorities had for years been investigating allegations that Bhutto and Zardari took kickbacks from Swiss cargo inspection companies and channeled some $12 million via offshore companies in Swiss bank accou
