 TEHRAN, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's opposition accused the authorities on Sunday of preparing "unconventional" actions to uproot the reform movement, after official media said pro-opposition students had destroyed pictures of religious leaders. Some reformist websites suggested that opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi may be arrested, six months after his defeat to conservative President Mahmoud Ahmadinjad in a disputed election plunged the Islamic Republic into turmoil. Officials were not immediately available for comment on the unsourced reports. Hardliners have in the past called for Mousavi to be prosecuted for fomenting widespread street unrest after the June presidential poll. Any arrest of Mousavi, whose supporters say the vote was rigged to secure Ahmadinejad's re-election, may spark new opposition demonstrations. A statement posted on Mousavi's official Kaleme website said, referring to accusations by the authorities that the opposition had "insulted" late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during student rallies last Monday: "By implementation of a pre-planned scenario to insult Khomeini and linking it to the students ... they (the authorities) are paving the way for unconventional methods." The statement added: "We are suggesting to all supporters of the Green (opposition) movement to be fully alert and keep themselves updated about the latest developments." Another reformist website, Tagheer, said: "Based on reports ... Mousavi may be arrested." State television has broadcast footage of what it said were opposition supporters tearing up and trampling on a picture of Khomeini during anti-government demonstrations on December 7. A nationwide rally on that day to mark the killing of three students under the Shah turned violent when reformist students clashed with security forces armed with batons and tear gas in the largest such protests in months. "NO LENIENCY" Mobile phone footage posted on the Internet, although not verifiable, showed students burning posters of Ahmadinejad, Khomeini, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khomeini, who led the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah, remains widely revered in Iran. He died in 1989 and was succeeded by Khamenei as supreme leader, Iran's highest authority under its government system of clerical rule. On Saturday, crowds of clerics from theological schools and other leadership loyalists staged pro-government rallies in cities across Iran, chanting "Death to America" and "Death to opponents of the Supreme Leader," official media reported. Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said there would be "no leniency" towards those who insulated Khomeini. Mousavi condemned the "insult" towards Khomeini, daily Jomhuri Eslami reported on Saturday. "No just and pious human being would allow himself to do such a thing," he said. During the election campaign, Mousavi attacked Ahmadinejad's foreign and economic policies, but he also advocated a return to the "fundamental values" of Khomeini. The authorities have rejected vote fraud charges and portrayed the huge pro-Mousavi protests that erupted after the poll as a foreign-backed bid to undermine the Islamic Republic. Last Monday's opposition protests were much smaller than those in the days after the election. But the mood seemed more radical with protesters chanting slogans against the clerical establishment and not just criticising Ahmadinejad's victory. The June election plunged Iran into its deepest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deepening divisions within the establishment. Thousands of Mousavi supporters were detained after the vote, including senior reformers. Most have been freed but about 80 people have received jail terms of up to 15 years and five have been sentenced to death over the post-vote unre
