 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government has upgraded nurses to second class employees and raised their age limit to 36 years, a health ministry statement said on Monday. The move was taken at a cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The cabinet also decided to appoint 2649 new nurses to boost healthcare services in the country. Previously the nurses were third class employees and their age limit was 30. However, for the children of freedom fighters the limit was 32. "Immediately, 2649 nurses will be appointed. The age limit has been raised to 36 for the nurses to be appointed until 2010," the ministry statement said. Nurses from now on have been upgraded from third class to second class employees, a press release from health ministry said Monday. Meanwhile, the regular weekly cabinet meeting approved on Monday a proposal of appointing 2,649 nurses against vacant posts to provide a better health service in the country, officials said. "Nurses will be appointed on an emergency basis against 2,649 posts," prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters. "The prime minister has asked to raise professional standard and greater social status for the nurses," he said. The cabinet at a meeting, chaired by the prime minister, endorsed two other proposals, he said. "The cabinet approved in principle a proposal to constitute the Barisal University (Amendment) Law 2009," Azad said. He said Barisal Science and Technology University Law was passed in 2001, but it was annulled in 2006. Currently, the amendment to Barisal University Law has been initiated upon request from Barisal City Corporation Mayor, the secretary said. Moreover, the cabinet has finalised the Islamic University (Ammendment) Law, 2009, Azad said.
