 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Chakoria, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)The second largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh, the 'Chakoria Sundarbans' in the southeastern district of Cox's Bazaar, has been totally depleted in a matter of decades. Deforestation plays a huge role in climate change  destruction of forests and land use change contributes approximately 20 to 25 percent of the carbon emissions that cause climate change, scientists say. "I have been frequenting the Chakoria Sundarbans area since my boyhood; it has been distressing to witness this forest vanishing during my lifetime," Abul Kalam, 76, told bdnews24.com. "More so, because the plunderers, all of them, have got away without paying for their crimes," said Kalam. The Chakoria Sundarbans, unlike the Sundarban of the southwest, is a manmade mangrove or 'parabon' forest almost a century old. It once sprawled along the Bay coast from West Ulahazara to Badarkhali on the east of the Moheshkhali Channel. Prof Kamal Hossain, of Chittagong University's Institute of Forestry and Environmental Science, told bdnews24.com: "The hundred year old Chakoria Sundarbans virtually disappeared over a period of just 30 yearsstarting in the 1960s and vanishing almost totally in the '90s." The forestland was denuded "most mercilessly" in the 1980s, with illegal logging and land grabbing, he said. Land use was turned to salt and shrimp production. "Many locals were forced to switch livelihoods to salt production and shrimp farming," said Hossain. Abul Kalam, who has visited the Sundarbans in the southwest district of Khulna, urged all concerned to take steps so that it doesn't suffer the same fate that Chakoria has. The Khulna Sundarban is part of the largest unbroken stretches of natural mangrove forest in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site "Chakoria was home to abundant wildlife in the past. The grabbers who finished Chakoria forest have now reached out to the southwestern Sundarbans. I'm afraid that we won't save that last bit of forest, our national pride." Philip Gain, executive director of the Centre for Environmental and Human Development, told bdnews24.com: "Chakoria forest along with its rich biodiversity has been lost to human greed. Now the Sundarbans face the same threat with the expansion of salt and shrimp production there." "The depletion of the country's second largest mangrove forest is going 'unnoticed' by the official conservators, which compels you to seriously ponder the fate of the Sundarbans," said Chakoria upazila nirbahi officer Zakir Hossain. He recommended replanting the denuded forest patches with mangrove saplings to reduce the risk of climate change-induced disasters hitting the vulnerable coasts. Professor Hossain said at least 16 percent of the Sundarbans in Khulna has already suffered serious damage, and with that the overall coastal environment and ecological balance is getting disturbed. Bangladesh boasts about two-thirds of the Sundarbans proper in the southwest, covering an area of about a thousand square kilometers in Khulna; the remainder is in the adjoining Indian state of West Bengal. The link between forests and climate change is now widely accepted. One of the most prominent reports in recent years, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the UK government and released in October 2006, was in no doubt about the impact forests have on our climate. "Action to preserve the remaining areas of natural forest is needed urgently," it said, and called for "large scale pilot schemes... to explore effective approaches to combining national action and international support". Prof Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The government is launching efforts to adapt to climate change, yet our forests are being depleted before the very eyes of the administration. This cannot be allowed to go on." He called upon the government to take exemplary punitive measures against forest plundering. bdnews24.
