<TITLE> 300 or 3,000 illegal structures along N'ganj rivers? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Narayanganj district authorities say there are anywhere between 300 and 3,000 illegal structures along three major rivers flowing through the district, depending on which survey records are followed. Officials said Saturday they have completed their work on identifying occupied land and illegal structures along the borders of the Buriganga, Shitalakhya and Balu rivers within the district limits, and are ready to submit a report in line with a High Court order. Narayanganj deputy commissioner Shamsul Rahman told local reporters that according to original cadastral survey records the total area of occupied land on both sides of the three rivers is about 1,158.61 acres with 3,010 illegal installations. Meanwhile, following revisional survey (RS) records, the area of occupied land is about 186.77 acres with 320 illegal installations. Explaining the huge difference between the two sets of data, the commissioner said the baseline timeframe of the two sets of surveys is separated by a gap of many decades. From 1888 to 1940, a cadastral survey of undivided Bengal created the original record of land rights, often still accepted as evidence by modern courts. Since the original cadastral surveys, the rivers gradually and naturally lost their depth and width. As a result, by the time revisional surveys were conducted between 1973-1983, new land raised by the natural siltation process was bought up and land ownership records published by gazette, he said. Which survey and land ownership records to follow in the bid to recover riverside lands and stop future encroachment is now a matter for the High Court to decide, officials said. The commissioner said his office will submit its report to the High Court on Sunday. The court, earlier this year, served a number of directives on the government in a bid to safeguard the ecologically threatened Buriganga, Turag, Shitalakhha and Balu rivers, which circle the capital and adjoining districts. It ordered the demolition of illegal structures encroaching the four rivers. It also directed the deputy commissioners of Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Munshiganj to demarcate the river boundaries, to prevent encroachment, after carrying out new river surveys. The court further ordered the environment ministry to declare the four rivers 'ecologically critical zones'. The directives follow a public interest petition by five Supreme Court lawyers and non-government organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. bdnew
