 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)--The Awami League is observing the Victory Day on Wednesday by paying homage to the martyrs of Independence War. The ruling party leaders, led by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, paid tributes at the National Memorial at Savar at dawn. Later, party leaders and supporters along with presidium member Obaidul Qader paid floral tributes to the portrait of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Dhanmondi. Qader told reporters, "Let's promise to build a 'digital Bangladesh' under the leadership of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. We want to build a happy and prosperous Bangladesh." Wounded freedom fighters then paid their respects by laying floral wreaths at the portrait and remained silent for one minute as a mark of respect to the nation's independence architect. They demanded war crimes trial without further delay. Other associate organisations of the AL also paid homage to the martyrs. The party took out a rally at 3pm from the Suhrawardy Udyan. bd
