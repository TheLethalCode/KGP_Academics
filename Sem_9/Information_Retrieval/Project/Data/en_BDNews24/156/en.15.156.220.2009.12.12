 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)  Nobel laureate Yuan T Lee said the scientists will have to work together and share knowledge, new technological options and the limited resources available to solve the problems across the world. "We must work together as a community to find new sustainable ways to re-establish an intimate relation with biosphere, live in harmony with nature and return to a more direct relationship with the mighty power of the sun," said at the 45th convocation of the Dhaka University on Saturday. Earlier, professor Yuan T Lee, who received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1986, was conferred with honorary 'Doctor of Science' at the convocation, which also conferred the degree on Professor Abul Hussam and Professor Ranajit Guha. The two were not present at the ceremony. He said in order to cope with global climatic crisis, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested that developed countries need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to provide a reasonable chance of averting warming. "It is unfortunate that the so-called developing countries are following the footsteps of developed countries..." He stressed the importance of concerted efforts to advance science and technology and educate a new generation of creative scientists. Professor Abul Hussam, whose acceptance speech was read out at the convocation, has called upon the politicians and academicians to take any action that might depoliticise academic institutions. "On the average each student lost 2 years of his productive life and this is happening over at least 30 years. Consequently, a lot of money (your parent's money), and national resources were simply wasted," he said. Hussam said, "I urge the politicians and academicians to undertake the courageous decision to do whatever it takes to depoliticise our academic environment and challenge the young people to perform at their highest potential." He also criticised the authorities for not providing a quality education to the students. "The emergent national problems such as arsenic crisis, water crises, looming energy crisis, severe environmental crisis, and the rise of preventable diseases in epidemic proportions, and the overall poverty cannot be solved by ill-equipped scientists and technologists," he said. Abul Hussam, a former DU student in chemistry, has been awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree for inventing the 'Sono' arsenic filter. Hussam developed his filter after years of testing hundreds of prototypes. The final version contains 20 pounds of shards of porous iron, which bonds chemically with arsenic. It also includes charcoal, sand and bits of brick. It filters nearly all of the arsenic from the well water. bd
