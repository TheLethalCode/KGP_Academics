<TITLE> Woods's break to fuel high-stakes guessing game </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Tiger Woods's decision to take an indefinite break from golf amid embarrassing revelations about his personal life has set off a high-stakes guessing game as to when the game's most popular and bankable player will return. After being swamped by a deluge of media reports on his numerous extra-marital affairs, Woods finally addressed his infidelities on Friday, apologizing to his wife and children after previously only admitting to "transgressions." "I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children," the 33-year-old said in a statement on his website (www.tigerwoods.com). "I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness. It may not be possible to repair the damage I've done, but I want to do my best to try." The world number one golfer's withdrawal, without a hint of a time-table for his return, has raised questions about how fans and sponsors will react, and how much the game will suffer for his absence. Woods had already pulled out of his own charity event in California last month, citing minor injuries from the bizarre early morning car accident that began the chain of revelations that has unraveled his image of clean-cut perfection. It had been thought the American might target the Century Club of San Diego Invitational at Torrey Pines in late January for his 2010 debut, but that now seems highly unlikely. "He's played in our tournament 11 years in a row except for last year when he had his injury from the US Open," San Diego tournament director Rick Schloss told Reuters in a telephone interview. "Obviously it's a difficult decision for him to take the time off from the tour but obviously these are personal decisions and we accept those and hopefully when everything gets back to normal he'll be back in San Diego." COUNTING THE DAYS Woods's impact on the PGA Tour has been well documented and his periods of absence from it have been mourned by organizers, fans and sponsors alike. His eight-month hiatus from the tour in 2008-2009 after knee surgery following his US Open triumph at Torrey Pines last year, hammered TV ratings and crowd attendances, leaving officials counting the days before his return in February. Interest will be intense when Woods comes back to competition, as inevitably, will be the media reception. The American father of two showed flashes of top form this year, raising hopes he might be poised for a spectacular year and a chance to add to his 14 major titles. Apart from Woods's usual happy hunting ground at Augusta, the US Open will be played at Pebble Beach and the British Open at St Andrews -- two of his most favorite venues. But instead of building momentum for the majors early in the year, Woods must now face up to his personal issues, the potential loss of sponsorship deals that helped make him the world's first billionaire athlete, and the disappointment of fans who once held him up as a lofty role model. Despite the tawdry revelations that continue to dog Woods in the media, golf officials have provided statements of support. "We fully support Tiger's decision to step away from competitive golf to focus on his family," US PGA Tour chief Tim Finchem said in a statement. "His priorities are where they need to be, and we will continue to respect and honor his family's request for privacy. We look forward to Tiger's return to the PGA Tour." One of Woods's largest sponsors has already said it will stand by the golfer. "Tiger has been part of Nike for more than a decade," the company said in a statement. "He is the best golfer in the world and one of the greatest athletes of his era. We look forward to his return to golf. He and his family have Nike's full support." The CEO of the PGA of Australia, Max Garske, who was among the nearly 100,000 people to have welcomed Woods to Melbourne for the Australian Masters last month, also weighed in, underlying the golfer's immense global appeal. "We fully support what a delicate situation it is for Tiger and his family where clearly they need their privacy and time to rebuild their lives," Garske said. While more sponsors and officials are likely to offer their unqualified support, Woods's agent and friend Mark Steinberg has acknowledged that the golfer's world, economic and personal, may have changed irrevocably. "The entirety of someone's life is more important than just a professional career," Steinberg said in a statement. "What matters most is a young family that is trying to cope with difficult life issues in a secluded and caring way. Whenever Tiger may return to the game, should be on the family's terms alone." Steinberg, however, is also prepared for defections on the business side. "Of course, each sponsor has unique considerations and ultimately the decisions they make we would fully understand and accept," he s
