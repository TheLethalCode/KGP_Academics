<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hardliners accused Iran's reformist opposition on Saturday of seeking the removal of key pillars of the Islamic Republic, including the office of the supreme leader, and of insulting the memory of its late founder. Conservative clerics spoke out against the opposition a few days after pro-reform students, seeking to renew their challenge to the re-election President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad clashed with police in Tehran and elsewhere. Crowds of clerics from theological schools and other leadership loyalists staged rallies in cities across Iran, chanting "Death to America" and "Death to opponents of the Supreme Leader," official media reported. "What they (the opposition) are after is to have a thin layer remaining of the Islamic Republic," Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said in a speech in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom. Saturday's events were held to protest against an "insult" to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-backed Shah and who remains widely revered in Iran. State television has broadcast footage of what it said were opposition supporters tearing up and trampling on a picture of Khomeini during anti-government demonstrations on December 7. A nationwide rally on that day to mark the killing of three students under the shah turned violent when reformist students clashed with security forces armed with batons and tear gas in the largest such protests in months. "There will be no leniency towards those who insulted the Imam," said Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, referring to Khomeini, who died in 1989 and was succeeded by the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi, a moderate who came second in the June election, condemned the "insult" towards Khomeini, daily Jomhuri Eslami reported. "No just and pious human being would allow himself to do such a thing," he said. "ISLAM'S ENEMIES" During the election campaign, Mousavi attacked Ahmadinejad's foreign and economic policies, but he also advocated a return to the "fundamental values" of Khomeini. Mousavi and his backers say the presidential poll was rigged to secure a second four-year term for Ahmadinejad, whose victory was swiftly endorsed by Khamenei. The authorities have rejected vote fraud charges and portrayed the huge pro-Mousavi protests that erupted after the poll as a foreign-backed bid to undermine the Islamic system of government implemented after the 1979 revolution. "They are after an Islamic Republic without Islamic jurisprudence and without the Guardian Council," Khatami said, referring to the institution of the supreme leader and a powerful 12-member legislative body. The comment was echoed by a senior cleric in the northwestern city of Tabriz, Ayatollah Mohsen Mojtahed Shabastari, who said the opposition's intention was "to get rid of the supreme leader," IRNA news agency reported. Last Monday's opposition protests were much smaller than those in the days after the election. But the mood seemed more radical with protesters chanting slogans against the clerical establishment and not just criticising Ahmadinejad's victory. A day later, a senior judiciary official said Iran would "show no mercy" towards demonstrators seen as threatening national security, comments underlined by a Revolutionary Guards official on Saturday. "Although we are quiet today at the order of the supreme leader, we are ready and prepared to firmly confront Islam's enemies and counter-revolutionaries with a signalling of his finger," said Ayoub Hassanzadeh, a cleric who is Khamenei's representative in the Guards' airforce. The June election plunged Iran into deep political turmoil and exposed deepening divisions within the establishment. Thousands of Mousavi supporters were detained after the vote, including senior reformers. Most have been freed but about 80 people have received jail terms of up to 15 years and five have been sentenced to death over the post-vote unrest. Hardliners have called for Mousavi to also be prosecut
