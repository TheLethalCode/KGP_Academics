 SYDNEY, Dec 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian movie "Samson and Delilah," about the plight of many Aboriginal communities, won the country's top film award Saturday, another major prize this year after it scored honors at the Cannes Film Festival. The film swept the Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards which were presented at a televised gala in Melbourne, with its director, Warwick Thornton, taking home the award for best direction as well as for best original screenplay. Thornton, who was raised in Alice Springs in the heart of Australia, had cast two non-actor children in the lead roles, and both -- Marissa Gibson and Rowan McNamara -- received the AFI's young actor award.

Frances O'Connor took home the best lead actress award for her role in "Blessed" while Rachel Griffiths was honored with the AFI award for best supporting actress in "Beautiful Kate." Director Baz Luhrmann's outback epic film "Australia," which had not been nominated for any top awards in his home country despite high hopes, was given the AFI's inaugural highest grossing film award, a fitting tribute to the $130 million 20th Century Fox movie, the most expensive ever made in Australia. Australian actor Russell Crowe received this year's AFI International award for best actor for his role in the political thriller "State of Play" while the AFI International award for best actress went to Toni Collette for her role as the suburban housewife with dissociative identity disorder in the Emmy award-winning television series "United States of Ta
