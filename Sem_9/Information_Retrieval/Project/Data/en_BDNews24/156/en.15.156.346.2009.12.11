<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Many people face sudden deaths in Bangladesh and elsewhere because of ignorance and lack of proper treatment, specialists say. But many innovative methods and technology have been introduced in the past few years and facilitated treatment of heart disease at a lower cost, physicians at a workshop titled 'Dhaka Heart Rhythm' said Friday. The workshop, jointly organised by Medtronic, Vitatron- the Pace Makers and Popular, was attended by some 250 physicians from Bangladesh and India at a hotel in the capital. The day-long workshop discussed problems relating to abnormal heart rhythm and their solution. Director of National Heart Disease Institute Dr. AKM Mohibullh said, "Nearly 25 million people are suffering from heart diseases across the world and the number will be doubled in 2030." Heart disease accounts for 20 percent of total deaths in the USA and 60 percent cases of heart ailments result in death, he said. Mohibullah said, "Though the statistics of heart patients in our country are not available, the number is increasing day and day." He said, "Many people having heart ailments run the risk of sudden death for lack of regular check-up." Senior adviser to National Heart Foundation Dr. Nazir Ahmed said, "Currently, pace maker is being installed for heart blocks successfully in Bangladesh." On top of that Ahmed prescribed regular health check-up and consultation with physician as soon as any symptom of heart disease develops. Executive director of Escort Heart and Research Institute Dr. TS Kelar said, "Those who have slow heart rhythm have much risk of sudden deaths and pace maker acts as a support for their hearts." bdnews
