 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP has bitterly protested the government's plans to rename Zia International Airport. "The government will have to pay dearly for [it]," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Tuesday. The Kurmitola International Airport, which began operating in 1980, was named Zia International Airport in 1983. A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, agreed in principle to rename the airport. Different newspaper reports have speculated that it might be renamed as Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. "This government has not only renamed the Bhashani Novo Theatre, but also wiped Zia from the mural there," Delwar said. "Now the government is talking about the renaming of Zia International Airport. It will be a mistake if this is done." He severely criticised the government for renaming of various roads and installations and its activities. Delwar was speaking at a discussion meeting held at Dhaka Mohanagar Natya Manch on the eve of Victory Day, where he paid homage to national leaders and to those who sacrificed their lives in the liberation war. "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman have been slain, but their names have been written in history, which none can change," said the BNP leader. "The name of Ziaur Rahman has been erased from text books; it will not do. People have fixed a place for Zia in their hearts and minds, which will not be erased." He also vented anger over the failure to realise the liberation war dreams after 38 years. "People's basic rights are yet to be established. The countrymen do not enjoy human rights or freedom of speech, which are guaranteed in the constitution." He also alleged: "Awami League first began extra-judicial killings by establishing the Rakkhi Bahini after liberation war. That is yet to be stopped." "It is the absolute violation of human rights." He demanded a trial for "killings of 32,000 political activists by Rakhi Bahini after independence". BNP joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed conducted the discussion. b
