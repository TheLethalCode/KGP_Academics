 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Madrasa education cannot be dropped because it is there in the curriculum for a long time, said Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education. "We are yet to establish non-communal democracy. But we have started moving towards that direction," he said at a roundtable on education policy at the Engineers Institute on Friday. An effort has been made to incorporate madrasa, English and all others including vocational education into the mainstream, he said referring to a unified curriculum in the national education policy. Justice Golam Rabbani demanded universal and secular education system according to the constitution. "The chapter 7 of our constitution says about 'universal' education. But the draft education policy prepared by the government includes religious studies," he said. "The government is shaky about framing a universal education policy without incorporating religious studies," he said. Many discussants questioned the high government investment and education methods of the 12 cadet colleges run by the armed forces. "Why there is one system for cadet college students and another for other students?," questioned Anu Muhammad, professor of Jahangirnagar University. The defense ministry is looking after the cadet colleges, but education should be looked after by the education ministry only, he said. Prof Serajul Islam Chowdhury pointed out the discrimination of expenses between cadet colleges and other government institutes. The expense for each cadet college student is 40 times more than that of each public university student, said Yasmin Haque, professor of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. Sixty six percent of the expense of cadet colleges comes from government exchequer, she said. "A kind of elites is being created by the cadet colleges. We do not even know their system of education," she said. "There is hardly any instance that good administrators, writers or poets are coming from the cadet colleges," said Syed Abul Maksud, the moderator of the programme. Prof Chowdhury demanded a unified, psychological and scientific education system and said that the mainstream education system should be strengthened. Different quota systems should also be revoked, he said. The national education committee has proposed an eight-year primary education. It has made English and religion & ethics compulsory from the third grade. The draft recommends identical education system and syllabus for selected subjects at the primary level across the country to promote a fair education system. At the same time it mentions secularity. Among compulsory subjects are Bangla, ethics, Bangladesh studies, mathematics, natural and social environments that includes climate change and IT & science. The proposed policy aims at coordinating primary education delivered at government and non-government primary schools, kindergartens, madrasas and NGO-run schools. Besides the selected subjects other subjects can be inserted. The government has said that the new education policy would become effective from January next. bdne
