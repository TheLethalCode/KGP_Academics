 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)Martyred Intellectuals Day was observed Monday amid renewed calls for speedy trial of war criminals, which the government has said will start next February. The nation paid homage to the memory of the university professors, scientists, doctors, writers and artists, who were brutally killed on this day in 1971, just 48 hours before Bangladesh achieved victory in the Liberation War. Sensing certain defeat in the war, Pakistan occupation forces, abetted by their local collaboratorsthe Rajakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shamshad carried out the killing mission to cripple the new nation. Bodies of renowned intellectuals were found with eyes blindfolded and hands tied in a brickfield in the capital, now known as the Rayerbazar Killing Ground. Political parties and organisations arranged programmes throughout the country marking the day. It was observed amid growing demand for speedy trial of war criminals, including those abetted in the annihilation of the country's top intellectuals and professionals at the fag end of the war. The Sector Commanders Forum has said it will launch a "movement" again as before if unacceptable delay is seen in holding the trials. SCF coordinator Lt Gen (retd) Harun-Or-Rashid called for speedy trials, speaking to reporters at Rayer Bazar Killing Ground, where he led fellow Sector Commanders in placing flowers and observing a minute's silence at the memorial there. Deputy commander of the liberation war, air vice marshal AK Khandaker, said he hoped the government would meet its election pledge to try war criminals. Former army chief KM Shafiullah urged the present government to begin and conclude the trials within its term. Awami League general secretary Ashraful Islam, in a programme later in the day, said the primary trial proceedings would start from February next year. He was speaking at a discussion meeting, led by Sheikh Hasina, at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre to mark the day. The day's programmes at 7am with president Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals Memorial at Mirpur. Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia also paid tribute at the memorial. Awami League, the party that led the war of independence, arranged programmes including hoisting of black flags and keeping the national flag and party flag at half-mast at the party's headquarter and other offices across the country. The ruling party leaders and activists laid wreaths at the Martyred Intellectuals, Memorial at Mirpur, Rayerbazar Killing Ground and on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's portrait at Dhanmondi in the morning. The main opposition BNP held a discussion marking the day at the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh in the capital. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain urged all to be united in building a society free from poverty and corruption to fulfil the dreams of the martyred intellectuals. "The ideals for which the intellectuals sacrificed their lives are yet to be fulfilled," he said. 'Trial to start by Feb' While some quarters have become impatient with perceived delays, law minister Shafique Ahmed has said the trials will definitely begin by February. The Awami League-led government, coming to power this year, pledged to finally start the long-awaited trial of war criminals, who collaborated with the Pakistani military during the 1971 independence war. The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 has been amended this year in preparation for conducting the trials. Construction of special premises and offices for a special tribunal, on Abdul Gani Road near the Bangladesh Secretariat, began in early December. Officials have said they expect the facilities would be ready within a month. bdnews24.c
