 Mustafiz Mamun on his return from Nijhum Dwip Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The beautiful Spotted Deer on the southern island of Nijhum Dwippreviously known as Char Osmanare now under severe threat from wild foxes and dogs. The Chitra Horin have become a prey to the wild foxes and to dogs kept by the local people to save their crops from the foraging deer. Moazzem Molla, a 70-year old inhabitant of the island, told bdnews24.com: "Deer are like enemies to the local people as they forage onto cropland and eat up the crops in the dark of night. We fear some day they'd start to eat the soil on the island." Asked why he kept dogs, he said none had forbidden them to keep them, parrying the question without admitting that they protected their cropland. Hossain Ali, a resident of Nama Bazaar, said many of the domestic dogs have turned wild as they became used to hunt. Some of these dogs spend most of the time in the woods and hunt the bucks and the fawns. The bucks, or male deer, cannot run fast with their long horns and fawns are to young to escape group attacks from the dogs, he pointed out. According to forest department estimate, there are some 20,000 deer on the island. In 1974, just one pair of deer was released on the remote island in the Bay, with numbers multiplying over the years as the wooded environment provided an extremely amenable habitat for them. The government in 2001 declared the island as a national park. Local people, however, said the number of deer has fallen drastically compared to the situation two years back. Rakibul Islam, from Nama Bazaar area, said deer are found dead everyday inside the woods. Nurunnabi Chowdhury, Forest Officer of the island, said they had informed the top officials of the department to take measures for killing the dogs to save the deer population, but no steps were taken. He said the number of dogs was increasing while that of the deer was falling, adding that steps should be taken to save the deer population. b
