 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Copenhagen, 12 Dec (bdnews24.com)  'My future is not negotiable' said a placard on the buggy of two-year-old Andes during the largest public rally yet on the sidelines of the Copenhagen climate conference. At the end of the first week of the climate talks at Copenhagen, the colourful demonstration, arranged by 515 organisations from 67 countries, started with music and speeches in front of the Danish parliament a few minutes past 1pm on Saturday. The organisers said about 100,000 people marched the six kilometre route from Copenhagen city centre to the Bella Conference Centre, the venue of the UN climate change conference. 'There is no Planet B', 'Change the politics, not the climate' and 'The planet is not for profit', said placards and banners waved by climate activists of all ages and nationalities. Two-year-old Andes and her parents from Sweden were among the many concerned families with children to join the three-hour march in Copenhagen. Her mother Sara Gabrielson told bdnews24.com: "We are worried about our the future - 25 years from now, what is waiting for our daughter?" She said ordinary people were concerned that the Copenhagen talks would not result in any legally binding agreement to safeguard their children's future. 'NOT ENOUGH COMMITMENTS' Gabrielson felt rich nations were not committing enough to CO2 cuts, to alternate energy and technologies or to climate funds to help poor countries adapt. "I want to pay for the future of planet," she said. Josie Riffaud from La Via Campesina, a global coalition of peasant movements, said: "We have seen this week in Copenhagen that governments are turning climate chaos into a commodity." "Farmers - men and women - are taking to the streets today because we are so outraged by the ineffective targets and false solutions such as agrofuels being peddled by business lobbyists and the governments that listen to them". Lidy Nacpil, from the Jubilee South Coalition, said: "All week we have heard a string of excuses from northern countries against making adequate reparations for the ecological crisis that they have caused. We are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt is repaid to the people of the South". Another activist, Lars Fredikssen said the root of the climate crisis was "an economic and political system that puts profit above people and the long term sustainability of this planet". "Unless we address these root causes, climate change will devastate people around the world," said Fredikssen, of Climate Justice Action, a coalition of NGOs from around the world. "These talks are a predictable failure and that's why we will be taking action next week to create a People's Assembly. We want the voices of ordinary people who are already being affected by climate change to be heard and listened to." 'SOME PROGRESS' Delegates of the conference claimed progress has been made on some fronts at the halfway mark, but the hardest decisions on cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and climate funds to help the poor are likely to be left for the main summit. "We have made considerable progress over the course of the first week," Connie Hedegaard, the Danish cabinet minister who presides over talks, told delegates. Negotiators had reportedly advanced on texts such as defining how green technologies such as wind and solar power can be supplied to developing nations and in promoting use of forests to soak up greenhouse gases. But they said there were deep splits on key issues such as raising adaptation funds for developing nations and sharing the responsibility of greenhouse gas cuts ahead of the closing summit of more than 110 world leaders on Dec 17 and 18.
