 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has ordered the Election Commission to cancel Jatiya Party's Abul Kashem parliamentary membership from Tangail-5, declaring his candidacy void on grounds of loan default. It also ordered the EC to declare Mahmudul Hasan of BNP , who was the runner up in the general election, elected. Justice Md Emdadul Haque's single bench election tribunal gave the order on Mahmudul's petition. He filed the petition in February. Election commissioner Shakawat Hussain said the EC will take step on receipt of the High Court order. Mahmudul told the reporters after the ruling: "The High Court has declared me the winner." The district returning officer on Dec 4 declared the nomination of Abul Kashem legal. He faced loan default of Tk 15.45 crore with Sonali Bank. Kashem also has unpaid telephone bill amounting to Tk 32,000 with the Mymensingh Telephone Exchange. Former attorney general A J Mohammad Ali argued for Mahmudul in the hearing while advocate Shah Monjurul Haque pleaded for Kashem. However, Haque said his client (Abul kashem) will file an appeal against the HC ruling. The HC in another judgment terminated the parliament membership of Mohammad Jashimuddin in a Bhola constituency for violating the rule relating to the time restriction following retirement from government job. bdnews2
