 DURANGO, Mexico, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected drug gangs dumped the severed heads of five police officers and a prosecutor outside a church in northern Mexico on Wednesday as killings from the latest cartel violence rose to more than 60 in the past three days. The heads were left in plastic bags near the church in Durango state before dawn.

More than 16,000 people have been killed in drug violence in Mexico since Calderon launched his drug war in late 2006. The United States, which worries about the growing power of the cartels, says the rising death toll is a sign the drug gangs are weakening under the military crackdown.
