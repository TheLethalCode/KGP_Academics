<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith on Tuesday gave emphasis on more research activities saying it is important for economic development of the country. He said, "Whatever progress made in the country's economy has been possible because of research works taken earlier by the government. The minister was speaking as the chief guest at a roundtable discussion meeting arranged by Economic Research Group (ERG) at capital's Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. Muhith made the remarks after BKMEA president Fazlul Haque blamed government for not initiating any research work on the economic sector. As a result, the government cannot take right decision in right time, which also affects the businessmen and industrialists, he said. Refuting this accusation, the minister said, "BKMEA president's allegation is not true. The Trade and Investment Policy (TIP) initiated in the 80s was formulated on the basis of research works. The present development in readymade garments has been made possible because of that policy." "I think here (Bangladesh) high quality research works have been done, however it needs more development. New possibilities have emerged in the medicine and furniture sectors that also demand research." ERG chairman Wahid Uddin Mahmud, also a former adviser of the interim government, said the economic management of Bangladesh should be research-based. The economic growth was satisfactory considering the low-level of governance in last 25 years, he said. Wahid also said, "According to election pledge, the present government should stress on the research works, which will lead to a satisfactory economic growth and elimination of poverty." bdn
