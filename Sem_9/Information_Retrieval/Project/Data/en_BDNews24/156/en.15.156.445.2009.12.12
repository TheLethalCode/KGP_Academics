 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) -- The Kyoto Protocol must and will survive the climate conference in Copenhagen, Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said on Friday. "I think the Kyoto Protocol should survive and must survive for a number of reasons," De Boer said at a news conference on the fifth day of the ongoing climate talk in Copenhagen . "It would be working towards a second period under Kyoto and a new treaty under the convention. That new treaty under the convention would enter into force when enough countries have ratified it." In the case of the Kyoto Protocol, it took eight years between 1997 when countries started to sign it and 2005 when it finally came into enforcement, he said. "The idea of having a single treaty is not off the table in the sense that in the room next door a number of countries stated their preference for a single instrument. "But I see the overwhelming majority of the countries involved in this wanting a two-track outcome, wanting to see something in addition to the Kyoto Protocol." De Boer said the Kyoto Protocol provides market-based mechanisms that are already functioning. There is no provision currently under the Convention for the mechanisms. If somebody wants to push a new treaty, there is again a gap that people do not want to see. The Kyoto Protocol is the only legally binding instrument concerning climate change, and there is no good reason to abandon it, he added. De Boer said significant progress has been made on some of the core elements that will constitute an agreement. "This is the time now to focus on the bigger picture" Earlier, Bangladesh pressed for a stronger climate deal by building on the Kyoto Protocol that expires in 2012. It also proposed for a new phase with new target for Kyoto protocol. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has also called for a new 'Copenhagen Protocol', based on the existing legally-binding Kyoto Protocol.
