 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)--The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has called for a new 'Copenhagen Protocol', building on the existing legally-binding Kyoto Protocol . AOSIS put forward their proposal on the fourth day of the ongoing crucial climate talk at Copenhagen, the Danish capital. Earlier, Bangladesh pressed for a stronger climate deal by based on the Kyoto Protocol that expires 2012. It also proposed for a new phase with new target for Kyoto protocol. AOSIS said in a statement on Thursday night, "Our proposal was designed to safeguard the Earth's climate system and to secure the future survival of its 43 members." "AOSIS members are at the frontline of the devastating impacts of climate change. "We have put forward a proposal for a legally binding agreement to secure the twin objectives of survival of the Kyoto Protocol and to strengthen the UNFCCC with a new 'Copenhagen' Protocol," said ambassador Dessima Williams of Grenada, member of AOSIS. Earlier, Bangladesh pressed for a stronger climate deal by building on the existing legally-binding Kyoto Protocol that expires 2012. It also proposed for a new phase with new target for Kyoto protocol. "Our proposal does forward amendments to secure a strengthened second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol and put forward a new Protocol to be adopted under the Convention which would result in legally binding targets for the USA", said ambassador Collin Beck of the Solomon Islands. Most of the members of AOSIS, a grouping of small island nations, will be submerged due to sea level rise because of the climate change, according to IPCC. "We believe our proposal provides a fresh way of looking at how the existing proposals from many different countries can be assembled into a coherent legal form whilst maintaining the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol and the primacy of the UNFCCC as the legitimate international forum for combating climate change and its adverse effects", said ambassador Antonio Lima of Cape Verde. "This proposal will help countries not only to adapt to climate change but also to achieve our national goal of becoming a carbon neutral country", said minister Mohamed Aslam of the Republic of the Maldives.
