 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)More evidence of official corruption was revealed on Tuesday, with evidence of at least Tk 12 crore in vehicle taxes being pocketed by officials of the postal department in the first half of the fiscal year. The communications ministry disclosed the evidence to a parliamentary body, whose head commented that the real figure was likely to be "at least triple". Members of the parliamentary standing committee on communications suggested the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority to investigate the alleged misappropriation of vehicle tax and registration fees by the postal officials and employees. The postal department collects vehicle registration fees and taxes on behalf of the BRTA. "According to the financial statement of the postal department, corrupt officials of the department misappropriated at least Tk 12.5 crore collected as fees and taxes from the public, in the first six months of 2009-10 alone," Sheikh Muzibur Rahman, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "But we, the committee members, estimate the amount would be at least triple," he said. "We, at the meeting, have recommended BRTA carry out a departmental probe into the corrupt practices, or the committee itself will do so". This would be the second probe into the BRTA's activities this year. The standing committee earlier formed a parliamentary sub-committee, headed by ruling party MP Omor Faruk Chowdhury, to probe corrupt practices in the BRTA, "if any". The probe body is yet to submit its reports. The BRTA in a 2007 departmental investigation detected that corrupt post office officials in connivance with BRTA officials embezzled over Tk 100 crore between 2001 and 2004. Some postal department officials lost jobs for their involvement in the scam. ONLINE TAX, REGISTRATION URGED "To avoid this type of misappropriation, the BRTA must immediately go for online collection of registration fees and taxes," said Muzibur Rahman. "Some sections of people have been trying to delay the BRTA's initiative of online collection of taxes and fees," said the chairman. The BRTA in June 2008 launched an initiative for collecting tax and registration fees online to totally replace the manual system now maintained by the postal department. But the project has been painfully slow for bureaucratic entanglements, BRTA officials have said. If the online payment is introduced, clients would pay in certain designated banks and the money would go automatically to the public exchequer within one working day. At present, vehicle owners stand in queues at the postal department counters for hours to deposit the fees and taxes. Dishonest postal officials and employees at the counters give the clients acknowledgement of receipts, but don't record the payment in the ledger book. The online system will enable the tax payers to check online whether their paid money is deposited to the BRTA's account and the central bank.
