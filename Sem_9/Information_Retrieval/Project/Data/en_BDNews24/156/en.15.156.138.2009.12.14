<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)--India won the sixth Bangabandhu SAFF Championship for a record fourth time on Sunday, beating Maldives 3-1 in a tiebreaker at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The tie breaker saw reigning champs Maldives score in their first try, but fail to make the three remaining shots count as Indian goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja made two saves. Last year's runners-up India, who fielded their Under-23 team in this tournament, found the net with all but their second. Both of the last year's finalists were left to decide the title in tiebreaker after they failed to score in the normal 90 minutes and the 30-minute added time. For Maldives, their star striker Ashfaq Ali was among those who failed to score from the spot-kick, with only Fazeel Ibrahim converting. Jibon Singh, Denzil Franco and Subodh Kumar scored for the victors. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina handed the SAFF trophy to India captain Sushil Kumar after the entertaining final. bdne
