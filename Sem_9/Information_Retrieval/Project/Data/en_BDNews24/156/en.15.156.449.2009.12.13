<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)A new parliamentary sub-committee is set to monitor compliance with labour laws in the private sector. The standing committee on labour Sunday formed a five-member panel headed by ruling party MP Rowshoan Jahan Shathi. "The members will visit production units to see whether factory owners and management are providing worker facilities as per the Bangladesh Labour Act," Israfil Alam, the standing committee chairman, told reporters after a committee meeting in parliament. Other members of the panel are: Noni Gopal Mandol, Zakir Hossain, Shahiduzzaman Sarker and Mosharraf Hossain. "After the factory visits, the members will report to the standing committee on compliance with labour laws," said Alam, the labour leader turned MP elected from a Naogaon constituency. According to parliament secretariat officials, standing committees are meant to form probe bodies or sub-committees every parliament to monitor the implementation of labour laws in the private sector. But successive parliamentary oversight has seldom brought positive changes to the poor labour conditions in Bangladesh. During the last parliament, a parliamentary probe body submitted a report urging an end to labour exploitation in the private sector, highlighting the ready-made-garment industry for special concern. But the report was never made public.
