 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Ban Ki Moon called for consensus and compromise to salvage a deal as the high-level phase of the UN climate talks opened in Copenhagen on Tuesday. The UN chief told delegates in the Danish capital that they had the chance to change history and urged nations to "seal a deal" to avert dangerous climate change. "We do not have another year to deliberate. Nature does not negotiate." "No one will get everything they want in this negotiation. But if we work together then everyone will get what they need," said the UN secretary general. Earlier in the day, ministers were struggling to break deadlock in the UN conference, just three days before world leaders are due to seal a global accord. The day before saw the climate talks stall as developing countries accused rich nations of trying to kill the Kyoto Protocol. The Copenhagen talks have stumbled over a long-running rich-poor rift on addressing the threat of climate change. Disputes remain over the level of emissions cuts by rich countries and a long-term global target to curb a rise in global temperatures which could trigger rising sea levels, floods and drought. Financing of the expected adaptation fund remains a sticking point. "The time for consensus has arrived. Our goal is to lay the foundation for a legally binding climate treaty as early as possible in 2010," said Ban. "For three years, I have sought to bring world leaders to the table," Mr Ban said. "Three years of effort comes down to three days of action." He urged the gathered negotiators not to "falter in the home stretch". He told them: "Forge an agreement that is fair ambitious comprehensive. That acknowledenges the demands of science. That involves all countries working to limit global temperature rise to within two degrees. That charts a path for green growth and strengthens our ability to adapt to inevitable climate change". Conference president Connie Hedegard said: "I must also warn you, we can fail. Probably without anyone really wanting it so. But we spent too much time on posturing, on repeating positions, on formalities." "If we are going to make it  and we are!  Well, then we must change gears. We can not risk failure. No on can carry that responsibility. That means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise". Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a press conference after the session: "A deal is clearly visible. But it also very complex." German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin that she was "a bit nervous" about the lack of progress. Business leaders say they want a clear deal with short and long-term targets so that they can invest appropriately. More than 130 heads of the state and government their presence in Copenhagen-clear proof that climate change has risen to the top of the global agenda. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina arrived in the Danish capital to join the first day of the high-level session. The Prince of Wales, UNFCCC executive secratry Yvo de Boer and peace Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai also spoke. Hasina will also attend the second day of the Joint High-Level Segment on Dec 17. On Dec 18, she will attend the opening ceremony of the main summit with 130 world leaders. She will join a discussion session after the summit, and attend the plenary meeting to adopt the agreed outcome on the same day.
