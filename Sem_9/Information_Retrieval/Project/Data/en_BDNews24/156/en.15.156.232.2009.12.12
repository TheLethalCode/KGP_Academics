<TITLE> Pakistan may face new jihad, this time on Internet </TITLE>

 ISLAMABAD, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The detention in Pakistan of Americans seeking to contact militants and join holy war through the Internet suggests the country may need more than security crackdowns to contain threats from an insurgency. The five men, students in their 20s from northern Virginia, were detained this week in the city of Sargodha in Punjab province, 190 km (120 miles) southeast of Islamabad, security officials said. The suspects were being investigated for possible links to a Pakistan-based group suspected of carrying out high-profile attacks and with links to the Taliban and al Qaeda. Laptops, cellphones and maps of Pakistani cities were seized from them. "It's a very difficult job to dismantle such networks which operate through the Internet. Their mode of communication was the Internet and email. All five and their contacts were using the same password and just putting their messages in draft and weren't sending them," said a Pakistani security official. "It's very difficult to detect them. If the FBI could not detect these types of messages, how can we? It's not an easy job." The possibility of having to track down militant networks on the Internet could not have come at a worse time for Pakistan. It is already struggling against militants who seem to carry out bombings at will, killing hundreds since October and raising questions over the stability of the nuclear-armed country. Islamabad also faces mounting pressure from Washington to root out militants that cross the border to attack U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan. Radicalisation starts thousands of miles away from the strategic region. Some security officials say the Americans had intended to go fight in Afghanistan. Two were of Pakistani origin. Officials said one of the Americans was of Egyptian origin, one of Yemeni origin and another of Eritrean origin, illustrating how the Internet can spread militant networks across continents, undetected. If young men are leaning towards leaving behind the West to seek jihad, the Internet offers a variety of videos, made by some of the world's deadliest militant groups, to help them decide. Cost-free indoctrination by the Taliban and al Qaeda is readily available on sites such as You Tube, which one official said was used by the five Americans to try and contact militants. Videos romanticise what could be a violent future. Militants jump through fire rings, climb obstacles and open fire with assault rifles to train for "martyrdom". Video clips often lead to images of aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center. Militants will smile in the face of death, viewers are told. NEW RECRUITMENT STRATEGY The suspects were being investigated for links with the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad group. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad has links with al Qaeda and the Taliban. It was suspected of involvement in attacks including the murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002 and an assassination attempt on former president Pervez Musharraf. Ahmed Rashid, author of a book on Pakistan called "Descent Into Chaos" and an expert on the Taliban, said the case of the Americans pointed to a "huge new development as far as terrorism is concerned". "Obviously al Qaeda, these groups, have determined that it's too dangerous for American citizens to attack America. They will be discovered too soon. So it's much easier that they come out here and use their bodies here," he told Reuters. "This is a new recruitment strategy. A few years ago these people would have been used as sleeper cells in the United States, or to lay low or to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States. They are not being used for that anymore." Pakistani television stations showed photographs of the detained Americans. There were no hints of the fiery emotions which have driven others to blow themselves up at Pakistan's markets or police stations, and recently, near the country's strategic military headquarters, ringing alarm bells. Pervez Hoodhbhoy, a Pakistani nuclear physics professor and writer on social and political issues, has seen the fury that drives men to take up violent causes during his meetings with members of the Pakistani community in the United States. He says clamping down on militant networks on the Internet could be impossible for any government. But Hoodhbhoy emphasised that Pakistan's policy of trying to modernise religious schools, some of which are seen as breeding grounds for extremism, may make the job more difficult. "The government put these computers and Internet into the madrasas as part of its reform package. The hope was that this would modernise the madrasas," said Hoodhbhoy, who has been called a traitor by militants on the Internet and received death threats. "In fact, it has given them means of networking with jihadist groups across the wor
