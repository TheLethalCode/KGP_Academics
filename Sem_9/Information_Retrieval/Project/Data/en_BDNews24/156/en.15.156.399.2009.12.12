 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)British prime minister Gordon Brown on Saturday extended all his country's support to Bangladesh, including Dhaka's position on climate change negotiations. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's aides told bdnews24.com Brown phoned her at Jamuna at around 3.15 pm to say that Britain would stand by Bangladesh in promoting its interests. "The British prime minister assured Bangladesh of all support from his government, including climate change issues being addressed at the ongoing talks in Copenhagen," one aide told bdnews24.com, quoting Hasina. "Mr Brown also agreed to meet our prime minister at the sideline of the ongoing Copenhagen summit, if possible," the aide said. Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal. Bangladesh is also urging rich nations to contribute at least $100 billion for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Britain, meanwhile, is the first country to contribute 75 million pounds for creation of Bangladesh's own multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation. The UK's international development agency DFID also helped Bangladesh government formulate its climate change strategy and action plan. bdnews
