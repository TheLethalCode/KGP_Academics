 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Exports rose by 18.01 percent in October this year over the earnings in the same period last year, but it is 19.53 percent less than the target fixed for the month, Export Promotion Bureau statistics show. In the first four months (July-Oct) of fiscal 2009-10 exports shrank 6.74 percent in terms of earnings over the same period in the last year. However, it fell short of 12.57 percent of the target set for the period. Meanwhile, exports of the country's top two items -- knit and woven garment -- fell on an average 5.8 percent compared with that of the matching time of last year. Agricultural products, tea, leather, frozen foods and ceramic products are the other items that saw a drop in exports, while pharmaceutical products, raw jute, melamine and engineering products performed better in the period. However, exporters are sceptical about reaching the target at the end of the fiscal while a senior EPB official is optimistic. Md Shahabullah, EPB vice chairman, on Friday told bdnews24.com, "The growth in the first quarter of last fiscal was unusually high. That's why it seems less this year." "Growth does not maintain similar trend throughout the year. Hopefully, we'll be able to reach the target at the end of this fiscal," he added. Export target for the current fiscal has been set at $17.6 billion against $16.3 billion last year, and the country earned $15.6 billion registering a fall of 4.5 percent. It is expected that 79.46 percent of this will come from the garment sector -- 41.46 percent from the knit sector and 38 percent from woven wears. Exports in October amounted to $1,024 million against the target of $1,272.48 million, while last year's October had exports worth $867.69 million. Export earning was $4,897.70 million during the four months against the target of $6,602.08 million. The export fetched $5,251.49 million during the same period last year. The knitwear exports in July-Oct was worth $2,094 million, which fell short of the current year's target by 9.83 percent and 4.28 percent compared with the last year's earnings. The target was $2,322.70 million. During the same period, woven wear exports were estimated at $1,817.5 million, which fell short of the current year's target by 20.87 percent and 7.32 percent compared with the last year's earnings. The target was $2,128.76 million. However, the garments exporters were uncertain about meeting the target this year, citing the falling trend in the first quarter. President of BKMEA, the apex knitwear exporters' body, Fazlul Huq, on Friday told bdnews24.com, "There's a possibility of shortfall in the target as the situation in Oct-Dec quarter will not improve even if the growth were 23 percent October this year." bd
