<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Price of rice increased by at least Tk 300 per 74-kg sack over a period of 15 days in Chittagong wholesale and retail markets. The wholesalers blamed short supply of Amon rice from the northern districts for the sudden price hike. The higher price at wholesale level has also reflected in the retail market, traders said. There has been a poor supply of both parboiled and boiled rice from warehouses in the northern districts, said Chaktai rice dealers' association general secretary Omar Azam. He told bdnews24.com that the requirements of rice were usually met from Naogaon, Dinajpur and some other districts in the north. Farmers there are reluctant to sell rice at a lower rate and have tightened the supply, which has led to current price hike, he said. On Monday, in Chaktai and Pahartali markets per sack parboiled Miniket sold at Tk 2020, local Beti Tk 1900, Burmese Beti Tk 1700, Paijam Tk 2800, thick parboiled Tk 1700, boiled Pari Tk 1900, boiled Guti Pari, Tk 1800 and thick boiled Tk 1640 per sack of 74 Kg. However, parboiled Miniket sold at Tk 1850, local Beti Tk 1600, Barma Beti Tk 1600, Paijam Tk 2700, thick parboiled Tk 1450, boiled Pari Tk 1700, boiled Guti Pari, Tk 1600 and thick boiled Tk 1500 15 days ago. In the retail Reazuddin Bazaar, the price of parboiled Miniket was Tk 2100 per sack while local Beti was Tk 2000, Barma Beti Tk 1800, Paijam Tk 2850, boiled Miniket Tk 2150, boiled Pari Tk 1960, Nazirshail Tk 2600 and Zirashail Tk 2550. Several rice dealers at Chaktai said everyday 500-700 tonnes of rice are brought in from northern districts. But, not even a half of this amount came in last 10 days. However, a retail rice vendor, Kamal Mia told bdnews24.com that the wholesalers were taking the chance of inadequate supply. bdn
