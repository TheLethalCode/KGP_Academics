 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)The five Appellate Division judges who last month upheld the death sentences of five convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case have signed and submitted the full 412-page judgement on the appeals. The submission of the full judgement, of which the verdict and short order was delivered on Nov 19, makes way for the next phase of legal procedures, including possible review and clemency petitions by the convicts condemned to death. Justice Mohammed Tafazzul Islam handed down the main verdict while four other judges in agreement with the judgement gave opinions. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said the judges had put their signatures to the full verdict. "A copy of it and other documents of the case will now go to the Sessions Judge's Court and necessary orders will be sent to the jail from there." Alam said: "The defence now can file a review petition against the verdict." "If the review petitions are filed, we will try to hold hearing as early as possible." The attorney general said the trial court will begin procedures to execute the death penalties immediately on receipt of the verdict copy. The trial court will not wait for the defendants to file review petitions. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer), told bdnews24.com that they will file review petitions after collecting a copy of the final verdict.
