 TOKYO, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama will put off a decision on a row with Washington over a US airbase, media reported on Tuesday, a delay that risks fanning US mistrust and voters' doubts about his leadership. Tokyo is under US pressure to implement a 2006 plan to relocate the Marines' Futenma airbase on Okinawa to a less crowded part of the southern island as a pre-requisite for shifting up to 8,000 Marines to the US island of Guam.

The plan to move Futenma is part of a broader realignment of US troops in Japan against a background of China's rising role and an unpredictable North Kor
