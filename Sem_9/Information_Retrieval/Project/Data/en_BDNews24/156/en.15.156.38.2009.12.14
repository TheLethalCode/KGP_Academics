<TITLE> HC slams 'more crossfire deaths' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday expressed grave concern at continued 'crossfire' deaths despite a suo moto ruling on extra-judicial killings it had issued last month. The bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Md Imdadul Haque Azad said 11 incidents of extra-judicial killings had reportedly taken place since the Nov 17 ruling ordering authorities to explain the deaths by so-called crossfire of two brothers in Madaripur. On Nov 16, brothers Lutfor Khalashi, 40, and Khairul Khalashi, 38, both alleged to be extremists, were killed in what RAB said was "an exchange of gunfire". The deaths were reported just 36 hours after family members voiced fears that the two might be killed in custody. The court issued the suo moto rule the next day on the home secretary, director general of RAB and two others following media accounts of the deaths, asking why the deaths should not be ruled extra-judicial. The court said extra-judicial killings must be stopped to establish rule of law and advised attorney general Mahbubey Alam to contact the RAB director general to stop the repetition of such an incident until the next hearing. Alam told the court that he would contact the RAB director general and requested the court to hold the next hearing on the rule after the winter vacation when the Supreme Court will remain closed from Dec 18 to Jan 2. The court set Jan 9 for the next hearing. Human rights organisation Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust lawyer Ruhul Kuddus Babu told bdnews24.com that the court expressed its concern over extra-judicial killings even after the rule. Media widely reported that Bablu Khalashi, son of Lutfor, had held a news conference in saying his father and uncle were arrested from Jatrapur in Narayanganj district on Friday night. He said the family feared they might be killed in "crossfire". The family also claims a third brother was killed earlier in a similar incident. Human-rights organisations have been expressing concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country though the government claims that no such killings are taking place. The government says law enforcers only fire weapons in defence, and deaths by shooting occur only where the suspect is armed and exchange of gunfire takes place. Such incidents are often referred to as "crossfire" killings in the media and common parlance, a term that has come to imply suspicious, or extra-judicial, killings. The High Court on June 29 had ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called "crossfire" should not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings of suspects in custody or others. RAB has said around over 570 people have been killed in encounter/shootout incidents with the elite force around the country in the five years since its formation in 2004. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February this year that the extra-judicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. bdnews24.
