 PROSPERIDAD, Philippines, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tribal gunmen freed dozens of hostages in the southern Philippines on Sunday after authorities transferred murder cases against them to a tribal court and disarmed both them and a rival group. The gunmen had abducted 71 people in Agusan del Sur province on Thursday as they fled police pursuing them after a gunbattle with their rivals, but had freed 29 over the next two days.

Clan wars, known locally as "rido," are common in the south. Studies funded by the Asia Foundation and the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2007 found there had been more than 1,200 clan feuds in the south since the 1930s, killing nearly 5,000 people and displacing tens of thousan
