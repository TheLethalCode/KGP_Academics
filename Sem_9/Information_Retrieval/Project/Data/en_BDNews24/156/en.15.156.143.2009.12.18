 PARIS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 1,000 soldiers, including 800 French as well as Afghan and US troops, pushed into the Uzbin valley east of Kabul on Thursday and some clashed with insurgents, a French military spokesman said. The unusually large operation followed weeks of negotiations with villagers in the area and was intended as a show of force, spokesman Jackie Fouquereau said by phone from Afghanistan. He said some allied soldiers had been wounded and some insurgents killed, without giving further details. "It's a big operation," he said. "It was meant to assure the local population of our presence." President Barack Obama has ordered that 30,000 extra U.S. troops be deployed in Afghanistan in an increased commitment to the war. NATO allies have also pledged to send more troops.
