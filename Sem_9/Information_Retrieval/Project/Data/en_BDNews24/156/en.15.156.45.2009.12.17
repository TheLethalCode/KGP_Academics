<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiations on a nuclear arms reduction treaty to replace START may extend into 2010 despite calls by US and Russian leaders for a deal by year's end, a senior Obama administration official said on Wednesday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected speculation an accord might be signed this weekend on the sidelines of the Copenhagen climate summit, which U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev plan to attend along with their foreign ministers. The official said the negotiators in Geneva had cancelled plans to take a break in discussions over the weekend. "They're powering right through the weekend. They're going to go right up to Christmas," the official said. "Nothing's going to happen in Copenhagen." "From everything I hear, it's quite likely they'll end up breaking for the holidays and coming back in January," the official said. Speculation about a new treaty increased earlier this week with an announcement that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would be part of Russia's delegation to Copenhagen. A Russian source said Lavrov would not likely attend the summit unless Moscow believed a deal could be signed there. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also made plans to travel to the Copenhagen summit at the last minute, but officials said she would be working on climate change. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Tuesday played down any chances of a nuclear arms deal being signed at Copenhagen. The senior administration official said Obama and Medvedev might have a bilateral meeting in Copenhagen but were not planning to conclude a nuclear treaty. "We're not expecting a deal by the end of the week," the official said, adding negotiators were continuing to work on the issue of verification and other technical details. The original 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, took nearly a decade to achieve. Under the deal, both sides cut their nuclear arsenals approximately in half, to no more than 6,000 deployed warheads. The two sides have since further reduced their nuclear arsenals. Estimates of nuclear stockpiles vary, but the US-based Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimated at the start of 2009 the United States had about 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads and Russia about 2,790. Last July, Obama and Medvedev outlined a framework for a new arms reduction treaty, restricting deployed strategic warheads to between 1,500 and 1,675. The START-1 treaty expired on December 5, but the two sides have agreed to abide by most of the verification provisions until a new agreement can be achiev
