<TITLE> Hasina, Brown want to see Copenhagen deal </TITLE>

 Maruf Mallick and Rashida Ahmad Copenhagen, 16 Dec (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and British counterpart Gordon Brown have stressed the need for world leaders to reach a climate deal at Copenhagen. The two prime ministers, who met Tuesday on the sidelines of the climate conference, were in agreement over a need for climate funds and higher commitments for emission cuts, officials said. "World leaders are now gathered in Copenhagen. I hope they will reach a consensus over how to save climate victims. Climate woes and responsibilities have to be shared and faced jointly and unitedly," Hasina said during the meeting at the Radisson Hotel on Tuesday night. More than 100 heads of state and government are due to adopt a final resolution on Thursday, but the UN conference appeared to have stalled for the past two over a 'rich-poor' divide that threatens to derail a chance for any deal. UN chief Ban Ki Moon has urged countries to "seal a deal" by consensus and compromise. Gordon Brown on his arrival in the Danish capital Tuesday said failure to reach a deal at Copenhagen may trigger economic disaster, food shortages and unprecedented migration. One senior British official involved in the climate talks said that Brown will be pressing other countries hard to commit to higher greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Hasina and Brown, meanwhile, agreed that funds are a must for the most vulnerable countries (MVCs) to enable them in facing the challenges of climate change, Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary said after the meeting. It must also be ensured that development work in those countries is not slowed down while tackling climate change challenges, Hasina said. She thanked the British prime minister for his initiatives to raise a global adaptation fund for the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In reply, Brown reiterated a previous assurance to Hasina of providing every possible assistance to Bangladesh in tackling climate change risks. Hasina said Bangladesh was already working on a number of adaptation projects, including a major plan to launch capital and maintenance dredging of the countries' rivers to restore full navigability in a bid to protect against unexpected flood and water upsurge. But, she said, more was needed to face the terrible impacts of global warming on Bangladesh. Hasina told Brown Bangladesh needs international help. She said Bangladesh and its people are not responsible for climate change, but they are the worst sufferers of the resulting natural calamities. Brown had extended his country's support for Bangladesh's position on climate issues, in a call to Hasina just ahead of her departure from Dhaka for the Danish capital. Brown, who arrived in the Danish capital two days ahead of schedule to try to help broker a Copenhagen deal, has said unchecked global warming would cause chaos and cost dear. Without urgent action to tackle global warming, rising temperatures will cause drought, severe flooding, the government says. Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal. Bangladesh is also urging rich nations to contribute at least $100 billion for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Britain, meanwhile, is the first country to contribute 75 million pounds for creation of Bangladesh's own multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation. The UK's international development agency DFID also helped Bangladesh government formulate its climate change strategy and action plan.
