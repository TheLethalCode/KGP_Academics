 OSLO, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There will be no "precipitous drawdown" of US forces in Afghanistan and US troops could still be in the country for years to come, President Barack Obama said on Thursday. Obama told Americans in a televised speech last week US troops would begin withdrawing from Afghanistan on July 2011 as they transferred control to newly trained Afghan security forces. Obama, in Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, shied away from repeating the word "withdraw" and said July 2011 would signal a shift in the US mission in Afghanistan, when "we are beginning to transfer responsibility to the Afghan people." There has been debate in Washington over Obama's commitment to the July 2011 withdrawal date after administration officials testifying before the US Congress suggested it was flexible.

In an interview with the US television program "60 Minutes," Obama said setting a deadline was necessary so the Afghan people understand the United States will not be responsible for their country's security forever. "In the absence of a deadline, the message we are sending to the Afghans is, 'It's business as usual. This is an open-ended commitment,'" Obama said in an excerpt of the interview released on Thursday. He said there were those in Afghanistan who would be happy with an arrangement "in which they carry no burden. In which we're paying for a military in Afghanistan that preserves their security and their prerogatives," he said. "That's not what the American people signed up for when they went into Afghanistan in 2001. They signed up to go after al Qae
