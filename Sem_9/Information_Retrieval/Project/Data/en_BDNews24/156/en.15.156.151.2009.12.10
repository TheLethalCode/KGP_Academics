 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)--A political decision is needed to stop unlawful killings by law-enforcement agencies in Bangladesh, politicians and professionals said Thursday, at a programme to mark International Human Rights Day. They called for action at a discussion titled 'Extrajudicial killings and rule of law', co-organised by rights group Odhikar and English newspaper New Age, marking the day. According to Odhikar, law-enforcement agencies including Rapid Action Battalion and police killed 141 people from Jan 1 to Nov 30 this year. RAB sources said as many as 577 people were killed in encounters, crossfire, shootout since Mar 26, 2004, when the elite force came into being, up to Aug 31 this year. At a media call on Thursday, RAB director-general Hassan Mahmood Khandaker said the elite force is not violating law. "RAB is not doing anything beyond the law. They are not taking any innocent or a recognised terrorist into custody and killing them," he said at the RAB headquarters. Meanwhile, Maj Gen Moinul Hossain Chowdhury, a former caretaker adviser, told the rights seminar: "Indemnity from prosecution creates disorder in the law-enforcement agencies. If the government punishes crimes, it will lessen the offences. "Lawmakers have to point out the ways to run the state. The government should terminate all black laws," he added. The home ministry has repeatedly rejected concerns of human rights organisations from home and abroad. The current government, like previous administrations, says law enforcers only fire weapons in defence, and deaths by shooting occur only where the suspect has been armed and exchange of gunfire takes place. Such incidents are often referred to as "crossfire" killings in the media and common parlance, a term that has come to imply suspicious, or extra-judicial, killings. Former BNP minister Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan termed extra-judicial killing a violation of human rights. "Death sentence as punishment should also be abolished because in case of a mistakes it cannot be revised." "Misuse of power is the main reason for this problem. Political culture of the country should be changed to establish rule of law," he added. "Governments sometimes flout laws. It happened in our term too. But confessing mistakes, the government should take actions against the criminals." Jatiya Samajtrantic Dal (JSD) MP Zikrul Ahmed said, "If the state wants to free itself of responsibilities for the killings, the two big parties should reach consensus. We cannot accept it if the state itself murders someone." BNP MP Shammi Akhter said since there is no mechanism to make the government accountable for its conducts, people are being killed in detention. This is happening for a long time but in different disguise." BRAC university professor Pias Karim blamed such killings on political bankruptcy. At the beginning of the meeting, Manjurul Alam, brother-in-law of Kaysar Mahmud Bappi who was killed in an alleged 'encounter' in the capital's Rampura some days ago, demanded immediate punishment for the killing. He said the police were trying to derail the investigation. Women leader Sultana Akhter Rubi said only political change can stop these killings. Nurul Kabir, editor of New Age presiding over the discussion, said extra-judicial killings have been happening since 1972. To accept violation of human rights is irresponsibility. Extra judicial killings are regularly taking place though the government never confesses it. People become helpless when the state itself lies with them, said Kabir. bdn
