 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  Two members of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) died on Friday, one in the prison cell and another of cancer. Habilder Rezaul Karim, 45, of Rifles Battalion-44 died in prison Friday morning at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. He was one of the first 17 who were detained in the BDR mutiny case filed with the Lalbagh Police Station. Another, Shimul Kanti Barua, 42, died Friday morning while undergoing treatment at the BDR Hospital. Cancer was detected as the reason of his death. With these two, the death toll of the BDR men reached 55 after the mutiny that took place at BDR headquarters in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country on February 25-26, when 73 people, including 57 army officers, were killed. Karim's nephew Liton Bashar claimed that his uncle was tortured to death. He told bdnews24.com, "There were signs of torture in his body. While in jail, he (Karim) said he was severely tortured and might not survive. His fear has turned to reality." Karim was at the Peelkhana during the mutiny on February 25-26 and was arrested immediately after the carnage. He was taken into the custody of law enforcing agencies and later admitted to BSMMU as his health deteriorated, Bashar added. While asked the BDR chief dismissed the torture allegation. "He was in jail after his arrest. So there's no question of torture," Maj Gen Moinul Hossain Chowdhury, the director general, told bdnews24.com. Preparations for the burial of Karim's body are made by the BDR, he added. The other deceased, Barua, was admitted to the BDR hospital with fever. He was given treatment for malaria attack, but afterwards it was diagnosed as lung cancer, the DG said. Then he was admitted to the Cancer Hospital at Mohakhali and was sent back to his home on December 5. BDR had all preparations to send him to India for better treatment as wanted by his family, the BDR chief said. bdnews2
