 CHICAGO, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trading card and memorabilia company Upper Deck said on Tuesday that it would not end its sponsor deals with Tiger Woods, who has admitted to marital infidelity and has had other sponsors back away from him as a result. The company said it stood by the world's No. 1 golfer, who said on Friday that he was taking an "indefinite break" from pro golf. "Upper Deck will maintain its exclusive agreement with Tiger in both our sports cards and memorabilia categories, and we look forward to his eventual return to the PGA Tour," Upper Deck Chief Executive Richard McWilliam said in a statement. "Tiger and his family have our full support." Woods has served as an exclusive spokesman and autograph signer for Upper Deck since 2001. Woods, 33, last week admitted to "infidelity" in his marriage to his Swedish wife Elin Nordegren as allegations of multiple extramarital affairs rocked his life and career. Upper Deck is not the only company to stand by Woods as Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKa.N) NetJets unit also recently have said they would not end their deals. The star golfer was estimated to earn about $100 million a year in endorsement deals before his unwelcome troubles. However, Woods' popularity has plummeted in the short space of two weeks as a parade of up to 13 women -- from cocktail waitresses to porn stars -- came forward to say they had had flings with the married father of two. The allegations emerged after Woods was involved in a minor Nov. 27 car accident at his Florida home. In the latest USA Today/Gallup poll, Woods' "favorable" rating dropped to 33 percent from 85 percent the last time the survey was conducted in June 2005. His "unfavorable" rating surged to 57 percent from 8 percent. Meanwhile, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll found more than four in 10 Americans hold an unfavorable view of Woods and more than a third -- whether golf fans or not -- believe companies should not continue to use Woods to endorse their products and services. Findings like those are making companies nervous. On Sunday, Accenture Plc (ACN.N) said it was ending its six-year sponsorship deal with the golfing icon, the world's first billionaire athlete who is believed to be the wealthiest sports personality on the planet. Accenture's move away from Woods came a day after Procter & Gamble's (PG.N) Gillette said it would limit the use of Woods in its marketing. AT&T Inc (T.N) has said it is evaluating its relationship with him. Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH.PA), said this week that it would assess its options over the coming week
