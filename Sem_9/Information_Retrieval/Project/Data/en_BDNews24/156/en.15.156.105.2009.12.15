 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina left for Copenhagen late on Monday, a day which saw the UN climate talks stall as developing countries accused rich nations of trying to kill the Kyoto Protocol. Hasina, who caught an Emirates Airlines flight at 10:45pm, will join the high-level segments and main summit of world leaders at the 15th Conference of Parties from Dec 16 to 18 in the Danish capital. During her five-day stay, Hasina will attend the Joint High-Level Segment of the climate talks on Dec 16 and 17. She will attend a reception in the evening on the first evening. The prime minister is also due to attend a luncheon by the executive secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a dinner hosted by the Danish queen on the second day. On Dec 18, she will attend the opening ceremony of the main summit, to be addressed among others by the Danish prime minister and UN chief. She will join a discussion session after the summit, and attend the plenary meeting to adopt the agreed outcome on the same day. US president Barack Obama rang Hasina at around 9:30pm Monday, just before her flight, to say that Bangladesh as a climate change-hit country plays a vital role at COP15. Obama assured Hasina of his country's sincere efforts to help Bangladesh get due help to deal with climate change, her special aide Mahbubul Alam Hanif told bdnews24.com. Hanif said that Bangladesh has also convinced neighbours India and China--countries that have a bigger say in the ongoing talks-- to speak for her. Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh postponed a crucial December meeting to attend the Copenhagen talks. British prime minister Gordon Brown, meanwhile, also extended his country's support for Bangladesh on climate issues ahead of her departure. Speaking to Hasina by telephone on Saturday, Brown offered to meet her on the sidelines of the summit, according to the prime minister's office. Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal. A Bangladesh delegation already in Copenhagen has also been urging rich nations to contribute at least $100 billion a year for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, are among the high level delegation travelling with the prime minister. Hasina is due to return home on Dec 21. bdnews
