 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)--A leading climate campaigner from Dhaka on Friday highlighted how the vulnerable communities across Bangladesh coped and learned to live with the life-changing impacts. Bangladesh, said Atiq Rahman, was having to deal with "too much of water, but wrong type of water, and at the wrong time, or too little water" but local people were already adapting. Dr Rahman, chair of Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) and executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, invoked the famous lines from the English romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge  "Water, water everywhere  nor any drop to drink" to portray his country's plight. "Many communities in the world are adapting in the fullest knowledge that they are impacted by Climate Change. Others are adapting to climate variability and extremes but with less of an understanding," said Dr Rahman, who chaired the session on Approaches, Practices and Early Learnings. "Adaptation has to be locally based," Rachel Berger of the UK-based NGO Practical Action agreed with Dr Rahman, "it has to be context specific." Added Rahman: "They will be implemented by communities, enterprises and at eco-systems levels." "Building capacity to adapt is difficult to define," she said. "One is, access to an understanding of local climate information, understanding what's happening in terms of weather for next three days, getting access to seasonal information, indication of winter, and how intense the rain might be in this season." "Another key component is what we call social networks." Shadrul Agrawala, of the Paris-based OECD, spoke on microfinance as a tool for community-based adaptation to climate change. "Global scaling of adaptation fund is not enough," warned Agrawala as he lauded "small adjustments made by thousands of actors". Microfinance could be one of the ways of helping communities to adapt, the OECD economist explained as he responded to Saber Hossain Chowdhury MP who said the poor were being made to 'borrow and repay' for something they were not at all responsible for. Macro-finance would be necessary for bigger adaptation projects such as building dams, he admitted. Ian Burton, Professor Emeritus at University of Toronto, was sceptical of the poor countries' capacity to use funds. "Part of the problem is the institutions," he said. Each of the 49 LDCs was given US$ 200,000 to come up with a national adaptation plan, he said, but failed to spend the money in four years. Chris Ebi, chair of a working group of the IPCC technical support unit, and Bill Jackson, deputy director general of the Geneva-based IUCN, also spoke. Youba Sokona, co-chair of an IPCC working group, shared his experience on adaptation.
