 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)Danish prime minister Lars Lkke Rasmussen replaced Connie Hedegaard as president of the troubled Copenhagen climate talks, just a day before world leaders are due to sign a deal. The Danish prime minister's office, in a press release on Wednesday, said: "As a consequence of the unprecedented number of Heads of State and Government who have started to arrive in Copenhagen to participate in climate negotiations, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lkke asmussen will, from the beginning of the High-Level Segment, take the chair as president of the COP and the COP/CMP." "The Danish Prime Minister has appointed Minister Connie Hedegaard as his special representative. Thus, she will continue conducting informal consultations to the Copenhagen Outcome," it said. Approximately 115 heads of state and government have decided to participate in the Conference of Parties (COP) at summit level to close a deal in Copenhagen. "The final negotiations will be tense and strenuous. I have therefore asked Minister Connie Hedegaard to continue to negotiate the Copenhagen outcome with her colleagues," said Rasmussen. Hedegaard said "it is appropriate that the Danish prime minister presides" with so many heads of state and governments arriving to give their statements. She said negotiations and consultations will continue being conducted at all levels. The previous two days have seen the UN conference stall as ministers struggled to break a deadlock that threatened to derail any chance of a deal. Proceedings have stumbled over a long-running rich-poor rift on addressing the threat of climate change. Developing countries have accused rich nations of trying to kill the Kyoto Protocol in negotiations. Disputes remain over the level of emissions cuts by rich countries and a long-term global target to curb a rise in global temperatures which could trigger rising sea levels, floods and drought. Financing of an expected adaptation fund also remains a sticking point. UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon urged nations to "seal a deal" as the high-level phase of the UN climate talks opened in the Danish capital on Tuesday. He called for consensus and compromise to salvage the talks. The UN chief said:"No one will get everything they want in this negotiation. But if we work together then everyone will get what they need." He told delegates that they had the chance to change history. "We do not have another year to deliberate. Nature does not negotiate," he said. bdn
