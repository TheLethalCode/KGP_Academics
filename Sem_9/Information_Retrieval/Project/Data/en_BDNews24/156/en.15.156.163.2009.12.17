 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a four-member commission to investigate reported acts of killing, rape, looting and assault on minorities and Awami League workers following the 2001 general election won by BNP. The decision might be published as a gazette next Sunday, law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters at a press briefing at his office. The minister said the commission is led by former district and sessions judge Mohammad Sahabuddin, with members former deputy IGP Nazrul Islam, home ministry's deputy secretary Abdul Hannan and superintendent of police (Special Branch) Mir Shahidul Islam. The commission has been asked to submit its report after investigation within four months, officials said. The High Court on May 6 asked the government to form a commission to probe post-poll violence, including killing, rape, attack and plundering, after the eighth parliamentary elections. It asked for a report by the commission in the next six months. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammad Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave the orders upon a writ petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Manzill Murshid, who earlier moved the writ petition on behalf of the rights group, sent a legal notice on Dec 9 to the secretaries for home, prime minister's office, cabinet division as well as the inspector general of police for not complying with the High Court directives. Murshid also told reporters at the time that he would file a contempt of court petition against the government if it did not form the commission within seven days from the day notice served. Countrywide post-poll violence, against Awami League supporters and minorities, was reported following the 2001 general elections, which were won with a large majority by a coalition led by BNP, now the main opposition party. bd
