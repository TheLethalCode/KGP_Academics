 RAJKOT, 15 december (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India survived a thrilling Sri Lanka run chase to clinch a three-run win in the first-one day international as the teams piled up more than 800 runs between them on Tuesday. Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan smashed a career-best 160 off 124 balls to lead the chase after counterpart Virender Sehwag notched 146 to help India post their highest one-day total of 414 for seven after being put in to bat. The visitors were restricted to 411 for eight after looking good to pull off the second-highest ODI run chase ever and then needing 11 runs in the final over and six off the last two deliveries. Sehwag, whose 12th one-day hundred was studded with 17 fours and six sixes, added 153 for the first wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (69) and 156 for the second with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who struck 72 after promoting himself to number three. Dilshan struck his fourth one-day hundred in a 188-run opening stand with Upul Tharanga (67) followed by skipper Kumar Sangakkara, who lashed 90 off 43 balls in a fast 128-run second-wicket partnership. India snapped up four wickets within four overs to reduce it to 345 for five in the 41st over, but Thilina Kandamby (24) and Angelo Mathews (38) almost pulled it off until their dismissals in the end. Nagpur will stage the next game of the five-match series on Frida
