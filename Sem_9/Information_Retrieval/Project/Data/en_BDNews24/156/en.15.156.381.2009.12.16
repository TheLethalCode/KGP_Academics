 ISLAMABAD, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court was considering on Wednesday its ruling to challenge an amnesty decree that has protected President Asif Ali Zardari and some aides from graft charges. A widely expected court decision to strike down the 2007 amnesty decree, introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf, would heap pressure on Zardari, even though he is protected from prosecution by presidential immunity.

He was never been convicted but nevertheless spent 11 years in jail. He is now deeply unpopular and his government is perceived as weak in the face of a Taliban insurgency and a struggling economy. The Supreme Court is expected to rule that old corruption cases can be reopened if it rules the amnesty unconstitutional. Among those protected by the amnesty are the interior and defense ministers and several of Zardari's top aides. The government has said it will accept the court's decision but pressure is likely to mount quickly for officials facing charges to resign. The United States, keen to see Pakistan widen its battle against Taliban militants on the Afghan border, is likely to be dismayed by the prospect of political turmoil distracting the government's attent
