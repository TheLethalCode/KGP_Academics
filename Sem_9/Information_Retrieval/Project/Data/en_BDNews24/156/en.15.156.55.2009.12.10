 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)The new BNP committee will be announced by next week, a senior BNP leader said on Thursday. "The party chairperson will nominate the right person as secretary general," BNP vice-president Tariqul Islam told reporters at the party headquarters at Naya Paltan in Dhaka. He spoke before supporters of Jatiayabadi Swecchasebok Dal, BNP's volunteer wing, took out a rally marking the appointment of Tarique Rahman as party's senior vice- president. "Party workers and leaders will welcome the committee she declares," he said, "We are expecting the announcement of committee will come within next week." BNP's fifth national council on Dec 8 unanimously elected Tarique, the elder son of re-elected chairperson Khaleda Zia, as senior vice president. The post was created after amending the party constitution ahead of the election. Tarique is now undergoing treatment in England on bail from the High Court. Islam refuted the allegation of corruption against Tarique. "It is nothing but propaganda. Many more corruption cases were filed against the prime minister (Sheikh Hasina) herself." The rally was attended, among others, by BNP joint secretary-general Mirza Abbas and chief whip of opposition Jainal Abdin Farrouque. b
