 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is celebrating Victory Day, heralded by a 21 cannon salute that rang through the capital at dawn, and followed by the president laying a wreath at the National Memorial in Savar to commemorate those who gave their lives for independence. On this day in 1971, the Pakistan army surrendered to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India at Ramna Racecourse Maidan in Dhaka, ending the painful nine-month Liberation War that saw the birth of the new nation. President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina issued separate messages on the the nation's 38th Victory Day, calling for all to work unitedly for a prosperous Bangladesh. Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, in a message, also called for national unity, in the spirit of liberation war, to protect the country's independence and sovereignty. Programmes abounded on Wednesday, organised at state level and by numerous social and cultural organisations across the country. Sammilito Sanskritik Jote was holding the main cultural programmes on Dhaka University campus and Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, including victory parades from the Central Shahid Minar at 10am and from the stadium at 4pm. Army, navy and air force bands were playing at the National Parliament premises, Farmgate and Mirpur stadium from 2-4pm. A combined performance by army, navy, air force, BDR, police and Ansar bands was also seen at Suhrawardy Udyan from 2-4pm. Naval ships docked at Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chittagong, Khulna and Barisal were open to public from 2pm to sunset. Awami League programmes, led by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury in place of Sheikh Hasina who was in Copenhagen for the climate talks, included tributes at the National Memorial and at the portrait of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. The ruling party, which led the liberation struggle, was holding a victory parade from Suhrawardy Udyan at 3pm. The main opposition party BNP, led by its chairperson Khaleda Zia, paid tribute too at the National Memorial at dawn. Party leaders also visited Ziaur Rahman's grave and were bringing out their victory parade from their Naya Paltan office at 3pm. Security has been boosted in the capital and around the country to ensure public safety and trouble-free celebrations. Near about 10,000 police were on duty around the capital, 3,000 of them specially deployed for the occasion. Rapid Action Battalion said 5,500 of their men were spread out in teams across the country, 2,000 of them in the capital. Beside regular law enforcers, dog squads, bomb squads and intelligence agencies will also be on special duty. THIS TIME LAST YEAR This time last year, the nation observed Victory Day on the last day of a near-two year emergency period under a caretaker government. The interim cabinet approved the Emergency Powers Repeal Ordinance-2008 on Dec 14, and under it the lifting of emergency rule that was imposed on Jan 11, 2007 amid political unrest following cancelled elections. The state of emergency was officially lifted from midnight on Dec 16, after 23 months of restrictions on civil and political activities. bdnew
