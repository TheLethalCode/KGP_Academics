 COPENHAGEN, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A protest by African nations accusing the rich of doing too little to cut greenhouse gas emissions slowed U.N. climate talks on Monday just four days before world leaders are due to forge a deal in Copenhagen. African nations agreed to allow talks to restart in a compromise after a five-hour standoff. They had accused the rich of trying to kill off the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, which obliges many industrialized nations to cut emissions until 2012. "We found a reasonable solution," said Andreas Carlgren, environment minister of Sweden whose country holds the European Union's rotating presidency. Rich nations assured the Africans they were willing to discuss Kyoto commitments. "The (Danish) presidency agreed to do more to consider the Kyoto Protocol," said Pa Ousman Jarju from the Gambian delegation. Talks have been sluggish since they started two years ago in Bali, Indonesia. Negotiators are seeking to break deadlock to reach a new U.N. deal due at a summit of 110 world leaders on Friday, shifting the world economy away from fossil fuels in a bid to help avert heatwaves, floods, mudslides or rising sea levels. "At least five hours (have been lost), and I think that's very regrettable. I don't think we've covered ourselves in glory," British Energy and Climate Minister Ed Miliband said. Talks were going on behind closed doors trying to end long-running standoffs on major issues before the summit, such as the depth of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by rich nations by 2020 and how to raise new funds to help the poor. Earlier, African delegates said that the rich were trying to shirk firm commitments by ditching the Kyoto Protocol, which binds almost 40 industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. KILL KYOTO Plans by the rich mean "we are going to accept the death of the only one legally binding instrument that exists now," said Kamel Djemouai, an Algerian official who leads the African group. Australian Climate Minister Penny Wong accused the African nations of staging a "walkout" and said it was "not the time for procedural games" so close to the end of the December 7-18 meeting, for which 35,000 people are registered. A group of activists dressed as polar bears staged a protest urging the talks to "save the humans." Developing nations want to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and work out a separate new deal for the poor. But most rich nations want to merge the Kyoto Protocol into a single new accord with obligations for all to fight global warming. Developing nations accuse the rich of trying to avoid new, legally binding promises by ditching Kyoto. Industrialized nations want a single track largely because the United States, the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China, is outside Kyoto. They fear a binding new Kyoto while Washington slips away with a less strict regime. Highlighting the range of disagreements, a senior Chinese envoy said that developing nations' top concern was to secure funds from the rich to pay for carbon emissions cuts and cover the cost of adapting to a warmer world. "If you list them in order of priorities, the most pressing issues where developing countries want to see results are: firstly finance, secondly emissions reduction targets, third technology transfer," He Yafei, China's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters. Many world leaders will turn up early to try to bridge the gaps. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown would travel to Copenhagen on Tuesday, his office said. Brown hopes to meet Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi before other leaders begin arriving for the end of the negotiations. Separately, a U.N. report said the world this year suffered the lowest number of natural disasters in a decade, but floods, droughts and other extreme weather continued to account for most of the deaths and economic losses. There were 245 natural disasters recorded this year, down from the decade high of 434 in 2005, said the U.N. International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. And a report said that polar bears were not the only species threatened by climate change. It listed another top 10 -- beluga whale, clownfish, leatherback turtle, emperor penguin, quiver tree, ringed seal, salmon, staghorn coral, arctic fox and ko
