<TITLE> Climate deal failure would be economic disaster: Brown </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COPENHAGEN, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Failure to reach a deal at the Copenhagen climate talks may trigger an economic disaster equivalent to the combined effects of the two world wars and the Great Depression, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday. Brown, who arrived in the Danish capital two days ahead of schedule to try to help broker a deal, said the chaos caused by unchecked global warming would cost the country up to a fifth of its national income. "It is a defining moment," he said in a statement. "If we do not act to tackle climate change, the costs to our standard of living will be huge -- a reduction in our national income of up to 20 percent, an economic catastrophe equivalent in this century to the impact of two world wars and the great depression in the last." Without urgent action to tackle global warming, rising temperatures will cause drought, severe flooding, food shortages and unprecedented migration, the government says. World leaders from 190 countries meeting to try to agree a new deal on curbing climate change are part of a process that will "shape the future of humanity," Brown added. An ambitious climate deal would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in Britain alone and help the economic recovery, Brown said. The global market for environmental goods and services will be worth $4 trillion (2.4 trillion pounds). Brown, who has eroded the Conservatives lead in the opinion polls in recent weeks before an election due by June, has sought to take a leading role in the Copenhagen talks. His government sees "green" industry and services as an important part of the recovery from the longest recession on record. "With an ambitious deal in Copenhagen the low carbon economy will become one of the major drivers of Britain's recovery, growth and job creation," Brown said. One senior British official involved in the climate talks said that Brown will be pressing other countries hard to commit to higher greenhouse gas emissions cuts. "His (Brown's) concern is that at the moment the ambition level in the numbers is not sufficiently high," the official, who asked not to be named, said. "His role in the next few days is to talk to other leaders as they come in and raise the level of ambition. Everybody needs to be playing their part." Wide differences remain between countries with only three days to go before world leaders are due to agree a new deal. Organisers said most of the work must be done before some 130 leaders formally join the Dec 7-18 meeting on Thursday. Disagreements over the levels of greenhouse gas emissions cuts to be made by developed nations and a long-term target to curb global temperature rises are among the stumbling bloc
