<TEXT>
 Khulna, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)Embankments need urgent repair to restore livelihoods and agriculture in the Aila-hit areas of the south, Khulna residents and local authorities said on Saturday. Speaking at a FAO programme, Dakope Upazila chairman Sheikh Abul Hossain highlighted the urgent needs of the people who lost everything as Cyclone Aila hit on May 25 this year. Many of the distressed are still living in temporary shelters on the damaged embankments, facing scarcity of drinking water and resources to resume a productive life, Hossain and other speakers said at the event to distribute seeds and fertilisers as part of a agricultural rehabilitation programme. The distribution was held in Dakope and Tala upazilas where FAO's Bangladesh representative Ad Spijkers, his colleagues and local authorities including local MP Engineer Sheikh Mujibur Rahman participated. FAO Bangladesh is continuing its agricultural rehabilitation programme in cyclone Aila affected areas of the south-western districts, particularly in Khulna and Satkhira. Spijkers led the FAO team on his second field mission to the Aila affected areas in recent weeks, distributing seeds of salt-tolerant rice, mung bean, watermelon, maize, cowpea and vegetables together with fertilisers in Dakope and Tala upazilas this time. Over 24,000 small and marginal farmers have benefited from FAO's distribution programme in the Aila affected areas so far. "The south has a huge potential for agricultural growth and supporting the national economy", said Spijkers, who addressed large audiences in Dakope and Tala. "Good seeds produce good crops, and we are trying to ensure good agricultural practices including the balanced use of fertilisers", he added. While a good harvest of the present Aman season rice is expected, a priority concern was raised for repairing the embankments in the affected areas for the coming Boro cultivation season and to ensure the success of the rehabilitation efforts. "The present government is committed to ensure farm inputs to the farmers with low prices for sustainable agricultural production and a better life for them" said Engineer Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Member of Parliament from Tala. He also emphasised strengthening agricultural research for southern parts of Bangladesh addressing salinity and changed climatic conditions. "Southern districts need good irrigation structures, water reservoirs to harvest freshwater during the monsoon season. This would enhance the potentials of the south and this needs adequate investments and long term planning", said Spijkers. He also reiterated the local concerns on rebuilding embankments severely damaged by Aila, which caused water logging in a vast area and prevented agriculture from being restored.
