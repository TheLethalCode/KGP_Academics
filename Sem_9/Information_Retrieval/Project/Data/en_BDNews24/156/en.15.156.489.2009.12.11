 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com) Foreign ministers of regional group BIMSTEC on Friday inked an anti-terror agreement and discussed connectivity among member states for boosting trade and investment. The ministerial-level meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation in Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw also underlined the need for cooperation in energy sector to speed up development in the region. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand are members of BIMSTEC. Foreign minister Dipu Moni attended the BIMSTEC meet along with her counterparts of the member countries. Inaugurating the ministerial meet, Myanmar prime minister Thein Sein stressed cooperation in combating terrorism and trans-national organised crime. "The member states signed an agreement on BIMSTEC convention on cooperation in combating international terrorism, transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking," said a foreign ministry press statement received from Myanmar Friday evening. Dipu Moni in her speech linked human trafficking with cross boundary criminal activities such as in narcotics, arms trafficking and money laundering. "Human trafficking is the fastest-growing crime industry in the world, with the total annual revenue for trafficking in persons estimated to be between $5 billion and $9 billion," she said. "It is time that we develop mechanisms to enhance cooperation in combating human trafficking in the region, which in turn would have a positive impact on the complex nexus of transnational criminal activities". The meeting also linked communication networks with increased trade and investment among the member countries. "The meeting viewed that the improved transportation and communication linkages and greater connectivity between our member states are important elements for the BIMSTEC process that will provide direct benefits to our people," said the statement. Its connectivity plan will link six South Asian countries with South East Asian countries such as Thailand and Myanmar. The plan is an alternative approach for integrating the South Asian region, without Pakistan and Afghanistan. Bangladesh foreign minister termed the BIMSTEC as one of the fastest growing regions in the world and sought energy cooperation among the member states. "At the forthcoming meeting of the BIMSTEC energy ministers in Thailand, we should try to develop a comprehensive roadmap for energy sector cooperation in the region," said Dipu Moni. The statement also said the 12th meeting also discussed issues such as strengthening cooperation in the areas of grid connectivity, gas pipelines, hydro power, renewable sources of energy and others. The meeting also discussed setting up of a permanent secretariat of BIMSTEC. Dipu Moni said, "I would like to reiterate that Bangladesh would be privileged to host the permanent secretariat of BIMSTEC in Dhaka." "Given our location and the fact that we have resident diplomatic missions of all BIMSTEC members, we feel that Dhaka is the natural choice." BIMSTEC was launched in 1997, but the regional group's performance in terms of cooperation in its designated areas is not upto the mark, critics say. Countries having dependence on the Bay of Bengal for trade and economic activities are the members of the group.
