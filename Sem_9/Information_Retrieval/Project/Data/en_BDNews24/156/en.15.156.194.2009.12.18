 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Friday said she is worried about the threat given by two ministers to the editor of a daily newspaper 'Amar Desh', which on Wednesday ran a report on the prime minister' son and an adviser. Agriculture minister Matiya Chowdhury and state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak reportedly criticised the daily's editor Mahmudur Rahman at a Victory Day discussion on Thursday. The criticism came a day after the daily published a report against prime minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajib Wajed Joy and energy advisor Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury. Khaleda on Friday said in a statement, "The threat from the ruling party amounts to hiding the truth and is against the fact. This has been done to influence the investigation into the incidence of bribing." "Such a threat is an outburst against freedom of the press and it is like the one-party tyrannical attitude of a BAKSAL. The fascist attitude of the ruling party has been exposed nakedly through this threat." b
