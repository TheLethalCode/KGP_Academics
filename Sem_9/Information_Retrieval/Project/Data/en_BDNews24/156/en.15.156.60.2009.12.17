 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expressed hope on Thursday for a climate deal at Copenhagen that includes a further 25 percent emission cuts by rich nations than agreed at Kyoto. Speaking at a press conference in Dhaka, the Bangladesh opposition leader called for global unity and solidarity on the eve of the final summit of the climate talks in the Danish capital. "The opportunity that has arrived in Copenhagen must not end in vain," Khaleda said. "I hope that world leaders stand for justice and will not lose the opportunity to come up with a final text that is based on these principled positions for which people's consensus has already been formed globally." "We all must save our planet, people and life from the imminent danger of global warming. We must take responsibility defined by our different capacities, moral obligation and differential position in the global economy." She hoped the world would not look only for market solutions, such as carbon trading. "We must take courageous steps forward to address more fundamental issues such as restructuring global economy and commit to change our life styles to make the world more sustainable and ensuring enabling conditions for justice to prevail." She thanked millions of people around the world, particularly in the developed countries, who are against conventional lifestyles in their own countries and seeking a climatic justice as an outcome of Copenhagen. "I am overwhelmed by their support to the vulnerable peoples of the world, particularly the people of Bangladesh who are the worst affected," she said. "Their demand for unconditional compensation from the rich countries, for those who have been victims of this human induced calamities caused by green house gas emission, has united them with deep bondage with the peoples of Bangladesh." She backed the Bangladesh government's support for a legally binding international instrument by which developed countries must reduce carbon emission at least by 25% over that agreed at Kyoto; transfer of green technologies to countries like Bangladesh without any barrier such as intellectual property rights; and support for sustainable development models that not only can ensure life and livelihood of the people but also can set into motion appropriate policies for national prosperity. But she also mentioned that Bangladesh didn't like to see themselves as dependent on 'aid' or to be reduced as merely 'receivers' of money, despite the fact that developed countries have a moral obligation not only to mitigate the global vulnerability but also to support peoples' capacity building for 'adaptation'. "In this case, the people of Bangladesh have a lot to offer to the global community, if we can ensure that in the name of 'expertise' local knowledge practices are not undermined. Increased dependence on 'aid' or 'grant' without clearly defining and elaborating how the fund should be used to enhance peoples' capacity is the major issue to the people of Bangladesh." "I hope that our government does not reduce the Copenhagen COP 15 as merely an opportunity to receive fund from rich countries without raising fundamental issues that affects all of us both globally and nationally," said Khaleda. She also urged the Awami League-led government to look at both local and global factors as well as regional factors that will increase vulnerabilities of people to Climate Change and to act to mitigate such threats. "For example, peoples of Bangladesh are seriously affected by unilateral withdrawal of water through Farakka," she said. "On top of this, Tipaimukh Dam in India will further worsen the situation. The whole Meghna river basin's ecology and environment will be severely affected, wetlands will be destroyed and fish and other aquatic species and varieties will be extinct," she said. She called upon neighboring country India to listen to the demands of people both in India and Bangladesh and refrain from building Tipaimukh dam and any other activities in the upstreams that threatens Bangladesh's environment, ecology, biodiversity, life and livelihoods
