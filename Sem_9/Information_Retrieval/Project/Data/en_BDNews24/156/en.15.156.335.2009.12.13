 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is doing well in all economic indicators excepting investment, which has slowed down due to poor supply of electricity and gas among other factors, the finance minister said Sunday. "The economy has started to see an upward trend as a result of our [the government] initiatives over the last one year. All the indicators are performing well except for investment," AMA Muhith said Sunday while speaking to the press at the secretariat. The comment came after queries from reporters regarding the overall economic scenario of the country after almost a year of the current government assuming office. On the sluggish scenario of the government's newest avenue, Public-Private Partnership (PPP), Muhith admitted that it was not going according to expectations. "I have to admit that PPP implementation is not progressing as fast as we thought." But, he added that three projects under the communications sector would be implemented very soon under the PPP. The economy will do much better once the effects of the global recession fade out, he said. On the crucial issue of power and gas, Muhith said that the supply problem of these two important inputs is yet to be averted. "Though gas and power generation has increased but the demand has also risen. That's why there is stagnancy in investment." However, imports of capital machineries rose, he added. Touching on the best feature of the current economy, the finance minister said that agriculture has performed well. "There are indications that we will see a bumper harvest in this Aman crop season." bdnews24
