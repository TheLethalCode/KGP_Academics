 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)--The probe committee on Bhola ferry tragedy that took place the day before Eid has submitted a report on Thursday. Two copies of the report were submitted each to the minister's personal secretary and other to the secretary, head of the five-member probe committee and joint secretary of the shipping ministry Jayanta Kumar Nandi told bdnews24.com. But he would not go into the details of the report, saying the issue is 'very sensitive'. The minister will brief the media on it. The Coco-4 partially capsized on Nov 27 on the river Tentulia at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate the holiday with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. The committee was formed immediately after the accident that caused the death of at least 85 passengers. Monday was the deadline for submission of the report, but it was extended by three more days on Sunday. Several officials of the ministry said the probe committee has blamed the launch authority for the accident. It identified faulty design and irregularities in construction. It also served recommendations in the report. A murder case was filed--first such case for such incident, in the country with Lalmohon Police Station. Five officials of the MV Coco-4 secured anticipatory bail at the High Court so far in the case. The officials are master of the launch Abdur Rahim and Shamsul Haque, manager Mizanur Rahman, terminal supervisor Mohammed Kibria and a staff 'Zaman'. The High Court bench on Thursday asked two other petitioners, launch staffs Ujjal Hossain and Maksud Ahmed to appear in the lower court within eight weeks. The case accuses the on-duty employees of the MV Coco-4 of causing the death of passengers by overloading and attempting to dock 50 feet away from the Nazirpur launch terminal, where passengers were trying to disembark. b
