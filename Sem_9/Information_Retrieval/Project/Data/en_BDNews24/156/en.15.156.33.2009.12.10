<TITLE> ACC enjoying 'full freedom', says antigraft chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Golam Rahman has insisted the commission is enjoying "full freedom" to act neutrally, in an apparent change of tack from a previous statement. "Everyone, inside and outside the government, is equal in the eyes of the ACC. The only issue is those who are corrupt will be tried," Rahman told a discussion in the capital on Thursday, marking International Anticorruption Day (Dec 9). On Oct 14, the anticorruption chief had expressed different sentiments, suggesting the ACC's role was being undermined. "After making the Anticorruption Commission a 'tiger without teeth', the process is underway to remove its claws," he had said. Thursday's talks, on 'An Effective ACC: Why and How', were organised by Transparency International Bangladesh. TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said: "A 2007 ordinance declares the commission a sovereign body, but activities of a parliamentary sub-committee are interfering with its freedoms." The ACC chief disagreed, however, appearing to backtrack over his past statement, and stressed the ACC's neutrality. Citing an example, Rahman said two cases against ruling party MPs were being conducted. "So, if anyone suggests we are sparing members of the ruling party, it would be an unfair comment," the antigraft chief said. He also rejected the notion of "politically-motivated" graft cases. "People have alleged that graft charges are being pressed for 'political' purposes. We don't see any politicisation. But, if any cases appear to be filed for 'harassment' purposes, we will certainly look into that." Rahman did, however, reiterate the need to amend ACC laws to make the agency "more effective". Regarding the many appeals holding up corruption cases in the higher courts, he said: "Rule of law will be served if there are 'positive' decisions from the highest court." Dhaka University Salahuddin M Aminuzzaman said the ACC was "very active" under the caretaker government. "But they did not have the competence to handle the sort of cases that were being filed at the time," he said, referring to the failure to resolve the majority of corruption cases filed during the two-year caretaker government. Former chairman of TIB Mozaffar Ahmed backed the call for amending ACC laws. He also said: "The ACC alone can't wipe out corruption; parliamentary watchdogs should work in coordination with them." bd
