 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)Two gangsters were killed by rivals early on Friday at Mirpur in the capital, police said. Kafrul police chief Delwar Ahmed told bdnews24.com that 'Amirul', 25, and 'Shahed', 22, allegedly involved in 'terrorism', were killed at around 2am in Balurmathh area under Mirpur section 13 near Gudaraghat. The dead were members of Mirpur terror outfit 'Jabbar group' and were murdered by the members of rival 'Ibrahim group'. "Miscreants of Ibrahim group possibly brought in their hostages from outside and shot Amirul and Shahed at the spot," Ahmed said. The victims used to reside in Bhashantek slum. Shakhina Begum, 40, living in a slum near Balurmathh, told bdnews24.com, "I heard the gunshots but dared not come out of my house. We came to know after police's arrival that two people had been killed." She, however, alleged that the dead were known for their notoriety in the locality. Amirul's mother Monowara Begum told the reporters, "Amirul was in his in-laws' home at Bhashantek. Local muggers took him away at gunpoint. RAB and police were called to find them out but could not be traced for a long period." Shahed's mother Fatema Begum told the journalists Shahed was also taken away similarly from a cultural programme at Bhashantek. The two were involved in terrorist activities and there were cases against them with the police station, police said. The bodies were sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Families of the dead are reportedly taking preparations to file cases with the Kafrul thana police. bdnew
