<TEXT>
 NAGPUR, 16th December (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and fast bowler Dilhara Fernando will miss the rest of the one-day series in India because of injury. The pair have finger problems, the team's official website (www.srilankacricket.lk) said on Wednesday. The tourists lost the opening game in Rajkot by three runs on Tuesday. The second contest in the five-match series will be played in Nagpur on Friday. Muralitharan hurt his bowling hand in the third and final test against India earlier this month and missed two Twenty20 internationals as well as the opening one-dayer. Off-spinners Muthumudalige Pushpakumara and Suraj Randiv have joined Sri Lanka's squad to bolster the bowling in Murali's absence. Fernando fractured his finger in the first one-dayer. The uncapped Suranga Lakmal has been named as his replacement.
