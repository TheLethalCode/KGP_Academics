 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com crime reporter Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Police are now targeting 17,000 new police members in the second phase of an ambitious recruitment programme that has so far fallen short, inspector general of police Nur Mohammad said Sunday. "The Bangladesh Police has an immense workforce crisis besides transportation and accommodation problems," Nur told reporters at police headquarters in the capital. He hoped that the new recruitment process would resolve these problems. "The process to appointment 17,000 new police members of different ranks will start within two or three months." He said it was an extended recruitment challenge for the government as it fell short of its initial target of an average of 10,000 in the first and subsequent years. The present government coming to power in January announced a plan to swell police ranks by 30,000 new members within three years. According to police headquarters, 8,946 personnel were to be recruited during the first phase up to the end of this year, but just half of that target has been met as the year comes to a close. Another 13,082 were to be added in 2010, and another 10,003 in the final recruitment phase throughout 2011. Responding to a query on whether mass recruitment will exacerbate problems of poor facilities, the IGP said: "We have sent a demand notice for a block allocation of Tk 500 crore to meet transportation problems." "However, there will also be a separate budget for the newly appointed ranks." Nur said senior posts long lying vacant will be filled through promotions. He also said a battalion of 1,000 police troops withdrawn from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as part of the peace process, will be relocated throughout the country. bdn
