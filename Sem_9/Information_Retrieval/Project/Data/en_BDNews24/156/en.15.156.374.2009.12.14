<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Monday extended by six months the freeze on the effectiveness of the government notice that asked BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia to leave her cantonment house. The bench of justices Syed Reefat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury gave the order upon an appeal by her lawyers TH Khan and Mahbubuddin Khokon. The court initially stayed the government notice, which was sent to the opposition chief, for three months on May 27. Later on Aug 23, the High Court extended its stat order upon the government notice for four months. The government in a May 24 notice asked the former prime minister to leaver the house by June 30. The Directorate of Military Lands and Cantonments served Khaleda the original notice on April 20, asking her to immediately vacate the cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. Khaleda filed a petition with the High Court on May 3 challenging the executive order. The bench of justices Ahmed and Chowdhury accepted the petition for hearing on May 12 after four benches declined it. The cabinet had earlier decided to cancel the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that Khaleda had violated the lease terms. Before her cabinet took the decision in April, however, prime minister Sheikh Hasina had told parliament that Khaleda should vacate the house to make way for blocks of apartments for families of army officers killed in the February BDR mutiny. The massive 2.72-acre spread was originally the official home of the deputy army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia, who later became army chief and then president through controversial means. After the murder of Ziaur Rahman, in a military coup in 1981, his widow Khaleda was also awarded a house in Gulshan in addition to the cantonment house the family had been occupying since the 1970s. bdnews2
