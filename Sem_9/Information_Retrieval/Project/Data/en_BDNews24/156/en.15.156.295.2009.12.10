 Chittagong, Dec 10(bdnews24.com)Deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has criticised BNP's national conference as a "mother-son council". Sajeda said Thursday that compared to Awami League's council the nation got nothing remarkable from the opposition's. Speaking as chief guest at the launch of a Victory Month Fair on Thursday in Chittagong, she declared that trials of 1971 war criminals and of the 1975 Jail Killings of four national leaders would begin soon. She also said people want to see the killers of Bangabandhu "executed within the victory month". Sajeda called on all to take an oath for trying 1971 wartime collaborators. Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury opened the fair to mark Dec 16 Victory Day. The 21- day fair will continue until Dec 30. There are 242 stalls and six pavilions in the fair. Daily programmes include memoirs of the liberation war, discussions, shows and an art exhibition. The fair is being held at the port city's gymnasium grounds and outer stadium premises after a lapse of seven years. Freedom fighters and Chittagong citizens jointly held the fair for the first time in 1989. b
