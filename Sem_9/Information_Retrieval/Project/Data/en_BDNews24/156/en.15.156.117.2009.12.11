 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is going to declare 'partial committees' in the next one or two days, said senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP on Friday. "The chairperson will name those who made sacrifices in the past two years for the posts upto joint secretary level," he said referring to partial formation of both executive and standing committees by Khaleda. He was talking to journalists at his Dhanmondi residence. Rejecting Awami League's remarks on Tarique Rahman following his appointment as BNP vice-chairman he said, "Tarique Rahman is Martyr Zia's son. He has become BNP's asset through the fifth national council." Earlier on December 9, Awami League's joint general secretary Mahbubul Haque Hanif said the opposition has again opened the door to corruption by promoting controversial Tarique to such a prominent and powerful party post. Replying to a question, Chowdhury also said, "Grass roots level leaders gave their opinions about the 'reformists' in the fifth council. I think the leader (Khaleda) will value their sentiment and take action accordingly." Responding to a query on the delay in committee formation, he said, "As BNP is a big party, it needs time. Decisions taken hurriedly might go wrong." BNP's constitution was amended in its fifth council on December 8 to create a new position  senior vice chairman  to place Tarique in party leadership.
