 COPENHAGEN, Dec 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The main session of U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen stalled on Monday after African nations accused rich countries of trying to kill the existing UN Kyoto Protocol. Talks failed to start as planned at 1030 GMT due to the African protest. The session was to seek ways to end deadlock on core issues, four days before about 110 world leaders aim to agree a new climate deal to limit global warming that scientists say will bring more heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels. "This is a walk-out over process and form, not a walkout over substance, and that's regrettable," Australian Climate Change Minister Penny Wong said of the protest by African nations at the Dec. 7-18 meeting. "A range of developing countries have expressed their concerns and acted accordingly. This is not the time for people to play procedural games. We need to resolve the process issues and get onto the substance," she said. African nations accused rich nations of trying to kill the U.N.'s existing Kyoto Protocol for cutting greenhouse gases. They said the outline of the talks planned on Monday would sideline their concerns. Developed countries are trying to "collapse" the entire 192-nation talks, Kamel Djemouai, an Algerian official who heads the African group, told a news conference. He said that plans by rich nations "means that we are going to accept the death of the only one legally binding instrument that exists now," referring to Kyoto. Other African delegates also said the rich wanted to "kill Kyoto". Yvo de Boer, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, predicted that the negotiations would get back on track in early afternoon. "The vast majority of countries here want to see the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol," he said. "I'm not aware that any countries are trying to block anything." De Boer said that Danish Minister Connie Hedegaard, presiding at the meeting, would hold talks to appoint environment ministers to try to break deadlock in key areas, such as the depth of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by developed nations by 2020, and cash to help the poor. KYOTO Developing nations want to extend the existing Kyoto Protocol, which obliges rich nations except the United States to cut emissions of greenhouse gases until 2012, and work out a separate new deal for developing nations. But most rich nations want to merge the 1997 Kyoto Protocol into a new, single accord with obligations for all as part of an assault on global warming. "We need two-track outcomes," Djemouai said, wearing a button on his jacket saying "Kyoto Yes". Most developed nations favour a single track largely because the United States, the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China, is outside Kyoto. They fear signing up for a new Kyoto while Washington slips away with a less strict regime alongside big developing nations. "If we carry on at this pace, we're not going to get an agreement," British Energy and Climate Minister Ed Miliband told the BBC. Earlier, he expressed sympathy with developing countries who "don't want the Kyoto Protocol track to be ended before we have a new legal instrument or instruments in place." "Equally I think developing countries understand that for Kyoto parties to sign a partial treaty now with many countries outside it would be irresponsible for the climate," he said. Such a deal would be "accepting we would have continuation of simply some countries in the treaty," he said. Kyoto binds almost 40 industrialised nations to cut emission, mainly from burning fossil fuels, by at least 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The United States stayed out, reckoning Kyoto would cost too much and wrongly omitted developing nations, but President Barack Obama wants to take part in cutting emissions in a new deal stretching to 2020. Separately a U.N. report projected that climate change will turn the oceans 150 percent more acidic by 2050, threatening coral reefs that are key refuges and feeding grounds for commercial fish species. Oceans are turning gradually more acid as they absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from human activities, it said. The corrosive effect undermines the ability of corals, crabs or lobsters to build protective she
