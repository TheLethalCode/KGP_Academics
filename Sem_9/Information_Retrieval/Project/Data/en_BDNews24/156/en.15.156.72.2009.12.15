 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com) - A US court sentenced Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, an American of Bangladeshi descent, to 17 years for 'video terrorism' charges. US District Judge William S Duffey Jr, handing down the sentence on Monday, told Sadequee that he was misusing the tenets of his faith "to justify in your mind the crimes you have committed" and that he had taken advantage of U.S. laws and the Constitution's free speech protections "to advance your self-interest and your distorted view of the world." He told the US-born defendant that his conduct had determined his fate, not the Muslim faith he professed or his rejection of America's government, culture and system of laws. Duffey's comments came after Sadequee -- who had earlier notified the court that he wanted to represent himself at sentencing -- was allowed to make an hour-long statement, partly in Arabic and partly in English. Sadequee stood when delivering his colloquy to the court, but refused to stand when Duffey sentenced him, telling the judge, "Mankind rises for God. We cannot stand before men." Sadequee had faced a maximum sentence of 60 years, according to federal sentencing guidelines for crimes associated with terrorism. Federal prosecutors asked for a 20-year prison sentence. On top of the 17 years jail-term, Duffey also forbade Sadequee from accessing the Internet during 30 years of supervised probation that will follow his prison sentence. The Internet prohibition followed testimony at the trials of Sadequee and co-defendant, former Georgia Tech student Syed Haris Ahmed, that identified the duo's forays into Internet chat rooms where they corresponded with self-proclaimed jihadists. Both defendants argued during their trials that their Internet conversations about jihad were idle, harmless chat and that these conversations were constitutionally protected speech. In a separate hearing on Monday afternoon, Duffey sentenced Ahmed to 13 years for conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. At the time of their arrests more than three years ago, Sadequee was 19 and Ahmed was 21. Sadequee is American by birth. His family immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh. Ahmed's family immigrated to the United States from Pakistan when he was 12, and he is a naturalised American citizen. His father is a professor at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega. Federal agents learned that Sadequee sent videos, which contained shots of Washington landmarks, to a jihadist Web site known as a media outlet for al-Qaida in Iraq. Those videos formed the basis of some of the charges of which Sadequee was convicted last summer. Sadequee, 23, arrested in Bangladesh by the FBI in 2006, was convicted on Aug 13 by a federal jury in Atlanta
