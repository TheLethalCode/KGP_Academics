 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has exempted the deputy commissioner of Dhaka, inspector general of prisons and jailor of the Dhaka Central Jail from appearance in a contempt of court charge. The bench of justice Syed Md Dastagir Hossain and justice Md Raisuddin issued the order after these officials filed petition appearing in the court on Sunday. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder was exempted from court appearance on the same charge on Thursday. The HC on December 9 issued a ruling on the four officers for their failure to comply with an order concerning medical treatment of detained former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, an accused in the Aug 21 grenade attack case. Yousuf Hossain Humayun argued in the hearing for DC Zillar Rahman, IG of prisons Brig Gen Ashraful Islam and jailor Mokhlesur Rahman. The court set January 3 to give the order on Pintu's petition. The court on October 13 ordered for special treatment for the ex-deputy minister outside the jail and on November 24 it again asked for his treatment inside the jail by specialist physician. Pintu filed the contempt of court petition on December 7 as both the orders were not obeyed. The August 21 grenade attack at Bangabandhu Avenue had killed at least 23 people and left scores of others injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then the leader of opposition. Some 22 people face charges in the cases, including Pintu, his brother Maulana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. bd
