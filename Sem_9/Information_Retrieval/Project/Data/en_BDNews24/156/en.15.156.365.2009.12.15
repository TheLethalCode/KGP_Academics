 PRETORIA, South Africa, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Stuart Broad will turn down offers to play in next year's lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) in order to be in peak form for the 2010 Ashes in Australia, he said on Monday. Broad, 23, told reporters in Pretoria that playing for England had always been his "boyhood dream" and remained his priority. "My dream has always been to play for England, playing at places like Lord's, and money will not make you happy," Broad told a news conference. Broad's England team mate James Anderson has also announced he will not play in the IPL next year, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on their website (www.ecb.co.uk).

"I want to play as much as possible for England, that's what gives me a buzz, and I won't put my body in jeopardy. There's always a risk of injury in the IPL and by not going I'll be able to have a little rest and hopefully strengthen my performance heading into the international summer." Broad did not disclose if he had received offers to play in the IPL which runs from March 12 to April 25. England's Ashes defence in Australia gets underway in November. England start a four-test series against South Africa at Centurion on Wednesday and Broad said confidence was high in the squad. "We're in good shape, we've won our last two series, and our success against Australia will stand us in good stead for South Africa. "I've taken three 'five-fors' in 2009, so I know I can perform at test level. I'm excited about bowling in South Africa because the pitches are good, there's a balance between bat and ball, a fair contest. "I know that when I get into rhythm, I just have to concentrate on the basics, landing the ball in the right place, troubling the batsmen and making them play. And I feel like I'm in a decent rhythm at the moment," Broad sa
