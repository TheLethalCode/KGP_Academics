 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)--Nineteen out of 24 national hockey players have resigned en masse alleging that their German coach had treated them badly during the South Asian Games preparation in Germany. At a press conference at Maulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium in the city on Wednesday, they said they decided to resign as their coach Gerhard Peter Rach had not cooperated with them during the matches against European countries, including Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Coach Rach have dismissed the allegations. The players said they had to resign as no steps were taken even after Bangladesh Hockey Federation had been informed of the complaint. The coach at Victory Day Tournament dropped players from BHF XIAsaduzzaman Chandan, Jahid Bin Talib Shubha, Mosharraf Hossain Kuti, Rimon Kumar Ghosh, Jahidul Islam Rajon and Khandaker Hossain, they said. The six players played for Bangladesh Police on Wednesday. Chandan said, "The coach recognised him as A-Grade player merely a few days ago." Kuti said, "I regularly played in German League. But, now the coach has dropped me saying that I am short." Coach Rach said those who have been dropped are not eligible to be world class players. He also said he favoured the axing of captain Rasel Mahmud Jimi from the national team because he cannot improve. On leaving out six players, he said, "I have rested, not dropped them. I am trying youths in the Victory Day tournament." bdnews24
