 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  A delegation left for London on Sunday to organise a road show on December 15-16 to attract investment in the country's cash-starved power sector. Bangladesh has organised three road shows to woo investors in 11 projects to generate an additional 4,035 MW of power at the cost of $5 billion to meet the growing demand. The team is being led by Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, prime minister's adviser on power and energy ministry. Two other road shows will be held in Singapore and the US between Jan 25 and Jan 28. The daily demand for power is 5,500 MW against production of 3,800 to 4,000 MW. The government is planning to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal to double power generation in a bid to meet increasing demand, said the energy adviser at the Zia International Airport before flying to UK. The imported fuels will be used to set up new power stations, he told reporters. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad said about 700 MW of power will be added to national grid this year. Chowdhury said: "We face a shortfall 500 to 600 MW of power everyday for gas crisis. "We have crisis of gas. We can't generate power for lack of gas, forcing us to import LNG. "Alongside, we are mulling alternative fuel of power production to gas. We want to import coal for that," he said. Bangladesh has nine trillion cubic feet of gas proven reserve so far. Our daily demand is about 2,300 million cft. The proposed 11 projects include five projects of 1,325 MW capacity, to be run on gas and oil, one coal-fired 2,600 MW, three solar based projects capable of generating 10 MW of power, one wind based project of 100 MW and setting up one 500 million cubic feet LNG production terminal. S A Samad, executive chairman of the Board of Investment, who also joined the nine-member delegation, said Bangladesh is a suitable country for investment. "We will try to convince the investors about the investment potential in Bangladesh power sector," he said. Some 80 interested investors, including 25 expatriate Bangladeshis, have registered online to take part in the road show. The Awami League in its election manifesto has pledged to promote power generation to 5,000 MW by 2011, 7,000 MW by 2013 and 20,000 MW by 2021. bdne
