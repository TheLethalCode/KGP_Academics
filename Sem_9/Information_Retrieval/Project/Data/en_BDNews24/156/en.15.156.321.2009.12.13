<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)  Seven dates have expired for framing charges against BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy in an illegal wealth case, officials said Sunday. Goyeshwar's lawyers once more petitioned the Third Special Judge's Court for more time before on Sunday - the seventh consecutive date fixed for charge framing  citing their client's recent occupation with BNP's national council. Justice Mohammed Mozammel Hossain granted the extra time and fixed Jan 7 as the next date. The Anticorruption Commission's lawyer Abdus Salam Reza told bdnews24.com: "The judge approved their time petition despite our opposition." The ACC filed the case with Ramna Police Station on Jan 5 this year on charges of accumulating illegal wealth worth Tk 2.68 crore and hiding wealth information from the graft watchdog. Goyeshwar surrendered before the High Court on March 9 seeking anticipatory bail until the submission of the charge sheet. On Aug 16, the High Court ordered the BNP leader to show up before the Special Judge's Court within eight weeks after his lawyers appealed for a bail extension. A Dhaka court sent Goyeshwar to jail on surrender on Oct 12, saying: "The accused surrendered to the court a day after the deadline. The trial court rejected his bail extension plea for disobeying the High Court order." He was freed again on bail on Oct 18. bdn
