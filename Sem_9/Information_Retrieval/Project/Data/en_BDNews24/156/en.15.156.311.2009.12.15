 MANILA, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine authorities started evacuating about 50,000 people from around the country's most active volcano on Tuesday as it spewed burning mud and rocks.

Level 4 means an eruption is imminent while Level 5 means an eruption is in progress. "We've been monitoring a high-level of unrest and there could be an hazardous explosion coming," Solidum said. The Philippines lies on the "Ring of Fire", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes. Mayon is the most active of 22 volcanoes in the country, having erupted more than 50 times in the last four centuries. The most destructive eruption came in February 1841 when lava flows buried a town and killed 1,200 people. The last time Mayon erupted was in 20
