 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  A probe committee has blamed faulty design and overloading of passengers for the Bhola ferry tragedy, the shipping ministry said in probe report on Thursday. Another committee, formed to probe the Kishoreganj ferry capsize, accused authorities of not taking cautionary measures following poor visibility due to fog. Both the committees made 31 recommendations and specified nine reasons behind the two accidents, shipping minister Shajahan Khan told newsmen at a press briefing. The Coco-4, crowded from hull to decks with people, partially capsized on Nov 27 on the river Tentulia at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town causing death to at least 85 passengers. On the reason behind the Bhola accident the report said the vessel was built violating the required rules of 2007. Though the launch was three-storey its main height was 44 metre. According to law, no launch below 50 metre height is allowed to have three stories. Besides, loading in excess of capacity and picking passengers from other vessels in the middle of the journey are also blamed for the tragedy. The committee was formed immediately after the accident and submitted its report on Dec 10. It identified seven reasons and 19 recommendations in its report. The recommendations include taking departmental actions against the related staff, speedy dispatch of salvage vessel to the accident scene and compliance of construction rules. The committee identified two reasons and made 12 recommendations in its report on sinking of MV Al-helal-1 on Dec 4 near Charigram in Mithamoin upazila of Kishoreganj. A least 50 passengers were drowned. The recommendations include taking legal action against the authorities for operating the ferry with an unskilled driver, setting up BIWTC office in haor areas, sending fitness certificates and lists of the ferries to the UNO Office in every six months and raising manpower of Inspectorate of Inland Shipping office under the Marine Science Directorate. The government will implement the recommendations within 15 working days, the shipping minister said. The committee will talk to the owners and workers' representatives before that, he said. Shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader said each family was immediately given Tk 3,000 for burial purposes. Each family of Bhola tragedy will be given Tk 30,000 and families which lost more than one member will get Tk 45,000 each.
