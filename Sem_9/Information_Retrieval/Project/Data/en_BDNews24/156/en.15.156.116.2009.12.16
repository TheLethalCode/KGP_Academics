 LONDON, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United thrashed a weakened Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 Tuesday to move level on points with Premier League leaders Chelsea. A Wayne Rooney penalty and a Nemanja Vidic header gave United a 2-0 halftime lead against a Wolves line-up showing 10 changes to the side that beat Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Saturday. Antonio Valencia added a third goal in a pedestrian second half to put United on 37 points, although Chelsea can restore their three-point lead against Portsmouth Wednesday.

Vidic effectively killed the game when his header evaded Wolves keeper Marcus Hahnemann shortly before the break and Valencia got on the scoresheet, volleying in smartly after clever play from Dimitar Berbatov. It was a good night for the city of Birmingham. Goals by England duo Emile Heskey and James Milner earned Villa their victory at Sunderland who had Lorik Cana sent off. "It's been a great few days," manager Martin O'Neill told the BBC. "I was worried about this fixture but confidence is high and when confidence is high you can perform."
