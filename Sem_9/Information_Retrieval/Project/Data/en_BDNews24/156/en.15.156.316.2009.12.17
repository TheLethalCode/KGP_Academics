 LOS ANGELES, Dec 17(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "The Beautiful Life," Ashton Kutcher's quickly canceled television drama about fashion models, could gain a second chance to find an audience -- this time on the Web. The CW network ended the show's run in September after just two airings due to poor ratings, leaving Kutcher holding three additional episodes that had been produced but never shown. So, the former star of "That '70s Show" who has transformed into content producer and Web impresario will put all five on YouTube.com, starting on Thursday.

Kutcher reckons if he can increase the audience size on YouTube, then he might lure sponsors or others to finance more episodes solely for the Web. The show's first batch of episodes -- including a third one viewers never got to see on The CW -- will play at YouTube starting Thursday. Another two unseen programs will premiere Monday, Dec. 21. All five of the roughly 40-minute episodes will be shown without commercials, thanks to a sponsorship deal with electronics company Hewlett-Packard. While the trend in content for the Web has called for short "webisodes" of 5- to 15-minutes, instead of longer shows, Kutcher believes "The Beautiful Life's" production values will allow it to buck that trend. "I would bargain that people will be willing to sit a lot longer if the picture looks a lot better," Kutcher s
