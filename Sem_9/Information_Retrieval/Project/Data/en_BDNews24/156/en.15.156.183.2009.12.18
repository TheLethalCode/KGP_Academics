<TEXT>
 Jessore, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)Maulana Sakhawat Hossain, a Jatiya Party presidium member, was arrested from his Keshavpur house in Jessore in connection with an extortion case at around midnight on Thursday, police said. Azimul Islam, assistant police super, Jessore, said that Sakhawat was arrested in an extortion case filed by Masud Memorial College principal Mashiur Rahman. Sakhawat, a former MP who became a controversial figure for switching political allegiance, entered politics under the banner of Jamaat-e-Islami and later joined BNP. He has lately switched over to JP, said Rahman. In the last election, the Maulana had sought nomination from the Awami leage-led grand alliance. Sakhawat had founded Masud Memorial College in the name of his dead son. Of late, misunderstanding arose between him and the college principal over issues of controlling the institution. Keshavpur Upazila JP organizing secretary Amjad Hossain however claimed that the extortion case was filed on Thursday in connection with the JP leader's rivalry with the principal only to harass him. bdnews
