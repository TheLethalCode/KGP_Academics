 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh celebrates Victory Day anew this year, following two successive years of muted celebrations under emergency rule. A 21-gun salute at dawn will herald the day, followed by laying of wreaths at the National Memorial in Savar, led by the president, to commemorate those who gave their lives for independence. On this day in 1971, the Pakistan army surrendered to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India at Ramna Racecourse Maidan in Dhaka, ending the painful nine-month Liberation War that saw the birth of the new nation. President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina issued separate messages on the eve of the nation's 38th Victory Day, calling for all to work unitedly for a prosperous Bangladesh. Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, in a message, also called for national unity, in the spirit of liberation war, to protect the country's independence and sovereignty. PROGRAMMES Programmes will abound on Wednesday, organised at state level and by numerous social and cultural organisations across the country. Sammilito Sanskritik Jote will hold the main cultural programmes on Dhaka University campus and Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on Wednesday, including victory parades from the Central Shahid Minar at 10am and from the stadium at 4pm. Army, navy and air force bands will play at the National Parliament premises, Farmgate and Mirpur stadium from 2-4pm. A combined performance by army, navy, air force, BDR, police and Ansar bands can also be seen at Suhrawardy Uddyan from 2-4pm. Naval ships docked at Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chittagong, Khulna and Barisal will be open to public from 2pm to sunset. Awami League programmes include tributes at the National Memorial and at the portrait of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. The ruling party, which also led the liberation struggle, will bring out a victory parade from Suhrawardy Uddyan at 3pm. The main opposition party BNP will pay tribute too at the National Memorial in the morning. Party leaders will also visit Ziaur Rahman's grave and bring out their victory parade from their Naya Paltan office at 3pm. SAFETY Security has been boosted in the capital and around the country to ensure public safety and trouble-free celebrations. Special security measures have been taken for the National Memorial at Savar, police and RAB said. Walid Hossian, additional deputy police commissioner, told bdnews24.com, near about 10,000 police will be on duty around the capital. "Three thousand of them have been specially deployed for the occasion." Rapid Action Battalion has said 5,500 of their men will be spread out in teams across the country. Among them 2,000 will be in the capital. Beside regular law enforcers, dog squads, bomb squads and intelligence agencies will also be on special duty. THIS TIME LAST YEAR This time last year, the nation observed Victory Day on the last day of a near-two year emergency period under a caretaker government. The interim cabinet approved the Emergency Powers Repeal Ordinance-2008 on Dec 14, and under it the lifting of emergency rule that was imposed on Jan 11, 2007 amid political unrest following cancelled elections. The state of emergency was officially lifted from midnight on Dec 16, after 23 months of restrictions on civil and political activities. bdnew
