 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India might now take place on January 10, a foreign ministry official said Tuesday. Sheikh Hasina was originally scheduled to go to Delhi on December 19 on a three-day visit. But the trip was postponed following India's request. "The Indian authorities have now proposed January 10 for our prime minister's visit," a foreign ministry director general told journalists at his office. "We are yet to respond to the Indian request," he said. The director general, however, said the duration of the visit will be fixed as per discussions between the two governments. Sheikh Hasina and Indian prime minister Manmohon Singh will be in Copenhagen on December 18 to attend a highest level meeting of the heads of the state or government there. Hasina left for the summit on Monday night. The prime minister's upcoming Delhi visit is seen very important as the two neighbours are set to sign a number of bilateral deals on different issues. Bangladesh hopes that the two top leaders will sign a deal on sharing of water of the Teesta river, which crucial for Bangladesh's largest irrigation project.
