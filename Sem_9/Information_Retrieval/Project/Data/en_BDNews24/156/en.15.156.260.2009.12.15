<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)---Bangladesh Bank will rate commercial banks based on CSR activities, governor Atiur Rahman said on Monday. He urged banks to help allay what he termed an "opportunity crisis" in the country. Atiur said Bangladesh abounded in potential. "There are many talents in our country, but most of them have failed to bloom for lack of proper opportunities." "This lack is a major crisis in our country," he said, speaking as chief guest at a fellowship awards programme among students of different universities. Atiur urged banks and financial organisations to come forward in unfolding opportunities for nurturing talent. "Recently some banks have been carrying out corporate social responsibility, but far less than necessary," he said. Bangladesh Bank is monitoring the CSR activities of the commercial banks, he added. It would prepare annual ratings of banks considering CSR activities, including those that contributed to nurturing young talent and to poverty alleviation, the governor said. He also urged banks to come forward to assist farmers. He said that Bangladesh is one of the countries whose economy has been least hit by the recession, adding that the farming community contributed most to this success. Monday's programme saw 30 MPhil and PhD research fellows of different universities of the country awarded grants sponsored by a private bank. Each was given a grant covering their entire research period at the rate of Tk 5000 per month. The governor handed over the cheques at the programme hosted by Dutch-Bangladesh Bank at the Purbani Hotel. bd
