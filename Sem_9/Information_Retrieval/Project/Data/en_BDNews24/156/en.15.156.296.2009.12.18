 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will continue to protect migrants' rights and promote good practices in migration management, the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) hopes. Bangladesh is one of the world's leading manpower exporting countries which combated the adverse effects of global economic crisis with the remarkably high remittances from its expatriate workers, IOM Dhaka office said in a statement released on Friday marking the International Migrants' Day 2009. There is a great potential for further enhancing labour migration from Bangladesh if it remains committed to providing its labour force with the necessary skills and ensuring protection to both the existing and potential migrants at home and abroad, Rabab Fatima, IOM's regional representative for South Asia, said. It also said climate change and environmental degradation have already triggered migration and displacement all over the planet while Bangladesh is one of the poor and environmentally endangered countries that are bearing the brunt. The statement, however, expressed doubt whether any global deal on climate change would acknowledge the impact of climate on migration and displacement. Most of the migration already occurred in the Asian countries, including Bangladesh, is the result of internal environmental factors like recurrent floods, which drive people to move to crowded urban areas, it said, citing a recently published IOM global report. "The government, NGOs, civil society and media also need to work together to achieve greater coordination at home and abroad to raise awareness and find sustainable solutions to these myriad challenges," Fatima added. IOM in its statement also praised the government for its efforts to address the climate change impacts and to highlight the challenges facing the country in the global context.
