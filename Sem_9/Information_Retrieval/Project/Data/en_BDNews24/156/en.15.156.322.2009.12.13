<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has been nominated for the Indira Gandhi Gold Plaque 2009, an award of the Kolkata Asiatic Society. Outgoing Indian ambassador Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty handed over the nomination letter on Sunday, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. The letter says the society would be honoured if Sheikh Hasina receives the award, Azad said. It decided 'unanimously' to confer the award on Hasina for her contribution to peace and human development, he said. Azad said the prime minister believes in the co-existence of neighbouring countries. "She thinks it is essential for development." The Kolkata Asiatic Society awards the plaque for contributions to international settlement, inter-culture cooperation or human development. It introduced the prize on Nov 17, 1984. Sweden prime minister Olof Palme won the first prize. Chakravarty, who completes his term in Bangladesh this month, thanked the prime minister for help extended to him in carrying out his office. bd
