 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has proposed that adaptation funding must be at least 1.5% of GDP of developed countries, separate from ODA as stipulated in the Brussels Program of Action. Addressing the main plenary meeting of the ongoing UN climate talks at Bella centre in Copenhagen on Wednesday, she said disbursement of fund for adaptation must take into account the extent of vulnerability to climate change, size of population exposed to risk, adaptation initiatives by countries concerned and immediate action. "Developed countries must also allow transfer of ecofriendly technology, particularly to Most Vulnerable Countries (MVCs) and LDCs, at affordable costs. "These must be kept outside the Intellectual Property Rights Regime. There is also need to establish an International Center for Adaptation, Research and Training under UNFCCC for bolstering capabilities through shared experiences on adaptation." Shed said climate refugees are increasing by the day in Bangladesh. "Visible sea level and temperature rise are destroying fish sanctuaries, and livelihood of our fishermen. "Natural disasters, river bank erosions and salinity intrusion are taking toll on lives, and uprooting farming families in millions,"the prime minister said, describing the current situation of Bangladesh. "They are swelling our cities and causing social disorders. Fund allocated for development are being diverted for their rehabilitation affecting our MDGs. In fact, climate change is costing us significant share of our GDP." "It is estimated that a meter rise in sea level due to global warming would inundate 18% of our land mass, force 20 million climate refugees with 40 million more losing their livelihood by 2050," she pointed out. Hasina said to meet climate change challenges, all nations must take immediate action on the basis of the Bali Action Plan on sustainable development for survival. Developed countries must commit to deep and legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. "Indeed Annex One Parties must reduce emissions by 45% by 2020, below 1990 level, allow peaking by 2015, reduce greenhouse gas concentration to 350 ppm by 2100, and limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees or to no more than 2 Degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels." She rattled off a list of initiatives Bangladesh has taken to adopt to climate changes. At national level, she said, Bangladesh has brought a paradigm shift from relief and rehabilitation, to disaster risk management. "We have also adopted adaptation and mitigation programs comprising 134 action plans, and designated authorities for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The prime minister said Bangladesh's greenhouse gas contribution is negligible, but is one of its worst victims. Climate change, and increased frequency, ferocity and erratic pattern of natural disasters are causing havoc in Bangladesh. "The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction has ranked Bangladesh as the most vulnerable country to floods, third most to tsunami, and sixth most to cyclones in terms of human exposure. In addition, salinity intrusions in coastal areas are reducing our cultivable land and threatening the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sunderbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site". Hasina said, an important development is developed countries' realization of their responsibility of unbridled greenhouse gas emissions, which have resulted in global warming and climate change. Important also is their readiness to cut emissions for reversing the present adverse climate trends. "However, to achieve science recommended levels, political will and bold decisions are needed for investment of resources and technologies" she said.
