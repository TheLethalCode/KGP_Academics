<TITLE> Iran to start full-scale enrichment by March 2011 </TITLE>

 TEHRAN, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will start full-scale uranium enrichment production by March 2011 with advanced models of centrifuges, the Islamic state's nuclear chief told the semi- official Fars news agency on Friday. "We are producing new generation of centrifuges named IR3 and IR4 ... We plan to use them by 2011 after eliminating problems and defects," Ali Akbar Salehi told Fars. Iran has been testing small numbers of the machines at a pilot enrichment plant for about two years. Iran is at odds with the West over its declared plans to generate electricity with enriched uranium, a programme the United States and European allies fear is a cover to develop the ability to produce atomic bombs. Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude oil exporter, says its enrichment programme will allow it to export more gas and oil. The Islamic Republic said in October that it planned to use a new generation of faster centrifuges to refine uranium at its newly-revealed enrichment site near the central city of Qom. "In order to bring about an atmosphere conducive to competition, we are using two groups (IR3 and IR4) regarding the issue of the new generations," Salehi said. The underground enrichment plant was kept secret until Iran disclosed its existence in September. Diplomats say it did so after learning Western spy services had detected the site. Nuclear experts say the new model of centrifuges is capable of doubling or tripling the output rate of Iran's current P-1 machine, an outmoded, breakdown-prone vintage from the 1970s. Enriched uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power plants and, if refined further, provided material for atomic bombs. "ACTIVE CENTRIFUGES" Salehi said Iran now had "over 6,000 active centrifuges." In a report last month, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said 3,936 centrifuges were enriching uranium at the Natanz nuclear complex, a 15 percent drop from February, while another 4,756 were installed but were not producing enriched uranium. Analysts said Iran seemed to be having technical problems. "We are currently employing new generations of centrifuges, which have put behind the necessary tests, in enrichment activities," Salehi told Fars. Iran angered the West on Wednesday by test-firing a longer-range missile called the Sejil 2. An earlier version of the missile was tested in May. Washington and its allies interpreted the test as a violation of the UN Security Council resolutions calling on Tehran to curb its nuclear research and ballistic missile activities. Iran, which has been advancing its missile technology in the past years, said that the missile was for the purpose of defending Iran from enemies -- such as Israel and the United States. The United States has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to get Iran to restrain its nuclear programme and subject it to intrusive UN inspections. Iran has vowed to retaliate for any attack. In October, six world powers offered a deal under which Iran would send most of its low-enriched uranium abroad for conversion into fuel for a nuclear medicine reactor in Tehran. However, Tehran has backed away from it, raising the prospect of additional sanctions. Analysts say political turmoil in Iran since a disputed presidential election in June has further clouded prospects for any resolution of the nuclear dispu
