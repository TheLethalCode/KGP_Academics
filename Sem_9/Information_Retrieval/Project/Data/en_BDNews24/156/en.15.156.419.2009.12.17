<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Thursday proposed two separate divisions in his ministry to ease conflicts between its executive and judicial activities. At present, the two wings of the ministry  legislative drafting and judicial  are operated by two additional secretaries, which is creating trouble, he said. "However, it can be resolved if the ministry is divided into two different divisions under two secretaries," Shafique told reporters at the Secretariat. He said the conflict between the executive and judiciary is an old one. "The government must take measures to decide on this." The minister was speaking after the Supreme Court earlier in the day upheld a High Court ruling that declared the appointment of Kazi Habibul Awal as acting law secretary illegal. The law minister said the verdict copy had not reached his office yet and steps will be taken only after receiving it. Asked if Habibul would continue his job as acting secretary, the minister said the appointment of a secretary is done by the prime minister. However, Shafique added, the secretary and his lawyer would decide if he (Habibul) would continue with his duty or not. bd
