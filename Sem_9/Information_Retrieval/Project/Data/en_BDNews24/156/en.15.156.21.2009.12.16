<TITLE> Film archive lacks full '71 collection </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Film Archive sadly does not have a full collection of films based on the events of the 1971 Liberation War. Out of some 70 films, only around 30 films are preserved at the BFA, the archive director, Dr Jahangir Hossain, told bdnews24.com on Monday. "We have preserved them in an air-conditioned and humidity controlled vault," he said. Condition of prints before preservation should be considered, he said, pointing out that it so happened that one collection of films and photographs had been lying under someone's bed for two decades. Analogue system was used to preserve the footage/prints for many years, he said, adding that steps have now been taken to preserve them all in digital form. A branch was opened two years ago to monitor the process, he said, adding that steps would be taken to preserve the films on CD and DVD as well. "We collect CD and DVD of films on liberation war which are available in the market," he said. Some films were preserved in computer hard disks, he said. The major problem in preserving films digitally is that digital devices are being updated constantly, he said. Outside Bangladesh, film makers made a number of films on Bangladesh's liberation war, he said. Of them, Joy Bangla by Nasiga Oshima, Dateline Bangladesh by Gita Mehta and Duranta Padma by Durga Prasad are remarkable. Bangladesh Film Archive has not preserved any by overseas film makers though it has a plan to start collecting them, he said
