 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia cast aside the so-called reformists in picking the party's expanded national standing committee, bringing in 12 new faces, including son and senior vice chair Tarique Rahman. Khaleda also decided that Khandaker Delwar Hossain will remain in place until a new secretary general is appointed, her press secretary told reporters Sunday night at the BNP chief's political office in Gulshan. She named the seven joint secretaries general of the executive committee, press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan said. He said Mirza Fakhrul Alamgir was made senior joint secretary general in place of Tarique, who has been elevated to the more powerful, newly formed senior vice chairman position. The announcements came five days after the party's fifth national council, which expanded the policymaking standing committee from 15 to 19 members. The new faces are Tariqul Islam, ASM Hannan Shah, MK Anwar, Sarowari Rahman, Jamir Uddin Sircar, Mirza Abbas, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, Abdul Moyeen Khan, Nazrul Islam Khan, Rafiqul Islam Miah and Salauddin Quader Chowdhury. Tarique in his new post is also now a member of the party's highest policy-making body. Among those axed from the standing committee were Abdul Matin Chowdhury and Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed. Saifur Rahman's sudden death in a car accident earlier this year also left a gap. One-time BNP stalwarts, that were later seen as loyal to 'reformist' leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, including Sadek Hossain Khoka, Abdullah Al Noman, Hafizuddin Ahmed, Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf, Selima Rahman, Shamsuzzaman Dudu, Zahid Uddin Swapan, Mofiqul Hasan Tripti and Enam Ahmed Chowdhury, were left out from the new pick.
