 NEW DELHI Dec 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's plan to carve a Telangana state out of Andhra Pradesh on Friday sparked statehood demands in other parts of Asia's third largest economy in a new challenge to the Congress party-led government. In a surprise move, the government announced on Thursday that it would push for the formation of a new state after a week of violent protests and a hunger strike by a leading politician shut down business in the state's high-tech Hyderabad city. Since independence in 1947 India has had to balance the challenges of maintaining different peoples under one federal system as well as the relationship between central power in the capital Delhi and the states of the world's largest democracy. The Gorkhas, ethnic Nepalis, in West Bengal called for an indefinite strike from Friday demanding their own "Gorkhaland" to protect their heritage. Other groups also made statehood demands. The Congress party, which heads the ruling coalition, returned to power for a second term by a wider-than-expected margin in May, freeing it from the communists who scuppered many reforms in exchange for their support to the last government. But just a little over six months into office, it has been besieged by a slew of crises, undercutting the momentum from a resounding election victory and making it harder to carry through bold promises of policy change and economic reforms. Political agitations, such as demands for new states driven by ethnic and regional groups, is only expected to slow the pace of economic reforms as political expediency takes preference over firm governance. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Andhra Pradesh lawmakers after 128 out of the 294-member state assembly resigned in protest over the statehood move. The resignations, cutting across party lines, have yet to be accepted by the local speaker. Some leading Congress party members will now try to convince the government to abandon the plan, party sources said. The creation of India's 30th state would need approval by the Andhra Pradesh assembly as well as India's parliament. PROTESTS MOUNT Last month the central government yielded to demands on sugar prices after tens of thousands of farmers marched to parliament, putting a halt to proceedings for two days. "Congress has panicked on a number of issues and it is on the backfoot now," said Kuldip Nayar, a political analyst. "They are doing everything in a haste and protests on every front are a result of their own doing." Thousands of people marched in Andhra Pradesh on Friday, some supporting the decision for a separate state, others vowing to fight it tooth and nail. Businesses were shut and public transport halted. The state has long been divided between the more prosperous coastal area and the less developed inland Telangana region. A unit of global drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said it was temporarily closing its factory in the state due to the protests. An HSBC bank branch was ransacked and buses were set ablaze. Investors fear protests will hurt Hyderabad, southern India's IT hub and home to firms like Microsoft, Google and Dell. No decision has been taken as to which state Hyderabad will belong to but Home Secretary Gopal Pillai said on Friday it should belong to the new state. "Congress has created a big mess for themselves. They could have taken more time and started a negotiation before announcing their decision on Telangana suddenly," said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies think-tank. Twenty-one Gorkha leaders started a hunger strike on Friday to demand their own state. At least 1,200 people died in a bloody Gorkhaland campaign in the 1980s, but protests ended after Gorkha leaders accepted limited auton
