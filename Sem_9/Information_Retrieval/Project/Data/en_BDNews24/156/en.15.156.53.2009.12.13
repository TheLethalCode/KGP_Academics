<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnesws24.com)Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty will leave Dhaka on Dec 20 ending his diplomatic assignment in Bangladesh, foreign ministry sources say. Pinak's successor and high commissioner-designate Rajeet Mitter is scheduled to arrive in city on Dec 26, said a director general of the foreign ministry. "They (Indian high commission) have informed us that he (Chakravarty) will leave on Dec 20 and the new envoy is scheduled to arrive on Dec 26," the director general told bdnews24.com at his office Sunday. Chakravarty, from West Bengal, took charge as high commissioner in January 2007, and has raised some controversy during his term. He was criticised by several quarters during his stay for his allegedly "undiplomatic" remarks on Bangladesh matters, including internal affairs. BNP and its allies objected to "contentious" comments on the politics of the main opposition parties earlier this year. The opposition protested strongly at the time and went so far as to urge the government to request India for Pinak's withdrawal from Bangladesh.
