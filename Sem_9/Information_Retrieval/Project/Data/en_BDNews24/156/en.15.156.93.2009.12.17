 Mustafiz Mamun on his return from Nijhum Deep Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Deer, the most gorgeous bio-diversity abounding the southern island of Nijhum Deeppreviously known as Char Osmanare now under threats from the wild foxes and dogs. The wonderful species of deer, also called Chitra Horin, have become a prey to the wild foxes and the dogs, kept as pet by the local people to save their crops from the foraging deer. The wild foxes and the dogs also chase the deer deep into the island woods, local residents said. Moazzem Molla, a 70-year old inhabitant of the island, told bdnews24.com, "Deer are like enemies to the local people as they forage onto cropland and eat up the crops in the dark of night. We fear some day they'd start to eat the soil on the island." Asked why he kept the pets dogs, he said none had forbidden them to keep them, parrying the question without admitting that they protected their cropland. Hossain Ali, a resident of Nama Bazaar, said the domestic dogs have turned wild as they became used to hunt. Some of these dogs spend most of the time in the woods and hunt the male and child deer. The male deer cannot run fast with their long horns and child deer are comparatively immature to escape the group attacks from the dogs, he pointed out. Local people said the number of deer has been reducing compared to the situation two years' back. Rakibul Islam from Nama Bazaar area said deer are found dead everyday inside the woods which are later dragged by the dogs. The government in 2001 declared the island as a national park. Nurunnabi Chowdhury, the Forest Officer of the island, said they had informed the top officials of the department to take measures for killing the dogs to save the deer population, but no steps were taken. He said the number of dogs was increasing while that of the deer decreasing, adding that steps should be taken to save the deer population. According to forest department estimate, there are some 20,000 deer on the island. In 1974, only a pair of deer was released on the remote island in the Bay, but over the years the number multiplied as the woods and environment on Nijhum Deep provided a natural spawning ground for them. b
