 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh police, handicapped by shortage of transports, have sent a proposal to the home ministry seeking allocation of Tk 500 crore for purchase of vehicles. "We do not have sufficient vehicles to carry out duties in maintaining law and order. The vehicles we have now are used for VIP duties," Inspector general of police Nur Mohammad said recently. Many police stations have only one vehicle, he said. The police headquarters sent the proposal to the ministry on Nov 26 to buy 1,500 pickup vans and 6,500 motorcycles. Nur said there is a budget for police every year to buy vehicles and other equipment. "We have been allotted Tk 12.50 crore for this year, but this amount is not sufficient for us. "We wanted Tk 500 crore for three years. We will buy vehicles according to the demand of various police stations," he said. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder told bdnews24.com: "The police have been using old, ramshackle and almost rejected vehicles for a long period. "The ministry is considering the proposal for buying a good number of vehicles and motorcycles." He believed the transportation problem will be lessened a lot after the implementation of the proposal. The police members are now carrying out their duties and operations with a large number of requisitioned cars. About 200 cars are being requisitioned only in the capital a day. bdnews
