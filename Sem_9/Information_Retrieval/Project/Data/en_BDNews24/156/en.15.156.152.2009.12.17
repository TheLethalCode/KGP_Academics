<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has upheld a High Court ruling that declared illegal the appointment of Kazi Habibul Awal as an acting law secretary. The seven-member Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice Mohammed Tafazzul Islam, gave the order on Thursday. It also rejected the appeal filed by Habibul, who was later promoted to full secretary, against the HC order. Retired district judge Aftabuddin filed a writ petition challenging the legality of the appointment on July 5, 2007. Habibul was appointed as acting law secretary on June 28, 2007. The HC on January 18, 2008 declared Habibul's appointment illegal. Habibul filed an appeal against the order that day. On Thursday, Ajmalul Hossain QC, lawyer for the petitioner, told bdnews24.com that as the Appellate Division had rejected Habibul's appeal he would be no more the secretary of the law ministry. But Habibul will be able to return to his previous position as additional secretary in the law ministry's drafting wing department. Barrister Ameer-ul-Islam stood for Habibul in the hearing. Ajmalul Hossain and barrister A B M Siddiqur Rahman argued for the writ petitioner and additional attorney general M K Rahman represented the state. On whether a review petition will be filed Ameer-ul-Islam said Habibul is abroad now. "We will decide on it after he is back," Islam said. The writ petition said Habibul cannot be appointed as acting secretary as per the regulations of the appointment in the particular ministry. The appointment regulations reserve 75 percent quota for judicial cadres. But Habibul was not a cadre of the judicial service. The Appellate Division put a freeze on the High Court ruling following Habibul's appeal. The government appointed him law secretary on June 17, 2008. bdne
