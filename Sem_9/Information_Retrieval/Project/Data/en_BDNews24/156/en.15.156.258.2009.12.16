 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)--The postal department has signed a deal with a software developer to make way for automation of the entire postal system within three years. The move comes in a bid to revolutionise postal services still operating under a law more than a century old. It is also one of the projects under which e-banking and e-money transfer is being launched in Bangladesh Under the deal, Sinesis IT will develop software within one year got initial installation in 84 post offices around the country in the subsequent three months at a cost of Tk 320 million. AKM Shafiur Rahman, project director under the postal department, and Sinesis IT managing director Sohrab Ahmed Chowdhury signed the agreement on Tuesday. Rahman said total automation of nearly 10,000 post offices throughout the country will be completed by three years. The postal department is currently implementing eight different projects at a cost of Tk 1,780 million, he added. State minister for post and telecommunications Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, present at the signing ceremony, said all the 9,876 post offices will eventually be brought under automated services if the project is successful. The services of the postal department will be modernised and some 10,500 staff will perform as a mobile bank, he said. He said the department, operating under legislation framed in 1898, is ill-equipped to withstand the competition of private courier service providers. The state minister also said the government has taken initiatives to amend the law to revive the state postal service. The law has already been scrutinised and revised and it will be passed in the upcoming winter session of parliament, he said. After that, there will be no bar to post offices providing ebanking and e--money transfers, Razu said. Hasanul Huq Inu, chief of the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry, said the automation process is on as the government wants to deliver banking facilities to all. bdnews
