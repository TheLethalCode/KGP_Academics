 Maruf Mallick and Rashida Ahmad Copenhagen, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh expressed disappointment with discord at the UN climate talks on Thursday, but said it had not given up hopes of seeing a deal in Copenhagen to slow global warming. One of the most vulnerable countries, Bangladesh said "there was no alternative to success". State minister for environment Hasan Mahmud told a press conference that intense negotiations had been going on over the past ten days, but rifts remained on the eve of a deadline to reach an accord. "We are disappointed that we see major differences among the parties." He said countries must be guided by the Bali Action Plan, which was agreed by UNFCC members, to uphold the objective of the Dec 7-18 conference in Copenhagen. "We have not given up hope. Informal consultation is going on. We consider that these differences can be resolved if we pay serious attention to our commitments in the Bali Action Plan." Mahmud said Bangladesh was calling on countries to lower total emissions at their source and limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius, as a basis for a legally binding treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol that expires in 2012. "Total emission must fall by 45 percent (of 1990 levels) by 2020, they must peak by 2015. And we demand that the total (concentration) of the greenhouse gases in the air must not be more than 350 ppm by 2010," said the minister. However, a leaked document prepared by the UN climate convention secretariat says current pledges by developed nations will "lead to concentrations equal or above 550ppm, with the related temperature rise around 3C." The analysis was based on a number of recent studies, notably the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook. Nevertheless, Mahmud said: "We are here with very high hopes. We do not have any alternative without success" Earlier on Thursday, success seemed remote as leading emitters China and the United States were blamed for deadlock on carbon cuts. But Danish prime minister and conference president Lars Lokke Rasmussen re-launched the talks, which had been stalled for more than 24 hours, by dropping a new set of complex and disputed draft texts. The US and China also added fresh impetus as world leaders gathered for a last effort to reach a pact. China signalled concessions on monitoring of emission curbs. The US said it would commit money for developing countries, backing a $100 billion global climate fund. TALKS RESUME AS TIME RUNS OUT The summit of world leaders, scheduled for Friday, is meant to adopt a final deal to avoid dangerous climate change and drive a greener global economy less dependent on fossil fuels. Negotiators have nearly run out of time to present world leaders with intelligible drafts to sign at the summit. Rasmussen removed the first obstacle to the talks on Thursday, dropping the new draft texts after opposition from many developing nations, which saw the talks grind to a halt the day before. "The conference is now at a critical juncture and we have now agreed how to proceed," said Rasmussen. "We now rely on the willingness of all parties to take that extra step to make that deal that is expected of us." Ministers and leaders also urged fresh urgency. In his address to delegates, French president Nicolas Sarkozy called on nations to "stop posturing". "A failure in Copenhagen would be a catastrophe for each and everyone of us," he said. "If we keep on heading where we're going, we are heading for failure." HOPE US secretary of state Hillary Clinton renewed hopes, telling a news conference: "The United States is prepared to work with other countries toward a goal of jointly mobilising $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing countries." The European Union has proposed a $150 billion global fund, and African leaders have supported climate aid for the world's poorest of $100 billion. Agreement on a climate fund could add political drive to the UN talks which are meant to agree a host of other measures on Friday, from saving rainforests to boosting carbon markets in addition to curbing global carbon emissions. BLAME India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh, however, accused rich countries at one point of planning a "propaganda campaign" to blame developing nations for any breakdown in the talks and failure to reach a deal. Developing economies are expected to add almost all future growth in carbon emissions. "We are in the end game. It's only a matter of time before the blame game starts," said Ramesh. Hillary Clinton clearly stipulated that any US contribution to a global climate fund depended on developing nations standing behind their actions to curb growth in emissions under a new pact to replace the Kyoto Protocol after 2012. Developing countries, including Bangladesh, want to see any new deal build on rather than replace the existing Kyoto Protocol, which is the only legally binding document on emission cuts and pertains only to rich nations. France backed the call to continue with the Kyoto Protocol on Thursday, breaking away from the EU position. The US, meanwhile, has never been a party to the Kyoto Protocol. The US has said that unless developing nations, specifically China, committed to emissions curbs too, a new deal would fail. China was clearly unhappy with such comments. "We are not interested in becoming a party to the efforts by some people to try to blame other countries for 'a failure' at Copenhagen," China's climate change ambassador Yu Qingtai said. "Copenhagen is too important to fail," Yu said.
