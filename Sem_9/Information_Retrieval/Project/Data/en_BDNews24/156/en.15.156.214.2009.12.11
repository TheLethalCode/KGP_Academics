 SEOUL, Dec 11 (bdenws24.com/Reuters) - North Korea indicated on Friday it was ready to end its year-long boycott of nuclear negotiations, following talks in the reclusive state this week with a U.S. envoy to try to revive a disarmament-for-aid deal. The North's official KCNA news agency described the talks with US President Barack Obama's first envoy there as "frank and businesslike." "The two sides deepened the mutual understanding, narrowed their differences and found not a few common points," it quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying. US envoy Stephen Bosworth spent three days in Pyongyang where he met First Vice Minister Kang Sok-ju, considered to be the mastermind of its nuclear policy and close to leader Kim Jong-il. KCNA said there were extensive talks on drawing up a peace treaty and normalising ties, provision of economic and energy aid and denuclearising the Korean peninsula. Bosworth flies to Beijing on Friday, then to Tokyo and Moscow to brief members of the six-way talks before going to Washington next week. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the talks "quite positive" as a preliminary meeting as the Obama administration pursues an approach of "strategic patience in close coordination" with allies. North Korea walked away from the negotiating table a year ago. Five months later it detonated a nuclear device, its second such test, resulting in tightened UN sanctions that further damaged the North's crippled economy. Analysts said it may be the North's broken economy that is pushing it back to the table, where it hopes to win aid in return for a fresh promise to give up its nuclear arsenal. "For the situation to move forward, North Korea needs to take irreversible steps in denuclearisation," said Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. "For this to happen, actions must be taken on both sides simultaneously." Bosworth said he passed on Obama's message that failure to move ahead on the disarmament deal was an obstacle to realising Pyongyang's long-sought goal of improving ties with Washington. Once the six-party process resumed, he said, progress could then be made on issues such as talks on a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War. North Korea has blamed the US military presence in the South as proof that Washington was intent on destroying it, which made it necessary to build a nuclear arsenal in self defence. The United States has denied such plans
