 VATICAN CITY Dec 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Industrialised nations must recognise their responsibility for the environmental crisis, shed their consumerism and embrace more sober lifestyles, Pope Benedict said on Tuesday. The pope's call for more environmental commitments came in his message for the Roman Catholic Church's annual World Day of Peace, to be marked on Jan 1 and whose theme is "If You Want to Cultivate Peace, Protect Creation." The message is traditionally sent to heads of state, government and international organisations and its importance this year is more significant because its release coincided with the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen.

"Our present crises -- be they economic, food-related, environmental or social -- are ultimately also moral crises, and all of them are interrelated."

Environmental issues deserved the attention of the world community because the were human rights issues that could influence the right to life, food, health and development. "Sad to say, it is all too evident that large numbers of people in different countries and areas of our planet are experiencing increased hardship because of the negligence or refusal of many others to exercise responsible stewardship over the environment," he s
