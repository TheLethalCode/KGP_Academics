 Dhaka, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy winter fog, which has been blanketing most parts of the country, looks set to stay for the next few days, the met office says. Travel, especially by river, may be further disrupted for at least five more days. The fog may lift after a low in the Bay weakens further, Rashiduzzaman, on duty officer of the Meteorological Department, told bdnews24.com Sunday. Weather forecast for 24 hours up to Monday said night temperatures will remain unchanged. The highest and lowest temperatures were 29 and 11.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday. "The recent low pressure that formed over the Bay meant a huge amount of water vapour has come in from the sea, with fog settling across the country," said Rashiduzzaman. A low pressure developed into a cyclonic storm earlier in the week. The Cyclone 'Ward' gradually weakened into a low again on Sunday, moving towards Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu, said the met official. "The weather will return to normalcy after four or five days. Heavy fog may remain for that time." Communications on highways and river routes have been severely disrupted due to heavy fog in recent days. On Sunday, ferries were halted on the Mawa-Kaorakandi route. The past two days saw ferry movement disrupted for ten hours at a time. Sirajul Huq, manager of BIWTC's Kaorakandi office, said ferry movement came to a stop on Mowa-Kaowakandi route from 10pm to morning on Saturday and Sunday. He said scores of trawlers and 18 passenger boats were stranded in fog on the Padma, Meghna and Dhaleswari rivers. Long-distance bus movements on different highways to and from the capital were also disrupted. The long-term weather forecast shows one or two mild to moderate cold waves may blow over the country in the second half of December, the met office said. bd
