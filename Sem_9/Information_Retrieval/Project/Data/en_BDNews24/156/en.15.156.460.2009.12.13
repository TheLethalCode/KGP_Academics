 Dhaka, Dec 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Switzerland on Sunday ratified a bilateral Agreement on Double Taxation Avoidance (DTA), says a foreign office statement. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes and the Swiss ambassador Dr Urs Herren exchanged the instruments at the foreign ministry. Foreign minister Dipu Moni was present at the occasion. "Under the DTA, companies and professionals will enjoy better legal protection and double taxation on income, profit, dividends, interest, royalties, pensions, etc, would be avoided to facilitate operation of business and investment," the statement reads. The exchange allows the agreement to take effect in January 2010 for Switzerland and in July 2010 for Bangladesh. According to the provisions of the treaty, the two sides have undertaken to apply the principle of non discrimination and agreed to exchange information for correct application of the DTA.
