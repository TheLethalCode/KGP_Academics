<TITLE> 'Delayed impact' to hit Bangladesh growth: ADB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Asian Development Bank sees Bangladesh's GDP growth falling to around 5.2 percent this year due to delayed impact of the global recession. ADB, in its Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update released Thursday, cited a fall in exports. It also forecast a slowdown in remittance inflow in coming months, despite continued strong growth so far this fiscal. "The lingering impacts of the global economic crisis are expected to lower GDP growth to 5.2 percent in FY2010. Slower growth of exports and remittances will have secondary effects on industry and services in FY2010, through weaker external and domestic demand," it said. Surviving the external and internal shocks during FY2008, the economy gained momentum in the first quarter of FY2009 (JulySeptember 2008) before it began to experience the impact of the global crisis, the report said. But, ADB said, GDP dropped below 6.0 percent in FY2009, for the first time in several years. It fell to 5.9 percent, down from 6.2 percent in FY2008 and 6.4 percent in FY2007. It said Bangladesh will need to improve the investment climate, upgrade infrastructure, reduce power and energy shortages, and accelerate economic reforms to achieve higher economic growth, create jobs, and sustain progress in poverty reduction. Agriculture Despite continued policy support, agriculture growth is expected to moderate in the current fiscal year due to the higher base (at the end of FY2009) and moderation in farmers' incentives because of the last year's lower output prices at the farm gate, it said. As a result, the agriculture sector growth rate is expected to decline slightly to 4.1 percent in FY2010, it added. Industry Industry sector growth for FY2010 is expected to remain at about 6 percent. It declined sharply from 6.8 percent in FY2008 to 5.9 percent in FY2009 because of the impact of the global economic slowdown on exports from Bangladesh and moderation in domestic demand caused by the deceleration of growth in remittances, said ADB. The adverse effects of the global economic slowdown are expected to further dampen export sector growth in FY2010, which will in turn affect domestic industrial production, said the bank. "The slowdown in remittance growth is expected to affect the housing subsector. The deficiencies in power, gas, and basic infrastructure are the major supply-side bottlenecks for industry sector growth." Banks and insurance companies will continue to be affected by sluggish investment activities. Service sector growth in FY2010 is thus expected to be only 5.5 percent down from 6.3 percent in FY2009, said ADB. Inflation The report said year-on-year inflation was rising again after falling to a 9-month low of 2.3 percent in June 2009. Inflation rose to 4.6 percent in September 2009, although it remained low compared with 10.2 percent in September 2008. Remittance Despite the continued rise of remittance inflow this year, the ADB sounded a warning bell. "While the flow of remittances is encouraging, it is likely to moderate significantly in the months ahead as the growth of new migrants leaving the country slows," it said. Out-of-country jobs reduced sharply by 46.4 percent during JulyNovember 2009 over the year earlier, suggesting a slowdown in remittance inflows in the near future, it added. Balance of Payments The report said FY2010 began with dismal export performance, raising serious concern about the prospects of attaining the annual export target of $17.6 billion (12.8 percent growth over FY2009). Export earnings declined by 11.7 percent in the first quarter of FY2010, as the impact of the global economic recession on exports from Bangladesh became more pronounced. The decline was broad based, affecting all items, with the exception of raw jute and jute goods, said ADB. "Import payments during JulySeptember 2009 declined sharply by 19.0 percent over the same period in 2008. "Rice imports experienced a sharp decline of 98.5 percent because of the good domestic harvest. Among other food items, imports of sugar also declined. Imports of consumer and intermediate goods fell by 33.6 percent. "The decline in the import of key industrial raw materials such as chemicals 9.9 percent, yarn 27.7 percent, plastic and rubber 16.8 percent, textiles 11.7 percent, and capital machinery 4.1 percent suggests decreased industrial activity in the near term," the report said. It said the trade deficit narrowed to $738 million during JulySeptember 2009, down from $1.3 billion during July September 2008, as the large decline in imports more than offset the decline in exports. "With the lower deficit in trade and services, and the continued rise in remittances, the current account surplus increased dramatically to $1.4 billion during JulySeptember 2009, from $308 million in JulySeptember 2008," it said. As a result, the surplus in the overall balance of payments rose to $1.3 billion during JulySeptember 2009 from $396 million during JulySeptember 2008. The surplus in the combined capital and financial accounts also contributed to the significant increase in the overall balance, said the development b
