 COPENHAGEN, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has told participants in the UN climate change talks that it sees no possibility of achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday. Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the Dec. 7-18 conference, and had hoped to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming. The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing "a short political declaration of some sort," but it was not clear what that would say. The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an "operational accord" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is hammered out in 2010. Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure. "We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try," said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband. "At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try." NATIONS AT ODDS Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world. While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal. Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions. Talks on a UN-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests. A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans. On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warmi
