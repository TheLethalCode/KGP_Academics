 WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday the US government's purchase of a prison in Illinois to hold some Guantanamo Bay detainees will help close the facility in Cuba, perhaps by summer. He told a news conference at the Justice Department that the acquisition of the Thomson Correctional Center in northwestern Illinois "goes a long way" toward shutting down the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Holder initially said he hoped the prison would be closed over the next several months, but later told Reuters in a brief interview that it could be the summer or perhaps even the early fall of next year.

Administration officials such as Holder have cited a number of legal, political and diplomatic problems in closing the prison, which now holds 210 detainees. While the Jan. 22 deadline will be missed, Holder said he wanted to make clear that "Guantanamo will be closed." Holder said he expected to go to the Illinois prison at some point to personally inspect efforts to make the facility more secure. Holder's comments came the day after the administration announced that the federal government was buying the Illinois prison, and that some U.S. military trials for the detainees would be held there. Republicans called the move a potential security risk. Holder also said he recently went to New York City, where he has decided to send the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and four co-conspirators for trial in federal court. They currently are at Guantanamo. Holder said he was assured by local, state and federal officials in New York that trials can be held there in what he described as a "safe and appropriate manne
