 Copenhagen, Dec 18 (Reuters/bdnews24.com)--U.S. President Barack Obama urged world leaders on Friday to "act together" on an accord to fight climate change, but he did not offer new U.S. commitments to cut emissions that some see as crucial to a deal. Obama, addressing his counterparts at talks in the Danish capital, reiterated the U.S. offers, called for transparency from other countries in how their emissions curbs are checked, and said the United States would continue to fight global warming regardless of what happened at the summit. "I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I come here today - not to talk, but to act," he said to applause. "As the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bears our responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility." The United States has offered to cut its greenhouse gas emissions roughly 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels or 3 percent from 1990 levels. Those goals correspond to legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, and Obama -- who is eager to turn the bill into a law -- did not offer more aggressive targets. He did, however, call on all countries to make concessions in order to reach a deal now. "We are ready to get this done today. But there has to be movement on all sides," he said. Activists were disappointed. After two weeks of faltering talks, they hoped Obama would offer a more aggressive emissions cut, despite his political constraints at home. "President Obama can still save Copenhagen by doing what he called on other leaders to do and give some ground by increasing his commitment to cut global warming pollution," said Greenpeace US executive director Phil Radford. "As it is he crossed an ocean to tell the world he has nothing new to offer, then he said take it or leave it." Obama's participation at the talks holds risks for him at home and abroad. If the president, a Democrat, puts a more aggressive offer on the table, he could face criticism from Republicans who charge the United States is going too far without getting enough in return from India and China. If he remains cautious and the talks end up faltering, he would be connected to that failure and his efforts to pass domestic climate change legislation could suffer along with his credibility among other international leaders. STILL SOMETHING MORE TO OFFER? Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to discuss outstanding disagreements in Copenhagen and the two directed their negotiators to work toward a deal. China and the United States are the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Obama may have been holding back to leave wiggle room at the negotiating table. "I think the speech may have been calibrated not to put some things on the table at this point, because of the hard-ball negotiations going on," he said. "We're hopeful that the (China-U.S.) bilateral may have cleared some of the air and laid the groundwork for agreement on some of the issues." Obama acknowledged that deal texts circulating in Copenhagen were not perfect and did not give every country what it wanted, but he said that should not prevent a deal from being reached. "There is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We have charted our course, we have made our commitments, we will do what we say," he said. With a nod to lawmakers back in Washington, Obama said the United States would push ahead with its efforts to fight climate change even if the Copenhagen talks failed. "America is going to continue on this course of action to mitigate our emissions and to move toward a clean energy economy no matter what happens here in Copenhagen," he said. Some environmentalists praised Obama for coming at all but said his actions in the coming months, while climate change legislation is debated in the U.S. Senate, would show the degree of his commitment to the cause. "The president showed his leadership in coming to Copenhagen at this critical juncture. We hope his legendary leadership will inspire his peers to rise to the occasion," said Carter Roberts, head of environmental group WWF, in a statement. "The ultimate test of his leadership will be engaging the Senate and delivering action in Congress early next year," he said. White House officials say the president will make a robust effort to get the climate bill through Congress once his top domestic priority, healthcare reform legislation, is compl
