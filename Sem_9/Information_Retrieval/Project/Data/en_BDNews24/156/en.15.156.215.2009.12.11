 By Alister Doyle and David Fogarty COPENHAGEN, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world should at least halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with rich nations taking the lead, according to a first draft text on Friday seeking to break deadlock on a new climate pact at U.N. talks. The 7-page document omits figures for how many billions of dollars the rich nations should give developing nations to help them shift to green energies and cope with the impact of global warming, such as desertification and rising sea levels.

"We are still considering the text," said Kemal Djemouai, an Algerian official who chairs the group of African nations. Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said there were huge gaps in the text.
