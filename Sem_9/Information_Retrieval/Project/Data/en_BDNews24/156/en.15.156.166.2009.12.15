<TITLE> Power interconnector cuts massive system loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)Implementation of Ashuganj-Sirajganj Inter-connector Project has yielded a savings of Tk 22 crore in five months, which would otherwise be lost to 'system loss'. Besides, the project has helped strike a balance in the power supply situation in the northern and western grids, minimising loadshedding and voltage fluctuation. Engineer Mozammel Hossain, director, Power and Grid Company of Bangladesh told reporters Tuesday while they were taking a tour of the project funded by the Asian Development Bank and the Bangladesh government. People in general, especially the farmers of northern and western regions are reaping the benefits of the 'Second East-West Power Inter-connector Project', he said. The project's implementation was initiated in fiscal 2004-05 to facilitate power supply from the eastern zone to the north and west of Bangladesh, which was completed in FY 2007-2008. Power supply through the inter-connector began in February 2009. The estimated cost of the project was Tk 361 crore, but it was completed spending only Tk 336 crore, of which the government's share was Tk 119 crore and the ADB bore the rest. The project director said, the project's initial power handling capacity of 44 MW was lifted to 1100 MW in its second stage, which reduced system loss from 3.53 percent to 3.23 percent or 75 million kw hour of power worth Tk 22 crore. Ruhul Amin, the PGCB's managing director said, the farmers of the north and western Bangladesh saw bumper production of rice in the last season as the inter-connector ensured smoother power supply throughout the irrigation season. The visiting ADB country director Paul J Heytens said, ADB has been a longstanding partner of Bangladesh in its power development sector. Another ongoing joint venture in the sector is expected to add up another 530 MW of electricity to the nation grid within another year or a year and a half, he said. The ADB plans to invest another $300 million in installation of pipeline to boost gas supply, he said. "We're currently discussing with the government the possibilities of injecting more funds into the sector by the year 2011," he said replying to a reporter's query. bd
