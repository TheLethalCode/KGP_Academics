<TEXT>
 Nagpur, India, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tillakaratne Dilshan struck his second successive century to lead Sri Lanka to a three-wicket victory over India in a thrilling second one-day international on Friday. Man-of-the-match Dilshan hit 123 off 113 balls and put on 102 for the first wicket with Upul Tharanga (37) as Sri Lanka chased down 302 for victory with five balls to spare to level the series. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni lashed his sixth one-day century (107) to guide India to a commanding 301 for seven after choosing to bat first in the day-night game. Explosive Dilshan, who smashed a career-best 160 in the first match when the tourists fell three runs short of pulling off the second highest ODI run chase ever, was dismissed with his team needing 89 off 85 deliveries. Left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan claimed the wickets of former captain Mahela Jayawardene (39), Thilana Kandamby (27) and Chamara Kapugedera (2) to put the pressure on Sri Lanka. But all-rounder Angelo Mathews hit a sparkling 37 not out batting with a runner to guide the tourists to victory. The third match will be played in Cuttack on Monday
