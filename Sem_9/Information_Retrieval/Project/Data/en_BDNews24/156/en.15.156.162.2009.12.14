 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com)--Over three quarters of the people killed--and 95 percent of the total affected by natural hazards--since the beginning of the year were due to extreme weather events, said Margareta Wahlstrm, special representative of the UN secretary-general for Disaster Risk Reduction. These 2009 figures were released on Monday at Bella Centre, hosting the COP 15, by the Belgian WHO collaborating Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) covering the period from Jan 1 to Nov 2009. Out of the 245 disasters in 2009, 224 were weather related, accounting for 55 million people out of the 58 million people affected, 7000 out of 8900 of those killed, and US$15 billion out of the US$19 billion in economic damages. In 2009, 11 million people were affected by floods compared to 178 million people in 2007, and 45 million in 2008. "Statistics this year show lower figures compared to previous years, which is a good news for people and countries, however extreme weather disasters remain top of the list and will continue to affect more people in the future as more than half of the world's population highly exposed is living in coastal regions" said Wahlstrm. "The extreme weather event figures are probably underestimated as drought impacts are not easily detected in disaster statistics" said Professor Debarati Guha Sapir, Director of CRED in a joint UNISDR, UNDP and WMO press conference in Copenhagen. Drought is a major hazard and a slow onset disaster in many part of the world with long term consequences on people and their assets. It undermines livelihoods, kills slowly through malnutrition and disease. In Africa alone, drought accounted for less than 20% of disaster occurrences but represented 80% of all people affected in the continent between 1970 and 2008 (CRED). "Access to clean water, in fact access to any water at all, is already a major threat to human security. Disasters can be caused by too little water as well too much water. In cities around the world, even simple measures such as drainage systems can save lives and prevent losses" said Margareta Wahlstrm. Asia is especially vulnerable to storms and floods. Between January and November 2009, 48 million people were affected by weather-related events , which remains at highest risk with the largest numbers of affected people. Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization who announced the year 2009 among the top 10 warmest years on record since the beginning of instrumental climate records in 1850, underlined the importance of early warning systems, and seasonal climate forecasts to manage risks and to better prepared vulnerable populations to cope with more extreme events.
