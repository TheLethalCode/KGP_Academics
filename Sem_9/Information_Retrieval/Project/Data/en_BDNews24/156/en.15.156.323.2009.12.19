<TEXT>
 Copenhagen, Dec 18 (Reuters/bdnews24.com)--Following are notable quotes about a summit of more than 120 world leaders that is trying to secure agreement on who should cut greenhouse gas emissions, by how much and who should pay. CHINESE PREMIER WEN JIABAO "We will honor our word with real action. "Whatever outcome this conference may produce, we will be fully committed to achieving and even exceeding the target."
