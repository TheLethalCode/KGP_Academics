 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh on Thursday pressed for a stronger climate deal by building on the existing legally-binding Kyoto Protocol that expires 2012. A Bangladesh official, speaking at a session of the Conference of Parties, said Dhaka would like to see the Kyoto arrangements continue with amendments. The delegate proposed new targets for the rich nations, or Annex 1 countries, to cut CO2 emissions by 40-45 percent on the 1990 levels by 2017. A few countries, however, proposed a new framework, when Kyoto Protocol expires, in line with the Bali Action Plan. "Bangladesh stands for the continuation of KP for a 2nd and subsequent commitment periods. At the same time Bangladesh recognises the need to put all out effort in strengthening and making it more effective by having judicious amendment to this Protocol," the Dhaka delegate told COP 15 on its fourth day of deliberations. bdnews24.com obtained a copy of the official presentation the Bangladesh delegate made at the conference. "Bangladesh believes that this KP platform is very promising and around 190 countries have put confidence in this. Bangladesh believes and it is widely expected that at least 5% (below 1990 levels) overall emission reduction by Annex I Kyoto Parties as laid down in the Protocol during 1st commitment period (2008-2012) would be achieved. "At the same time, we have to continue to pursue our Non-Kyoto partners to join this international platform in order to respond collectively to the challenge of the greatest security threat to humankind at present." "Bangladesh strongly associates itself with the views expressed by Tuvalu, Grenada, Ethiopia on behalf of LDCs and other Country Parties in forming a contact group in this regard in order to allow more discussion on this important agenda item." The Dhaka delegate referred to the demand made by the alliance of small islands countries such as Tuvalu, Grenada that the temperature rise must not be allowed to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius by end of the century and that the emissions should be reduced to 350ppm. In another meeting, Bangladesh called for more balanced regional distribution of Clean Development Mechanism projects.
