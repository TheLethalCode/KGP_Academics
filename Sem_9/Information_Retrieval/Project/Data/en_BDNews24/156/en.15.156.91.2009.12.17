 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh celebrated Victory Day Wednesday, heralded by a 21 cannon salute that rang through the capital at dawn, while the president laid a wreath at the National Memorial in Savar to commemorate those who gave their lives for independence. On this day in 1971, the Pakistan army surrendered to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India at Ramna Racecourse Maidan in Dhaka, ending the painful nine-month war that saw a new nation emerge. The country celebrated its 38th Victory Day anew this year, after two years of muted celebrations under the immediate past emergency rule. The day brought renewed calls for quick trial of 1971 war criminals, 38 years after Bangladesh's Liberation War ended. The Awami League government, after year-long preparations, has said trials will begin in February. Sectors Commanders Forum convenor Lt Gen (retd) Harun-ur Rashid told bdnews24.com: "The nation expects that the issue will be settled during this government as it was among their electoral pledges." Mostafizur Rahman, an Old Dhaka trader, also a son of a freedom fighter, joined the celebrations at Dhaka University campus. He told bdnews24.com: "Trials must be held as soon as possible." Many groups marking the day, including the main cultural organiser of the day's festivities, Sammilito Sangskritik Jote, also demanded that the government start the trial of war criminals immediately. CELEBRATED WITH COLOUR Celebration programmes abounded on Wednesday, organised at state level and by numerous social and cultural organisations across the country. Sammilito Sanskritik Jote was holding the main programmes on Dhaka University campus and Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla Stadium where tens of thousands gathered to see performances of song, dance, synchronised marching, bands, films and book exhibitions. Many people volunteered to give blood in the traditional Victory Day blood donation drive. Two victory parades, with huge colourful floats, were brought out from the Central Shahid Minar at 10am and from the stadium at 4pm. Army, navy and air force bands were playing at the National Parliament premises, Farmgate and Mirpur stadium from 2-4pm. A combined performance by all-forces bands was also seen at Suhrawardy Udyan from 2-4pm. Naval ships, docked at Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chittagong, Khulna and Barisal, were open to public from 2pm to sunset. Awami League programmes, led by presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury in place of Sheikh Hasina who was in Denmark for the UN climate talks, included tributes at the National Memorial and at the portrait of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. The ruling party, which led the liberation struggle, was holding a victory rally from Suhrawardy Udyan at 3pm. The main opposition party BNP, led by its chairperson Khaleda Zia, paid tribute too at the National Memorial at dawn. Party leaders also visited Ziaur Rahman's grave and held out their victory rally from their Naya Paltan office at 3pm. Security was boosted in the capital and around the country to ensure public safety and trouble-free celebrations. Near about 10,000 police were on duty around the capital, 3,000 of them specially deployed for the occasion. THIS TIME LAST YEAR This time last year, the nation observed Victory Day on the last day of a near-two year emergency period under a caretaker government. The interim cabinet approved the Emergency Powers Repeal Ordinance-2008 on Dec 14, and under it the lifting of emergency rule that was imposed on Jan 11, 2007 amid political unrest following cancelled elections. The state of emergency was officially lifted from midnight on Dec 16, after 23 months of restrictions on civil and political activities
