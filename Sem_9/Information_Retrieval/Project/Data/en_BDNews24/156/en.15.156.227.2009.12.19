 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)--Some institutions are doing irregularities by giving education in English and Arabic medium, threatening the entire education system, the information minister has said. "We are moving forward with a dream to make Bangladesh a middle income country by 2021. A standard education system and discipline in education are needed for that," Abul Kalam Azad said on Friday. He was speaking at a discussion meeting on " Thoughts on education of Dr Muhammed Shahidullah' organised by Dhaka University Alumni Association at the university's Senate Bhaban. Dhaka University vice-chancellor professor AAMS Arefin Siddique also spoke at the discussion. Siddique said students are being affected through the wholesale English and Arabic medium education imparted by the institutions. In addition, he added, a gap is also emerging in the outlook of the students due to pursuance of various curricula. These streams of education are helping to commercialise education, he said and called for swift steps against such institutions. bdnews2
