 Dhaka, Dec 11 (bdnews24.com)-- Thick fog on Friday disrupted ferry operations like the past few days on the Paturia-Doulatdia and Mawa-Kawrakandi routes. Several ferries also remained stranded in the middle of the waterway, officials said. bdnews24.com's Madaripur correspondent said ferry crossing remained suspended on the Mawa-Kawrakandi route for around 10 hours. The Manikganj correspondent said no ferry ran on the Paturia-Doulatdia route for about five hours. Kawrakandi ferry terminal duty officer and Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) official Ruhul Amin told bdnews24.com ferry crossing resumed at 10 am after a halt since Thursday midnight. The 10-hour stoppage caused long tailbacks on the both Kawrakandi and Mawa roads, he said. The Chandpur correspondent quoting BIWTC's Chandpur officials said at least 20 Dhaka-bound ferries were halted in the middle of the river Meghna early on Friday. However, BIWTC Mawa terminal manager Md Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com's Munshiganj correspondent that ferry service resumed in the morning. BIWTC Aricha office manager (trade) Ashraf Ullah said ferry operations stopped at 1:30am on Friday as two ferries were stuck in the midst of the river due to thick fog. Crossings resumed again at 7am. Ferries are giving buses priority over other vehicles as long snarls piled developed on the routes, BIWTC officials said. Officials at the Met Office in Dhaka said foggy weather would continue for next two to three days along the river basins and over a vast swathe of land. They advised people not to embark on journeys in early mornings. Met officials also asked vehicle drivers and motor launch skippers to move carefully amid fog to avert accidents. bdnews2
