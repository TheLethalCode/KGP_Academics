 Dhaka, Dec 12 (bdnews24.com)The country's small and medium industries under knitwear sector will collapse if the prices of yarn do not come down, the BKMEA president warned Saturday. Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), said sharp rise in the yarn prices will badly hurt them as they will not be able to face the international market competition. "The price of a kilogram yarn increased by 80 cents to $2.25-$3.10 in last two-and-a-half-months. This means a 15 to 20 percent hike in the production cost," he said. Hoque was addressing a news conference in the capital to ahead of the "2nd worker festival" on December 18 in Narayanganj. "Yarn prices have increased by eight to 10 cents a kilogram in the international market due to the price hike of cotton. And our local yarn mills owners have hiked the yarn prices up to 80 cents. This is illogical." He said the yarn price hike has emerged as a new crisis in the knitwear sector, which has already been facing negative growth due to global recession for last several months. The industry, however, saw a positive growth in October. Hoque expects government intervention to bring the yarn prices at a reasonable level. 2nd worker festival The BKMEA president said the 2nd worker festival will be held at Osmani Stadium in Narayanganj "to enhance a friendly relationship between the knitwear industry workers and owners". The state minister for home, Shamsul Haque Tuku, is expected to inaugurate the day-long festival on December 18. The festival will highlight fashion show, traditional dance, song, drama performed by the workers. bdne
