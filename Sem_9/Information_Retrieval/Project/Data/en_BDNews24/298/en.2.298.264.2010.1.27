 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) -- The Bangladesh cricket team leaves for a short tour of New Zealand on Thursday night to play a one-off Test and three ODIs next month, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release. On Wednesday, the BCB announced a 15-member squad which included Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. The paceman, out of action since July, will only play in the one-dayers and Twenty20 match before returning home. Shakib Al Hasan will lead the side after Mashrafe requested not be considered for the captaincy. Mashrafe, who underwent knee surgery after the tour of West Indies last year, was forced to miss the home Tests against India and the tri-series, also featuring Sri Lanka. He was the officially named captain before the team departed for the West Indies but since the first Test of that tour, when he suffered the injury, Shakib has led the team in his absence. The squad contains no new faces. Former Indian Cricket League rebel Shahriar Nafees who failed to impress in the first Test against India in Chittagong, was overlooked and his place went to another ex-ICL rebel Aftab Ahmed. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak earned a recall at the expense of Enamul Haque Jr while paceman Nazmul Hossain was included after he recovered from a right quadriceps muscle injury which had ruled him out of the Idea Cup tri-series. Junaid Siddique, who replaced Nafees in the second Test against India in Mirpur, will join the team for the Test at Hamilton on Feb 15. The tour begins with a day-night Twenty20 International on Feb 3, followed by three limited-overs mataches on Feb 5, 8 and 11. Squad: Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (vice-capt/wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Mahmudullah, Aftab Ahmed, Naeem Islam, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Nazmul Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mo
