 Kishoreganj, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)Buses stopped plying the roads in Kishoreganj since Wednesday morning following a strike called by the bus owners association. The district transport owners association (DTOA) called the strike for an indefinite period protesting harassment by transport workers. No buses so far left for any destination from the three bus terminals in the district town, DOTA sources said. The strike has disrupted road communications in the district, causing sufferings to commuting people. They are now hiring tempos and three-wheelers to travel to nearby destinations, local people said. Transport workers allegedly roughed up Shahjahan Lashkar, the DTOA president, and other leaders on Tuesday afternoon over an altercation over overloading buses with passengers. The DTOA called an emergency meeting on Tuesday night and decided to call the strike. The association has demanded the arrest of the workers responsible for the untoward incident. The DTOA acting general secretary Khandaker AB Siddique (Inchhu Miah) filed a case with Kishoreganj Police Station against four transport workers in this reagrd. bdnew
