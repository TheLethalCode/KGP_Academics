<TITLE> Ban excessive: Ronaldo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo thinks his two-match suspension for Sunday's red card against Malaga is excessive and is confident the La Liga club's appeal will succeed. Ronaldo scored both goals in the 2-0 win at the Bernabeu but was shown a straight red card in the 70th minute after catching defender Patrick Mtiliga with a flailing arm and breaking his nose. The Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) said on Tuesday the Portugal forward had been suspended and fined 600 euros (521 pounds). If Real's attempts to get the ban reversed, reduced or postponed are unsuccessful he will miss Saturday's trip to Deportivo Coruna and the home game against Espanyol the following weekend.

"Of course, we would then ask for a postponement (of the ban)," he said. "If the player completes the suspension then it won't help us at all if (the CEDD) rules in our favour." Real presented evidence to the RFEF disciplinary committee which included video of an incident earlier this month involving Barcelona forward Lionel Messi trying to shake off a Sevilla opponent who was holding him back. Messi was awarded a free kick and Real claimed the incident supported their case for Ronaldo's card to be reversed. The committee ruled, however, that as the referee had not mentioned the Messi incident in his match report it was not relevant and, in any case, no injury had been ca
