<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)--Speaker Abdul Hamid has instructed MPs and ministers to use 'Sangsad Sadasya' (member of parliament) instead of 'Saangsad' which is used in India. He also requested media Tuesday to write Sangsad Sadasya in line with the constitution and the rules of procedure . "I draw attention that some of you address the MPs as Saangsad. But you should address them as Sangsad Sadasya according to the constitution and the rules of procedure," Hamid said in his ruling. The ruling came as finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith repeatedly used the Indian 'Saangsad' during the question-answer hour in parliament. "Saangsad is used in our neighbouring country India. The media also write Saangsad instead of Sangsad Sadasya. "We should not use Saangsad. I request media not to write Saangsad," said Hamid. This is at least the second time Hamid gave a ruling on calling MPs 'Sangsad Sadasya' in Bangla. But his ruling could not stop the use of the Indian term on the floor. "I draw your attention once again that you use Saangsad Sadsya in lieu of Saangsad," said the speaker.
