<TEXT>
 UNITED NATIONS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN chief Ban Ki-moon named Swedish diplomat Staffan de Mistura on Wednesday as his next special envoy in Afghanistan to help oversee a beefed up civilian presence to bring peace there. De Mistura, currently a senior official at the UN World Food Program in Rome and former UN special envoy to Iraq, will succeed Kai Eide of Norway and take up his appointment on March 1, Ban told reporters. Ban's announcement came on the eve of a 60-nation conference he will attend in London, which will seek to set a framework for eventually handing over security to Afghan forces. NATO powers are expected to back plans by Afghan President Hamid Karzai to reach out to Taliban insurgents. De Mistura, 63, is expected to play an important role supporting US President Barack Obama's new policy in Afghanistan, which includes more US and NATO troops to fight the Taliban and a "civilian surge." NATO on Tuesday named a senior British diplomat, Mark Sedwill, to be its civilian representative in Afghanistan, and the European Union is also expected to appoint a new envoy. The UN mission, known as UNAMA, oversees aid operations, advises on governance issues and has helped organize elections. Ban said de Mistura's appointment "will help UNAMA extend its role in coordinating the international civilian effort in Afghanistan." PERSONAL COST De Mistura had been tipped for weeks to be the new UN envoy, but briefly withdrew from the race last week, citing family reasons. Diplomats said Ban spoke with de Mistura over the weekend and the Swede told the secretary-general he had changed his mind and would accept the offer. Ban said de Mistura had taken on the job "at some personal cost to himself." De Mistura has worked in a variety of UN jobs for nearly 40 years. The Afghanistan post has generated controversy in recent years. In early 2008 Ban chose British politician Paddy Ashdown for the job, which was to be reconfigured to give him much more authority than previous UN envoys had enjoyed. But before Ban could confirm him in the post, Karzai vetoed Ashdown, possibly fearing he would be usurping some of the president's authority, UN diplomats said at the time. Ban then appointed Eide, who was later accused by his deputy, American Peter Galbraith, of playing down the extent of the fraud in Afghanistan's August 2009 presidential election. Eide denied the allegations and Ban fired Galbraith. On Wednesday Ban again defended Eide and his leadership of the UN mission. "His courage and dedication in a job that involves considerable personal risks has been admirable," the UN chief sa
