 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)A regional workshop Thursday stressed the need for expanding the scope of definition of trafficked persons in the SAARC convention. The workshop identified that the "SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution" did not include male as trafficked persons. "The participants proposed that the SAARC Convention on Trafficking be revised to make it an effective instrument for combating trafficking in persons in the region," said a press statement issued by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) which organised the workshop at hotel Sonargaon. "The participants agreed that the scope of the convention needs to be expanded to include trafficking of men and trafficking for other exploitative purposes, such as forced labour or labour trafficking," said the statement. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes attended the workshop as chief guest at the concluding session. The IOM also presented a research paper on trafficking in persons in Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives. "The secretary further reiterated his commitment to take forward some of the recommendations identified by the study as well as the meeting, during the preparation for the upcoming 16th SAARC Summit at Thimpu, Bhutan," said the statement. Rabab Fatima, the IOM's regional representative, highlighted the importance of maintaining the momentum generated at this regional meeting. "IOM calls for each of the participating countries to move forward the review process for an effective and timely implementation of the recommendations," said the statement. Participants from Afghanistan , Bangladesh , India , Maldives , Nepal and Pakistan attended the two-day meeting.
