 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam has said the fugitive killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be brought back home. "The convicts will not get respite from law. They will be brought back home," Ashraf told reporters on Thursday, hours after the execution of five captured Bangabandhu killers. Five convicted killers were executed at Dhaka Central Jail in the early hours of Thursday. Six other convicted killers in the case remain fugitive, taking shelter in different countries. Ruling Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury also pledged to bring the fugitive killers back. "We are hopeful of bringing them back home," she told reporters Thursday at the prime minister's official residence in Jamuna. Ashraf, who is also AL general secretary, blamed former president Ziaur Rahman for protecting the killers. "Ziaur Rahman did not only indemnify the killers he also rehabilitated them by awarding jobs in many foreign embassies." "Those who did not want the trial of Bangabandhu murder promulgated indemnity ordinance to keep the killers away from the purview of trial. "They are not happy today. But the nation is happy," he said. "Crimes are never erased. The criminals must be tried. "The executions of the five Bangabandhu killers have proved it that rule of law exists in the country. "The nation has got rid of certain of its stains through the judgment. "But it is not the end," Ashraf said. "We will hold trials of the Jail Killings (of four national leaders in 1975) and war criminals. After that the nation will get respite from stains," said Ashraf, the son of Syed Nazrul Islam, one of the four slain leaders. "We have to ensure so that nobody is exempted from the punishment after committing a crime," he said. The minister said there is no fear of sabotage. "Everything is going sound in the capital," he said adding those who try to create any panic would be thwarted strictly. Ashraf spoke to reporters after attending the concluding day of the CIRDAP ministerial level conference. b
