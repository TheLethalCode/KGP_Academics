 MOSCOW, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - He took office promising cautious reforms but almost halfway through his term, critics say Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's real agenda may be different -- to keep the Kremlin seat warm for a return by Vladimir Putin. Nearly two years after his election, analysts say there is scant evidence that Medvedev is implementing promises to open Russia's controlled political system, modernise its oil-fuelled economy, fight corruption and establish the rule of law. Local elections in October were dubbed Russia's dirtiest ever by opposition leaders. NGOs and business chiefs say corruption is as bad or worse. Kremlin-friendly regional bosses accused of unethical behaviour have been re-appointed. And abuses of police and court power are reported each day. "Medvedev has shown he doesn't want to reform," said Vladimir Ryzhkov, who served as the last independent deputy in the State Duma (Russian parliament) until changes to election law prevented him running again in 2007. "He keeps doing a few very small cosmetic things to pretend to reform but in fact there are no real reforms." Asked to list Medvedev's achievements since his March 2008 election, the Kremlin said it was preparing detailed information for the press to mark his two years in office in May this year but did not have such information available now. Medvedev's spokeswoman Natalya Timakova said the president would focus this year on more reforms to the political system, improving the investment climate, pacifying the troubled North Caucasus and agreeing a nuclear arms pact with Washington. State-run media has tried to boost the president's image -- an analysis by the Interfax news agency said references to Medvedev in Russian media last year outweighed those to Putin. But pollsters say rising prosperity and greater stability during Putin's 2000-2008 presidency has made him much more popular among ordinary people than Medvedev. This popularity continues now in Putin's role as prime minister. Russia's elite also respects Putin more. A typical example -- Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov referred to Putin several times in a Reuters interview last month, terming him a "very strong leader of world stature". He did not mention Medvedev. Hopes among Western powers that Medvedev would prove a more pliable and accommodating partner than Putin quickly evaporated, as Medvedev led Russia into a brief war with Georgia in 2008. Last year, Moscow raised hopes it would finally enter the World Trade Organisation, ink a nuclear arms reduction pact with the United States and agree to tough sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme -- only to disappoint on all three so far. In each case, officials say privately, Putin had the final say, not his formal superior Medvedev. This shows where power lies in Russia's ruling "tandem". Officials at the Kremlin and at the White House (Putin's prime ministerial offices) insist publicly that the "tandem" is a close and productive working relationship of two equals who respect each other's constitutional areas of competence. An example: Medvedev convened a meeting last week to discuss reforms to Russia's political system, so dominated by the Kremlin's United Russia bloc that critics compare it to the Soviet-era Communist Party. But Putin had the last word: "We should continually think about perfecting Russia's political system. But we must act...in this area with extreme caution," he said. "The political system must not wobble like runny jelly with every touch". "Putin's message was clear," said one senior diplomat. "There will be no serious political reform in Russia". Investors are also clear about where power lies. Asked how Russian markets would react to a Medvedev departure, one chief strategist replied at a Moscow bank replied: "Not a blip." When asked the same question about Putin, the answer was "mayhem". Nonetheless, the frequent differences in public tone between Putin and Medvedev have led some Russia-watchers to speculate about arguments between them, or even to suggest a power struggle might be taking place inside the elite. Promoters of Medvedev are especially keen on spreading that message to burnish his reformist credentials, diplomats say. In this version of events, Medvedev's lack of reform achievements is explained because he is moving cautiously so as not to upset Putin. Boosters of the president insist that at some unspecified future time Medvedev will move more boldly. But many close to the circles of power dismiss such talk. Opposition journalist Yulia Latynina has argued that it is impossible to have a struggle between a man who holds all the power (Putin) and a man who has none (Medvedev). Sceptics also argue that Medvedev, a consummate insider who has worked closely with Putin for 19 years, is highly unlikely to have a reform agenda which he has kept secret for so long from his boss -- a very well-informed former KGB spy. Many informed commentators believe that barring an upset such as a major financial crisis, Putin is likely to return in 2012 to the presidency, taking advantage of a constitutional reform extending the next Kremlin chief's term to six years _ the most significant political reform Medvedev has enacted. Re-election could take Putin, now 57, through to 2024 before he would be obliged by the constitution to leave office. Putin is more popular and more trusted than Medvedev, said Olga Kryshtanovskaya, an expert on the Russian elite and member of United Russia. "I'm just back from a trip to the provinces and everyone believes Putin will come back in 2012, that's the popular view. I share this view...Putin has more resources and more suppo
