<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Thursday he would hold a council of elders in what could be a first step towards bringing Taliban insurgents into a political settlement of the conflict. Karzai, speaking at a 60-nation conference in London, also called on Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to support peace efforts in Afghanistan. He urged Afghan insurgents to sever ties with al Qaeda, renounce violence and rejoin the political process. "We must reach out to all of our countrymen, especially our disenchanted brothers, who are not part of al Qaeda, or other terrorist networks, who accept the Afghan constitution." "We will establish a national council for peace and reconciliation and reintegration, followed by a peace jirga in Afghanistan," he said. Analysts say it is unclear whether Karzai would try to include the Taliban in a peace jirga, or if he would first seek Afghan political backing to bring them in at a later stage. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the conference as the war, originally launched to deny al Qaeda militants sanctuary after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, enters its ninth year. Public support in the United States, Britain and other nations in the NATO-led campaign is waning and casualties among foreign troops as well as Afghan civilians are rising. A flawed election, widespread corruption and questions about Karzai's performance have also fueled criticism of the mission. Karzai called on Saudi Arabia, which has hosted talks between Afghan government and Taliban representatives in the past, to help bring peace to Afghanistan. "We hope His Majesty (Saudi) King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz will kindly play a prominent role to guide and assist the peace process," he said. He also said that Afghanistan needed the support of its neighbours, particularly Pakistan, to secure peace. Washington says Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Muhammed Omar and other insurgent leaders are based in Pakistan -- a charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan, which along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were the only three countries to recognise the Taliban government before it was ousted in a U.S.-led invasion in 2001, is seen as well placed to mediate in any eventual peace talks. Washington is sending an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to break a stalemate in a war. Western governments are hoping this, combined with renewed commitment to development and new funds to win over Taliban fighters, will weaken the insurgency and allow them to start pulling out trooops in 2011. "By the middle of next year, we have to turn the tide in the fight against the insurgency," British leader Brown told the conference. WAR WEARY With public opinion wearying of war, attention is already turning to an eventual exit strategy which could involve a political settlement with the Taliban leadership -- although officials stress that this is not on the cards right now. "To those insurgents who refuse to acept the conditions for reintegration we have no choice but to pursue them militarily," Brown said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said on Wednesday any reconciliation with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was "probably a bridge too far" after he gave safe haven to al Qaeda to launch the Sept. 11 attacks. "He has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands," he told reporters in Washington. But Mark Sedwill, newly appointed NATO civilian representative in Afghanistan, suggested some hard choices would have to be made about whom to involve in talks. "If we are going to bring conflicts like Afghanistan, civil conflicts, to an end, that means some pretty unsavoury characters have to be brought within the system," he said. The Taliban have so far shown no willingness in public to enter talks, though some analysts say they too are tired of the fighting and realise they are no better placed than the United States and its allies to win power by military means alone. The war has intensified in the past year, with more than twice as many US troops being killed in 2009 than in 2
