<TITLE> Nadal limps out as Murray and Henin dream on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafa Nadal limped out of the Australian Open on Tuesday, his title defence shattered by a recurring knee problem and a devastating display by Andy Murray. Nadal quit when trailing Murray 6-3, 7-6, 3-0 but the match was already as good as over with the Scotsman deservedly on his way to the semi-finals after a breathtaking performance. It has been 74 years since a British man won a Grand Slam title but the wait could soon be over if Murray can maintain his brilliant form for two more matches. The 22-year-old has not dropped a set in Melbourne and will next face Croatia's Marin Cilic, who wore down seventh seed Andy Roddick 7-6, 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3 but is nearing exhaustion after spending more than 18 hours on court to get this far. Justine Henin's dream of winning the women's championship was also edging closer to reality. So too for Zheng Jie, the first Chinese to make the semis in Australia. Henin booked her place in the last four with a 7-6, 7-5 win over Russia's Nadia Petrova to set up a showdown with Zheng, who defeated Russia's Maria Kirilenko 6-1, 6-3. Nadal's sad exit was the latest sorry chapter for the Spanish second seed whose brilliant career has been blighted by knee injuries over the past year. It remains to be seen how serious this latest problem is but there will be doubts as to whether the 23-year-old can ever scale the same heights as he did 12 months ago when he held the Australian, French and Wimbledon titles and was ranked number one in the world. "I've known Rafa since I was 13 or 14 and he is somebody I have always looked up to," fifth seed Murray said courtside. "He is my favourite player to watch because of his energy and I am gutted for him." TORMENTED KIRILENKO Former world number one Henin is playing only her second tournament since coming out of an 18-month retirement and her victory was another triumph for her golden generation. But her next opponent represents the changing face of women's tennis. Zheng raised hopes of a first Chinese champion at any Grand Slam after she tormented Kirilenko with her powerful groundstrokes and speed around the court. It is not the first time Zheng has broken new ground for the world's most populous nation. Four years ago, she teamed up with Yan Zi to win the women's doubles in Australia. Then in 2008, she became the first Chinese to make the semi-finals at a Grand Slam when she reached the last four at Wimbledon after the All England Club gave her a wildcard. "I feel a bit calmer than the last time I made a semi-final," said Zheng. "Now, I feel like whoever makes the last four has a chance of winning it." Zheng is one of two Chinese left in the women's draw. Li Na also made the quarter-finals and plays Venus Williams on Wednesday, raising the once unthinkable possibility of an all-Chinese final. Beating Kirilenko is one thing, defeating Henin is another. The Belgian has already won seven Grand Slam titles and while she may be in the early stages of a comeback, she is still just 27. Henin was partly inspired to return to the tour while watching fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters win last year's US Open shortly after her return. Henin needed a wildcard for Melbourne but never gave any serious thought to winning the championship, until now. "I was curious about what was going to happen," she said. "I knew it was going to be hard. Every match was a goal. "I never thought, I'll be in the semis. "Now I can dream of being in the final of this Grand Slam, of course, but it's still a long way. "I just have to try to be focused on what I have to do on the court and hope it's gonna keep going this way." Cilic became the first Croatian to reach the semi-finals at Melbourne Park when he somehow summoned up the energy to fight off American Roddick's comeback from two sets down. Cilic has ben pushed to five sets in three of his last four matches, including his fourth-round win over US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, and now faces the daunting prospect of playing Murray. "If I play like I did tonight I have got a good chance," Murray said. "The nerves are going to be there because it is the chance to make the final of a Grand Slam but I lost to him at the US Open (last year) so I will be looking for reve
