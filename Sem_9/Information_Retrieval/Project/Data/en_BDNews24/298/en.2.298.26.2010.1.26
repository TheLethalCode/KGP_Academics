 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court resumed on Tuesday hearing on two petitions seeking a stay order on a 2005 High Court judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment to the constitution illegal. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, began hearing the petitions filed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan, seeking a stay on the High Court judgment. At the previous day's hearing on Thursday, Delwar's counsel TH Khan argued that the High Court had no authority to revoke any law regarding the repeal of the Fifth Amendment to the constitution. Khan said: "It is only parliament that can revoke a law." The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Marshal Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The original petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalised all the regimes between 1975 and 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power -- military or otherwise -- after the assassination of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. In 2005, an alliance government led by BNP, which was floated with the backing of General Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court stayed the High Court ruling. But the current Awami League-led government petitioned the High Court and was permitted to withdraw the leave to appeal earlier this month, allowing the stay also to be lifted and the judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal to stand. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had told the media that with the withdrawal of the leaves to appeal and vacation of the existing stay order, the High Court ruling was upheld, for now, despite the two pending petitions.
