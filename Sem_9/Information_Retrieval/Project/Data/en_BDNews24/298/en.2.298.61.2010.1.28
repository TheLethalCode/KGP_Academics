 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) --- A Bangladeshi born Australian citizen was captured by Special Branch police from a bus at Jatrabari as he was returning to Dhaka from Cox's Bazar after reports of his 'kidnap'. Police held Abdullahil Kafi Chowdhury from a Greenline Paribahan bus, on the outskirts of the capital, on Wednesday after he had been 'missing' from Dhaka since January 23. Police now believe that Kafi, who is in his 20s and a graduate of Queenparks University in Australia, staged the kidnapping drama to avoid repaying loans he had taken from an Australian bank. Kafi's family had claimed that some unknown people took him to Cox's Bazar after kidnapping him from the capital. Deputy commissioner of Dhaka SB police Moinul Hasan said Kafi's wife Shamima Chowdhury had filed a case with Gulshan police on January 25 related to the kidnapping of her husband and an alleged ransom claim of $100,000 Kafi's family members said he had been kidnapped on Saturday afternoon when he went to visit his friend Harunur Rashid at Uttara. An SB police team interrogated his friend Harunur Rashid on Tuesday after tracking him down in Chittagong. On interrogation, Harun confessed that Kafi was not kidnapped but went to Chittagong after disappearing from Dhaka. Kafi stayed in Chittagong on Tuesday and visited Cox's Bazar later, he said. In line with Harun's statement, police searched a Greenline Paribahan bus at Jatrabari and held Kafi from the bus at 7am. Police said Kafi had switched off two of his three mobile sets and informed his family of the "kidnapping" story through the other active mobile phone. He sent e-mail to his wife and family opening e-mail address 'Operation Kafi' through the mobile phone. Australian mission in Dhaka was informed of the matter. Police said Kafi had staged the kidnapping drama to avoid repaying bank loans he had taken from ANZ Bank of Australia. Police at a press conference at SB office on Wednesday produced Kafi before the reporters. His wife and relatives raised an uproar at the press conference claiming that police were staging a drama to harass him. Kafi claimed that he was supposed to fly to Australia on January 24 but he decided to stay at his friend's Uttara house on the night of January 23 to avoid the transportation problem caused by Biswa ijtema. He further claimed that the driver of the CNG auto-rickshaw he was riding made him unconscious by throwing something on his face. "Then I do not know where they took me They left me at Cox's Bazar after giving me some money," he said He said the kidnappers did not torture him. In reply to a question as to why the kidnappers set him free, he said, "They freed me on hearing that RAB and police have launched a drive to rescue me." Asked why he had not informed local police or his family, he said, "I was flabbergasted and could not decide anything." Kafi however admitted that he had borrowed money from an Australian bank, adding that it is a common practice there. Assistant deputy commissioner of Police Nazrul Islam Mollah, who led the rescue operation said, expensive laptop, mobile phone and cash money were retrieved from his possession. If he had been kidnapped, the kidnappers would rob him of his belongings, he said. Kafi had gone to Australia after passing HSC examinations from Residential School and College nine years ago. b
