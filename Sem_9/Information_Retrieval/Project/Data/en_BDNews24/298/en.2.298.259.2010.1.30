<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Students of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University at Agargaon in Dhaka vandalised 62 cars on Friday after they clashed with the police over entry to Dhaka International Trade Fair. The university's proctor, students and policemen were among at least 50 injured injured. The police said they had to use rubber bullets and tear gas shells to bring the situation under control when violence broke out in the evening. The prolonged violence caused severe miseries for the visitors of the trade fair being held at Agargaon adjacent to the university campus when some students hurled stones at the fair grounds. It caused widespread panic and the fair venue was deserted at the weekend when there is generally a far higher number of visitors than on weekdays. But students and police gave different accounts of how the events came to such a head. A witness, also a student of that university, told bdnews24.com that some students of the university tried to get in showing their identity cards. But when they were denied entry, the students picked up an argument with the policemen. "The altercation led to a fistfight and more students came by when they heard the news." That was apparently when the clash broke out. The university's assistant proctor, Arifeen Ali, told bdnews24.com that there was a little scuffle between the police and the students and the police detained some of the students. "But they were released later." However, rumours spread among the students that the students had been detained, which prompted the students to vandalise one or two cars, said Ali. "That was when the students and police had the skirmish and chased each others." Ali said he had gone to the spot along with the proctor to calm the students down. But the proctor was severely beaten even after he told the police about his identity. "They beat me too," said the assistant proctor. The proctor is currently under treatment in the city's orthopaedic hosptial. He said the students were currently inside the campus and the police had taken up position just outside. The student witness, wishing to remain anonymous, said after a few turns of the police and the student chasing one another, the police fired 25/30 rounds of rubber bullets and 10/12 rounds of tear gas shells. The deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police of Tejgaon, Chowdhury Lutful Kabir, however, had a different story. He told bdnews24.com that when two students wanted to take away a jacket for free, tension flared. Soon afterwards, a few young women near the fair's gates were teased by these students, he said. "The police then detained them." This triggered ripples of anger among the students who came out on to the streets and started vandalising cars. "We have reports of 62 cars being damaged. They also torched a motorbike." He said the police were compelled to open fire at around 10.00pm. "We fired a few rounds of rubber bullet and 10/12 rounds of tear gas shells." The police have detained two students and some 10 policemen have been injured with stones. They had laid siege to the university and surrounded it completely while the students were still milling about inside the campus until 11.30pm. The students had entered into another clash with the elite crime fighting force RAB only a few days ago. bd
