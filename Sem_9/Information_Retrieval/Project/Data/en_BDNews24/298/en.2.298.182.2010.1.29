 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission plans to complete polls to Dhaka and Chittagong city corporations and union councils within a year unless a writ petition over Dhaka's ward demarcation lingers on. Talking to reporters after attending a reunion of Dhaka University's history department alumni on Friday, the chief election commissioner, ATM Shamsul Huda said the commission wants to hold city corporation polls in Dhaka in May unless the High Court decided otherwise. He said elections to union councils would begin in May and CCC polls at a suitable time within a year. The election commission chief said the fate of DCC polls however depend on the court's decision following a writ petition seeking fresh delimitation of wards. Upon a petition by Shamim Molla, a resident of Khilkhet, the High Court on Jan 25 issued ordered the government and the election chief to explain within four weeks why they should not demarcate the DCC wards based on the latest population census. Huda said the commission wants to demarcate Dhaka's wards after the elections if the court allows. "Delimitation is a complicated task. It cannot be completed in less than six months. Once we start the work, it will get into a long process. Ensuring citizens' franchise is more important than demarcation," he said. The CEC said the commission would try to convince the court. Referring to Dhaka University's exclusion from the world's top 100-university list, Huda said the country's largest public educational institution should be reformed. Citing his experiences in the commission, he said: "No one wants to accept reforms initially. But they become acceptable in the course of time." He said Dhaka University needed to ensure a congenial atmosphere for scholastic pursuit and formulate a time-befitting curricula. The prime minister's adviser Gowher Rizvi, former advisers to caretaker government Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury and Akbar Ali Khan, and lawmaker Suranjit Sengupta, among others, attended the reunion. bd
