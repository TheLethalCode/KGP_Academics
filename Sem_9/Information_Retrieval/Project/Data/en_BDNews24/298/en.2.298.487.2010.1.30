 BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China warned on Saturday that Washington's announcement of arms sales to Taiwan would badly hurt ties between the two global powers, widening rifts in their far-reaching relationship. The swift and sharp protest came from Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said his government was "strongly indignant" about the proposed US sale of weapons to Taiwan, which China considers an illegitimate breakaway province. The Obama administration told the US Congress on Friday of the proposed sales to Taiwan, a potential $6.4 billion (3.96 billion pounds) package including Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot "Advanced Capability-3" anti-missile missiles, and two refurbished Osprey-class mine-hunting ships. Beijing responded with He's warning delivered to the US ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, that the arms deal could jeopardise bonds with Washington, which has looked to China for help in surmounting the financial crisis, dealing with Iran and North Korea, and fighting climate change. The US arms sales to Taiwan have joined trade imbalances, currency disputes, human rights, the Internet, and Tibet among rifts dividing the world's biggest and third-biggest economies. Washington and Beijing have also recently traded angry words about Internet policy after the search engine giant Google Inc earlier this month threatened to shut its Chinese google.cn portal and pull out of China, citing censorship problems and hacking attacks. In coming months Obama may meet the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader China calls a dangerous separatist, adding to Beijing's ire with Washington. Vice Minister He did not spell out what reprisals Beijing may mete out against Washington over the weapons sales. But he hinted the anger would be felt in a number of areas. "The United States' announcement of the planned weapons sales to Taiwan will have a seriously negative impact on many important areas of exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," said He in the remarks, published on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website (www.mfa.gov.cn). He said the arms sales were "crude interference in China's domestic affairs and seriously harm China's national security," using words notably tougher than Beijing's recent statements on the issue. "This will lead to repercussions that neither side wishes to see," said He. He urged the US to halt the planned sales. REPERCUSSIONS China could soon retaliate by curtailing military ties with the United States, but its other options are less clear. The biggest holder of U.S. treasury debt, Beijing has shown no signs it would use that leverage in retaliation, damaging the value of its own vast dollar holdings. "Let's watch and see what they do, not what they say, because sometimes tough words in China are a substitute for tough action," said Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who was formerly a US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State responsible for China and Taiwan. China could withhold potential cooperation on pressuring Iran over its nuclear activities, said Shirk. "They try to treat the (US) arms sales as another form of proliferation," she said. China curbed contacts with US defence officials in 2008 after the then US President George W. Bush flagged the arms package for Taiwan. After Washington cleared an earlier sale of Patriot missiles, China tested emerging military technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air. "After the Obama administration stressed good relations with China last year, this will damage trust between the leaders of the two countries," said Liu Jiangyong, an international relations professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University. "I think the price the United States pays will be heavier than the US may have anticipated," added Liu, who has advised leaders on foreign policy. TAIWAN WELCOMES DEAL Taiwan's Defence Ministry welcomed Washington's decision. "Its sales of arms to Taiwan gives us greater confidence in pushing for an amicable outcome in our relations with China, and will help promote peace in the Taiwan Strait." Under President Ma Ying-jeou, since 2008 Taiwan has sought to ease tensions with the mainland and expand economic ties. But Taiwan also worries that China could develop an overwhelming military advantage. Taiwan has been ruled separately since 1949, when Nationalist forces fled to the island, escaping victorious Communist forces. Since then, Beijing has demanded Taiwan accept unification, threatening it could resort to force. Washington, under a 1979 act of Congress, is legally obliged to help Taiwan defend itself. It says the island and Beijing should peacefully settle the disputes that have put them on the brink of war at times over the past 60 years. Taiwan says China aims 1,000 to 1,500 short-range and mid-range missiles at the island, 160 kilometres (miles) from China at its nearest point. Island officials have also asked the United States for F-16 fighter jets. U.S. officials have said Taiwan, which lags China in the balance of military power, needs updated weapons to give it more sway when negotiating with Beiji
