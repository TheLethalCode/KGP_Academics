<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The University Grants Commission has placed 31 observations and recommendations to the government for further development and effectiveness of the commission. UGC highlighted the issues, including one to change its name, in its 35th annual report. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid placed the report for 2008 in parliament on Monday. The number of public and private universities in the country had increased significantly since the country achieved its independence 37 years ago. Thus the responsibilities of the commission have also increased, the report stated. So, it is necessary to bring some amendments to the existing act to make the commission more effective, modern and stronger. The commission, following other SAARC countries, suggested two names 'Higher Education Commission' or 'Universities Commission of Bangladesh'. Regarding students' politics in the institutions, it said politics can be encouraged to improve intellectual practices and serve the interests of students and teachers. The commission also observed that everyone along with the university authorities, regardless of party identity and philosophy, should come forward to address the long-standing session-jam problems. bdn
