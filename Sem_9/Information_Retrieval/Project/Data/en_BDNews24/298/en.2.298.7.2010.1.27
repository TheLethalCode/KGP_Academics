<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  National flag carrier Biman is considering introduction of new routes and resumption of old routes with its recently strengthened fleet. Muhammad Zakiul Islam, chief executive of the Biman Bangladesh Airlines, on Wednesday told bdnews24.com that the airline was hoping to resume flights to Delhi, Bangkok and Mumbai by the start of next month. "Besides, we have plans to initiate flights to Tripoli, Colombo and Guangzhou." Islam said the long routes like Dhaka-London will be operated by the two Boeing 770-200 ER, one of which Biman has already received. Another one is expected by March. The regional routes from Bangladesh, however, will be operated by a Boeing 737-800. An Airbus A310 is also expected to be included to Biman's existing fleet by March. Islam said all four aircraft were being leased out on a temporary basis till Biman gets its own aircrafts. "The Dhaka-New York flights will hopefully resume within March,' said Islam. Biman had suspended these flights in July 2006. Currently Biman connects to 16 international and 3 domestic destinations with its fleet of four DC-10s, two Airbus-320s and two F-28s and two rented Boeing 747s. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will commission these two aircrafts into Biman's fleet on Thursday. In 2008, Biman signed a deal with Boeing for four 777-300 ERs, four 787-8s and two 737-800s at a cost of $2.5 billion. bd
