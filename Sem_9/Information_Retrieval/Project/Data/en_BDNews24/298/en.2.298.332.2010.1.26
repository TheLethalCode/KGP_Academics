<TITLE> Hazaribagh tanneries must make shift 'unconditionally', says Dilip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Hazaribagh tanneries must start shifting to a new industrial estate near Savar while construction of a Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) there is ongoing, industries minister Dilip Barua has said. Tannery owners have been demanding completion of the CETP as a precondition to start the massive relocation. But, Barua said on Tuesday, the tanners should agree to 'unconditional' shifting of the highly polluting industry, which is currently located along the Buriganga river at Muhammadpur, to the outskirts of the city. The minister was addressing a views exchange meeting with tannery industry leaders, officials of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) and local government officials at the Savar estate office on the outskirts of the capital. Abdul Hye, general secretary of Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA), reiterated previous demands, which he said were mandatory to shift the industry. "We'll be leaving the 50 years of history behind at Hazaribagh." "The sector will be destroyed if realistic measures are not taken," he added. Rezaul Karim Ansari, president of Bangladesh Finished Leather Goods Association, said, "We don't want to pollute the environment." "But we need some Tk 4,500-5,000 crore to complete relocation of our industry." The tannery leaders again asked for the government's intervention in directing banks to continue existing liabilities on the new estate. The minister pledged to assist in this area. Both the tannery leaders, however, expressed their frustration at the delay in installing the CETP at the Savar estate, which was originally supposed to be set up with foreign aid or by the government, according to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2003. However, the government in 2009 decided that the plot owners would pay the money in instalments. Ansari said, "Unless the High Court extends its order, losses will rise to crores of taka." The High Court on June 23 last year ordered all tanneries in Hazaribagh to quit the area by Feb 28, 2010. It also made installation of ETPs mandatory for all industries, including the tanneries, by June 2010, following a petition by environmental and human rights groups. 9;TO EXTEND HC DEADLINE' State minister for law Quamrul Islam, who also attended the meeting, reiterated the government's position saying, "The tanneries must go to the new site." But, he also added: "The CETP must be installed. It is unfair that it is not yet set up." The junior minister also told the tanners that he would help in extending the HC deadline for relocation if possible. Although the tanners sought compensation from the government, Barua and Quamrul avoided the issue. AKM Rahamatullah, MP from Dhaka-10 constituency and a tannery owner, said he hoped an inter-ministerial meeting with the banks could resolve mortgage problems. Manzur Elahi, a leading tanner and former adviser to the caretaker government, said installation of the CETP is a must to comply with the requirements of leather and leather goods importers. Necessary infrastructures, including utilities, roads, power and gas, have already been ensured at the 200-acre site. The industrial estate, initiated in January 2003, was scheduled to be completed by December 2005. The completion deadline was later extended to June 2010. bdn
