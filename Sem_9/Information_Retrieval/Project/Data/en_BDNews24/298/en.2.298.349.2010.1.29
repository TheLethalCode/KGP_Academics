 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Rehana, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and sister of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, arrived in Dhaka on Friday morning, a day after execution of five former army officers for her father's assassination in 1975. Immigration officials at Zia International Airport told bdnews24.com that she reached Dhaka at 10:45am flying from London. From the airport she went to the prime minister's official residence. The two sisters, who survived the August 15 1975 carnage as they were abroad, will place wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujib at Dhanmondi at around 2 pm. Rehana decided to come to the country immediately after execution of five of the 12 convicts in the Mujib murder case. Hasina and Rahana also lost their mother and three brothers in the August 15 killings, when a group of junior army officers invaded their residence just only three and a half years after the country earned independence through an armed struggle under Sheikh Mujib's leadership. bd
