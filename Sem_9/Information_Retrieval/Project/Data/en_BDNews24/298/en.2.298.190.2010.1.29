<TEXT>
 Mymensingh, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)--The government will set up 1,500 new schools by 2011, said education minister Nurul Islam Nahid on Friday. "We have initiated to bring all children to school by 2011," Nahid said at the opening ceremony of Mymensingh Government Anandamohon School to mark its 100th founding anniversary. Realistic steps will be taken to make Anandamohon College a university, he said. "But, it will take time." A government decision and a parliament approval will also be required, Nahid told the ceremony. "The new generation must be educated with modern education to implement Vision-2021 and build a truly digital Bangladesh." Speaking on his government's initiative to implement an education policy, which has not been possible for 38 years, he said, "Along with asking for peoples' opinion, we are formulating an education policy, awaiting finalisation." "It will not be a party education policy. Rather it will be a national education policy." State minister for health Mujibur Rahman Fakir, local MPs KA Khalid Babu and Mostaq Ahmed Ruhi, among others, were present. bdnews24.c
