 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has urged the international community to take genuine steps towards a world free of nuclear weapons, expressing concern at the spiralling expenditure on arms by powerful countries. Dipu Moni made the call Tuesday addressing the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, of which Bangladesh assumed the presidency this month. The foreign minister referred to "the positive environment prevailing at the global level" and urged the member states "to seize this opportunity to establish a world free from the scourge of nuclear weapons," said a statement by the foreign ministry. "She also expressed concern at the ever-increasing spending on armament and called upon the major arms producing and arms procuring countries to halt this mindless expenditure," said the statement. The foreign minister mentioned that global arms expenditure had reached US$ 1.46 trillion in 2009 and emphasised the urgency of freeing these resources for development to help achieve the UN's Millennium Development Goals. Dipu Moni reiterated Bangladesh's constitutional commitment to general and complete disarmament.
