<TEXT>
 Brahmanbaria, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com) A conference of Brahmanbaria district BNP could not be held on Tuesday as the authorities imposed a Section 144 ban on public meetings as two rival groups of the party caused tensions. The conference was scheduled to begin at 10am at the local municipal auditorium while a rival faction of BNP convened a separate meeting at the same time at the Abdul Kuddus Makhon open-air podium situated beside the auditorium. Additional deputy commissioner Abdul Wadud told reporters, "In the view of the prevailing tension, the administration imposed a Section 144 in the town from 6am to midnight." Sadar police chief Hamidul Islam said additional police forces were deployed the two meeting venues and in the town to thwart any clashes. Tension gripped the town during the past few days as a result of internal feuding over the BNP district convention. Two days back, there was a bomb attack on the house of district BNP convenor and former state minister Harun Al Rashid, for which Harun held the rival group responsible. Supporters of Harun's opponent Ruhul Al Mahbub gathered under the banner of 'Grassroots BNP' and alleged at a press conference on Monday night that 'anarchist' Harun was trying to form the local committees arbitrarily. bdnew
