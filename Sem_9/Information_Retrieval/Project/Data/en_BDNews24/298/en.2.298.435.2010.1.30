Hasina, who heads the ruling party, was speaking at the party's extended meeting on Saturday. She launched the party's recruitment drive by filling out the membership renewal form at the first session of the meeting. The party president said the coalition government cannot succeed without a strong party. "There are some people who become permanent members of the government party. They change colours with the change of government. "Awami League does not need these people," Hasina said. She expressed satisfaction at the executions of the five captured killers of her father and independece hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She said that the absconding killers will also be brought to justice. "Wherever the killers stay they will be put on trial. The world is small, where will they escape to?" Hasina also pledged to hold trials for the killing of the four national leaders, Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack and 1971 war 'criminals'. "I will not allow any crime in Bangladesh," she said. The chief asked her party activists to go out to people and dispel the propaganda of the opposition and draft in more women members. The meeting began at the Gano Bhaban premises at around 11am, taking aim at fresh leadership in the grassroots-level district and upazila committees like the central committee. The national and party flags were hoisted with the playing of national anthem during the time. General secretary Syed Ashraful Islam hoisted the party flag. This is the first extended meeting after formation of the new central working committee. Some 10,000 leaders and workers, including presidents and general secretaries of the party across the country, are attending the meeting. The last extended meeting was held in May 2008. bd
