 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) --Tanjim Ahmed, popularly known as Sohel Taj who resigned as state minister for home affairs amid rumours of a rift with home minister Sahara Khatun last year, flew back on Wednesday morning after a seven-month stay in the United States. He drove straight to his sister's Banani home to see his ailing mother from Zia International Airport. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and people from his Gazipur constituency were at the airport to greet Tanjim, son of the country's first prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed. Abu Noor Bazlur Rahman, joint secretary to the home ministry, told bdnews24.com: "We have not received any order from the top level that he is no more a state minister. "That's why he has been given the protocol of state minister without portfolio," Rahman said. But the witnesses said Tanjim exchanged greetings with the government officials and then got in his sister's car. The bodyguards wanted to go with him but he refused them. ZIA police chief Shamsuddin Saleh Ahmed told bdnews24.com they had escorted Tanjim to Banani. Tanjim did not talk to the media. There was wide speculation in June last year that Tanjim would resign due to conflicts with his home minister Sahara Khatun. He left for the USA on June 9 to spend time with his family. But he did not return. A Washington-based news agency, quoting Tanjim, said that he had submitted his resignation before leaving Bangladesh. Tanjim had reportedly refused to disclose any reason for the resignation, other than "personal". Sahara as late as July 21 had denied knowledge of his resignation, saying she only knew "he was on leave." Shamsul Haq Tuku was made state minister for home later. On Sept 10, Tanjim still abroad was included in the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs. Tanjim's personal assistant Abu Kawser told bdnews24.com he landed at Zia International Airport by a Qatar Airways flight at around 10:30am. He said Tanjim had gone to his sister Simin Hossain Rimin's house. His mother Zohra Tajuddin, also a presidium member of ruling Awami League, was also there. bdnews24
