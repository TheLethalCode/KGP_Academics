 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Tamim Iqbal was unhappy that he couldn't remain unbeaten after playing the innings of his life on the third day of the second Test against India on Tuesday. "It was a good wicket to bat on and I wanted to bat throughout the day," the opening batsman said after scoring 151 to help Bangladesh reach 228-3 at stumps. "The end did not happen the way I wanted. If I could stay unbeaten, it would have been good for the team and I had a chance to get a double century." He believed the batsmen to come were capable enough to turn the match around provided they concentrated. All that was needed was for one player to make a big score and another hit fifty-plus. "Players like Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim are rated as the best Test cricketers in Bangladesh. Shakib (Al Hasan) is a class act and let's not forget Ashraful and Raqibul they too have quality to put together a good innings. So, I think they will prove themselves against India in the second innings." Understandably Tamim rated his knock as being very satisfying. "They bowled a good line and length to me. But as I always said I enjoy scoring runs against India. This innings is so far my best. I'm sure many more will come. My focus is to play as long as possible. I think this is the way to play Test cricket." Indian coach Gary Kirsten thought Bangladesh really played well under the circumstances. "They played very well today (Tuesday). We know it's a very good wicket to bat on at the moment. We thought it would take more turn but it has not done that much. So it's good performance. "They played well under pressure. We got a 300-plus-run lead and wanted to get wickets as quickly as possible. Maybe we were a little bit impatient. And we did not bowl as well as we could. I'm very happy with the two wickets at the end. Zaheer is a great exponent of the reverse swing. The ball is reverse swinging at the moment. Hopefully we can make some early in-roads tomorrow." Kirsten also saluted Tamim's knock. "He is a very aggressive player who plays in the Sehwag mode. But we are also pleased to get him out at the end of the day. It was very important for us. It was a good knock
