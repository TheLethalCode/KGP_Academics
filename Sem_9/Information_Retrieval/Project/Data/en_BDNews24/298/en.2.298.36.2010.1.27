 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)The executions of five former army officers, sentenced to death for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, will be carried out by Jan 31, law minister Shafique Ahmed has said. He made the announcement on Wednesday after a meeting with the inspector general of prisons, following the Supreme Court's dismissal of the condemned men's petitions for review of the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers. Death warrants were issued against Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan on Jan 3. According to law, the death penalties must be executed between 21-28 days following issue of the warrants. However, a death convict has the right to petition for a review of the final judgment in his case during this time, and to seek presidential clemency as a last resort. All five death-row convicts submitted separate review petitions in this case, while clemency pleas of three have been rejected by the president. The Supreme Court dismissed the review petitions earlier in the day. Crowds had gathered amid heightened security measures at the court premises as the ruling was due. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, convened at around 9.25am. The bench gave its ruling within minutes. "This court dismisses the petitions for review," Islam said. The court ruled that the defence had failed to present new grounds for review of the Appellate Division judgment that upheld the death sentences. Wednesday's ruling came after three days of simultaneous hearings on the five petitions. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said the ruling resolved the trial of the most heinous act of murder in the nation's history. "Our fight for establishing rule of law and a fair trial has come to an end today," Haque told reporters in his reaction after the ruling. "We wanted the trial not to be vindictive, we wanted it for the establishment of rule of law," he said
