 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has said the state should have measures in place to prevent future imposition of martial law and military rule. A full bench of the court made the observation on Tuesday during proceedings on petitions against the repeal of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, was hearing the petitions filed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan, seeking a stay on a 2005 High Court judgment that declared the amendment illegal. Barrister Moudud Ahmed, lawyer for Delwar, said in the hearing: "None of us support military rule. But when it prevails, what can we do." The court asked him: "Should we then accept military rule?" Ahmed replied: "It does not come with prior warnings." The court said: "Measures should be taken so that military rule cannot be imposed again in Bangladesh in future." The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The original petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalised all the regimes between 1975 and 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  after the assassination of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. The High Court in its ruling to revoke the amendment exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government between Aug 15 1975 right up to the 1991 national elections were unconstitutional. Moudud Ahmed during Tuesday's hearing argued that the Fifth Amendment would not have been needed if the Fourth Amendment was not passed. The Fourth Amendment gave Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League validity, banning all other political parties, in effect bringing about one party rule. Moudud argued: "If the Fifth Amendment was not passed, fundamental rights, freedom of the judiciary and the newspaper would not exist in the country. "The nation would never have got rid of the stain of the Fourth Amendment," he said. "The Fifth Amendment was given validity in parliament. The court has no authority to give direction on it or revoke it." The court said: "Parliament gave validity to it for dishonest purposes." Ahmed replied: "Parliament never formulates any law for any unfair purpose." During the previous hearing, on Jan 21, TH Khan, another lawyer for Delwar, also argued that the High Court had no authority to revoke any law of the country. The court adjourned proceedings until Wednesday. b
