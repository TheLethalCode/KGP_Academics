 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday ordered the body of college teacher Chandan Kumar Chakravarty, which two women of two religions have claimed as his widows, to be donated to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for research. Dhaka additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Hakim Ali gave the order on the claims of the two wives, Tithi Chakravarty who is Hindu and Aklima Akhter Poly who is Muslim, as he found it tough to decide by which religion the deceased should be buried. "It is better to donate the body to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for the public good because it is tough to identify which religion Chandan, in fact, belonged to based upon the scrutiny of papers presented by his two wives," the magistrate said, giving his ruling. Mohammad Sultan Salauddin, lawyer for Chandan's first wife Tithi Chakravarty, said they are not happy with the order and so will appeal. Abu Abdullah Bhuiyan, lawyer for second wife Aklima Akter, who claims Chandan converted from his original Hindu faith to Islam when they were married, also said they are satisfied with the court's decision. Chandan, a 45 year old teacher of Khilgaon Ideal City College and resident of nearby Chowdhurypara, was stabbed to death on Dec 25 in the locality. His body has been lying at the DMCH morgue since then, as the two wives battled in court for the right to bury Chandan according to their respective religion. b
