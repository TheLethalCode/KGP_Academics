 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said climate change will not only disrupt the lives of millions of people on Asia and the Pacific region, but also harm the national and regional stability. Terming natural disasters and shortage of fuel large barriers to development of the region, she said: "Global warming has put us all at serious risk." The prime minister was speaking at the inaugural session of the CIRDAP second ministerial meeting on 'Rural development in Asia and the Pacific' at Dhaka Sheraton hotel on Wednesday. Representatives from 14 member states of the Centre on Integrated Rural Development in Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP) and a few non-member countries are taking part in the meeting, being held 23 years after the first one in 1987. Hasina said urbanisation process is intensifying and pressure on fuel mounting because of the influence of globalisation. She urged the leaders of the region to look at the problems, resulting from climate change and globalisation, and said: "Otherwise, rural development and poverty eradication programmes will not bring any sustainable result." The prime minister said an increasing number of natural disasters and the current economic meltdown have put food security of the poor people at stake. "We have to use our wisdom maintaining our united stance to find out practical solutions to the common problems," she told the ministers. The prime minister emphasised boosting investment and exports to offset the negatives of globalisation and said: "We have to identify new challenges and potentials of globalisation from regional perspective." She mentioned that threats of climate change on low-lying countries have already been identified. Hasina listed her government's poverty reduction measures, including formulation of a poverty reduction strategy paper, expansion of social safety net, increase in agriculture subsidy, and measures to ensure uninterrupted power supply for irrigation. She said the government is going to implement the 'one-house one-farm' programme from this year. CIRDAP chairperson and local government and rural development minister Syed Ashraful Islam, state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanok, rural development and cooperatives division secretary Rokeya Sultana, and CIRDAP director general Durga P Paudyal also spoke on the occasion. b
