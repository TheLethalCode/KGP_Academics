 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Syed Faruk Rahman and Bazlul Huda were buried at their village homes on Thursday morning after their execution in Dhaka for the 1975 killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed review petitions of the five detained convicts in the Mujib murder case, their last legal scope for deferral of the death sentences. The five, two others being AKM Mohiuddin and Mohiuddin Ahmed, were executed in the early hours of Thursday at Dhaka Central Jail. The bodies of the five former officers in five ambulances, escorted by RAB and police, headed for their home villages following the executions by hanging. Shahriar Rashid's body reached Gopinathpur village in Kasba upazila, Brahmanbaria, at around 6:30am; he was buried half an hour later. He was laid to rest beside his mother's grave according to his last wish.
