 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)Director of Dhaka Medical College Hospital Brig Gen Bazle Quader has been removed and sent back to the Armed Forces Division amid protests against him by physicians and employees of the country's premier public hospital. Brig Gen Shahidul Haq Mallik has replaced him, according to establishment ministry circulars issued on Tuesday. Doctors, officials and employees launched agitations against Quader early this month alleging favouritism in staff recruitment, and prompting the government to suspend the appointments. The incumbent staff alleged that all the new employees were being recruited according to lists provided by the pro-Awami League doctors' forum Swadhinata Chikitsak Parisad. The class-four employees of the hospital confined him inside his office for two hours and a half on Jan 13 demanding cancellation of the ongoing recruitment. The ministry, in separate orders, has also brought some army officials in to the administration and withdrew some others. The DHCH is traditionally headed by senior army officials on deputation. Directorate of Health Services director Brig Gen Ismail Hossain and Bangladesh University of Professional (BUP) registrar Brig Gen Md Enamur Rhaman have been withdrawn from their posts and their services put under the disposal of Armed Forces Division. Brig Gen Zahangir Hossain Mallik has been made director of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Brig Gen Abul Kalam director general of tge Department of Drug Administration and Col Abdur Rashid Miah director of Central Medical Stores Depot (CMSD) on deputation. b
