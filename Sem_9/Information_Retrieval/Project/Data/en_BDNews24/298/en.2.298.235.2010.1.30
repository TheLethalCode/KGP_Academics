 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at discussion urged politicians and the youth to be inspired by Gandhi's ideals of Ahimsa and Satyagraha. The comments were made at a meeting held to observe Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's anniversary of death on Saturday. Syed Abul Maksud, a researcher, said it would be worthwhile to follow Mahatma Gandhi's principle of non-violence and nonviolent resistance, during his speech at the 10th Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Lecture-2010 held at Dhaka University. He quoted Gandhi's saying, "My life is my message." "He spent his life for the welfare of the people by ensuring freedom and human rights," said Maksud, a former journalist. He said Gandhi had visited Bangladesh in 1925 along with Kazi Nazrul Islam and Chittaranjan Das to spread his philosophy of cooperation, equal rights and Ahimsa. The great leader was assassinated in 1948 in New Delhi on this day. Dhaka University VC AAMS Arefin Siddique said Gandhi throughout his life wanted to make the people understand that violence could not bring peace. "His philosophy should be an inspiration for us." Farid Uddin Ahmed, dean of social science faculty, said Gandhi expressed non-violence as a measure of social and political life. Pro-vice chancellor Harun-or-Rashid termed Gandhi as a social reformer, a humanist, political organiser and a true practitioner of his beliefs. He said, "He translated his philosophies into practice." Gandhi had said religion could not be the basis of partition, he added. Rajeet Mitter, recently appointed high commissioner of India, said the great leader believed in peace. "Gandhi's philosophy is part of the Indian constitution which has led the nation to become a secular and peace-loving nation," said the Indian envoy, who presided the discussion.
