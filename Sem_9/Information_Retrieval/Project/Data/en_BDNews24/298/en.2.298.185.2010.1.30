 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)--BNP has taken up a two-month programme to exchange views with its grassroots wrokers countrywide as part of the efforts to reform itself, according to senior leaders. Ten meetings will be held in six divisional cities starting from Sylhet on Feb 6. "We will hold meetings with the grassroots leaders in divisional levels to reform the party and set the future work plans," Selima Rahman, vice-president of the main opposition party, said at a news briefing at the Naya Paltan headquarters on Saturday. The programme has been modeled on the delegates' conference arranged by senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman in 2007. A documentary on the activities of Tarique--the elder son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, and currently in the UK, will also be screened in the meetings. Senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Alamgir said the opinion-exchange meetings will be held in Sylhet, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Khulna, Jessore, Rajshahi, Bogra and Barisal. Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi will hold two meetings each, while there will be one meeting in Sylhet and Barisal, he said. Alamgir said professionals and senior leaders will attend the meetings to decide on the future strategies of the party. "We will also discuss our activities for the country's development if we go to power in future," he said. Leaders assigned to work as coordinators in the divisions include M Ilyas Ali in Sylhet, Mirza Abbas in Chittagong, Mizanur Rahman Minu in Rajshahi, Amanullah Aman in Dhaka, Abdullah Al Noman in Khulna and Selima Rahman in Barisal.
