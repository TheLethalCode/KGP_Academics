<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25, (bdnews24.com)- Sachin Tendulkar was the first to admit it was a difficult pitch to bat on after the second day of the second Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. "It was not an easy track to bat on. It was a two-paced one and had variable bounce. I thought it might not be a bad idea to change the momentum of the game. That's why I played some shots and changed the momentum." India scored 459-5 with Tendulkar scoring 143 and featuring in a 222-run stand with Rahul Dravid, who had to retire hurt on 111.

So, we really had to bend our backs throughout the day." He didn't regret not picking up Tendulkar when he offered the chance. "Nobody wants to spill a catch especially when it involves a great player like Sachin (Tendulkar). Had the catch been taken, it would have been special. Missing catches is part of the game." Shahadat also defended the decision to bat first after winning the toss. Despite seeing Rahul Dravid felled by a bouncer, the hard-working bowler felt there was nothing wrong with the delivery. "Dravid is such a great batsman. To hit his helmet with a bouncer and make him fall on the wicket, I have to admit it felt good. I have hit batsmen before but this is the first time that a batsman has had to go back [after discontinuing batting]," Shahadat, who was unaware at that moment of Dravid's hospitalisation, sai
