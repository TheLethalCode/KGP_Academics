Ninety people, mostly Lebanese and Ethiopians, were on board Flight ET409 bound for Addis Ababa when it disappeared off the radar five minutes after taking off. Twenty-four bodies have been recovered so far, including those of two toddlers. The plane had apparently broken up in the air before plunging into the sea and Lebanon has ruled out terrorism as the reason for the crash.

"They need to pinpoint the location of the wreckage and then launch a dive there," the official said. Many relatives were angry the plane had been allowed to take off in bad weather.
