 MIAMI, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military said on Friday it has stopped flying Haitian earthquake victims to the United States for medical attention following concerns by some state governments about who will pay for the treatment. "At this moment in time, yes, the flights have stopped," said Navy Captain Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the US Transportation Command, which manages the military's medical emergency airlifts.

Crist's request did not state how much the medical care for the earthquake victims was costing his state but the Times reported the cost could be in the millions of dollars. The newspaper quoted Dr. Barth Green, co-founder of Project Medishare for Haiti, a nonprofit group tied to the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine, as saying the suspension of medical evacuations could be very harmful for patients. "People are dying in Haiti because they can't get out," Green told the Times. More than 500 quake victims had been treated in Florida hospitals, with hospitals in other states also having taken in injured Haitians, according to the Times.
