 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque Chunnu has become the first critic of president Zillur Rahman's Jan 4 speech in parliament. Chunnu said on Tuesday that the president's speech had little focus on Bangladesh's population burden. No other MP has been critical of the president's speech since parliament started the thanks-giving discussion. "The president's speech had only six lines on booming population which is the main problem in Bangladesh," Chunnu, the MP from Kishoreganj's Karimganj constituency, told parliament. "I am really frustrated with the poor focus on population," he said. "But I thank the president for his speech." Chunnu stressed that Bangladesh should maintain good relations with India in its own interest
