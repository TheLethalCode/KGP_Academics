 SEOUL, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea fired several artillery rounds on Thursday in the direction of a South Korean island off the peninsula in a second day of shooting near a disputed sea border that has been the site of deadly clashes in the past. The rounds landed on the north's side of the disputed maritime border off the west coast of the rival states, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said quoting military sources. The two Koreas remain technically at war.

South Korea's won was down slightly after the initial reports of the firing. The main stock index was muted. North Korea has more than 10,000 pieces of artillery aimed at the wealthy South and which could in a matter of hours destroy much of the capital Seoul, 25 miles (40 km) from the border. The firing came when President Lee Myung-bak was travelling to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum after a state visit to India. The latest clash comes amid signals from Pyongyang it was ready to return after a year-long boycott to six-country talks on ending its atomic arms programme. Earlier this week Pyongyang accused the South of declaring war by saying it would launch a pre-emptive strike if it had clear signs the North was preparing a nuclear atta
