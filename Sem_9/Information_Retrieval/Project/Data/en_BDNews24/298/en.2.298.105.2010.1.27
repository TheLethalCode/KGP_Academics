<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Wednesday recommended a new law prescribing punishment for publication of news "without accurate information". Another parliamentary committee questioned the government move of amending the criminal law to stop harassment of journalists. The parliamentary standing committee on planning ministry at its meeting said fabricated media reports violated the human rights guaranteed in the constitution. And the law ministry-related committee asked the ministry to clarify on journalists being given immunity from arrest. "We recommend formulation of a law having provision of considering media reports without accurate information as punishable offence. "It will ensure accountability of the mass media," the chairman of the panning ministry committee, Oli Ahmad, told reporters after a meeting in parliament. He said that the meeting unanimously decided to formulate a law to ensure the media's accountability. The committee in its minutes said that the media had long been publishing news items without accurate information against different institution and individuals. "So, where is their accountability? Dissection of character is not desirable. "The constitution guarantees fundamental rights of every citizen, and publishing news not based on fact should be considered violation of the constitution," the chairman said in press statement on his committee meeting. The law ministry committee at a meeting also asked the government to explain its move to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to stop harassment of journalists, writer and editors. "We have asked the ministry to clarify why journalists are being given such a privilegeimmunity from arrest," Suranjit Sengupta, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "What is the justification of framing such a law at this moment? "If journalists are given the privileges, what wrong we have done?" he asked. Law minister Shafique Ahmed tabled the "Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2010" which proposed not to issue direct orders of arrest in defamation cases against journalists. The bill says the judiciary could summon journalists only in defamation cases. "Where should we go when journalists harass people?" said Sengupta. The meeting resented the law ministry being run without secretary for weeks which the committee believes hampers governance, he said. The meeting, adjourned until Sunday as both the law minister and the state minister were absent, summoned the establishment secretary to explain why there was no law secretary in the ministry.
