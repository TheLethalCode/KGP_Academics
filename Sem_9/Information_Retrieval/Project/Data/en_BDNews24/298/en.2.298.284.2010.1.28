 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Russia is interested to give Bangladesh 300,000 tonnes of wheat as assistance. Russian ambassador in Dhaka Gennady P Trotsenko expressed his country's interest during a meeting with food minister Abdur Razzak at his secretariat office on Thursday. Trotsenko told the minister that for the assistance Dhaka would need to sign a deal with Moscow that would also facilitate Russian assistance for Bangladesh in the event of any food crisis. He said Russian, which exports a huge quantity of wheat, has huge surplus of the grain this year. Razzak said Bangladesh consumes 3 million tonnes of wheat, annually of which 1 million is produced locally and the rest imported by the government and private parties. Mentioning that the government would import 750,000 tonnes of wheat this year, he thanked the Russian envoy for the offer. The minister said steps would be taken promptly to sign the food-assistance agreement with Moscow. He said the government has to ensure food security of the country's huge population of which more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. He said the government does not want to depend on the private sector alone for food security of the people. Head of the European Union delegation in Dhaka, Stefan Frowein, also called on the food minister on Thursday. He said the EU has already given Bangladesh 5 million euros for rehabilitation of Aila-affected people in Bangladesh. The grouping is interested to give another 5 million euros, he said. bd
