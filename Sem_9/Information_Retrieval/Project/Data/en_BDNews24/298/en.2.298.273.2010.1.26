 BELFAST, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British and Irish prime ministers held crisis talks on Tuesday to salvage a deal to keep Northern Ireland's fragile power-sharing government in place. Gordon Brown and Brian Cowen flew in unexpectedly on Monday to help rival Northern Irish parties Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) overcome a dispute over when to transfer police and justice powers from London to Belfast. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson of the DUP said there had been some progress. "I can't say there's going to be a deal. None of us can say that, but we're going to sit at the table until we get the deal," he told reporters. The peace process in Northern Ireland has been touted as a model around the world and a failure to contain the enmity between the predominantly Catholic Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein and the pro-British, predominantly protestant DUP would be a major setback. Brown has a particular stake in trying to ward off crisis. He faces a parliamentary election this year and would not want his credibility and his Labour party's achievement as a co-signatory of the Northern Ireland peace deal in 1998 to be undermined. Brown's Downing Street office said the talks had "hard going," but "the parties engaged in good faith". Monday's discussions went on into the early hours and resumed on Tuesday morning with talks between Brown and Cowen followed by meetings with the Sinn Fein and DUP. Downing Street did not say how long the talks could last, although it said Brown had postponed until Thursday a London cabinet meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday. BREAKING POINT The last-minute decision by the prime ministers to intervene personally implied the situation was close to breaking point. Sinn Fein, which ultimately wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland, demands the transfer of policing and justice powers should take place as soon as possible and accuses the DUP of trying to delay the inevitable. The DUP, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, has denied the accusation. In a reference to Sinn Fein demands for a firm deadline, Robinson said: "I fear no date ... The date is not the important issue." The most intractable problem, analysts said, is the parades commission, which oversees the province's Orange Order Protestant marches. The DUP wants this form of oversight over this centuries-old tradition abolished. Sinn Fein, which sees the parades as provocative, wants the commission to remain. "The very fact that so much emphasis is being put on the parading issue probably militates against the chance of an agreement," said Paul Bew, Professor of Politics at Queen's University Belfast. "But let me make it crystal clear, this negotiation is not over and there is a possibility of a benign resolution but I would put it at possibility rather than probability." The odds of a solution are improved by the probable reluctance of both sides to trigger the Northern Ireland Assembly election that would follow a break-down in talks. The timing is not good for the DUP, which is mired in a scandal involving Robinson's wife that has forced him to temporary stand aside as first minister even though he is still overseeing the devolution talks. Although Sinn Fein might be more relaxed about a snap election, the outcome is uncertain and the party is still wary of incurring international opprobrium for undoing political progress that has taken years of effort. A deal on the transfer of powers to Belfast would give Northern Ireland its first justice minister and be one of the biggest changes since the 1998 Good Friday peace deal ended three decades of violence that killed 3,600 peo
