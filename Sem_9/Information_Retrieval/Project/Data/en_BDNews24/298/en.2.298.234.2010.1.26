<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has directed the government to submit a list within three weeks of scrap ships, brought to Bangladesh territory without neutralisation or environmental certification, since a previous rule on ship-breaking in March last year. A bench of justice Iman Ali and justice Md Abu Tariq gave the order on Tuesday on a petition by Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA). The High Court on March 17 last year ordered the department of shipping, which endorses import of ships, to ensure that no vessel enters the Bangladesh territory for breaking without neutralisation, or pre-cleaning, and certifications from the department of environment (DoE). It also ordered government to report to the court every month on how many scrap ships are arriving at the ports, and how much wastage they contain The BELA petition said the shipping department continues to authorise import of ships containing hazardous materials into the country. It said the shipping department does not involve the DoE in the authorisation process as directed by the High Court directive. In Tuesday's order, the court also directed the government to finalise regulations for the ship breaking industry and a gazette notification within three months. It further asked the government to determine the terms and references for a high-powered committee formed to monitor the ship-breaking process in the country so that the committee could visit breaking yards and give its opinions. A press release of BELA said the court expressed its dismay over lack of initiative of the government to regulate the industry and ensure labour and environmental standards. According to shipping ministry, around 500 workers have died and another 6,000 have been injured in the ship-breaking yards since the industry began growing in the 1990s. A survey of the environment department found the existence of 79 ship-breaking yards along the Sitakunda coast in Chittagong, of which 61 are in operation. The government, and the prime minister herself, over the past month has vowed to start regulating the industry "immediately" in the wake of worker deaths last month and reports of rampant deforestation along the coast to make way for the breaking-yards. b
