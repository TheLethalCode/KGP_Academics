<TITLE> Iraq tribal leader wants Baath forgiveness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAMADI, Iraq, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A prominent Sunni tribal leader urged the Shi'ite-led Iraqi government to abandon what he called a policy of revenge against those associated with Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party and pursue forgiveness. Ahmed Abu Risha, the head of Sunni Awakening councils in western Anbar province which proved pivotal in turning the tide against al Qaeda when they switched sides and joined US forces, criticised efforts to bar dozens of candidates from a March 7 election because of their suspected Baathist pasts. He said a justice and accountability law that replaced a de-Baathification law meant to keep Saddam loyalists from power was being misused to prevent competitors from running. "There is no justice in the justice and accountability law. It is harsher than de-Baathification," Abu Risha said in his mansion, set in grounds where deer graze and hunting hawks glare at visitors from a huge cage. Bangladeshi workers serve tea. "We want a law of forgiveness, not a law of revenge ... a law to close the pages of the past," he told Reuters this week. Abu Risha's association with the US military, which paid Awakening councils to fight al Qaeda, has swelled his already wealthy family's coffers. The tumult stirred up by a decision by an independent panel to bar more than 400 candidates from the March ballot has begun to die down. But it has heightened tensions ahead of the vote and laid bare Iraq's still painful sectarian wounds. Minority Sunnis, who dominated Iraq under Sunni dictator Saddam and formed the core of the insurgency, were initially outraged after reports the list was weighted against them. Sunnis largely boycotted the last national elections in 2005 and their resentment provided fertile soil for al Qaeda. Any suspicion the Shi'ite majority was trying to sideline Sunnis again could provide new fuel for the insurgency just as sectarian violence begins to recede. The list, in the end, included more Shi'ite politicians than Sunnis. It appeared aimed more at secular alliances expected to fare well in the election against the religious Shi'ite Islamist parties that have dominated politics since the 2003 invasion. One of those secular alliances targeted was a Sunni-Shi'ite slate formed by Abu Risha and Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, called the Iraq Unity list. "Votes should be the criteria for eliminating candidates or parties," Abu Risha said. "Votes should decide who is in and who is out." TANKS NOT CONDEMNATION Seventy of Iraq Unity's candidates are included in the list drawn up by the panel, which is headed by Shi'ite politicians viewed by their critics as being close to Iran. Banned candidates can appeal to a special seven-judge body. The legality of the panel is also being challenged in court. Abu Risha railed at Iran's increased influence since Shi'ites took power in Iraq and called for increased involvement by Arab countries. Both Iran and Arab nations are meddling in the election, some Iraqi officials say. Abu Risha said Iraq mishandled the seizure by a dozen Iranian soldiers of a disputed oil well in December. Iraq should have met the incursion with troops, he said. "Such actions should be countered by tanks, not condemnation." Abu Risha said he was an Iraqi army lieutenant who deserted in protest after Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. He took over the Awakening forces, or "Sahwa", after his brother, their previous leader, was killed in a suicide attack in 2007. Abu Risha turned the Awakening movement into a political bloc ahead of provincial elections early last year. He had been widely expect to align himself with Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for the March parliamentary election. He said Maliki asked him to join his State of Law coalition. "We rejected it," Abu Risha said. He said he insisted on being treated as an equal partner and that the alliance not use the name associated with Maliki, State of Law. Maliki decli
