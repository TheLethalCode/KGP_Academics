 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)Parliament offered a special prayer of thanksgiving on Thursday for the execution of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's killers, before adjourning until Feb 2. Speaker Abdul Hamid suspended all scheduled business of the day and suspended the session in memory of the country's independence leader and his slain family members. Awami League MP Abdul Awal Saidur Rahman administered the munajat. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, one of Mujib's two surviving daughters, was present in parliament. Hamid, who has been an MP since 1970, delivered an emotional speech. "Most of my colleagues, who used to cherish the dream of witnessing the trial of the killers, have died. "Had I died before this trial, my soul would have departed unsatisfied," Hamid said. "I will have no regret now if I now leave the earth," he said. He said the trial proved that none was above the law, as Article 27 of the constitution guarantees. "The whole nation has been relieved of the stigma of the killing of the Father of the Nation," he said. The speaker mentioned the insertion of a provision in the constitution prohibiting the trial of the condemnable killings. "Those who promulgated the indemnity bill did not take into consideration that history can never ignore a heinous murder of this type," said Hamid. He said the trial faced setbacks at different times, but ultimately "truth prevailed". Parliament started business at 3.45 pm and suspended at around 4.05 pm. The House will resume at around 3.00 pm on Tuesday (Feb 2).
