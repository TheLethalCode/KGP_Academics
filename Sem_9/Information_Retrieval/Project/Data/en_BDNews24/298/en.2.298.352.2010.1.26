 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)--The market plunged more than 1 percent on Tuesday, after registering a record rise of more than 3 percent the previous day, on news of a probe into the scary hike. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark general index or the DGEN lost 1.29 percent or 68.99 points to finish at 5243.44 points after touching the highest-ever level of 5312.44 points on Monday. The fall, however, was largely contributed by a price slash of market leader Grameenphone as a Tk 1 fall in its shares shaves nearly 3 points off the key index. The market giant ended on Tk 255, falling by more than Tk 20 or 8.4 percent from Monday's closing. The lone telecoms issue has been at the center of investors' attraction long before its debut last November. For the previous couple of sessions, its price had been going up before skyrocketing by about Tk 25 on Tuesday. The hike prompted the bourse authorities and the market regulator to open inquiries. A surveillance team of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gathered information about its share price, trade volume and margin loan to the security from a couple of brokerage houses. The SEC also instructed the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges to look into the reasons for the price hike of the mobile operator's shares. According to brokerage house officials, the hike lured investors into engaging in profit-taking but the news of probe also sent cold waves. "Profit-taking was happening as well when price was rising but the inquiry caused a bit of panic," said an official of Latif Securities, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the press. Meanwhile, the other market drivers, banks slowly came out from the last sessions losing streak while mutual funds eroded the previous day's gains with insurers following. The day turned out to be a bad one for fuel shares but the power sector advanced along with the lone gas distribution company of the market, Titas Gas. The pharmaceuticals sector, which houses some of the market heavyweights, ended mixed with ACI and its subsidiary, Square Pharmaceuticals and Beximco Pharma gaining. Out of the 238 traded scrips on the premier bourse, 131 lost, 105 gained and two remained unchanged. The daily turnover slightly fell to Tk 14.81 billion from 74,162,582 shares changing hands. Grameenphone was still the turnover leader with shares worth Tk 1.16 billion traded, followed by Bex Tex, Beximco, Beximco Pharma and Union Capitals.
