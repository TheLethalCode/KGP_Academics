 Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com corespondent Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  President Zillur Rahman has rejected a final-hour mercy plea by Syed Faruk Rahman, the fourth death-row convict to seek clemency in the Bangabandhu murder case. A release from the press information department said that the mercy plea by Faruk was rejected and another convict of the case, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, has not sought presidential clemency. A Bangabhaban source told bdnews24.com the petition was rejected within two hours of Faruk's plea arriving at the law ministry on Wednesday evening. The petition, sent through the prison authorities via the home ministry, was seen by bdnews24.com correspondent Prodip Chowdhury at around 6pm, before being sent through the prime minister's office to the president, who rejected it. A prison officer had also confirmed to bdnews24.com's senior reporter Liton Haider, that Faruk had sought clemency at this late stage as the condemned men face the gallows. The official added that the fifth death-row convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan had said he would not "beg for mercy". The clemency pleas of the other three jailed convicts  AKM Mohiuddin, Mohiuddin Ahmed and Bazlul Huda  were rejected by the president earlier this month. Death warrants were issued against the five death-row convicts on January 3. According to law, the death sentence should be executed between 21 and 28 days from the issuance of the warrants. But a death convict has the right to petition for a review of the final judgment in his case within this time and to seek presidential clemency as the last resort. All five death-row convicts submitted separate review petitions in this case, while Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin submitted mercy pleas on Jan 9. Mohammed Shafiul Alam, secretary to the president, told bdnews24.com on Jan 18 that the president had rejected the pleas. 'HAND-WRITTEN PLEA' Faruk Rahman, on Wednesday, gave three grounds in his plea for having his death sentence commuted. In a hand-written note, he said there was no one to take care of his elderly mother Mahmuda Rahman in his absence; secondly, he was a freedom fighter who worked to rebuild the country, and finally, he was removed from security duty at Bangabhaban before Mujib's murder on Aug 15, 1975 and that he was full of sorrow for the incident that occurred on that day. REVIEW PETITIONS DISMISSED Earlier in the day, a special bench comprising four justices, led by chief justice M Tofazzal Islam dismissed the petitions of the five convicts for review of the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers for the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence leader. The review petitions were the last legal opening for the convicts to defer their death sentences. Soon after the ruling, law minister Shafique Ahmed said their executions would be carried out by Jan 31, and the two who had yet to seek clemency must do so "immediately". He made the announcement at a press conference following a three-hour meeting with the home minister, inspector general of prisons and other concerned officials, after the dismissal of the petitions. Shafique said: "Everything is explained in detail in the jail code about the execution. Jail authorities will take measures accordingly." Asked about the two remaining convicts who did not submit clemency petitions, he had said: "They have already been informed of the Supreme Court ruling. They will have to submit mercy petitions immediately as per law." Chief state counsel Anisul Haque also said the two remaining convicts had yet the scope to submit clemency pleas but would have to do so soon. "The provision of submitting mercy petitions between seven and 15 days following the dismissal of review petitions will not be applicable here. "They will have to submit mercy petitions immediately," Haque said. 'EXECUTIONS IMMINENT' Haque also said: "The executions should be carried out between 21 and 28 days from the day of issuance of release of the original Supreme Court judgment and issuance of death warrants. "The countdown has begun from Jan 3. There is no legal bar in carrying out the executions by Jan 31," he said. The law minister was asked if the convicts submit clemency petitions to the president whether it would be possible to resolve them by Jan 31. He said: "If they submit petitions immediately it will be possible to resolve them before the deadline." TIGHT SECURITY COUNTRYWIDE Home minister Sahara Khatun, who was also present during the press briefing, said law enforcers had been directed to take tight security measures across the country at this sensitive time. She declined to reveal the types of security measures. Khatun was asked whether the intelligence agencies had received any information of subversive acts. She said: "Will it be right to disclose them if they had? I cannot do that as a home minister." bdne
