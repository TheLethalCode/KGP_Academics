<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) The government will be survey buildings in Dhaka metropolitan and surrounding areas to see if they were erected according to building regulations and approved plans, the disaster management minister says. "A lot of owners do not follow the approved design and plan. In these cases they will be marked to ensure that buildings are constructed according to building regulations," Abdur Razzaque said on Wednesday. Also steps are being taken to retrofit the decayed, old buildings including the Bangladesh secretariat and Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Help will be sought from donor countries and organisations, if necessary, the minister said. He briefed the media after a meeting at the ministry's conference room. The meeting titled 'Earthquake preparations and awareness', was presided over by the minister himself. Disaster management secretary Mukhlesur Rahman and others were present. Razzaque said, "Three thousand dangerous buildings have been marked in the city. Of them only six have been demolished until now. The rest are still at risk. The related ministries have been requested to demolish them. Fast action shall be taken from their part." The minister continued, "Large buildings are also being constructed outside Dhaka now. RAJUK has no authority there." "The local authorities would be made responsible and empowered to ensure that the buildings are constructed according to building code" said Razzaque. "Decision has been taken to retrofit or demolish dangerous government buildings. Already the Secretariat and Dhaka Medical College Hospital have been selected for retrofitting." But skilled workforces able to do such is unavailable in the country and specialists will be brought in from outside. He revealed of the formation of a sub-committee to finalise draft plans fixing responsibilities of ministries and organisations in case of earthquakes. "A draft of the contingency plan has been already made. But it has not been finalised." The decision to form a sub-committee has been taken after consulting related ministries and departments. bdn
