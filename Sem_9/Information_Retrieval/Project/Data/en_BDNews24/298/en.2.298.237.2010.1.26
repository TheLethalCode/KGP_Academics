 MEXICO CITY, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay international striker Salvador Cabanas was shot and critically injured in a Mexico City bar on Monday with doctors unable to remove a bullet lodged in his head. The 29-year-old, one of Latin America's most prolific goal scorers and expected to help spearhead Paraguay's attack at this year's World Cup, was possibly involved in a fight before the predawn shooting, Mexico City's top prosecutor said.

Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the shooting and offered Mexico City authorities federal help investigating the crime. Cabanas was also the top scorer in the South American Libertadores Cup in 2007 with 10 goals and again the following year with eight, both while playing for America. He has regularly been among the top scorers in the Mexican championship since moving to the country in 2003, initially with Chiapas until 2006 and then with America, which is Mexico's richest and most powerful club. He was in Paraguay's squad at the 2006 World Cup but did not get a game. Since then, injuries to Manchester City's Roque Santa Cruz have allowed him to enjoy more ac
