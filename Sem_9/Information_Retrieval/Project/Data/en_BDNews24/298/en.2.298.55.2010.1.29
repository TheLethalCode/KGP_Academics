<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer provided a masterful demonstration of his incredible talent and insatiable desire to win by overwhelming Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 on Friday and join Andy Murray in the final of the Australian Open. The world number one was at his brilliant best as he outclassed his French opponent to wrap up a lop-sided victory in under 90 minutes at Melbourne Park. "I'm very happy. You've always got to deal with how your opponent plays. Sometimes he plays like you want, sometimes not," a relaxed Federer said. "It's nice going through like this but I already know the next match won't be this way." Federer beat Murray in the 2008 US Open final but the Scotsman has been the form player over the past fortnight. However Federer's imperious display could give him a couple of sleepless nights before Sunday's final. "I know he'd like to win the first for British tennis in... what is it...like 150,000 years?" Federer joked in a courtside interview. "The poor guy has to go through those moments over and over again. He's done tremendously. We match up well. I'm looking forward to the final." Federer has already won the Australian Open three times, in 2004, 2006 and 2007, and is now through to his fifth final after losing an epic five-set clash with Rafa Nadal last year. BREAKING RECORDS The Swiss is also through to his 22nd Grand Slam final, more than any other man in history, and his eighth in a row. A victory over Murray will provide the 28-year-old with his 16th grand slam, extending yet another of his own records. "I feel a need for myself that I spent three weeks here and I don't want to just give away a match," Federer said. "So I will make sure I will make it as hard, as tough as possible for my opponent. "I hope I can play another good match. I'm really where I want to be. Being back in a Grand Slam final is always an amazing thrill for me." Growing in confidence with every match after a slow start to the championship, Federer showed no mercy against a weary Tsonga, who had won his two previous matches in five sets. He broke Tsonga's erratic serve once to win the opening set then twice more in each of the next two while comfortably holding each of his service games. "I thought he did really well in those five set matches and I expected him to come out here and be really athletic the way we know him," Federer said. "Maybe he was mentally more fatigued than physically." Tsonga, who reached the Australian Open final two years ago but has yet to win a grand slam, did not get a single break point on the Swiss master's serve. SUBDUED TSONGA The 10th seed had been bouncing around with all the energy of a schoolboy when he beat Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals but was left deflated after his loss to Federer. "It was tough to play against him today," he said. "He took the ball earlier than me and he was just better than me. He was really good, and that's it." Earlier, Serena Williams warmed up for her singles final against Justine Henin on Saturday by teaming up with her sister Venus Williams to successfully defend their doubles crown. The Americans beat Zimbabwe's Cara Black and American Liezel Huber to claim their 11th Grand Slam doubles title. "It always feels good to be that I'm gonna go home with at least one title," Serena
