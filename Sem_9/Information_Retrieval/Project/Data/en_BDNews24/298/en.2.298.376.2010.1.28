 COLOMBO, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)---Sri Lankans respond positively to the re-election of President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a second term in office. Sri Lanka returned to normal on Thursday, after Wednesday was declared a public holiday to keep people off the streets as the results of the country's historic election poured in. Official results showed President Mahinda Rajapaksa winning by 57.8 percent of more than 10 million votes cast. Former army commander General Sarath Fonseka received just over 40 per cent. Many said they were glad Rajapaksa won a second term. (SOUNDBITE) (Sinhala) TAXI DRIVER SOMAPALA SAYING: "This is what we wanted. We want to get Mahinda (president) to win."
