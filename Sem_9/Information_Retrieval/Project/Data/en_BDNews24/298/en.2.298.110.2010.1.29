 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The gun-wielding JCD cadre, famously photographed and widely publicised during violent clashes of two groups, was sent to a three-day police remand for interrogation on Friday. Syeduzzaman Pasha, a cadre of opposition BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, was photographed with his pistol during clashes between rival JCD factions on Dhaka University campus on Jan 18. The Detective Branch of Police said Pasha had been in the army for a year before he was dismissed. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court ordered the remand upon DB of Police sub-inspector Nayeem Ahmed's petition for 10 days. The court's general recording officer, Shakhawat Hossain, told bdnews24.com that there was no lawyer for Pasha.
