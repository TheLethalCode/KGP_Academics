 WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- The US teen pregnancy rate rose in 2006 for the first time in more than a decade, reversing a long slide, a US think tank reported on Tuesday. The overall teen pregnancy rate was up 3 percent in 2006, with a 4 percent rise in the rate of births and a 1 percent rise in the rate of abortions, according to the report by the Guttmacher Institute. The United States has higher rates of teen pregnancy, birth and abortion than in other Western industrialized countries. There were 71 pregnancies per 1,000 US girls aged 15-19.

"It's interesting to note that this flattening out of the rate and the increase in the rate is happening at the same time that we've seen substantial increases in funding for abstinence-only programs," Finer said. "We do know that when we saw the big decline in the '90s, that a lot of that decline was due to improved contraceptive use among teens." The abstinence-only programs, backed by many social conservatives who oppose the teaching of contraception methods to teenagers in US schools, received about $1.3 billion in federal funds since the late 1990s. The Obama administration's 2010 budget eliminated spending for abstinence-only, shifting funds to pregnancy prevention education that include abstinence along with "medically accurate and age-appropriate" information. New Mexico led the states with the highest teenage pregnancy rate with nine percent, followed by Nevada, Arizona, Texas and Mississippi. New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota and North Dakota had the lowest rates of teen pregnanc
