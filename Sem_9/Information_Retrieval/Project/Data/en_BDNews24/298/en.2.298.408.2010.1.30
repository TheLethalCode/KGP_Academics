 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League began its extended meeting on Saturday, taking aim at fresh leadership in the grassroots-level district and upazila committees like the central committee. Party president, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, launched the meeting at around 11am at the Gano Bhaban premises. The national and party flags were hoisted with the playing of national anthem during the time. General secretary Syed Ashraful Islam hoisted the party flag. This is the first extended meeting after the formation of the new central working committee. Some 10,000 leaders and workers, including presidents and general secretaries of the party across the country, are attending the meeting. Ahead of the party's extended council, Syed Ashraf said at a media briefing on Friday, "Leaders will be chosen from grass-roots level and new leadership will come. It will rejuvenate the party." Hasina will inaugurate the drive to recruit members and renew memberships in the extended council. "Council of district and upazila levels will be held after the drive is over. The whole procedure will take nearly three years." Hasina had brought in new leadership in the national council held in the middle of last year and also introduced fresh faces in the government. Ashraf also revealed that many 'important' political and organisational decisions would be taken in the extended meeting. The last extended meeting was held in May 2008. bd
