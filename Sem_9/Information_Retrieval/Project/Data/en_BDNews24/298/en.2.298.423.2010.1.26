 Khagrachharhi, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)A Bangalee organisation barricaded two roads in Khagrachharhi and Rangamati on Tuesday, a day after hill people barricaded roads in the hill districts in protest over a land dispute. The roadblock-cum-siege called by the Parbattya Bangalee Chhatra Parishad disrupted movement of all vehicles on Khagrachharhi-Dighinala and Rangamati-Baghachharhi-Baghaihat roads since morning. Parbattya Bangalee Chhatra Parishad (PBCP) general secretary Md Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com over telephone, "The half-day siege is being observed protesting the attacks launched on our organisation leaders and activists on Sunday." Local people said during the road blockade, agitating pickets vandalised two trucks and another vehicle carrying medicine. In another incident at Jamtali in Dighinala, four motor cycles were also vandalised by the agitators enforcing the siege. Mohammad Abdullah, deputy commissioner of Khagrachharhi said Dighinala Upazila Nirbahi Officer had been asked to keep a close watch over the law and order situation in the area. Criticising the road blockade by PBCP, Janasanhati Samiti vice president Ushatan Talukdar told bdnews24.com, "They should not have launched their road blockade programme just to protest one stray incident It has been a very disappointing decision." The hill people on Sunday called for a siege when the local Bangalees allegedly launched attacks on the hill people, the hill people claimed. Pockets in different parts of the Hill Tracts had been settled with Bangalees from the plains over the years both during the Pakistan and Bangladesh eras, a move resented by the local hill people who eventually had resorted to armed insurgency to free their land. The last Awami League government took a peace initiative and signed a peace accord with tribal insurgents who agreed to lay down arms. bdnew
