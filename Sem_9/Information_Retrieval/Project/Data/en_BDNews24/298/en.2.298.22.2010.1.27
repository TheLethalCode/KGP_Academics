Ten relatives of Huda were seen to enter the jail at around 3pm. "When asked how many of us should go, we were asked to hurry up," she said. Pasha said she also saw relatives of other death convicts at the jail gate. So many visitors have never been allowed at a time in the jail before, nor such long visits allowed. Huda's relatives left around 4:45pm after almost an hour and a half's visit. Convict AKM Mohiuddin's wife Hosniara Mohiuddin went in to meet him minutes later.
