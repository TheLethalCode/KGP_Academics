 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for employment Begum Munnujan Sufian told parliament on Wednesday that a total of 6.74 million Bangladeshis have been employed abroad since 1976. Almost $56 million have been remitted back to Bangladesh in the past 14 years (1996-2009), she also said. The state minister said the workers were sent abroad by Bangladesh Overseas and Employment Services Limited (BOESL) and private recruiting agencies, of which 475,000 workers were recruited in 2009 alone. Sufian, responding for the labour minister to a written query from Naogaon-1 MP, admitted however that many workers are falling victim to fraudulent recruiters. Replying to a supplementary question, she said, "The government has taken initiatives to stop such fraud. In some cases, licenses of agencies are being cancelled." No one will have to put up one's home for sale for going overseas. From now on, they can go to the foreign countries taking loans from the Employment Banks. She said her ministry is also aware of allegations of women workers compelled to do unethical work abroad. Sufian also read out a written reply by labour minister Engineer Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain that the amount of remittance received by overseas workers in the last 14 years was $55.9 billion (Tk 335,818 crores). The government is working to establish an expatriate bank to encourage more remittance from overseas workers, Mosharraf said. He also said all efforts will be made to make the Money Laundering Act effective to thwart all obstructions in the way of remittance inflow. The minister also said new labour markets are being opened to Bangladeshi workers in countries like Rumania, Russia, Australia, South Africa, Sudan, Greece, Iraq, Estonia, Tanzania, Liberia, Angola, Algeria, Nigeria, Botswana. bdne
