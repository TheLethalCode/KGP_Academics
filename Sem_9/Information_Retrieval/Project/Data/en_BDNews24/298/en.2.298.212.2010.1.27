<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin faces judgment day on Thursday after a trial in which he was accused of plotting to sabotage his rival Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign to win the presidency in 2007. The so-called Clearstream case has picked through the most rancorous political scandal France has seen for many years, laying bare the bitter enmity between the two when they served together in government under former President Jacques Chirac. Villepin, who became prime minister in 2005, is accused of trying to manipulate a judicial corruption investigation to discredit the ambitious Sarkozy as the two angled to succeed Chirac to the presidency. An aristocratic former diplomat who won global fame in 2003 when he denounced the U.S.-led war on Iraq at the United Nations, he risks disgrace, an 18 month suspended prison sentence and a 45,000 euro ($63,410) fine if convicted. But for Sarkozy, who triumphed in 2007, the stakes are also high and a 'not guilty' verdict would be a big symbolic blow, particularly given accusations that his status as president is incompatible with his role in the case as a civil plaintiff. He created a storm at the start of the trial by branding the five defendants in the case as "guilty" in a primetime television interview, allowing Villepin to claim he is himself the victim of the president's obsessive thirst for revenge. Villepin denies any wrongdoing and a not guilty verdict, coincidentally falling on Sarkozy's birthday, would not only be sweet vindication, it could also revive his political career and pose as a potential presidential challenger. CLEARSTREAM AFFAIR Behind the courtroom battle lies a tangled intrigue worthy of an airport thriller. The affair first emerged in 2004 when an anonymous informant passed a judge investigating a bribe-ridden arms sale a CD ROM purportedly listing thousands of secret accounts held at Luxembourg-based securities clearing house Clearstream. The document contained names of dozens of prominent figures from the worlds of politics and business, including Sarkozy who was designated variously as "Nagy" and "Bocsa", parts of his full Hungarian family name. The list was soon shown to be partially falsified and a search began to find out who was responsible, dragging in Villepin who had ordered a separate inquiry into the names by a senior intelligence official. Prosecutors say it was Villepin who prompted the informant, later identified as Jean-Louis Gergorin, a former executive of aerospace group EADS with links to intelligence services, to pass on the list confidentially to the judge, even though he knew it to be false. Gergorin, whom examining magistrates described as having "a notorious obsession with conspiracy", believed the list, supplied to him by a former EADS associate named Imad Lahoud, showed far-reaching criminal ties in the business establishment. He and Lahoud, who admitted falsifying the list for motives which have never been entirely clear, are both also in the dock and face prison sentences and 45,000 euro fines if convicted. There are also two other defendants, journalist Denis Robert and former Clearstream auditor Florian Bourges. Whatever the verdict, any party can appeal, although some judicial experts doubt whether prosecutors will want to drag on with the case if the judges decide in favour of Ville
