 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Information minister Abul Kalam Azad has urged the media to play a responsible role to ensure government accountability. "We should establish a strong media to ensure accountability of the government," he said inaugurating the council of ruling Awami League-backed Dhaka Union of Journalists on Saturday. He said the government had ratified a right to information act and established an information commission for the purpose. "The media should play a responsible role. It should not present any news harmful to the country and its people." He said the government is aware of ensuring security of journalists doing their job. "The government believes in the freedom of media. Therefore, it does not interfere." He also said the condition of the state-owned Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha is very miserable. "Many organisations were destroyed during the BNP-led alliance government. Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha is one of the victims." He also assured of solving problems of the Daily Observer, which has been riddled with financial problems for long. Employees of the English daily have not been paid their salaries for almost 8 years now. DUJ president Shah Alamgir presided over the session.
