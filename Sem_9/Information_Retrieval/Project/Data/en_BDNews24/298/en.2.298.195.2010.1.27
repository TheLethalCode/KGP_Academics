 By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's insistence on keeping open the option to produce more atomic bomb-making material to keep pace with other nuclear powers has dimmed prospects for launching global talks on the issue, diplomats said on Tuesday. Citing a "clear and present danger" from its nuclear-armed rival India, Pakistan ruled out on Monday negotiations to ban the future production of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium, saying it would be left at a permanent disadvantage if it stopped manufacturing fissile material. [ID:nLDE60023U] "Pakistan doesn't want to hear about it," a diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of not being identified, told Reuters on Tuesday. Another diplomatic source said it was not only Pakistan that opposed such a ban. "Israel and Iran don't really want negotiations on fissile material either," the source said. Pakistan joined a formal consensus to adopt the annual agenda on Tuesday, a week after blocking it, but signalled that it would continue to press its demands in discussions to hammer out a detailed programme of work. Pakistan's envoy Zakir Akram reiterated its right to raise other issues including the use of missiles as weapon delivery systems and regional arms control issues at the annual session. He won support from Bangladesh, whose foreign minister Dipu Moni said fissile stocks should be part of any negotiations. "Negotiations should extend to stocks, without which any such treaty may not be comprehensive," she told the 65-member forum in Geneva. Akram, speaking on Tuesday, said: "It was not my government's intention to block adoption of the agenda. We are very keen to move beyond consideration of the agenda to the more important task of working out a programme of work. "We will make our contribution in this regard," he said. Pakistan's stance, triggered by nuclear and arms deals between India and the United States as well as with other nuclear powers, is a blow to the Obama administration's efforts to revive global disarmament. The United States and others welcomed adoption of the agenda, but called for quick progress at the world's only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. "It is imperative that we work together here at the CD and begin substantive work in 2010 at the earliest possible date," U.S. envoy Garold Larson said in a speech. Negotiations on a fissile material "cut-off" treaty, and talks in three other agreed areas including halting an arms race in outer space, could take place "without prescribing or precluding the outcome of those discussions", Larson said. Issues raised by Pakistan -- a crucial U.S. ally -- could be covered within the parameters of the agenda, he said. Switzerland said it was important to take account of fissile stocks held by states and that focusing exclusively on future production "would not be an honest assessment of the situation". "Excess and civilian stocks are huge and certainly part of the problem. We therefore believe that the scope of such a treaty must be sufficiently broad," Swiss Ambassador Juerg Lauber said in a spe
