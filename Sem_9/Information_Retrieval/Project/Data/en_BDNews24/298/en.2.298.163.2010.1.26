 ISTANBUL, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Neighbours of Afghanistan met in Istanbul on Tuesday to find a "single voice" in their approach to the conflict ahead of a major conference in London. The international community wants regional players to cooperate in bringing stability to Afghanistan, the focus of a summit in London on Thursday that is expected to agree a framework for the Afghan government to take charge of security.

Pakistan has long played an important role in Afghan affairs, having nurtured the Afghan Taliban during the 1990s, but Kabul remains suspicious that Islamabad is pursuing its own agenda in the country to the detriment of Afghanistan. Zardari would not be drawn into the plan to negotiate with the Taliban, but told a news conference alongside Karzai on Monday: "If there are any people who are reconcilable, democracy always welcomes them bac
