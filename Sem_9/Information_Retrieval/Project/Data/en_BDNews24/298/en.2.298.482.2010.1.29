 Probir Kumar Sarker bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Sadeka Halim could only pack a small lunch for her daughter before she left home Tuesday morning. This mother of two undergraduates and her retired husband then decided to have lunch at a nearby restaurant. She had barely managed to cook some rice and make an omelette before her daughter hurried off to university from the apartment in Shewrapara, Mirpur at around 10.00am. A widespread gas crisis has been plaguing the capital, Dhaka, for several weeks. Typically, gas pressure in the supply lines decrease significantly as early as 9.00am. That was also what had happened with Sadeka on Tuesday. "The stove just died," she said. Md Abdul Aziz Khan, managing director of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, which supplies gas to Dhaka city, told bdnews24.com, "We do not have good supply facilities in a number of areas in and around Dhaka." He explained that in areas including Jurain, Kadamtali, Keraniganj, Hazaribagh, parts of old Dhaka and Mirpur sections 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 were particularly affected because the supply lines there have 3-inch diametre. "They need to be replaced by those with 10-inch diametre. But something like that cannot be done overnight." As the gas crisis persisted for days, many citizens of those areas had begun cooking their day's meals from early morning. Sadeka exclaimed, "But that means I have to wake up at 5.00 in the morning to start cooking!" She pointed out it was not really possible every day. Wali-ul-Kabir, a private firm executive residing in Jurain, was quite annoyed with this chronic problem. "What is the point of staying in the capital then?" he asked suggesting that life in Dhaka, expensive as it was, should at least provide one with the utilities. The problem is not just limited to households but has also affected other operators dependent on gas including industrial plants running gas generators for their power supply and CNG filling stations. Aminul Islam, an engineer at a CNG filling station at Asad Gate, Mohammadpur, said the station operated with only two nozzles out of their four because the pressure was too low. "We are lucky though. There are only three CNG stations in this line." He said the pressure would have been even lower if there were more. A private car driver, Shumon, instantly agreed. His regular filling station inside the cantonment area has almost no pressure at all. "So I am always looking for stations that have a decent level of pressure to avoid refilling a couple of times every day." Officials, however, say that the crisis is not about to improve if the cold prevails since the solution requires long-term measures. Aminul said the situation was slightly better during the weekends. The Titas MD mentioned several reasons behind the crisis. The Ghorasal fertiliser factory, which has resumed operations recently, consumes about 5 percent of Dhaka's city's demand of some 800 million units of gas, which he said was one of the reasons. But the main reason was the cold spell, said Khan suggesting that the crisis would resume if there were another such bout of cold weather. "People need to heat up their foodstuff more often. People are consuming more gas to heat up water. Also the industries consume more gas to warm up their boilers and get them to work because the water is colder." Khan also said that areas close to supply points did not face the crisis. He said the situation could, however, improve if it were possible to bring more gas from Ashuganj or Bibiyana gas fields. "But supply line from the Ashuganj plant is not large enough and Bibiyana does not have a compressor." He explained that a compressor increases gas pressure and ensures smooth supply over long distances. The matter is further worsened by the prevailing power crisis for which industrial units depend on gas supply to produce their own electricity. But realising that there had to be some form of a gas rationing, Petrobangla has initiated staggered weekly holiday schedules for industrial areas to alleviate the crisis. Gas supplies will be discontinued once a week according to the staggered holiday schedule in the industries of different zones inside and around Dhaka. While the crisis seems to be over with the end of the cold spell, officials say that it could reappear with another persistent cold wave as the previous one. b
