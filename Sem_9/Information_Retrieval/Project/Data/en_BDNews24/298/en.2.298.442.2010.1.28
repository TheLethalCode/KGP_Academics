 NEW DELHI/PATNA, Jan 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violence erupted against rising food prices in Bihar, one of the country's poorest states, on Thursday, heaping more political pressure on the government to focus on inflation rather than growth and financial reform. Mobs stoned trains and jammed roads with burning tyres in eastern Bihar, trying to enforce a day-long shutdown. Shops, offices and schools remained closed on Thursday, when official data showed that food prices in Asia's third-largest economy rose an annual 17.4 percent in mid-January. At least 12 passengers were injured when angry crowds stoned a train in Hajipur town, while thousands marched in the street in different parts of the state asking shops to shutter. "Their anger is natural," said Lalu Prasad, head of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party, the state's main opposition, referring to rising food prices. Food prices have soared because last year's monsoon rains, which irrigate 60 percent of the country's farms, were the worst in 37 years. Higher prices paid by government agencies to buy grains from farmers have also helped push the headline inflation rate to 7.31 percent in December, the highest in a year. Inflation and a high fiscal deficit are major risks to the country's ambitious plan to return economic growth back to the 9 percent a year level seen between 2005/06 and 2007/08. A focus on inflation may also distract the ruling Congress party from pushing reforms such as the liberalisation of the agricultural sector that may help cut the fiscal deficit, which is projected to rise to a 16-year high of 6.8 percent of GDP in 2009/10. POLITICAL FALLOUT Food prices have been key to political survival in the past. Onion prices helped push out a state government in 1980. Now, the volatile issue has given opposition parties a handle to attack the government, giving the Bharatiya Janata Party a credible issue against the ruling party, which draws its support from a large chunk of rural poor. "Its the biggest headache for the government right now," said Saibal Gupta, secretary of Asian Development Research Institute, a private think tank. Analysts say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government needs to walk a fine line, trying to please farmers, who want higher prices for their produce, and consumers, who want prices to fall. "If (rising prices) not tackled in time ... the government may also have to suffer political reverses in states where elections are due." Local elections are scheduled in Bihar and West Bengal states over the coming year. With public anger focused on high food prices, opposition parties may disrupt parliament proceedings, further delaying debate on bills such as those on land acquisition and entry of private players into the pension sector. The budget session of parliament starts Feb. 22. The RBI has said that, while food prices are rising because of supply issues monetary policy could not address, it also needed to guard against a break-out of wider inflation pressures. Ahead of a Jan. 29 policy review, authorities seem more focused on whether to tighten monetary policy to rein in inflation at the risk of hurting an incipient recov
