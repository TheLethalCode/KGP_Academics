 By Prokash Biswas Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Fate of two heroin-smuggling cases against owners and employees of BD Foods and its sister concerns has become uncertain. The investigating officer who needed to visit the United Kingdom, where the heroin consignments were headed, to conduct further investigation and collect evidence was not allowed to do so. The Criminal Investigation Department of the police on April 21, 2006 filed the cases with Motijheel and Sutrapur police stations in Dhaka accusing BD Foods of smuggling 75.5 kilograms of heroin to the United Kingdom hidden in consignments of vegetables and floor-tiles. The first probe committee, comprising representatives of the CID, Special Branch, Rapid Action Battalion, Department of Narcotics Control and the Bangladesh Bank, sought permission from the home ministry in 2006 to go to the UK, particularly London, to collect evidence seized by the British authorities. Subsequent investigators also sought permission for visiting the UK but were rejected. Sub-inspector Sakhawat Hossain of the general recording (GR) office, a police wing that keeps records of cases, told bdnews24.com that the investigation officer could not produce the probe report before the two trial courts although the magistrates had deferred submission deadlines several times. He said the courts fixed March 1 for submission of the probe report in the case filed with Sutrapur police, and Feb 7 for the one with Motijheel. Hossain said they were appearing before the court on the fixed dates but could answer the court's queries, as they do not know about the status of the investigation. Counsel of the accused Md Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com that investigation into the cases has come to a halt. Ten persons were arrested following filing of the cases. They are BD Foods chairman Badruddoza Momen, managers Abu Bakar Siddiqui Mithu and Moinuddin, employee Nazmul Haider Bulbul, cargo worker Nayan, BD Foods sister concern Green Heaven Company's owner Abul Bashar Selim, his associate Kazi Zafar Reza, Delwar Hossain, Mizinur Bhuiyan and Imdadul Haq Azad. Of the arrested, Moinuddin, Bulbul, Nayan and Zafar confessed to their involvement in the country's largest-ever heroin haul before a magistrate, who recorded their statements under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. All the accused in the cases are now on bail. Police officials said investigation officers in the case were changed four times. It could not be ascertained whether anyone has replaced the CID inspector Shyamal Chowdhury after he was seconded to Kalihati Police Station in April last year. CID additional inspector general Shah Jamal Raj could not be reached for comment despite several visits to his office and attempts over phone in the last few days. When contacted, Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "What result will this old and rotten case bring?" CID officials said London is not interested to provide Dhaka with the evidences of heroin smuggling since Bangladeshi laws provide for death penalty for smuggling heroin over one kg. In response to Dhaka's request for evidences, the then joint chief of UK's attorney general's office, Stuart Blackley, wrote a letter on Mar 20, 2008 to the Bangladesh home secretary. Blackley, in his letter, asked for Bangladesh's commitment of not hanging the accused if convicted. Apparently this commitment was the precondition for British cooperation. Bangladesh foreign ministry in another letter to the UK High Commission in Dhaka on Sept 5, 2008 again sought their assistance reminding them of Commonwealth Scheme and Vienna Convention, which seek unconditional cooperation against drug smuggling among the signatories. In April 2006, the UK customs in a message through the British mission in Mumbai, India accused BD Foods Ltd, Emdad Traders, Jamil International, MM Enterprise, and Green Heaven Enterprise of trafficking 75.5kgs of heroin to the UK. Following the accusation, the National Board of Revenue took up an inquiry and confirmed the validity of the allegations. b
