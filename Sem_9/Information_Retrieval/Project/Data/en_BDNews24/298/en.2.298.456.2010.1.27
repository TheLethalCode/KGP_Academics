<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  A devastating seven-wicket haul from Zaheer Khan derailed Bangladesh on the fourth day of the second Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Man of the match Zaheer's career-best 7-87 helped the tourists' earn a comprehensive 10-wicket victory and a 2-nil series after the Tigers were dismissed for 312 in their second innings, which meant they only had a one-run lead. India wrapped up the match without either Virender Sehwag or Gautam Gambhir needing to use their bat because the hosts conceded 2 byes off the second ball of the post lunch session. Bangladesh began the penultimate day on 228-3 with Mohammad Ashraful and nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain both on two. And for 90 minutes the pair frustrated the world's number one Test side. They added 68 runs taking the score to 290 before Shahadat (40) was caught at long-on off Harbhajan Singh. One run later Ashraful (25), patiently batting for 65 balls while Shahadat took the attack to Indian bowlers, was undone by a beautiful Ojha delivery from round the wicket. Shakib Al Hasan who got off the mark with a six, was out trying to sweep the spinner with the score on 301. Soon their position of strength was torn to shreds in the matter of a Zaheer burst that saw the left-armer grab three wickets in a single over. He began the self-destruction when Raqibul Hasan shouldered arms to be bowled. Then the bowler defeated Mahmudullah with some late movement and a magnificent catch from Murali Vijay inches from the ground while diving to his left. Shafiul Islam was clean bowled, but thankfully Rubel Hossain avoided the hat-trick ball. Despite the carnage, Bangladesh managed to limp to lunch on 312-9 thanks to some defiance from Mushfiqur Rahim, who made sure that India would have to bat again. Zaheer, a man on fire, returned after the break to put Bangladesh out of their misery when he sent back last man Rubel Hossain. India completed formalities when Shakib's second delivery wasn't gathered cleanly by the keeper and it went for byes and with it the series. MS Dhoni's men won the first Test in Chittagong by 113
