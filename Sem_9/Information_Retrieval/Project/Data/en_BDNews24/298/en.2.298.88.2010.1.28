<TITLE> Appeals open to fugitive killers: law minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  There will be scope to appeal for the six still-fugitive former army officers convicted for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Thursday. He said the government has information about the fugitives and was working to bring them back to face justice. "The home and foreign ministries are working to bring the fugitives back. Interpol has already issued Red Alert notices against them," Shafique told reporters at the Secretariat. The Supreme Court last November upheld the previous High Court death sentences of 12 former army officers for Mujib's murder. The five detained killers, whose appeals were rejected on Nov 19 and review petitions dismissed on Wednesday, were hanged early hours Thursday at Dhaka Central Jail. Six of the original 12 are still fugitive in foreign countries including Pakistan, Canada, Libya. One fugitive died since the High Court verdict in Zimbabwe. Ahmed said the Canadian government is helping Bangladesh to return fugitive Noor Chowdhury. "Only the legal formalities are pending now," he said. He criticised countries who sheltered killers by giving political asylum. "The confessed killers should not be given political asylum. If they are indulged, crimes like killings will keep on." On complaints by lawyers of the five executed convicts that due legal process was not followed, the law minister said: "The execution was carried out by completing all legal procedures and allowing them all scope. "There are no grounds for making such allegation," he said. Shafique said the nation's 35-year wait had come to an end through the executions. Earlier in the day, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam had said the fugitive killers "would not get respite from law". "They will be brought back home," Ashraf told reporters on Thursday, hours after the executions of the five. Ruling Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury also repeated her government's pledge to bring the fugitive killers back. bd
