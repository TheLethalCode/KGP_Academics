 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com) -- Tanjim Ahmed, who resigned as state minister for home affairs last year amid various rumours, flew back home on Wednesday morning after a seven-month stay in the United States. He drove straight to his sister's Banani home to see his ailing mother from Zia International Airport. People from his Gazipur constituency were at the airport to greet Tanjim, son of the country's first prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed. ZIA police chief Shamsuddin Saleh Ahmed told bdnews24.com they had escorted Tanjim to Banani. Tanjim did not talk to the media. There was wide speculation in June last year that Tanjim would resign due to conflicts with his home minister Sahara Khatun. He left for the USA on June 9 to spend time with his family. But he did not return. A Washington-based news agency, quoting Tanjim, said that he had submitted his resignation before leaving Bangladesh. Tanjim had reportedly refused to disclose any reason for the resignation, other than "personal". But Sahara as late as July 21 had denied knowledge of his resignation, saying she only knew "he was on leave." Shamsul Haq Tuku was made state minister for home later. On Sept 10, Tanjim still abroad was included in the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs. bdnew
