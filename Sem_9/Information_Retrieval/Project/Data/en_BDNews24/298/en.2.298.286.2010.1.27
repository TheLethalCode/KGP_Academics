 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)Crowds gathered amid heightened security measures at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as a ruling was due on the review petitions of five former army officers facing death penalties for the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, set the date for the ruling after three days of hearings on the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers. Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for death-row convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, in Tuesday's hearing had again presented one of the main arguments of the defence appeal that Sheikh Mujib's killing was part of an army mutiny. "Several units of the army participated in the uprising and later the top army officers including the army chief and deputy army chief accepted the new president." "Therefore the trial should have been held under military law, not under civil law," he said. Khan Saifur continued: "I have not received a satisfactory reply from the court explaining why the killing was not an act of mutiny." "Witnesses of the state termed it a mutiny. But the judge did not accept that," he said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, state counsel Anisul Haque and special counsel Toufique-e-Newaz argued against the petitions on Tuesday. Alam said: "All grounds presented by defence for review are old ones. Each convict was directly linked with the killing." He said three courts, at different levels, had handed down the verdict based on all the evidence. "There is no scope for review." Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said: "The defence counsels failed to present any new grounds before the court for review." He said there was no major omission in the trial. During the previous two days, the court heard from Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, who argued among other points for commuting his clients' death sentences on grounds of old age. Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, also argued the death penalty was not appropriate. The appeals court on Nov 19 last year upheld the death sentences of 12 former army officers for the murder of Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding father. The conclusion of the appeals process sealed the long-drawn case proceedings of 13 years, delivering a final judgment more than three decades after the killing of the independence leader. While five, who appealed their sentences from behind bars, await their fate in jail now, another six convicts remain fugitive. The twelfth died abroad since the case first came to trial. Death warrants against the five were issued on Jan 3. According to law, death penalties must be carried out between 21-28 days following issue of the warrants. However, a death convict has the right to petition for a last review of the final judgment during this time, and for presidential clemency as a last resort. b
