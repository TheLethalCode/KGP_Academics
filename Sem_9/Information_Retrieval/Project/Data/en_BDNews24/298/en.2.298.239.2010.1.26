<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has dismissed Jamuna Group's claim that it is not occupying lands of the forest department. A statement released by the environment and forest ministry on Monday reiterated its stance that the Group did grab 4.53 acres under the forest department at Shafipur in Gazipur. "The land has been under its possession since 1999." The statement said, "Jamuna Group applied to purchase 12 kathas at Shafipur on June 22, 1998. But it grabbed the land in 1999 as the forest department did not sell the land. "Since there are 68 more encroachers in that area, it is confusing why Jamuna Group has challenged." The statement had details of the case and verdict where it said, "the claims by Daily Jugantor, a concern of the group, saying the verdict favoured Jamuna, is not true. "Jamuna kept the land under their possession violating the court order. "Two lower courts on October 23, 2005 and October 10, 2006 gave verdicts in the group's favour. "But," the statement continued, "a High Court order on March 19, 2009 stayed the orders." State minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud recently disclosed the list in parliament. Jugantor on Friday carried a news titled 'Challenge by Jamunademanding resignation of the state minister for environment upon failure to prove the case'. "The statement has been released following Jamuna Group's challenge after the forest and environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder disclosed the true information on Sunday, clarifying the issue," the ministry added. "Jugantor in its report on Monday demanded punishment of the secretary." bdn
