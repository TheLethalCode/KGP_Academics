<TITLE> SC ruling ends trial of 'the most heinous crime': state counsel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Chief state counsel Anisul Haque has said the Supreme Court's dismissal of review petitions of the five convicted killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has resolved the trial of the most heinous act of murder in the nation's history. The court on Wednesday dismissed the review petitions of five former army officers facing death penalties for the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh's founding leader. "Our fight for establishing rule of law and a fair trial has come to an end today," Haque told reporters in his reaction after the ruling. "We wanted the trial not to be vindictive, we wanted it for the establishment of rule of law," he said. Asked when the death sentences would be carried out, Haque said: "The jail authorities will execute the order according to the provision of the jail code. They will decide when." But, the chief state counsel added, going by the law the convicts should go to the gallows by January 31. Death warrants were issued against Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan on January 3. According to law, the death sentence should be executed between 21 and 28 days within the issuance of death warrants. But a death convict has the right to petition for a review of the final judgment in his case within this time and to seek presidential clemency as the last resort. All five death-row convicts submitted separate review petitions in this case, while clemency pleas of three have been rejected by the president. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, lawyer for Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, in his reaction said: "We did not get the ruling according to our expectations. "We presented certain grounds during the hearing. But the court did not take them into consideration." He said: "The convicts can seek clemency pleas to the president within seven days after receiving the copy of the verdict of the review petitions. "If the pleas are rejected the death sentence should be executed between 21 and 28 days. "If it is executed even one day before it will be unlawful," Mamun said. On rejection of three clemency pleas, the lawyer said: "There is no provision of submitting mercy petitions before the review. "If there is the provision why is a review allowed?" he asked. Attorney general Mahmubey Alam told reporters after the ruling: "The court has dismissed the review petitions. The legal procedures are now over. There is no bar in the execution of death sentences." He claimed that the trial process had been transparent. The appeals court on November 19 last year upheld the death sentences of 12 former army officers for the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's founding leader. The conclusion of the appeals process sealed the long-drawn case proceedings of 13 years, delivering a final judgment more than three decades after the killing of the independence leader. While the five, who appealed their sentences from behind the bars, await their fate in jail now, another six convicts remain fugitive. The twelfth accused died abroad since the case first came to trial. bdnews2
