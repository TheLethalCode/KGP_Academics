 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Celebrity Big Brother bows out with its final show on Britain's Channel 4 on Friday, after the broadcaster decided to axe the series amid falling ratings. The regular Big Brother, a pioneer in the successful reality TV genre with versions all over the world, also has its swansong this year as ratings shifted from the survival format to talent competitions like "The X Factor" and "Britain's Got Talent".

Goody was evicted in a public vote and Bollywood actress Shetty went on to win the series. Commentators have said that Big Brother never fully recovered from the race row, after which they said it was "watered down." Others believed the show had grown stale and failed to win over the "Facebook generation" of young viewers more likely to find their entertainment on the Internet. Estimates show that as few as around two million people tuned to some episodes of the 2009 Big Brother series, the 10th -- a fraction of its peak audience of 10 million.
