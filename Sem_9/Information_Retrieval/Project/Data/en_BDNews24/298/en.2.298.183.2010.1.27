 Japan, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)-- World No. 1 carmaker Toyota suspends sales of eight models involved in a recall last week, hitting shares and raising recovery concerns. World No. 1 automaker Toyota suspended sales of eight models involved in a recall last week, sending shares lower in Tokyo on Wednesday and raising concerns about its recovery. The carmaker, trying to rebound from billions of dollars in losses, will announce its earnings February 4. Toyota has forecast a full-year loss of over $3.5 billion, but some company-watchers expect numbers closer to break-even for the year ending in March. Auto parts supplier analyst Dan Lucas says the move may not ultimately be a major factor. SOUNDBITE: DAN LUCAS, SENIOR ANALYST, MACQUARIE "Obviously the news is not good. We're talking about a large number of models, accounting for a very large fraction of Toyota's US production, and therefore there would be an impact on the parts companies. So, yes, I was concerned about that. But, on the other hand, what I think is interesting and important is that Toyota is taking action to prevent this. And at the end of the day, if we are talking about a week's slot of production, that is not going to be a major issue for the greater scheme of things, particularly if they have enough inventory in hand." Annual combined sales of all the recalled models in North America reached 1 million units last year, over half its annual sales there. Shares of Toyota declined over 4 percent Wednesday, while the stock's value is less than half its level of February 2
