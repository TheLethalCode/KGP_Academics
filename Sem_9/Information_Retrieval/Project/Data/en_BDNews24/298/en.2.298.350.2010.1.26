 COLOMBO, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa is seeking a second term in a presidential election on Tuesday, the first national poll since a 25-year war with the Tamil Tiger separatists ended in May. Here are some key facts about Rajapaksa: The 64-year-old incumbent has spent four decades in politics. In 1970 he became the youngest legislator to enter parliament. A lawyer by training, he comes from a long line of politicians from the southern Sri Lankan district of Hambantota. He has three brothers who are serving in his administration, a fact that has led to charges of nepotism. He won his first term as president in 2005, when Sri Lanka was in the middle of a tenuous ceasefire agreement with the Tamil Tiger separatists. Peace talks yielded nothing and the president in 2006 turned to his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a retired infantry officer then serving as the defence secretary, to draw up a plan to defeat the Tigers once and for all. Rajapaksa is from the Sinhalese ethnic majority and draws the core of his support from rural Sinhalese voters. However, some have grumbled that the cost of staple foods has gone up since the end of the war. That said, others have said they are grateful because he has brought peace and security to the country after decades of suicide bombings and war. Rajapaksa made a name for himself as a human rights defender during Sri Lanka's 1987-1990 Marxist insurrection, on which the government cracked down violently. But his reputation has been seriously dented by events at the end of the Tamil Tiger war, during which thousands of civilians were killed as troops battled to corner and crush the rebels. He dismissed international criticism and calls for a last-minute ceasefire, which gave the military time to finish the war. He also promised to protect journalists and freedom of speech, but under his watch at least one prominent journalist was murdered and dozens have been beaten, arrested or forced to flee the country. Watchdog Reporters Without Borders says Sri Lanka is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. Rajapaksa, working closely with Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, has pushed hard to make Sri Lanka more business-friendly to capitalise on post-war investment opportunities in tourism, trade and infrastructure development. China and India are so far the biggest winners in the infrastructure race. Both are funding power plant construction and China is financing and building the $3 billion Hambantota port, which is along one of the world's busiest sea la
