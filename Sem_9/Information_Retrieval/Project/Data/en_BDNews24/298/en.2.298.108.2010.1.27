 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has dismissed the review petitions of five former army officers facing death penalties for the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Crowds gathered amid heightened security measures at the Supreme Court as the ruling was due on Wednesday. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, convened at around 9.25am. The bench gave its ruling within minutes, dismissing the petitions for review of the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers. Death warrants were issued against Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan on Jan 3. According to law, the death penalties must be executed between 21-28 days following issue of the warrants. However, a death convict has the right to petition for a review of the final judgment in his case during this time, and to seek presidential clemency as a last resort. All five death-row convicts submitted separate review petitions in this case, while clemency pleas of three have been rejected by the president. Wednesday's ruling came after three days of simultaneous hearings on the five review petitions. "This court dismisses the petitions for review," Islam said. The court ruled that the defence had failed to present new grounds for review of the Appellate Division judgment that upheld the death sentences. Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for Faruk and Mohiuddin Ahmed, in the previous day's hearing had again presented the central argument of the defence appeal, that Sheikh Mujib's killing was part of an army mutiny and therefore the trial should have been held under military law, not under civil law. The defence lawyer said: "I have not received a satisfactory reply from the court explaining why the killing was not an act of mutiny. Witnesses of the state termed it a mutiny. But the judge did not accept that." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, state counsel Anisul Haque and special counsel Toufique-e-Newaz argued against the petitions on Tuesday. Alam said: "All grounds presented by defence for review are old ones. Each convict was directly linked with the killing." He said three courts, at different levels, had handed down the verdict based on all the evidence. "There is no scope for review." Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said: "The defence counsels failed to present any new grounds before the court for review." He said there was no major omission in the trial. During the previous two days, the court heard from Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, who argued among other points for commuting his clients' death sentences on grounds of old age. Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for Shahriar Rashid, also argued the death penalty was not appropriate. The appeals court on Nov 19 last year upheld the death sentences of 12 former army officers for the murder of Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding father. The conclusion of the appeals process sealed the long-drawn case proceedings of 13 years, delivering a final judgment more than three decades after the killing of the independence leader. While the five, who appealed their sentences from behind bars, await their fate in jail now, another six remain fugitive. The twelfth died abroad since the case first came to trial. CLEMENCY PLEAS OF 3 REJECTED Meanwhile, clemency pleas to the president of three of the five condemned men have been rejected by president Zillur Rahman. Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin submitted mercy petitions on Jan 9. Mohammed Shafiul Alam, secretary to the president, told bdnews24.com on Jan 18 that the president had rejected the pleas. Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan have not sought clemency so far. b
