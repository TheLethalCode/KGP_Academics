<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The potentials of 'branchless banking' through use of advanced technologies were highlighted at a conference on expanding financial services in the city on Wednesday. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman told the meeting that said use of digital technologies in providing financial services could be cost-effective compared to banking operation through branches. "It could help reach the target towards financial inclusion And the cost of operation will simply halve," he said. Branchless banking would also ease the demand pressure on cash currency loans, he added. The central bank governor, however, said switching to technology-based banking would require technical assistance from the country's development partners. He assured all concerned of introducing modern technological tools to boost financial activities in the country, which would also help eradicate poverty. Atiur said: "I'll try my best to uphold financial inclusion which is people-friendly." The conference on 'Expanding financial services with new technology', was organised by UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) on Wednesday in the city. Chris Austin, DFID country representative, citing the troubles in having bank accounts in Bangladesh, said: " we can reach large number of people through use of innovative technologies. "Bangladesh is in a unique position to combine development with business for a win-win solution for millions of poor," he added. David Porteous, director of Bankable Frontier Associates, said active agents could contribute significantly towards business development. Porteous mentioned demography of the urban youth, government and spread of data-enabled mobile phones as possible forces towards expansion of technology-based banking services. Representatives from the neighbouring countries -- Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India  attended the conference and shared their experiences with the audience. bd
