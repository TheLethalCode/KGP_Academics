 Dhaka, Jan 26(bdnews24.com) ---- Senior BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury has given a strong indication that his party will join parliament, as he called on the government Tuesday to "be ready to face the opposition". "BNP has never said that it would not return to parliament. We are returning," Chowdhury said at a roundtable hosted by the Muslim League. In typically droll jibe, he said: "The ruling party has around 300 MPs while we are only 30 but they will realise that the smallest chilli packs the most heat." His call to the ruling Awami League to "make preparations to face the opposition in parliament" adds another layer to the will-they-won't-they-join debate as regards BNP. The main opposition party has been abstaining from parliament for 64 consecutive days. It briefly joined the maiden session before walking out amid a dispute over seating arrangements. It has since maintained a non-stop boycott of parliament from the budget session. BNP more recently said seating was not the issue, but rather the hostile atmosphere, and it was waiting for the government to create a more "conducive environment in parliament" for the opposition to return. The party has also presented a 10-point charter of demands for its return, including revoking a government order for cancelling the lease of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment residence and withdrawal of "unfair" cases filed against opposition leaders. Defending BNP's boycott of parliemant, Chowdhury said on Tuesday: "Awami League boycotted the house for 223 days out of a total of 373 working days during the eighth parliament, and 135 days out of 400 working days in the fifth parliament." "In comparison, we have abstained 63 days (up to Monday) out of 86 working days," he said. 'BNP PRO-PEOPLE, NOT ANTI-INDIAN' Meanwhile, Muslim League secretary Atiqul Islam presented the keynote paper in Tuesday's roundtable on 'The Prime Minister's India Tour and Gain/Loss of Bangladesh'' at the National Press Club. Dismissing the widely-held belief that BNP is an 'anti-Indian party', Chowdhury said they were not anti- Indian "but we speak out to safeguard the interests of the common people." "We protest killings on the border, and demand fair sharing of Ganges waters," he said. He also slammed the government for signing security deal with India during her recent visit to India. "It is painful when we are termed anti-Indian because of our stand to protect the country's interests," he said. 'CONSPIRACIES' Chowdhury urged the government to try former army chief Moeen U Ahmed and "other perpetrators of the 1/11 conspiracy". Directing his remarks to the prime minister, he said, "They obstructed you from entering the country after they termed you a threat to the nation." "Please bring them to book otherwise your own security will be endangered," he allged. Chowdhury also "reminded the prime minister" that not a single member of parliament or any minister resigned after her father and family members were assassinated on Aug 15, 1975. He suggested that instead of suspecting the opposition, the prime minister should keep watch on the people surrounding her to ensure her security. b
