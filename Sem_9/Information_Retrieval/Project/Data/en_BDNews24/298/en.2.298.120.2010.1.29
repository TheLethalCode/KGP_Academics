 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The gun-wielding JCD cadre, famously photographed and widely publicised during violent clashes of two groups, had served in the army previously, the police say. Syeduzzaman Pasha, a cadre of opposition BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, was photographed with his pistol during clashes between rival JCD factions on Dhaka University campus on Jan 18. Detective Branch of Police assistant commissioner Mohammed Shahidullah told bdnews24.com that Pasha was recruited into the military under swimmers' quota after his SSC examinations. "But he went absent without leave (AWOL) after six months of training, for which he dismissed." He said Pasha went back to school afterwards, and got admitted to Dhaka College. However, the police have not been able to ascertain where Pasha got his pistol from. He was sent to a three-day police remand for interrogation on Friday. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court ordered the remand upon DB of Police sub-inspector Nayeem Ahmed's petition for 10 days. The court's general recording officer, Shakhawat Hossain, told bdnews24.com that there was no lawyer for Pasha. The Dhaka metropolitan DB police arrested Pasha at Bibir Bagicha area of Jatrabari on Thursday. The clashes on DU campus left 20 people injured, including JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku. Ruling Awami League's student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League men joined the fight with JCD factions at one point of the clash. Police, however, have not been able to arrest anyone affiliated with the pro-Awami League student bodies whose pictures were also published and broadcast widely in the media. bdnews24.co
