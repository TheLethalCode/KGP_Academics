<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has demanded trial for his father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury's 'murder'. He made the statement in a reaction to the execution of the five convicts found guilty of murdering founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at Chandpur circuit house on Friday. Fazlul Quader, speaker of the undivided Pakistan as well as president of the Muslim League before Bangladesh's independence in 1971, died as a prisoner at the Dhaka Central Jail on July 18, 1973. A main opposition BNP policymaker, his son Salahuddin, an MP, said, "The Awami League essentially realised its political agenda through the trial and execution of the verdict." This was the first time that any member of the opposition or its allies, specifically the Jamaat-e-Islami, commented on the executions of president Sheikh Mujib's trial. Another BNP policymaker, Mirza Abbas, said, "I do not endorse any kind of murder. But at the same time I cannot endorse hanging one or someone's unnatural death." The two leaders had gone to Chandpur to attend the local BNP's bi-yearly convention. Chowdhury inaugurated the proceedings at the municipal Eidgah at about 1.00pm. Mirza Abbas attended as chief guest. At the inaugural session in the evening, Chowdhury, addressing prime minister Sheikh Hasina, asked, "You executed the five convicted of Bangabandhu's murder. What about those behind the murder. Why do not you try those quarters too?" He went on to say that a number AL leaders were close to the government lasting until November of 1975 from the the murder of August 15. Some of them were still high up within the Awami League and even had positions of advisor to the prime minister. "That is the biggest threat to the prime minister's security." He said the judges of the country acted like 'Rajakars'collaboratorsfor the last two years of the state of emergency when a military-controlled interim government was in power; and now they have turned into freedom fighters. "The nation will not forgive them." He was apparently referring to the role of the judiciary during the military-controlled regime and its role now that the Awami League is in power. Chowdhury was critical of the repeal of the Fifth Amendment of the constitution. "The court was supposed to hear a case regarding the ownership of movie theatre and it ends up revoking an entire amendment." The BNP policymaker said courts had not been delegated with the responsibility of modifying the country's laws. He approved of the government's move to try war criminals and said he thought that enlisting all the war criminals was a good idea. But he cautioned suggestively that this list of criminals should not be longer than that of freedom fighters. Regarding BNP's joining the parliament Chowdhury said the opposition would certainly join if the government created such an environment. bdnews2
