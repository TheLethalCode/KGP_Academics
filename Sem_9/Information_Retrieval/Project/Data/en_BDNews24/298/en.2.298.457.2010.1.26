The pair have put on so far 186 runs for the second wicket, which is a record for any wicket for Bangladesh, after losing their first wicket on 19. India declared their first innings during the lunch break on 544 for eight, which gave them an overall lead of 311. Tamim was batting on 142 and Junaid Siddique made 50. Tamim whose previous best was 134, completed the fastest hundred by a Bangladesh batsman after tea. Batting on 98, he brought up the milestone off 101 balls with an attempted hook shot off Zaheer Khan that went for four.

India got stuck into the hosts straight after lunch when they dismissed opener Imrul Kayes with the scoreboard on 19.
