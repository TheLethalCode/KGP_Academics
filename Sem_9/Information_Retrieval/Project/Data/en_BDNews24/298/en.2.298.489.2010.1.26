 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has set Wednesday for a ruling on the review petitions of five former army officers facing death penalties for the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, set the date after three days of hearings on the petitions for review of the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers. The bench began the third day's proceedings on Tuesday at 9:10am. The court heard from the prosecution after the defence counsels concluded their arguments. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, state counsel Anisul Haque and special counsel Toufique-e-Newaz argued for rejection of the petitions. The court adjourned proceedings at 11am, saying it would give a ruling the following day. Defence counsels had presented their arguments during the previous two days. Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, argued among other points for commuting his clients' death sentences on grounds of old age. Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, said the death penalty was not appropriate. Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, repeated one of the main arguments of the defence appeal that Sheikh Mujib's killing was part of an army mutiny. The appeals court on Nov 19 last year upheld the death sentences of 12 former army officers for the murder of Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding father. The conclusion of the appeals process sealed the long-drawn case proceedings of 13 years, delivering a final judgment more than three decades after the killing of the independence leader. While five, who appealed their sentences from behind bars, await their fate in jail now, another six convicts remain fugitive. The twelfth died abroad since the case first came to trial. Death warrants against the five were issued on Jan 3. According to law, death penalties must be carried out between 21-28 days following issue of the warrants. However, a death convict has the right to petition for a last review of the final judgment during this time, and for presidential clemency as a last resort. b
