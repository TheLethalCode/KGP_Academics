 WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Osama bin Laden's claim of responsibility for the Dec. 25 bombing attempt on a US-bound airplane was a grab for "reflected glory" and not a sign he was behind the plot, a US official said on Monday. In an audiotape aired on Al Jazeera television on Sunday, a man purporting to be the fugitive al Qaeda leader praised the Nigerian man accused of the Christmas Day bomb attempt and vowed more strikes at the United States.
