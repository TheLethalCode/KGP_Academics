 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnewsw24.com)--Bodies of five captured killers of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman are being taken to their ancestral homes after their hanging at the Dhaka Central Jail in the space of an hour. Five ambulances drove into the heavily guarded prison at 2:20am after the execution and collected the bodies. Many of the onlookers gathered outside the jail on Nazimuddin Road hurled shoes at the cars in a show of hatred towards the five former army officers. RAB and police members came out with the corpse of Syed Faruk Rahman half an hour later and headed for his family graveyard in Naogaon. Security personnel then started for Chuadanga with Bazlul Huda's body, Brahmanbaria with Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan's, and for Patuakhali with Mohiuddin Ahmed and A K M Mohiuddin's bodies. The ambulances are escorted by RAB and police. bdne
