 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister says chances are few that appeals of the six fugitive former army officers convicted of killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be accepted in the court. According to the law, one has to specify valid reasons for each day of delay for filling an appeal. "I do not think there would be any significant reasons...so, as a lawyer I think their appeals would be not accepted," Shafique Ahmed told the media on Friday, emerging from the annual general meeting of Bangladesh Registration Services Association. The government is making efforts to identify where the absconding killers are and to bring them back, he said. "An Interpol Red Alert has been issued and talks through the diplomatic channels are going on." The Supreme Court last November upheld the previous High Court death sentences of 12 former army officers for the assassination of the nation's founding father. The five detained killers, whose appeals were rejected on Nov 19 and review petitions dismissed on Wednesday, were hanged in the early hours of Thursday at Dhaka Central Jail. They were Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. Six of the original 12 are still fugitive in foreign countries including Pakistan, Canada and Libya. One of the fugitives, Abdul Aziz Pasha, reportedly died after the High Court verdict in Zimbabwe.
