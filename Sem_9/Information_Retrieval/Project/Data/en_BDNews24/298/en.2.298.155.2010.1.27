 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)--State minister for labour and employment Mannujan Sufian on Wednesday told parliament that some Bangladeshi women workers were being abused abroad. Replying to a question from Sanjida Khanam, the junior minister said the government was trying to check the exploitation of women through immoral activities. "This is fact that some of our women are forced to do immoral activities in the destination countries," Sufian said. "The government has been trying to stop the abuse of women there." She said the government had already talked to the recruiting agents to stop the human rights violation. Answering to another question, Sufian told parliament that the government would cancel the licence of the recruiting agents if they were found to be involved in sending Myanmar's Rohingya refugees overseas with Bangaldesh passport.
