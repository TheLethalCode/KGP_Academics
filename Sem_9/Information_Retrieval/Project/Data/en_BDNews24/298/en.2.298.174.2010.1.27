 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)The executions of five former army officers, facing death for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, will be carried out by Jan 31, and the two who have yet to seek clemency must submit mercy pleas "immediately", law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Wednesday. He made the announcement at a press conference after a meeting with the home minister, inspector general of prisons and other concerned officials, on the heels of the Supreme Court's dismissal of review petitions of the convicted killers. Crowds had gathered amid heightened security measures at the court premises in the morning as the ruling was due. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, convened at around 9.25am. The bench gave its ruling within minutes, dismissing the petitions for review of the appeals court's judgment last November that upheld death sentences of the convicted killers. Shafique Ahmed, after the ruling, said: "Everything is explained in detail in the jail code about the execution now. Jail authorities will take measures accordingly." Asked about the two remaining convicts who did not submit clemency petitions, he had said: "They have been already informed of the Supreme Court ruling. They will have to submit mercy petitions immediately as per law." Chief state counsel Anisul Haque, following the ruling, also said the two remaining convicts had yet the scope to submit clemency pleas but would have to do so soon. "The provision of submitting mercy petitions between seven and 15 days following the dismissal of review petitions will not be applicable here. "They will have to submit mercy petitions immediately," Haque said. Haque said: "The executions should be carried out between 21 and 28 days from the day of issuance of release of the original Supreme Court judgment and issuance of death warrants. "The countdown has begun from Jan 3. There is no legal bar in carrying out the executions by Jan 31," he said. On whether the time taken to hear on the review petitions would be subtracted from the 21-28 days, Haque said nothing is said in the jail code about review petitions. The law minister was asked if the convicts submit clemency petitions to the president whether it would be possible to resolve them by Jan 31. He said: "If they submit petitions immediately it will be possible to resolve them by the deadline." Home minister Sahara Khatun, who was also present during the briefing, said law enforcers had been directed to take tight security measures across the country at this sensitive time. She declined to reveal the types of security measures. Khatun was asked whether the intelligence agencies had received any information of subversive acts. She said: "Will it be right to disclose them if they had? I cannot do that as a home minister." b
