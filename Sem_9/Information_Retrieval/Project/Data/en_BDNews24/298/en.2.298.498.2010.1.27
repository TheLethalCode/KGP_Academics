 EAST LONDON, South Africa, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mickey Arthur resigned as South Africa coach because of a disagreement with the Cricket South Africa (CSA) board over the team's future, he said Wednesday. "Differences have arisen between the board and me on the way forward and I don't believe I can take the team forward in the present circumstances," Arthur told a news conference the day after his shock resignation ahead of a tour of India. "My vision of how to go forward with the team was clear, but the board's was different. I've always run a tight management and team, but the CSA board of directors want structural changes." The 41-year-old had been in charge of the national team since May 2005 and his resignation Tuesday has forced the Proteas to install Corrie van Zyl as interim coach for the upcoming two-Test and three one-day international tour of India. CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said the major stumbling block between the board and Arthur was that the coach wanted to be in charge of appointing his support staff. "In the last few years, the coach has been able to appoint his own staff, but after speaking to the players, the board felt changes were necessary," he said. "Mickey did not believe that if these changes were made, he'd be able to choose his own people, so he moved on." DISAPPOINTING RESULTS Majola added that after a successful 2008 which led to South Africa rising to the top of the Test and limited-overs rankings, the board was unhappy with the team's results in 2009. They lost a home series to Australia, bowed out in the semi-finals of the ICC World Twenty20, were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions Trophy, lost a limited-overs series against England and then the second Test, which eventually led to them sharing the series. "Mickey's resignation came through the normal stock-taking process which followed the England home series and against the backdrop of the disappointing results of 2009," said Majola. "As this process unfolded and remedies were sought, Mickey expressed the very honest and humble view that he did not believe that at this stage he could continue as coach of the Proteas." Majola denied media speculation that Arthur had failed transformation targets in terms of selecting black players set by the CSA board. "Mickey's resignation is not for any reasons of transformation. As far as we are concerned, he achieved his targets, which are measured over a period of time and not just over one test." South Africa did not field a single black African player in the last two Tests against England once Makhaya Ntini was dropped after the first two Tests. South Africa captain Graeme Smith denied reports Arthur's resignation was due to a breakdown in their relationship. "Mickey brought a lot of stability and calmness to the team and, having worked so closely together, it was disappointing, it hurt me, to hear the media telling everybody our relationship had broken down," Smith, who sat next to Arthur and at one stage rested his head on his shoulder, told the news conference. "I can tell you we spoke a few times on the telephone yesterday, so much for our relationship being irreparably damaged, we had a very healthy relationship and I gave him my full suppo
