 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)--Speculations are rife that the death sentences will be executed sometime early Thursday morning as all the formalities were concluded with unusual alacrity. There has not been any official word, however. Within about 10 hours of a review petition's rejection by a Supreme Court bench on Wednesday morning, the fate of the convicts was sealed. A four-member special bench of the Appellate Division, headed by the Chief Justice, at 9.27am gave the ruling rejecting the review petitions of the five former military officers, also freedom fighters, convicted for the murder of Bangabandhu. The hearing took all of two minutes, beginning at 9.25, to deliberate and finally reject the petitions. A high-level meeting of policy makers and civil servants began at noon and continued for almost three hours. This meeting, attended by the law and home ministers, the state ministers for home and law, inspector general of prisons, the chief prosecutor of the Bangabandhu murder case, the home secretary and the acting law secretary, among others, apparently decided on the course of action, according to sources privy to what transpired in the meeting. The law minister, Shafique Ahmed, refused to be specific, telling the press that the sentences would be executed within Jan 31, emerging from that meeting shortly after 3.00pm. He cited the jail code that executions had to be carried out between three and four weeks of issuance of the death warrants which came on Jan 3. Jail authorities then called relatives of the five convicts on death row to come and visit. In a departure from regular practice, the death row convicts were allowed to remain with their families well into the evening, till about 8.00pm, according to sources in the Dhaka Central Jail as well as the family members themselves. In the meantime, Syed Faruk Rahman wrote his mercy petition addressed to the president. The petition, sent through the prisons authorities to the home ministry and seen by bdnews24.com correspondent Prodip Chowdhury, travelled at double-quick speed to the president through the Prime Minister's Office. Says Prodip Choudhury: "The petition was received and despatched by the home and law ministries virtually within minutes as all relevant top civil servants were present there in the minister's office. "It was merely a matter of signing a piece of paper and handing it to the person across the table." A Bangabhaban source confirmed bdnews24.com that president Zillur Rahman had rejected Faruk's mercy petition at about 7.30pm. Another death row convict, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, did not petition the president for mercy, according to the source in Bangabhaban. The clemency pleas of the other three jailed convicts  AKM Mohiuddin, Mohiuddin Ahmed and Bazlul Huda  had already been rejected by the president earlier this month. The Bangabhaban source told our correspondent to wear enough warm clothes. "It's going to be cold tonight." A highly-placed prisons source told bdnews24.com around 10pm that coffins "have been boug
