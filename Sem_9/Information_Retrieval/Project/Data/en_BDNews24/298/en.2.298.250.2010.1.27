 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Barrister Moudud Ahmed on Wednesday termed the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution "worse than martial law". Moudud, lawyer for BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, made the observation during a Supreme Court hearing on petitions against repeal of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, was hearing the petitions on Wednesday filed by Delwar and three Supreme Court lawyersMunshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyanseeking a stay on a 2005 High Court judgment that declared the amendment illegal. The court adjourned proceedings until Thursday. During the previous day's hearing, the court observed that the state should have measures in place to prevent future imposition of martial law and military rule. Moudud said on Wednesday: "The Fifth Amendment was passed to supersede the Fourth Amendment." The Fourth Amendment gave Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League validity, banning all other political parties, in effect bringing about a one-party rule. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  following the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujib. Moudud said BNP founding leader and late president Ziaur Rahman came to power by the mandate of the people. "The Fifth Amendment was passed in parliament during his regime." The previous day, he had also argued that the Fifth Amendment would not have been needed if the Fourth Amendment was not passed. "If the Fifth Amendment was not passed, fundamental rights, freedom of the judiciary and the newspaper would not exist in the country. "The nation would never have got rid of the stain of the Fourth Amendment," he said. He also said the Fifth Amendment was given validity in parliament. "The court has no authority to give direction on it or revoke it." The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The High Court in its ruling to revoke the amendment exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government between August 15 1975 right up to the 1991 national elections were unconstitutional. bdne
