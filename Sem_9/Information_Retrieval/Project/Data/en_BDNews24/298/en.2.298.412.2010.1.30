 Keraniganj, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)A youth was beaten to death on Saturday in Keraniganj Upazila southwest of capital Dhaka after local people suspected him to be a terrorist. The victim, 23-year-old Al Amin, used to live at Khejurbagh in south Keraniganj and was from Tongibari of Munshiganj. "Locals beat him up at around 9:30am and left him dead on the spot," sub-inspector of South Keraniganj Police Station Md Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com. Police recovered the dead body at around 10:15am. "A businessman called Kamal was murdered at Khejurbagh last month. The attack might have been carried out suspecting Amin's involvement in that murder," said Moniruzzaman. But Amin's name is not on the list of defendants of the case filed over Kamal's murder, he said. Locals brought out an anti-terrorism procession after the incident. Some of Amin's relatives also took part in the procession, said locals. Asked if there was any allegation of terrorism against Amin, another sub-inspector, Kabir Hossain, could not provide any information right away. "I am trying to find out if there is any allegation of terrorism against him," he said to bdnews24.com. bd
