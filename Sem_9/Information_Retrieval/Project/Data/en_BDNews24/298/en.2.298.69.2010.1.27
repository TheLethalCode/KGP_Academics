<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were all out for 312, to lead by only one run after lunch on the fourth day of the second Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. The hosts lost six wickets in a dramatic session before lunch to leave them on 312-9, to lead by only one run on the fourth day of the second Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. For over an hour the tourists were frustrated by the overnight pair of Shahadat Hossain and Mohammad Ashraful, who resumed on 228-3. But the fourth-wicket partnership, which added 68 runs, was finally broken when nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain was caught at long-on for 40 off Harbhajan Singh. The hosts then lost Ashraful one run later after he made a patient 65-ball 25. He was undone by the turn and bounce from an Ojha delivery. Shakib Al Hasan who got off the mark with a six, was out trying to sweep with the score on 301. Raqibul Hasan was dismissed shouldering arms to be bowled by Zaheer Khan, who then induced an edge from Mahmudullah. Shafiul Islam was clean bowled but thankfully Rubel Hossain avoided the hat-trick ball. Zaheer bagged six wickets, it was his best bowling perform
