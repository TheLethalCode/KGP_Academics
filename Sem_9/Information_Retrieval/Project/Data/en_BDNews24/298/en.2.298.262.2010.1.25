 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has asked the opposition to join the parliament and contribute effectively. "I am asking the opposition to join the parliament so that they can play an effective role," he told parliament at the beginning of the fourth session on Monday. He said, "Tolerance is a hallmark of functional democracy. We have to evaluate the others' opinion for the greater interest of the country across the political divide." "Come to parliament and say what you have to," he added. Democracy will be further strengthened by means of mutual respect, Hamid said. He greeted all the members of the parliament on the anniversary of the parliament's first year. "The first one year of the ninth parliament, with your full support, was very significant." The speaker said all the standing committees had been formed in the first session, which had happened for the first time in the history of Bangladesh. "The committees, where the opposition members also participated, played effective roles which increased the accountability of the ministries and government agencies." Until Thursday, the parliament had 95 working days, Hamid said. He said during the sessions 91 bills were tabled where 69 were passed. The total number of submitted notices was 3,821, while 171 were accepted and discussions sere held on 128 notices. Notices under rule 71 (Ka) were 1,004. As many as 203 notices were submitted under rule 62, among which 112 were resolved. Sixteen notices were served under rule 147 and six of those were finalised, he added. A total of 1,114 notices on questions for the prime minister's answers were submitted so far where answers were given to 128. Among the 15,965 questions for the ministers, 7,031 were answered. The parliament also passed two decision proposals, he added. In 2009, 31 parliamentary delegations joined conferences in many different countries, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) summits. Bangladesh had regained its postponed CPA membership during this time, the speaker said. bdnews
