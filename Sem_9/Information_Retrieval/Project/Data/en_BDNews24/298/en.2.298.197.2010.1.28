 Rajshahi University, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com) Police detained a newsman on Thursday for cursing at the prime minister over the executions of five jailed convicts for the murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Md Humayun Kabir, Rajshahi bureau chief of the daily Khabar Patra, was heard using abusive language against the prime minister while reading about the executions in the morning, police said. Kabir was picked up from the Rajshahi University's public relations office, Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain told reporters. Shafiqul Islam, an assistant in the PR office, told bdnews24.com that the newsman came to the office at around 9.00am in connection with some advertisement, when he picked up a newspaper, read the news of executions and began cursing at the PM audibly. As Shafiqul Islam and the office director Khandaker Habibur Rahman Mukul protested, Humayun had a row with them too. He apparently also threatened people on his cellphone to "shut down the university in five minutes". Later, when officials informed the university authorities about the incident, Humayun was stopped at the gate of the administrative building. Pro vice-chancellor Muhammad Nurullah arrived on the spot and, after hearing an account of the events, ordered that he be detained until police arrived. Subsequently, RU proctor Md Zakaria intervened and arranged for handing Humayun Kabir over to Motihar Police Station. He said, "Humayun was detained and handed over to the police as he was allegedly making indecent comments about the PM." Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com that Humayun was been detained "as he was heard cursing the PM". He said "appropriate measures" would be taken after the RU authorities notified them about the untoward incident in writing. bdn
