 DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global climate talks may have to continue into 2011 after failing last month to agree on a Kyoto successor, the UN's climate chief Yvo de Boer, told Reuters on Friday. A lack of trust and the economic crisis complicated prospects for a global climate deal in Mexico at a December meeting, said President Felipe Calderon, the prospective host of those talks.

The UN's de Boer said countries must arrange additional meetings this year, in addition to the two already timetabled in Bonn in June, and then in Mexico if they wanted agreement. De Boer said he was "very happy" to receive confirmation yesterday from the United States that it had beaten a Jan. 31 deadline to submit formally its planned carbon cuts, to be written into a non-binding "Copenhagen Acco
