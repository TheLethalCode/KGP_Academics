<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League is breathing fresh leadership into the grassroots-level district and upazila committees like the central committee. Ahead of the party's extended council on Saturday, general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said at a media briefing on Friday, "Leaders will be chosen from grass-roots level and new leadership will come. It will rejuvenate the party." Party president prime minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the drive to recruit members and renew memberships in the extended council. "Council of district and upazila levels will be held after the drive is over. The whole procedure will take nearly three years." Hasina had brought in new leadership in the national council held in the middle of last year and also introduced fresh faces in the government. He also revealed that many 'important' political and organisational decisions would be taken in the extended council. But he refused to shed light on their nature and said, "Everyone will be informed after the decisions are taken." The first part of the extended council will start at the party president's Dhanmondi office, presided over by AL presidium member and deputy leader in parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury. The final part, presided over by Hasina, would commence a hour later at Ganabhaban. The last extended council was held in May 2008. bdn
