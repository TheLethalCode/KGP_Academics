<TITLE> Protests as UK's Blair appears at Iraq War inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters chanting "Tony Blair, war criminal" gathered outside the London inquiry into the Iraq War on Friday, where the former British prime minister was to publicly explain why he backed the US-led invasion in 2003. The decision to send 45,000 British troops to Iraq was the most controversial of Blair's 10-year premiership, provoking huge protests, divisions within his Labour Party and accusations he had deceived the public about the justification for war. Seven years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and almost three years after Blair handed over to Gordon Brown, the issue still provokes deep anger. Families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in Iraq joined about 100 anti-war demonstrators chanting and waving placards outside the building hosting the inquiry in central London. Blair arrived early and entered by a back door amid heavy security and large numbers of police on standby. "The real question Tony Blair needs to answer in the end will be at The Hague and before a war crimes tribunal," said Andrew Murray, chairman of Stop the War Coalition. "He is an accomplished actor but I think most people have long since seen through the script." Blair's appearance will not only affect his own personal legacy but still has the potential to damage the Labour government of his successor Brown, who was finance minister during the war. Some Labour leaders fear it will reignite strong feelings on the issue among voters, denting support for a party already trailing the Conservatives in polls in the run-up to an election due by June. "It's a pivotal day for him, for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world," said Anthony Seldon, a political commentator and biographer of Blair. "This is an enormous day and it goes way beyond him and his own reputation." "DODGY DOSSIER" The inquiry is likely to focus on the public justification the government gave for war, notably a dossier published in September 2002 when Blair said intelligence had "established beyond doubt" that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD). No such weapons were ever found. The inquiry has already heard from senior civil servants who said intelligence in the days before the March 20, 2003 invasion indicated that Saddam's WMD had been dismantled. It will also examine the war's legitimacy and at what stage Blair, now an international envoy to the Middle East, promised U.S. President George W. Bush that Britain would support military action against Iraq. Witnesses have suggested Blair gave that assurance in 2002 although then-Attorney General Peter Goldsmith, the government's top lawyer who eventually gave the invasion the green light, had warned him that using force for regime change would be illegal. Goldsmith told the inquiry he originally believed the United Nations had to approve the use of force and only changed his mind a month before the invasion. The two top lawyers at the time at the Foreign Office have also said they had told the government the war would be unlaw
