 BRASILIA, Jan 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was briefly hospitalized for high blood pressure and canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, his office said on Thursday. Television images showed the 64-year-old Lula, visibly tired and dressed in a white track suit, saying goodbye to doctors as he left hospital in the northeastern city of Recife.

His blood pressure was much higher than usual and he was taken to hospital, where the results of exams were normal, it said. Lula, who has earned praise for fighting social inequality while pursuing market-friendly policies, was due to receive the Global Statesmanship Award in Davos, Switzerland. The former factory worker won investor confidence in 2003 by abandoning decades of left-wing rhetoric in favor of pragmatic economic policies, including a free-floating exchange rate, fiscal discipline and an inflation-targeting regime. Tax breaks, low-cost credits and an increased minimum wage have helped Brazil emerge from a brief recession in the second quarter of last year.
