 Rajshahi, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The police charged batons on students of the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology on Friday, leaving at least 15 including a teacher, injured. The Dhaka-Rajshahi highway link was also blocked from 2.00pm due to the clash between students and police. Ratan, student of the university's electrical department's 2005 batch, said students of his batch brought out a procession with three-four horse carriages in the city to celebrate their completion of studies. A Shyamoli Paribahan bus hit one of the horse carriages near the city's main bus terminal and six passengers of the carriage were injured. The students got into an argument with transport workers over the accident. Later they sat with worker's union leaders at the terminal to settle the matter. Leaders and workers allegedly attacked the students there and chased them. The students escaped and went back to their campus. They took out processions protesting against the incident and laid siege to the Dhaka-Rajshahi highway in front of the campus. The students tried to break a Shymoli Paribahan counter at Kazla but were stopped by Salim Hossain, a teacher of the electrical department. The police charged baton on the mob at this time and Salim, along with several students, was injured. After the police action, students took position inside the campus and hurled brickbats at the police. The police then forced their way into the campus and again charged batons on the students. Nearly 20 students were injured at this time. After this, students brought out a procession demanding resignation of the vice chancellor and wrecked a pick-up van, card phone booth and a number of notice boards. Later they threw brickbats at the vice-chancellor's residence. In response, the police fired 8-10 tear gas shells. Assistant police commissioner Mrinal Kanti Roy, officer in charge of Motihar Police Station Tofazal Hossain were present during police action. The clash is ongoing and the highway link is still out. RUET VC Dr Shirajul Islam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "Students have been asked to calm down. The police force has also been requested to leave campus." Assistant commissioner Roy had no comments. bdnew
