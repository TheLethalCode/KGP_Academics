<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government to give appointments within three months to another 652 civil service candidates, who passed the 27th BCS exams in 2005 but were later disqualified. The bench of justice Miftahuddin Chowdhury and justice Abu Bakar Siddiqui gave the order on Tuesday on a petition by a group of "deprived" candidates. It follows a previous order on Nov 11 last for appointment of 169 candidates. The results of the first round 27th BCS exams, held in 2005, were published in January 2007. The Public Service Commission cancelled the results, however, on allegations of irregularities and held a fresh round of viva voce exams. The viva voce for those who had passed the written test was re-taken, based on which 1,154 candidates who had passed the first time round were failed the second time. The failed candidates, calling themselves "deprived" and protesting the "unfair treatment", have lobbied the authorities to appoint them and filed petitions with the High Court against the PSC decision. b
