<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to float a quarter of the shares in public mobile-phone entity Teletalk in the capital market, the telecommunications minister announced in parliament on Tuesday. "We have decided in principle to float 25 percent of its shares, but we do not have a specific dateline for the beginning the process," Raziuddin Ahmed Razu said while replying to a question from Noagaon-6 MP Md Israfil Alam. Alam asked him if Teletalk would be privatised. The government is considering a proposal to operate jointly with Viettel, the public mobile operator of Vietnam, Razu added. Replying to a supplementary question, he said Teletalk achieved some 1.25 lakh connections in the last three months. "It will not stop, rather will compete with the private telecom companies at a higher level. China has already sanctioned loans while many foreign companies have showed interest". Razu said Teletalk had been lagging because of conspiracies during the tenure of BNP-led alliance government, adding that the incumbent government has initiated measures to revive the company. "Mobile service is available in the Chittagong Hill Tracts areas. People of that area can now contact with the outer world," he added. Teletalk's network coverage has been expanded to another 22 upazilas from Lama in Bandarban in the last six months while network has been widened at Baghaichharhi by setting up a BBS (Bulletin Board System), the minister said.
