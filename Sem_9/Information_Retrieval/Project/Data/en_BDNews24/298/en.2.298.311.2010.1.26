 HONG KONG, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five pro-democracy lawmakers quit Hong Kong's legislature on Tuesday to trigger by-elections they say will serve as a referendum on universal suffrage, despite a warning from Beijing that the plan was unlawful. The legislators -- Alan Leong and Tanya Chan of the Civic Party and activist "long hair" Leung Kwok-hung, Albert Chan and former radio talkshow host Raymond Wong from the League of Social Democrats -- say their resignation will turn the by-elections in five districts into a "de facto referendum" on democracy. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council said earlier this month the plan was unconstitutional and posed a "blatant challenge" to Beijing's authority. Opinion polls have shown waning public support for the plan, and even pro-democracy groups are split over the strategy. The influential Democratic Party decided not to participate. Hong Kong's pro-Beijing and pro-establishment forces including the Liberal Party have said they will boycott the by-elections, making it harder for the parties contesting the polls to portray them as a legitimate referendum. "Some people say we're causing an uprising," said Audrey Eu, a lawmaker and spokeswoman for the groups backing the referendum plan. "No, all we're doing is ... to fight for democracy." Hong Kong's markets have been unruffled by the controversy. Since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, pro-democracy groups have been sparring with Beijing to try to secure universal suffrage, as guaranteed in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law. China has promised to allow a direct vote for the city's leader in 2017, but many democrats remain sceptical Beijing will allow this without first tweaking electoral rules to make it difficult for opposition figures to win power. "What we're trying to do is to give an opportunity back to the people to vote for real democracy, to vote for abolition of functional constituencies," said Eu, referring to largely pro-administration special interest groups that make up half of the legislature's 60 seats. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Donald Tsang said in a statement he "deeply regrets" the resignations, while calling them an abuse of the by-election mechanism and a waste of taxpayers' money. The cost of the by-elections has been estimated by the government to be around HK$150 million ($19.2 million). The bowtie-wearing Tsang added, however, that while his administration refused to recognise the referendum, it would abide by existing laws and allow the by-elections to be h
