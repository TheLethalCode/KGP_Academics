<TITLE> Govt to ask micro-lenders to cut rate to 30% </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)--The government will ask the micro-credit providers to slash their interest rate to maximum 30 percent, according to the finance minister. A M A Muhith told parliament on Tuesday they reach loans on the doorsteps of their clients and so, their interest rate is high. Micro-credit Regulatory Authority has tasked a research institute to recommend ways to cut the lending rates, he said, replying to a written question of Sirajganj-4 MP Mohammad Shafiqul Islam. "Upon the research findings, the government will suggest that micro-credit providers bring the interest rates down to a reasonable level." Answering a supplementary query, the minister said there is no plan to dole out interest-free loan among the disadvantaged people, because it will put pressure on the budget. Many poor and marginal farmers do not get loan easily and when they do, they face many hassles. Even they do not get all the loan, which they deserve, because of irregularities and the government was taking steps to address them, he said. Some state and privately-owned banks are providing loans for going abroad on easy terms, he said in reply to a question made by MP Mohammad Fazlul Azim. The World Bank lends Bangladesh on Tk 0.75 interest rate on easy terms and the loans are to be repaid in 40 years, not 10 years, according to him. The government is trying to rein in some rogue companies in the share market that neither hold annual general meeting nor give dividend. But, the government does not want to enforce law everywhere, he told parliament. "There are 83 companies in the Z category who neither hold annual general meeting nor give dividend." "Our capital market is limited. We are trying to revitalise it. Still, the capital market is failing to bring in investment," Muhith said. b
