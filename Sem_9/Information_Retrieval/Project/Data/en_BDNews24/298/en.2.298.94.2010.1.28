 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)Barrister Moudud Ahmed fears if the Fifth Amendment to the constitution is revoked, Islamist parties will lose the right to do politics and lean towards underground militancy. Moudud, lawyer for BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, expressed the fear on Thursday during a Supreme Court hearing on petitions against the repeal of the Fifth Amendment. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, heard the petitions for the fifth day before adjourning until Sunday. Delwar and three pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Supreme Court lawyersMunshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyanfiled the pleas seeking a stay on a 2005 High Court judgment that declared the amendment illegal. The Awami League-led government withdrawing the appeal for a stay on the High Court ruling prompted the petitions. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  following the 1975 assassination of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Moudud said: "The Fifth Amendment should be upheld for the sake of national interest and social unity. Islam has been acknowledged as the state religion through this amendment. He alleged that the government was trying to revoke the amendment being politically hostile. "They are now bringing the issue of secularism. They are now trying to erase Islam from the constitution though they have come to power exploiting Islam." Moudud, who was a minister in the governments of military rulers Ziaur Rahman and HM Ershad, said: "Martial law has killed democracy most of the time. Therefore it should be stopped forever." The court said: "We also want the military rule to be stopped forever. The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, it declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The ruling exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government between August 15 1975 right up to the 1991 national elections were unconstitutional. On Wednesday, Moudud termed the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution "worse than martial law". The day before, the court observed that the state should have measures in place to prevent future imposition of martial law and military rule. b
