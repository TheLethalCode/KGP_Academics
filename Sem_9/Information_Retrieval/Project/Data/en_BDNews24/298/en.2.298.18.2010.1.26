<TITLE> Petition over DCC wards 'intentional', says election official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  An election commissioner has termed filing of a petition seeking fresh demarcations of Dhaka City Corporation wards, just days before the announcement of the poll schedule is due, as motivated. "Filing of this writ petition at a time when the EC is ready to hold the DCC elections is intentional. We believe it is aimed at holding back the polls," commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at the Election Commission on Tuesday. He feared the petition proceedings in the High Court would delay the elections, which are two and a half years overdue. The High Court on Monday issued a rule nisi on the government and the chief election commissioner asking them to explain within four weeks why they should not demarcate the DCC wards based on the latest population census. Shamim Molla, claiming to be a concerned Dhaka city voter of Khilkhet, filed the petition seeking orders for fresh ward demarcations. Election officials have said the schedule for DCC polls will be announced in mid-February and the elections held in March. They have also stressed that the commission does not want further delay in the crucial vote. Sakhawat said on Tuesday that if anybody was genuinely concerned that Dhaka city wards be demarcated on the latest census, they might have filed such a petition two years ago. He urged all to refrain from filing such petitions "in the greater interest", pointing out that elections to some union councils have been overdue for 18-20 years due to litigations. Regarding the EC's reply to the rule, Sakhawat said they are yet to receive the High Court order. "We'll let you know our position once we receive it." He said the EC has plans to hold all overdue local government elections. Polls will be first held to union parishads, or councils, of the coastal and haor areas, whose tenures have expired, he added. bd
