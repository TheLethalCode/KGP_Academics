 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)--An official and four players of Nepal were injured only three and a half hours before the South Asian Games when a lift crashed at a hotel in Dhaka. Marketing manager Mahbub Ullah of Hotel Imperial in Gulistan told bdnews24.com that accident occurred at around 12:30pm. The five, two of them severely injured, were rushed to Square Hospital. Members of the Nepalese judo and weightlifting teams competing in the Games were staying in the hotel. He said 21 people had boarded the 13-passenger lift. He rejected allegations that the accident happened due to cables snapping and said the lift mechanism failed due to excess weight and the elevator fell to the ground. There were no fatalities thanks to the spring jerky system of the lift, Mahbub Ullah added. But scouts members assigned as guides of the Nepalese team dismissed the claim of eight extra passengers riding the lift and said that it had crashed after the fourteenth passenger had got in. The injured players are Radha Devi Rai, Debu Thapa, Kuluman Thamang and Ramesh Mogar. The injured official is Dem Basnet, a member of Nepal's sports council. Female judo contender Thamang has broken a leg. Oli Ullah, chief executive officer of the Bangladesh Olympic Association, said that Debu Thapa and Radha Devi Rai have also been admitted into the hospital. The CEO in a release said that the other two are out of danger. The players had come to Dhaka to participate in the 11th South Asian Games, scheduled to be launched at 4pm on Friday at Bangabandhu National Stadium. bdnews2
