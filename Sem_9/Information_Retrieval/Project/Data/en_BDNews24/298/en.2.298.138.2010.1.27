 Sirajganj, Jan 26 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of chickens were culled as bird flu struck at a farm in Sirajganj Sadar on Tuesday, with fears that thousands more dead birds in the district may have been infected, local livestock officials said. A team of district veterinarians and officials, led by upazila nirbahi officer Mohammad Hossain, culled about 3,000 birds of Akmal Poultry Farm at Ranigram village beside the Jamuna river on Tuesday night following detection of avian influenza there. District livestock official Mohammad Abdul Mannan said, "After receiving reports of bird flu, we destroyed the birds of Akmal Farm considering it is a very harmful virus which can affect man and bird equally." Asked about the number of poultry farms or birds affected in the district, he failed to draw any figure. However, Mohammad Akmal Hossain, general secretary of Bangladesh Poultry Farm Association's district unit, said: "About 2,000 poultry have already died of bird flu, which local livestock officials put down to Ranikhet at first without carrying out any tests." Ranikhet is another highly infectious viral disease of poultry, which strikes in winter. "But we along with the concerned authorities sent samples to Dhaka. We received confirmation of avian influenza this morning (Tuesday)," said Hossain. About 10,000 birds of at least 20 poultry farms of Sialkole union in the Sadar Upazila reportedly died of Ranikhet between Jan 10-20, according to the local livestock office, though tests were not carried out to confirm the disease. However, after the detection of avian influenza in then other cases, livestock officials said Tuesday those poultry might also have died of bird flu. Mohammad Faridul Islam, president of Bangladesh Poultry Farm Association's Sirajganj unit, said the disease broke out due to import of eggs and poultry from India. "The industry in this district may collapse if the government doesn't take steps immediately," he said. bdn
