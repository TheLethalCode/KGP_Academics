<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)The European Union, which recently issued a statement opposing death penalties for major cases in Bangladesh, said on Wednesday it will respect the judicial process followed in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder trial. "No, we see it (the judicial process) as respectable," Stefan Frowein, the EU mission head in Dhaka, told reporters Wednesday at the foreign ministry, replying to a question on whether the EU had any question on the judicial procedure in trying the killers. The EU statement said, "The European Union is paying close attention to the various judicial proceedings in Bangladesh this year concerning politically-motivated murders. "This statement applies to trials for all such crimes, notably: the 1975 murders of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members and others, murders committed during the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny, and potentially also war crimes committed during the country's struggle for independence." The statement was issued at a time when the Supreme Court was reviewing the petition of the killers whose death sentence was upheld. The lawyers for the killers appealed to the highest court to reduce the punishment from capital punishment to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court laster in the day rejected the review petition of the killers. Frowein also said the EU statement just reflected its policy against death penalty. "We have just said the EU is against death penalty everywhere. It is not for any particular country," he said. "The statement is not aimed at dictating Bangladesh into doing something," the EU ambassador told bdnews24.com. Frowein saw foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes and discussed the upcoming visit of 12 European Parliament members on Feb 12.
