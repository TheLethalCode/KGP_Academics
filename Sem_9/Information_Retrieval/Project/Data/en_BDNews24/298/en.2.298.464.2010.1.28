<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  A senior BNP leader has said the Awami League-led grand alliance government is running the country in 'Baksal style' under the cover of democracy. "This government is not fulfilling any commitment made to the people (before the 2007 general elections). They've made parliament a single-party one. They are running the country in Baksal style," BNP standing committee member Khandker Mosharraf Hossain told a discussion meeting on Thursday. He cited Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Baksal (Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League) party as an example of outlawing political parties other than the ruling one and imposing restrictions on freedom of the press. Mujib as president in June 1975 formed the new political alignment, banning other parties and outlawing all daily newspapers but four. Addressing the discussion titled 'Establishment of one-party Baksal rule and democracy killing day', Mosharraf claimed Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, an elite force constituted by Mujibur Rahman, killed around 20,000 freedom fighters. "Democracy was killed to establish one-country, one-leader, one-party system." He declined to make any comment on execution of Bangabandhu Sheik Mujib's five killers when reporters sought his reaction to the development after the discussion is over. The former power and energy minister of 1991-96 BNP government criticised the government's 'contradictory policy' to solve the country's gas crisis. "The government is signing deals with foreign companies for gas export on one hand and pursing gas rationing on the other. Such gas rationing will affect exports," he said. The BNP leader also came down heavily on the government for its signing deals with India. "They've satisfied India by selling out national interests." He said the 50-point India-Bangladesh joint communiqu issued during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's India visit had mentioned signing of three deals and two memorandums of understanding but nothing about Bangladesh's fair sharing of waters from common rivers or about India's scrapping of Tipaimukh dam project. "That is why the contents of the deals have not been placed before parliament or made public due," he said. Mosharraf urged his party leaders and activists to be prepared for launching movement against the 'anti-state activities'. BNP joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, vice-president Selima Rahman, BNP chairperson's adviser Shamuzzaman Dudu, Jubo Dal general secretary Syed Moazzmen Hossain Alal and Association of Agriculture member Zafir Tuhin also addressed the discussion. Alamgir urged BNP leaders and activists to make the new generation know of one-party Baksal rul
