 Rangamati, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Tension ran high in this hilly town after a land dispute sparked clashes between Bengali settlers and indigenous people on Saturday evening. Officials said an alleged bid by the Bangalee settlers brought the two battling parties face to face at Baghaihat bazaar, but police and army intervened to tame the two groups. "The army along with the police have brought the situation under control," Sourendro Nath Chakravarty, the Rangamati deputy commissioner, told bdnews24.com. Locals said the clashes began at around 8:30pm and continued well beyond the midnight. Allegations say the Bengalis have been trying to build households at Baghaihat and Gangarammukh under Sajek union. Blockade on Sunday Sajek Naree Samaj, a rights group, called for a blockade on Dighinala-Baghaichari-Baghaighat road on Sunday to press for return of the occupied lands and protest army intervention as well as assault on eight people from the indigenous community. They demonstrated at Baghaichari Upazila sadar Saturday as they announced the blockade. Sharmila Chakma of Naree Samaj and Batayan Chakma of Pahari Chhatra Parishad told bdnews24.com that they would go ahead with their boycott of the bazaar, ongoing since Jan 18. The army men, allegedly, had beaten two indigenous young men-- Kalabija Chakma and Karunamoy Chakma. The same day, the troops beat indigenous people at Ladumoni bazaar where eight were injured. bdne
