 UNITED NATIONS, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Veteran Swedish diplomat Staffan de Mistura has turned down an offer to become the new UN special envoy to Afghanistan due to "family reasons," Western diplomats said on Friday. Diplomats said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had wanted de Mistura, a senior official at the World Food Program and former UN special envoy to Iraq, to replace his outgoing envoy in Kabul, Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide. Eide was accused by his former deputy, US diplomat Peter Galbraith, of playing down the extent of the fraud in last year's presidential election. Eide denied the allegations and Ban fired Galbraith. Diplomats said it was not clear who would get the job now. One said that former Slovak foreign minister Jan Kubis was one name being considered. Ian Martin of Britain, the former UN envoy to Nepal and previous head of Amnesty International, has also been mentioned as a possible candidate. "He (de Mistura) says it's for family reasons," a senior Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity. "Now we're back to square one." Other diplomats confirmed his remarks. The new envoy is expected to play an important role supporting US President Barack Obama's new policy in Afghanistan, which includes more US and NATO troops to fight the Taliban insurgency and a "civilian surge". Ban had hoped to announce de Mistura's appointment during an international conference on Afghanistan in London next week, officials and diplomats said. "I think they won't have a replacement (for Eide) by then," the senior diplomat said. MORE CIVILIAN ENVOYS The European Union plans to appoint its own envoy to Afghanistan. Diplomats said the top candidate had been Jean-Marie Guehenno of France, who ran the UN peacekeeping department from late 2000 until 2008 but he too turned down the post to spend time with his family. Guehenno had also been considered for Eide's job, but the diplomats said Ban did not want him. A New York Times editorial earlier this month recommended Guehenno for the job, an unusual step for the newspaper. A Kabul-based diplomat said on Thursday NATO planned to create a stronger civilian representative post to help lead international efforts and the British ambassador in Kabul was a top candidate. NATO confirmed it was planning to beef up the post but did not comment on who was being considered for the job. The decision is part of a plan to raise the profile and efficiency of civilian efforts, alongside the 110,000-strong NATO-led military mission that will grow fast this year with the arrival of 30,000 more American troo
