 Gazipur, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Garment factory workers went on the rampage torching over a dozen vehicles on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway after a worker was killed by a speeding bus at Board Bazaar in Gazipur Sadar on Monday. Traffic movement remained suspended for two hours, until police managed to clear one side of the highway at around 11.00am. The dead factory worker has been identified as Sujon, 25, son of Tota Miah from Harinakanda village in Sribardi Upazila, Sherpur. Sergeant Md Mostafizur Rahman, of Naojorh highway police post, said Sujon was crushed under the wheels of a speeding bus at around 7:45am at Board Bazaar area as he was on his way to work. The bus injured several other people, who have been admitted to a local hospital, he said. As news of the accident spread, angry workers of neighbouring garment factories came out onto the highway and vandalised 20-25 vehicles, including buses, setting fire to 15 of them, Rahman said. "All traffic movement stopped. Police tried to clear the highway and had to chase down the agitators." Receiving news of the burning vehicles, Gazipur fire brigade rushed in to douse the fires, said Rahman. Sujon's body has been kept at the local hospital morgue. bdne
