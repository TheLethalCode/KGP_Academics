 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Relatives of three of the five convicts sentenced to death in the Bangabandhu murder case visited the condemned men at Dhaka Central Jail on Saturday. "They were allowed to meet their relatives between noon and 3.00pm and discussed legal issues," a senior jail official told bdnews24.com. The official said Bazlul Huda, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and AKM Mohiuddin received the visits. Jail officials and members of security agencies were present during the visit, he added. Relatives of the two other death row convicts, Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, might visit on Sunday, the official added. Huda, Rashid and AKM Mohiuddin last had visits from relatives on Nov 22 last year just days after the Supreme Court overturned their appeals, upholding their death penalties for the 1975 murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. bdnews
