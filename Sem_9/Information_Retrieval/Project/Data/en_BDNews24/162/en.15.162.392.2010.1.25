 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, central committee president of pro-BNP student organisation Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, on Monday secured bail from the High Court. The bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque also ordered the other accused JCD leaders including its general secretary Amirul Islam Alim to surrender in the lower court by the end of this week. The court also ordered the government not to arrest or harass them before the deadline. Earlier on Jan 18, Shamima Laizu, wife of a 'rebel' Chhatra Dal leader Sheikh Abdul Halim Khokan, filed a case against eight JCD leaders with the Kalabagan police accusing them of threatening to murder and intruding into her house. bdnews
