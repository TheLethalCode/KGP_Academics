 TOKYO, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prosecutors questioned Japanese ruling Democratic Party kingpin Ichiro Ozawa for more than four hours on Saturday over a funding scandal that is dimming the party's prospects in a mid-year election, Japanese media said. The scandal ensnaring Ozawa, the Democrats' key campaign strategist, has eroded support for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's government ahead of the poll for parliament's upper house, risking policy stalemate in the long term. Public broadcaster NHK reported Ozawa would hold a news conference later in the evening. The Democrats need an upper house majority to reduce reliance on small coalition partners and enable them to pass bills smoothly. The party swept to power last year promising to reduce bureaucrats' control of policy, cut waste and boost consumer spending power to help the weak economy. Ozawa, who holds the key post of party secretary-general and is widely seen as the real power behind Hatoyama's administration, came under fire after prosecutors arrested three aides on suspicion of improper reporting of political donations. He has denied any intentional wrongdoing and he was not legally obliged to respond to the prosecutors' request that he answer questions about the case. Graphic on Japan voter support: r.reuters.com/myv63g Japanese media said Ozawa would likely tell prosecutors the money came from his own and family bank accounts, but prosecutors suspect construction firms seeking public contracts may have been involved. Some newspapers said prosecutors are probing the possibility that Ozawa himself was involved in illegal activities. Hatoyama has backed Ozawa, credited with engineering his party's historic win in an election for the more powerful lower house last August that brought it to power, and said he hoped the party No.2 would have a chance to prove his innocence soon. FRAGILE ECONOMY Opposition parties grilled Hatoyama this week about the scandal during parliamentary debate on an extra budget for the year to March 31. But the bill is now expected to be enacted next week because the opposition would risk a public backlash if they delayed the steps, aimed at bolstering Japan's fragile economy. Ozawa, who bolted the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party in 1993 and spent the years after striving to defeat his former colleagues, has been a double-edged sword for the Democrats. His indisputable electioneering skills are seen as important to winning the upper house election, but his image as an old-style political fixer is denting the popularity of the party, which took power pledging to sweep away politics based on vested interests and collusion between lawmakers and bureaucrats. Some analysts say Ozawa, who resigned the party's top post last year over a separate scandal, will have to step down this time too, but may not decide to do so for a while. Despite slipping voter support for the government, the LDP has not recovered much ground since being ousted from power in the August election, which ended its almost unbroken rule of more than five decad
