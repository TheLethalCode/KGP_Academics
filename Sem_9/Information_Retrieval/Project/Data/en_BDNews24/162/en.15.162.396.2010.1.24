<TITLE> MPs to have duty-free cars of certain brands </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--Finance minister AMA Muhith has said the MPs will be allowed to import duty-free cars, but of certain makes and engines. A decision will be taken soon, he said. The past caretaker government revoked the provision of importing duty-free cars amid allegations that the MPs imported luxury cars only to sell them to make windfalls. The Awami League-led government has restored the opportunity. Muhith defended the government decision on Sunday. "The ministers and secretaries are getting car facilities. Upazila chairmen are also getting cars soon. Why not the MPs?" he said. "But this time they will not be allowed to import cars as they wish. Their make and the size of the engine will be fixed," the minister told reporters. "If they (the MPs) are given government cars what will be done with them after five years? "We will have to face problems if we sell them. Parliament has no transport pool. There is not enough space in the government's transport pool, either. "It will take one more year if we want to buy cars following Public Procurement Act and Public Procurement Regulations." "Considering all these issues we are thinking of importing duty-free cars," Muhith added. bdne
