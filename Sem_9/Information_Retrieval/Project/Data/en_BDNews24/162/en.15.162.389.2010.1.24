<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury is biding for an opportune moment to sue former army chief Moeen U Ahmed. Speaking at a press conference at his Dhanmondi residence on Sunday, Chowdhury told reporters, "I have made necessary preparations to sue him and am just waiting for a favourable atmosphere." The influential BNP leader called on all people irrespective of party affiliations to bring Moeen to trial. He also urged the prime minister to try Moeen for violating the constitution. Moeen should be court martialled for violating the constitution, said Chowdhury. He said, "Moeen froze the fundamental rights of people for two years by installing an unconstitutional government, persecuting students, teachers and politicians." Terming the former army chief a 'rebel' and 'violator of constitution', he said, "The rebel will not be spared and he will be brought to book one day or another." Regarding Moeen's plea of innocence the day before, claiming that he had not done anything wrong knowingly, Chowdhury said it actually amounted to Moeen blatantly ignoring the politicians. Referring to the negative connotation of giving the thumb, Chowdhury said that was what the former army chief had given to the politicians. "Moeen is jeering at the politicians pleading his innocence." Referring to Moeen's statement, he said, "It is a great shame for politicians that the man who waged war against 15 crore people by suspending their fundamental rights still dares to raise his voice." Addressing a function to mark the 75th anniversary of his alma mater Tejgaon Government School on Saturday, Moeen said he did nothing wrong deliberately during the state of emergency between Jan 2007 and Dec 2008 when a military-controlled interim government was in power. Moeen is believed to have played a pivotal role in installing the Fakhruddin-led interim regime that took office after the changeover of Jany 11, 2007. The former army chief, currently only awaiting retirement, however admitted his support for the regime. He faces a demation suit of Tk 1 crore filed by BNP's former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku. bdn
