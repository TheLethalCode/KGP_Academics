<TITLE> REVIEW PETITIONS: SC hears plea for commuting death sentences </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Sunday once more heard a defence plea for commuting death penalties for the 1975 murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, during the first day hearing of review petitions by the five death-row convicts in the case. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, adjourned proceedings to Monday after a three-hour hearing from 9.30am. The bench heard from Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, on the day. Mamun argued for review of the appeal court's judgment, which last November upheld death penalties of the convicted killers, on 15 points. Among the points, Mamun argued that an indemnity ordinance shielding the 1975 killers was revoked in 1996 "but its efficacy was not withdrawn". "The law was revoked, not the efficacy. So no case can be filed on the matter. This is against the law," he claimed. Mamun also reiterated the 'mutiny defence', one of the arguments made during the appeals in that a mutiny should have been tried by a military court, therefore the criminal trial that convicted his clients was invalid. Mamun argued: "The High Court in its previous ruling said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not of the army, that's why his killing could not be tried by a military tribunal. "But as commander-in-chief of the armed forces he was the supreme army figure. From that perspective, trying the case under criminal law instead of military law was a breach of law." He also said the chain of command collapsed in 1975. "The army officers including the army chief did not go to see Bangabandhu's body. So this can be termed as a mutiny," he said,. The court replied that these points and others had been made during the appeals and the verdict given accordingly: "Since we have given our verdict on these matters, there is nothing new to say on these points." Mamun also appealed to the court to commute the death penalties of his clients considering their age. "My clients are old. They have been languishing in the condemned cell for many years. They are suffering mental torture there," he said. After Mamun's arguments, Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for convicts Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Abdur Rezzak, lawyer for Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, moved for adjournment of the hearing for one week. But the court rejected their plea and set Monday for the next hearing. SLIM CHANCE Strict security measures were being observed around the Supreme Court premises as the hearing began Sunday. The judges arrived at the court guarded by special police convoys, while the court premises and its entrances were being patrolled by contingents of police, RAB, Special Branch and other security agencies. For the five former army officers, a review of the appeals verdict is one slim chance to defer death by hanging, due within days. Mohiuddin and Faruque filed review petitions on Jan 19, the deadline for submission, their counsel Khan Saifur Rahman told reporters. The other three, Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Rashid, had submitted separate petitions earlier, between Jan 10 and 12. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said at the time that hearing on all the review petitions would be held simultaneously on Jan 24. Haque has also said that review petitions rarely result in a change of verdict. The Supreme Court last year, concluding years of proceedings, rejected the appeals of the five jailed killers and upheld the High Court's death penalties in the case. The Appellate Division gave its final verdict on Nov 19 last year after 29 days of hearings on the appeals that began on Oct 15. The court released the full 417-page judgment on Dec 17, making way for the following phase of legal procedures, including issuance of death warrants and submission of review and clemency petitions by the condemned men. The Dhaka district and sessions judge issued the death warrants on Jan 3. Prison authorities at Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in the condemned cells, began preparations for the executions on issuance of the death warrants. Death sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. CLEMENCY PLEAS OF 3 REJECTED Meanwhile, clemency pleas to the president of three of the five convicts have been rejected by president Zillur Rahman, Mohammed Shafiul Alam, secretary to the president, told bdnews24.com on Jan 18. On the eve of the review petition hearing and in the backdrop of preparations for the executions, the European Union issued a statement on Saturday saying it opposes the death penalty in cases of "politically motivated murders" in Bangladesh. The statement referred to the Mujib murder case as well ongoing BDR mutiny trials and preparations for trying 1971 war crimes. "The European Union is paying close attention to the various judicial proceedings in Bangladesh this year concerning politically-motivated murders," EU ambassador to Bangladesh Stefan Frowein said in the statement. "This statement applies to trials for all such crimes, notably: the 1975 murders of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members and others, murders committed during the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny, and potentially also war crimes committed during the country's struggle for independence," he said. The EU justified the statement saying it was "opposed on principle to the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances". Amnesty International issued a similar statement against the death penalties in November just days after the Supreme Court rejected the appeals of the five convicts. The global rights watchdog called on Bangladesh to commute the death sentences. Law minister Shafique Ahmed told bdnews24.com Saturday that he was unaware of the EU statement on Bangladesh's internal affairs. He declined to comment on it. However, Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, told bdnews24.com: "They have expressed their concerns." "As far as we are concerned, we are guided by our principles, law and administration of justice," he said. LONG-AWAITED JUDGMENT The Supreme Court's Appellate Division, in a long-awaited judgment on the appeals, censured the failure to act of successive governments in bringing Sheikh Mujib's killers to justice. The Awami League government finally revoked an indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial of Mujib's killers. The case was finally filed on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul sentenced 15 of the accused to death. The High Court later upheld death sentences for 12. The appeals process had slowed down and came to a halt during the BNP-led coalition government between 2001-06. The proceedings resumed after a long gap with the return to power of Mujib's elder daughter, Hasina, in January last year. The long pending appeals finally resumed on Oct 15, 34 years after Sheikh Mujib's assassination. The appeals court took 29 days to hear all arguments. The court judged "that there was no scope to commute the death sentence for the brutal and hateful killing." After analysing all the evidence, the Appellate Division decided that the death sentence was appropriate, attorney general Mahbubey Alam said on release of the full judgment in December. As five of the convicted killers face death by hanging, six others remain fugitives from justice abroad, while the twelfth convicted killer died overseas in the interim. The absconding are Lt Col (retd) Khandaker Abdur Rashid, in Pakistan, Lt Col (retd) Shariful Haque Dalim, in Canada, Lt Col (retd) A M Rashed Chowdhury, in South Africa, Lt Col (retd) S H B M Noor Chowdhury, in the US, Risaldar Moslemuddin in Thailand and Capt (retd) Abdul Majed, in Kenya. Lt Col (retd) Abdul Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. bdne
