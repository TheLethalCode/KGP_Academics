 NEW DELHI, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The ruling Congress party is seeking to deflect blame for surging food prices and inflation, just as the central bank looks set to tighten policy, but in doing so it risks upsetting a coalition ally running the farm ministry. With overall inflation at its highest in a year and food prices rising by 20 percent in the year to December, Congress is trying to stop opposition barbs from eroding its electoral support, after it won a fresh five-year term last year. "Our primary concern is that the agricultural ministry, which is also the ministry for food, food distribution and consumer affairs needs to work proactively with state government to see that this spike settles down," Congress party spokesman Manish Tiwari said on Monday. The agriculture ministry is headed by Sharad Pawar, head of the Nationalist Congress Party which has supported Congress since its election in 2004, who is not happy at taking the blame for rising prices after the weakest monsoon in 37 years. "The Prime Minister and everybody else come together and decide the price policy. Nobody decides at the spur of the moment," Pawar told reporters on Monday. India's wholesale price index rose to 7.31 percent in December, the highest in a year. The tussle underscores the dilemma of the Congress party, which aims to rein in inflation without denting its rural base which helped it win last year's general elections as farmers gained from rising grain prices. Sugar in particular has been a problem, with the Congress party caught in the middle of competing demands from consumers who want lower prices while cane farmers seek higher prices for their produce. Domestic sugar prices nearly doubled last year as cane output in the world's top consumer tumbled for two straight years. The supply situation deteriorated further in recent months when Uttar Pradesh state, seeking to help cane farmers, banned processing raw sugar, jamming 750,000 tonnes of raw sugar at ports. The federal government has now allowed millers to process the raw sugar in other states, which analysts said would ease the supply crunch. "We should see food prices easing significantly in about two months when the winter crop comes in," said D.H. Pai Panandikar, head of private think tank RPG Foundation. Other prices are expected to ease too in coming months, as the winter crop adds to food supplies. Rising food prices and declining production also encouraged state-run trading firms to invite bids for rice imports last year, but the government rejected the prices as too high. The central bank has said while food prices are rising because of supply issues monetary policy could not address, it also needed to guard against a break out of wider inflation pressures. A Reuters poll showed the central bank is expected to raise the cash reserve ratio for banks by up to 50 basis points at a policy review on Friday as it looks to unwind some of the ultra-loose policy introduced to shore the economy up against the global cr
