 MELBOURNE, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After a week of mostly predictable results, the Australian Open starts to get serious on Sunday when the top players begin lining up against each other. Only two unseeded men and four unseeded women made it through to the last 16 as the most of the big names survived the first three rounds. The defending champion Rafa Nadal plays the only remaining unseeded player in the bottom half of the men's draw, Croatia's Ivo Karlovic, and is expecting to face a barrage of big serves. "He is always a really difficult opponent because the match is decides in a few points," the Spaniard said. "So the thing is to concentrate on my serve and try to convert the small opportunities that I can have on the return." Nadal could meet Andy Murray in the quarter-finals if the Briton can survive another giant server, American John Isner, who has thumped down 81 aces in the tournament. Isner is one of the most improved players on the tour, winning the Auckland Open last week, but is wary of Murray's reputation as one of the best returners in the game. "It's gonna be a challenge to hold serve a lot, that's gonna be my number one focus, first and foremost," Isner said. "As long as I'm doing that, I know I'll be in the match but it's going to be a challenge." DANGEROUS PLAYER Argentina's US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro will play Croatia's Marin Cilic with the winner to face the victor from Sunday's last men's match between American Andy Roddick and Chile's Fernando Gonzalez, the 2007 Australian Open finalist. "He's a very dangerous player. Some days he comes out, looks like he's playing ping pong the way he can sling the ball around," Roddick said of Gonzalez. The only certainty about Sunday's four women's matches is that two Russians and a Belgian will win. Last year's runner-up Dinara Safina will face fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko, who knocked out Maria Sharapova in the first round, while French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova will play Nadia Petrova in another all-Russian affair. Petrova pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament so far when she thrashed Belgium's Kim Clijsters 6-0, 6-1 on Friday. Justine Henin, in only her second tournament since announcing her comeback, faces Yanina Wickmayer in an all-Belgian match. Both are unseeded, Henin because she does not have enough ranking points and Wickmayer, who made the US Open semi-finals last year and is ranked 16 in the world, because she was suspended with the registrations for the first grand slam of the year closed. "I've never played Yanina in the past. When I retired, she was just coming," Henin said. "But she proved with her results last year that she is in top f
