 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Shahbagh police have recorded a complaint by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal over last week's violence at Dhaka University. The complaint, filed on Jan 20 against 14 persons, was recorded as a case Friday night after preliminary investigation, said Nazim Uddin, second officer of the Shahbagh Police Station in Dhaka. M Quamruzzaman, the legal affairs secretary of the opposition BNP's student wing, filed the complaint against 14 identified and some 20-25 unidentified persons. The 14 are leaders and activists of the Bangaldesh Chhatra League, student wing of the ruling Awami League. The police received the complaint last Wednesday (Jan 20) but refused to record it as a case. The day before the police had filed a case against eight leaders of the Chhatra Dal including its general secretary Amirul Islam Aleem. On Jan 18, rival factions of JCD, BNP's student wing, locked in armed clashes on Dhaka University campus over disgruntlement for not being on the student organisation's newly formed central committee. BCL reportedly joined the clashes at the time. JCD blamed the Dhaka University administration and Bangladesh Chhatra League for the clashes in which at least 20 people, including the Shahbagh police chief, DU proctor and JCD president, were injured. bdne
