 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)The devastating images of Haiti earthquake are already beginning to fade from American media. Of course, that is not unexpected given the nature of the news industry, as it had to cover other pressing issues like the debacle of the Democrats in Massachusetts and continuing job losses in America. But the question many are asking is whether the attention of the international community, especially of the United States, will also fade along with the departure of television cameras from Haitidespite the unequivocal assurance given by President Obama in the quake's immediate aftermath: "You will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten" Whether this commitment will be followed through and whether Haiti will come around is something only the future can tell. There's no doubt it will be a mammoth task to rebuild Haiti given the unimaginable destruction the earthquake has caused to life and property in the capital Port-au-Prince. Of course, the earthquake was intense but it wasn't only the quake's magnitude that caused such horrific mayhem and carnage. Some facts may highlight that perhaps may not be the case. On Oct. 17, 1989, for instance, a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck the Bay Area in Northern California. Sixty-three people were killed and the destruction was nowhere near what Haiti experienced. The Haiti earthquake, also measuring a magnitude of 7.0 that struck near Port-au-Prince on Jan 12, has so far killed an estimated 200,000 people and decimated the entire capital city. POVERTY STORY The fact underscores that this is not merely a natural disaster story. It is also a story about poorly constructed buildings, shoddy infrastructure and terrible public services. In short, it's a poverty story. That poverty aspect is going to offer some hard truths about the reconstruction task in Haiti. The first of those truths is that the international community is still unsure about how to use aid to reduce poverty. As New York Times columnist David Brooks recently wrote: Over the past few decades, the world has spent trillions of dollars to generate growth in the developing world. The countries that have not received much aid, like China, have seen tremendous growth and tremendous poverty reductions. The countries that have received aid, like Haiti, have not. In the recent anthology "What Works in Development?," a group of economists try to sort out what we've learned. The picture is grim. There are no policy levers that consistently correlate to increased growth. There is nearly zero correlation between how a developing economy does one decade and how it does the next. There is no consistently proven way to reduce corruption. Even improving governing institutions doesn't seem to produce the expected results. The chastened tone of these essays is captured by the economist Abhijit Banerjee: "It is not clear to us that the best way to get growth is to do growth policy of any form. Perhaps making growth happen is ultimately beyond our control." The second hard truth is that microfinance is vital but insufficient. Given the failures of macrodevelopment, aid organizations often focus on microprojects. More than 10,000 organizations perform missions of this sort in Haiti. By some estimates, Haiti has more nongovernmental organizations per capita than any other place on earth. They are doing the Lord's work, especially these days, but even a blizzard of these efforts does not seem to add up to comprehensive change. The microcredit issue also brings the case of Bangladesh. It's true that the efforts of Grameen bank and other nongovernmental organizations have succeeded in reducing hardcore poverty in the country, but questions remain as to whether microfinance is enough to make serious dent in the Bangladesh's overall poverty situation. Some experts argue that the curse of colonialism is to blame for the poverty in many countries. That's perhaps a contributing factor to Haiti's predicament. It has a history of oppression, slavery and colonialism. But so does Barbados, and Barbados is doing pretty well. Haiti has endured ruthless dictators, corruption and foreign invasions. But so has the Dominican Republic, and the D.R. is in much better shape. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the same island and the same basic environment, yet the border between the two societies offers one of the starkest contrasts on earth  with trees and progress on one side, and deforestation and poverty and early death on the other. So, this begs a question: what's the answer to countries like Haiti? Are they hopeless? Many influential people in the U.S. think so. WHAT HOPE? Bill O'Reilly, the influential television talk show host, is one of them. He has said on his show: "Once again, we will do more than anyone else on the planet, and one year from today Haiti will be just as bad as it is right now." Of course, there are people who strongly disagree. Nicholas Kristof, the New York Times columnist, has written that "O'Reilly is dead wrong". He argues that this is the most pernicious myth of all. In fact, Haiti in recent years has been much better managed under President Ren Prval and has shown signs of being on the mend. Far more than most other impoverished countries  particularly those in Africa  Haiti could plausibly turn itself around, Kristof insists. "It has an excellent geographic location, there are no regional wars, and it could boom if it could just export to the American market". He argues that it's a strategy that has worked for other countries, such as Bangladesh, and Haitians in the slums would tell you that their most fervent wish is for jobs. A few dozen major shirt factories could be transformational for Haiti. "So in the coming months as we help Haitians rebuild, let's dispatch not only aid workers, but also business investors. Haiti desperately needs new schools and hospitals, but also new factories" Kristof writes.
