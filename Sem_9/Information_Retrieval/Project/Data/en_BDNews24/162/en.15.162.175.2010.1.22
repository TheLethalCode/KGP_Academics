 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nadia Petrova proved she had no room for sentiment, dumping crowd favourite Kim Clijsters out of the Australian Open third round on Friday with a 6-0, 6-1 thrashing in just 52 minutes. The 19th-seeded Russian had never beaten Clijsters, who is still in the early stages of her return from retirement, in their four previous encounters. "It sucks.

The Belgian had been heading for a rare 6-0, 6-0 defeat until the 10th game of the match when she finally held her serve. Petrova broke again and while Clijsters was able to stave off two match points when the Russian was serving for victory, she was unable to stop her opponent's irrepressible mome
