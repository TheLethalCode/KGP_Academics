 TOKYO, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese opposition parties vowed on Sunday to pursue a scandal ensnaring a ruling party kingpin ahead of a mid-year election, although they stopped short of threatening to delay budget debate in parliament. Ichiro Ozawa, seen as the most powerful politician in the ruling Democratic Party, denied on Saturday any wrongdoing in a funding scandal that has led to the arrests of three current and former aides on suspicion of misreporting political donations. The scandal has eroded support for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's government ahead of the poll for parliament's upper house, risking policy stalemate in the long term. Ozawa told a news conference on Saturday after four hours of questioning by prosecutors over the scandal he would stay on in the party's No. 2 post of secretary-general.

The Democrats need an upper house majority to reduce reliance on small coalition partners and enable them to pass bills smoothly. Domestic media were also poised to pursue the scandal despite Ozawa's denial of wrongdoing. "Ozawa's news conference of just over 20 minutes did not include enough time for questions and answers, and many doubts remain," the Yomiuri Shimbun daily said in an editorial. "A more detailed explanation is needed." Hatoyama has backed Ozawa, credited with engineering his party's historic win in an election for the more powerful lower house last August that brought it to power. Some analysts say Ozawa, who resigned the party's top post last year over a separate scandal, will have to step down this time too, but may not decide to do so for a whi
