<TITLE> Govt backs idea of UN convention on religion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh government is supportive of the initiative for a UN convention on the right to religion, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Monday. Michael G. Kozak, US acting assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, had earlier met the law minister at his office and asked Bangladesh's opinion about the proposed convention. The minister told reporters after the meeting that Bangladesh appreciated the initiative. Kozak praised Bangladesh on being informed that the Constitution of Bangladesh enshrines freedom of religion, said Shafique. The minister was questioned on the Election Commission's objection to religion-based party Jamaat-e-Islami's charter on grounds that it went against the spirit of the Constitution. The minister said, "No law of the country is greater than the Bangladesh constitution." "The commission is right to oppose it if it goes against the Constitution. The Election Commission has the authority." However, asked about his recent comments on banning religion-based parties, by amending the constitution, the minister refrained from making any comment. "As this issue is now pending in court, it will be unwise to remark on this." Asked whether the death penalties for the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would be executed by the end of January, Shafique said the verdict was under review by the Supreme Court. The verdict would be executed in due time in line with the court's orders. The death warrants against the five jailed convicts in the case, Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, were issued on Jan 3. According to law, the death penalties are to be executed between 21 and 28 days of issuance of the warrants. In line with that law, the deadline expires on Jan 31. On trial of the war criminals, the law minister said the special tribunal and other related offices would be set up at the present Judicial Services Commission premises, in the Supreme Court building, as it is going to be vacated on Feb 7. The minister also hoped that appointment of judges and the trial process would begin by March. bdnews
