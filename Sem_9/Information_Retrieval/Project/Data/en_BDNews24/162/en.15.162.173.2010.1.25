<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo apologised for breaking Malaga defender Patrick Mtiliga's nose in a La Liga match Sunday but said he should not have been sent off. The world's most expensive player scored both goals for Real Madrid in their 2-0 home win, moving them to within five points of leaders Barcelona. But he picked up a red card in the 70th minute after swinging his arm behind him and catching Mtiliga in the face as he tried to spin away from the Danish defender's clutches.

Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini said he was unable to see the incident clearly but the club's director general Jorge Valdano rushed his player's defence. "The referee has to understand which players want to entertain and those who want to break up the spectacle," he said. "Cristiano wants to play (football). When a player grabs him from behind he tries to break away from them. Others throw themselves to the ground to simulate a foul. "More than Ronaldo's need to adapt to the Spanish league the referees need to adapt to protect players who want to entertain. "I don't want to judge referees decisions, simply to state that Ronaldo's intentions are always noble."
