 Dhaka, Jan 23(bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina called on filmmakers Saturday to produce at least one children's film every year. Hasina made the call as she inaugurated the Third Children's Film Festival at Osmani Memorial auditorium. The festival, being held every year since 2008, hosted by the Children's Film Society will run from Jan 23 to Jan 29. Festival director Morshedul Islam said the event aims at acquainting children with different cultures through creative films from home and abroad. The festival will screen 243 films from 50 countries at 12 venues in Dhaka. Admission is free for children. Festival advisory council chairman Mustafa Monwar demanded construction of a national children's film complex that educate children to on many subjects. The opening session was addressed among others by information minister Abul Kalam, Children's Film Society president Zafar Iqbal and information secretary Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury. The prime minister inaugurating the event said more than half of the population was below 18 but children's film is almost entirely neglected. "Children should get priority as spectators and there is no valid reason for not making films for them," she said Hasina said, history, tradition, liberation war, culture, customs and behaviour and values could easily be etched into the young impressionable minds of children. "Film is a very powerful art medium, which could be properly used for the benefit of children with appropriate initiatives," she said. The prime minister also urged the film makers to use films as tools for fighting different social maladies like terrorism and militancy. "Make such films which can help children develop human qualities." "A good film teaches a man how to love the country and how to transform himself into a good person," said the prime minister. Taking a swipe at the filmmakers, Hasina said, "Instead of wasting money, you should work together to mould children's characters for the future." The prime minister also called on them to instil patriotism among children so that they can serve the nation better in future. "A memorable character can etch itself into the minds of children for a lifetime," she said, adding that the children of Bangladesh are showing their true potential at home and abroad. Hasina assured the filmmakers all-out assistance for children's films. "The government used to fund only three films before. But now it will finance five films of which two can be for children." b
