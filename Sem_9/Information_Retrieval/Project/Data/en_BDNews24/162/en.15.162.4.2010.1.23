<TITLE> Australian Open to shrug off economic downturn </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 23 (bdnewsw24.com/Reuters) - Lingering effects from the global financial crisis have hurt big-ticket corporate sales at the Australian Open but organisers expect record crowds to boost year on year revenues for the annual tournament. Corporate sales, which include hospitality bookings for companies seeking to entertain clients and partners, were down about 10 percent on the previous year, Tennis Australia commercial director Steve Ayles told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "We felt the global financial crisis to a degree at last year's Australian Open but people make those decisions six months in advance," Ayles said. "From that perspective we were quite fortunate that a lot of companies had locked in and paid. "Of course, when they were thinking about the decision to book for this year's tournament, (the downturn) was probably felt more." Ayles said organisers had been too pessimistic in their budgeting, however, and would have sold more had they not reduced the amount of corporate bookings on offer. "We actually took away some of our inventory as well. We believed that we actually wouldn't sell it. As it happens we probably could have sold some of it." He said the tournament was on track to break its record attendance of 605,735 people set in 2008 and could reach "somewhere between 610 to 620,000." "If the weather continues as forecast, there is a real chance," Ayles said, adding that ticketing revenue yields from attendance had also increased. "Last year, people chose to buy a ground pass rather than a Rod Laver Arena ticket. This year, it has reversed," Ayles said, adding that some 20-30,000 more tickets for reserved stadium tickets had been bought at the same stage than last year. A$7 MILLION LOSS Despite the loss of three of last year's sponsors, including financial services provider GE Money and Australian airline Qantas, new sponsors had been found and existing ones had invested more to pick up the slack, Ayles said. "The good news is that despite it being probably one of the tough economic climates, we managed to increase our sponsorship revenue from 2009 ... we're not talking massive percentages, though." Organisers, who have rebranded the Australian Open as the "Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific," were looking for more commercial tie-ups in the region and would offer more wildcards to Asian players to attract more interest from high-growth markets. "We anticipate that there will be a fairly significant investment as part of our Asia-Pacific strategy," Ayles said. "If you look at our sponsorship portfolio, there's only two Australian companies. The other 14 are global or Asia Pacific companies." "Our focus is certainly on global organisations, probably those that are more focused in the Asia-Pacific area." Tennis Australia derives more than 90 percent of its revenues from the grand slam, which effectively subsidises infrastructure and player development in the sports-mad country. The governing body reaped more than A$127 million ($116.4 million) in revenues for the 2008-2009 financial year, but posted a more than A$7 million loss, which Ayles put down to increased investment for grass-roots development including courts, facilities and training programmes. Ayles said the outlook for 2010 was positive, however, and that organisers would be "erasing that (loss) and increasing (cash) reserves again" this year. With only two male and three female players in the top 100, Ayles said a big emphasis for investment would be on turning talented youngsters, like two-time junior grand slam champion Bernard Tomic, into professional champions. "From a development perspective, there is an unequivocal link between our having our leading players being at the top of their game and getting new, grass-roots interest in the sport." "So these players that are at that cusp, now we need to translate them to the adult ra
