 Tongi, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)--The Biswa Ijtema, the second largest Muslim congregation in the world after the Hajj, ended with millions of devotees saying their final prayers on the banks of the Turag river outside Dhaka at midday on Sunday. Unofficial estimates put the numbers at two million faithfuls as the top Tablighi Jamaat leader from India, Maulana Zobair Ul Hasan, led them in the 25-minute prayer--'Akheri Munajat'--that began at 12:20pm. President Md Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia were among those attending the final prayers. Arrangements were also made for ministers, MPs and other VIPs, said Abul Bashar Mohammad Ameer Uddin, administrative officer of the Ijtema venue. Pilgrims from Bangladesh and around the world flocked to the annual three-day Tablighi Jamaat Islamic congregation on the outskirts of the capital. Many devotees, braving the winter cold and fog, spent the days and nights under open sky this year unable to find space under the huge makeshift pandels or designated shelters. Large numbers were also seen taking part in the congregation from rooftops of nearby buildings and roads. The three-day event began with the Aam Bayan, or principal sermon, after the Fajr or early morning prayers on Friday. Ijtema volunteer Md Giasuddin told bdnews24.com the largest Jumma congregation in South Asia was also held at the Ijtema venue at noon on Friday. Throughout the three days, discussions on various aspects of Islam, recitation of the Quran and Hadith and other religious programmes are held. Ulemas and Islamic scholars from Pakistan, India and other countries delivered lectures this year, which were simultaneously translated for devotees into Bangla, English, Arabic, Tamil, Chinese and among other languages. Volunteer Abdul Quddus said tens of thousands of pilgrims had arrived from United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan, Algeria, Qatar, Palestine, Bahrain, Tunisia, Yemen, Iraq, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Djibouti, Somalia and France this year. He said a separate area was earmarked on the venue's north-west side to cater to special needs of up to 25,000 foreigners. On Saturday, the second day of the gathering, 140 couples were married dowry-free, according to Ijtema tradition, with the consent of the bride and bridegroom and their guardians. The mass wedding was held in a ceremony beside the Bayan stage after Asr prayers. Gazipur district police chief Mahfuzul Haq Nuruzzaman told journalists that huge security preparations were taken to hold a successful Ijtema. He said some 18,000 security personnel from different agencies and several hundred plainclothes law enforcers were deployed in and around the 0.65 square-kilometer venue as part of multi-tier security measures to avert any possible trouble. Director general of Rapid Action Battalion Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said that around 18 control rooms were set up with 60 CCTVs installed at the venue to facilitate RAB personnel to monitor the Ijtema site. He said around 800 RAB men split in five groups remained on watch 24 hours a day during the Ijtema. Moreover, the elite crime-busters patrolled in helicopters, speedboats and pickup vans in and around the area. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police headquarters said traffic movement would remain suspended on Airport Road from Tongi's Abdullahpur to Kuril's Pragati Sarani bus stand and on the opposite side up to Gazipur's Chandana for 24 hours, from 6.00pm Saturday to 6.00pm Sunday, as the Ijtema drew to a close and hundreds of thousands of pilgrims left the grounds to make their way home. bdnews24.
