 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)  Death of a mother and daughter in a road accident led to vandalism at Gabtali on Thursday night. Although witnesses said that infuriated locals damaged at least 50 vehicles, the police claimed that it was limited to a few vehicles. While crossing the road near a sweeper colony, Parvin Akhter, 25, and her daughter, a class-II student, died on the spot at 9:30pm when a Mohammadpur-bound truck ran them over. Angered, thousands took to the streets and vandalised at least 50 vehicles, said Shahid Miah, a witness. A number of vehicles were stranded at Aminbazar Bridge brining the Dhaka-Aricha road to a halt as locals blocked the Gabtoli-Beribadh Road overnight, said witnesses. Shahid Miah claimed that inhabitants of the sweeper colony blocked the Dhaka Aricha road. Officer in charge at Darussalam Police Station ASM Mostak Hossain told bdnews24.com: "Locals took to the streets. We later solved the issue." Regarding vandalism, he said: "There was no vandalism. They might have tried to damage some vehicles throwing brickbats." Hossain said: "They blocked the road for an hour or a little longer, which put some pressure on the Dhaka-Aricha road." He said they arrested the truck driver Sentu. Asad Miah, Parvin's husband, filed a case with the station. Sentu has already been sent to court. bd
