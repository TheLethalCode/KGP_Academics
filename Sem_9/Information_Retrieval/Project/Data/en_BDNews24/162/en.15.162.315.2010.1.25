 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court heard arguments by defence lawyers for a second day on Monday in proceedings on the review petitions by five former army officers facing death penalties for the 1975 murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, heard two defence counsels for almost four hours from 9.30am. Proceedings were adjourned at 1.10pm until Tuesday. Abdur Rezzak Khan, lawyer for Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, and Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for Syed Faruk Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed, presented their arguments in the simultaneous hearing on all five petitions. Abdur Razzak in his arguments said that penalty handed down to his client was not appropriate. Moreover, the testimony and cross-examinations by state witness Abdul Kahhar Akand was not taken into consideration. The case was not tried fully, Abdur Rezzak said and added that Shahriar Rashid was detained on Aug 13, 1996 but he was produced before the court on Dec 11 that year. Nobody knew where he had been kept during the period, although he had been remanded in custody several times. These acts are against the Criminal Procedures Act and the fundamental rights, the lawyer said. Shahriar Rashid had been forced to give confessional statements and so the penalty based on the statements is illegal, he said. Rashid had gone to the radio station to do his job during the event at Dhanmondi 32 house on Aug 15, Abdur Rezzak said. "He went to the radio station to do his duty as a public servant, not to wrest its control. He did not take part in any plot either." The court asked him who had ordered his client to go to the radio station even after his retirement on the day when the president was killed along with his family members. From that it is clear that he did know everything well before the events unfolded, the court said. On the first day, the bench heard from Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. Mamun argued for review of the appeal court's judgment, which last November upheld death penalties of the convicted killers, on 15 separate points. Among them, he asked the court to commute the death sentences of his two clients on grounds of old age. The top appeals court upheld the death sentences to 12 former army officers in the Bangabandhu murder case. The landmark judgment sealed the gruelling and often-disrupted case proceedings of 13 years, delivering justice more than three decades after the killing of the independence leader. Five of the convicted killers - retired major general Bazlul Huda, dismissed lieutenant colonel Syed Faruk Rahman, retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed and retired major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed - await their fate in jail now, while six remain fugitive. A seventh convicted killer died as a fugitive in Zimbabwe. bdne
