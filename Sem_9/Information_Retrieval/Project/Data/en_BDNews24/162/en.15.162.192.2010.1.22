<TITLE> New National Security Adviser may herald China outreach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government has appointed a former top diplomat as National Security Adviser in a move that may see efforts to improve ties with rival Pakistan and push for better relations with China. Shiv Shankar Menon, 60, takes over from M.K. Narayanan, a former intelligence chief seen as having a more hawkish approach to regional security, and who critics said lacked a wider geopolitical understanding. Menon, who retired last year as head of India's foreign service, played a crucial role in cementing ties with the United States through a civilian nuclear technology deal and seeking to normalise relations with Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attack. The NSA coordinates both internal and external security in India, as well as playing a role in setting India's diplomatic agenda. Narayanan was a key negotiator in the US civilian nuclear deal in 2008. "What we can hope to see now is a strategic vision as opposed to a tactical view," said Amitabh Mattoo, professor of foreign policy studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. "We will see a reaching out to Pakistan, a consolidation of relations with China. As India emerges as a global power he will seek to settle down our neighbourhood." The key challenge Menon faces is reducing tension with Islamabad and resuming a 5-year-long peace dialogue India suspended after the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. POLITICAL MINEFIELD As someone close to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Menon probably has the leader's support in reaching out to Pakistan but such a move is difficult in the minefield of Indian politics and where making concessions to Pakistan can evoke public suspicion. "Clearly he is someone who believes in engaging Pakistan but he will have to wait for a political opportunity to be created to be able to move forward," said a former diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Menon's dealings with Pakistan have generated controversy. Many asked if he had made an unusual blunder in drafting a declaration at an India-Pakistan summit in Egypt last year in which India appeared to de-link terrorism from a broader peace process that India halted after November's attacks. The government also drew flak for agreeing to include in the joint statement a reference to the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, where Pakistan accuses India of fomenting an insurgency. New Delhi denies the charge. The controversy highlighted how politically risky it is to push peace with Pakistan and bring about any major policy shift. Such hurdles will meet Menon as well. "Any policy shift is going to be just incremental," said Brahma Chellaney, a leading political analyst with the Centre for Policy Research. Menon, considered a China expert with strong knowledge of the language, is not a policymaker and he will defer to politicians such as Singh and Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna. But as the national security adviser he will exert huge influence as the point-person in negotiations with Pakistan and China, which would be another priority for him. A long-standing dispute over their Himalayan border, which sparked a short war in 1962, still festers between Asia's two emerging giants. "We can expect him to push for resolution of the boundary problem with China," Mattoo s
