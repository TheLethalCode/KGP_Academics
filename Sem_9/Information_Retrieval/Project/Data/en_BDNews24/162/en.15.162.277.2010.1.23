 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Proshika staff returned to work on Saturday after police handed back the keys to the incumbent governing body following clashes earlier this month that led to a lockdown at the headquarters of one of the country's largest NGOs. Staff entered Proshika Bhaban, located in the city's Mirpur area, from around 8am in presence of chief executive officer Mahbubul Karim. Proshika director Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com "everything is going smoothly." Police handed over the key of the building on Friday night, he said. The incumbent governing body removed Faruque from the chairman post in May last year following allegations of corruption. He has since petitioned the High Court challenging the legality of the decision Faruque's men had marched on Proshika Bhaban on Jan 12, entered and forced Proshika staff out of the building. Tensions ran high for 24 hours in and around the headquarters as supporters of ousted chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed and those loyal to the present governing body fought for control of the building. Police were forced locked the main entrance on Jan 13 and cordon off the area to prevent clashes. On Jan 19 the High Court ordered police to return the key to the governing body and ruled that Faruque and his supporters could not go near the building until his petition was resolved in court. Pallabi police chief Iqbal Hossain told bdnews24.com they had returned the key to the officials of the incumbent body following the High Court order. bd
