 Rangamati, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Rangamati hill district's indigenous residents barricaded the Dighinala-Baghaichharhi-Baghaihat road from early Sunday, after tension ran high the night before in the main town as a land dispute sparked clashes between Bengali settlers and the indigenous locals. When contacted, deputy commissioner Shourendra Nath Chakravarti said the administration has posted adequate police and military personnel in the area in a bid to maintain law and order. "The situation there is under control," he added. Witnesses at Baghaichharhi, local reporters among them, said the blockaders took up position at several major intersections on the main road of the upazila headquarters from 6am. The picketers reportedly vandalised a Marishshya-Khagrhachharhi bus at 'Nine Mile' point in the early hours. Tension also prevailed in Baghaihat Bazaar area on Sunday, among disgruntled groups of the local hill people and Bangalee settlers. The roadblock was enforced in response to a call by the Sajek Naree Samaj, a local women's rights group, to press for return of occupied lands and protest a reported assault on eight members of the indigenous community. The indigenous protestors also demanded a halt to harassment by officials and army intervention in the hill districts. Officials said an alleged bid by the Bangalee settlers brought the two battling parties face to face at Baghaihat bazaar on Saturday evening. Locals said the clashes began at around 8:30pm and continued well beyond the midnight, but police and army intervened to tame the two groups. "The army along with the police brought the situation under control," Sourendro Nath Chakravarty, the Rangamati deputy commissioner, told bdnews24.com. Indigenous residents of the area allege the Bengalis have been trying to build houses on indigenous land at Baghaihat and Gangarammukh under Sajek union. bdne
