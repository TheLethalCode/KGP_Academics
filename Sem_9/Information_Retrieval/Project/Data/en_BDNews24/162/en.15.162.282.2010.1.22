<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com -- The Pakistan Cricket Board has decided to appeal to the International Cricket Council regarding the exclusion of all 11 Pakistani players from the Indian Premier League after the auction in Mumbai this week, reports Cricinfo. Since the IPL is a domestic tournament, it is outside the ICC's purview and so it is unlikely cricket's ruling body will be able to do much about it, but the matter continues to rage on in Pakistan. "We will be lodging a complaint with the ICC and I will personally table this issue at the next meeting of the ICC executive board on Feb 10," said PCB chairman Ijaz Butt after a meeting with the country's sports minister in Lahore.

"How can they [IPL franchises] avoid bidding for players from the world champion team?" he said after meeting the PCB chairman. "It's our unanimous decision to take up this issue at the highest forum and lodge our protest at the ICC." As a sign of protest against the snub to Pakistan's cricketers, the speaker of the lower house had also stopped a parliamentary delegation from traveling to India.

Butt, however, said these were excuses without substance. "They should tell us if franchises had reservations about signing Pakistani players because they were worried about security issues and availability of the players why were our players included in the auction in the first place," he said.
