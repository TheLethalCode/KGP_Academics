<TITLE> Henin reaches another milestone on the comeback trail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Justine Henin reached a special milestone at the Australian Open Friday when she beat Russia's Alisa Kleybanova 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. It was the Belgian's 500th career win, putting her in an elite club of tennis professionals. Henin would have reached the landmark a lot earlier if she had not decided to suddenly quit the sport in 2008 when she was the number one player in the world. Then again, she might never have made it at all had Kim Clijsters not won last year's US Open, inspiring Henin to join her fellow Belgian in making a comeback. Henin's win over Kleybanova was not her best performance at Melbourne Park this week but enough to thrust her into the fourth round against Yanina Wickmayer, another unseeded Belgian. Henin would have to win another four matches to claim the title but the question is already being asked. Can she possibly win the Australian Open in her second event out of retirement just as Clijsters did in New York? "It's a big challenge to come back and I think I love challenges. That's the way I am," Henin said. "I need always to push myself and to push the limits back. I'm very proud of what I'm doing right now. I enjoy my game out there. That's the most important thing." Her next opponent, Wickmayer, could provide some of the answers. Wickmayer sealed her place in the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-7, 6-3 win against Italy's Sara Errani and will provide Henin with a stern test. UNDER SUSPENSION Wickmayer made the US Open semi-finals last year and is ranked 16 in the world but was overlooked for the seedings and forced to come through qualifying because she was under suspension when the registrations for the Australian Open closed. Dinara Safina and Maria Kirilenko also won Friday and will now play each other in an all-Russian fourth-round clash Sunday. Like the Belgians, the Russians are on the march. Safina defeated Britain's Elena Baltacha 6-1, 6-2 in less than an hour and is slipping through the draw almost unnoticed even though she made the final in Australia last year and is ranked number two in the world. "I managed to dictate from the first point of the match," she said. "I think everything was going right." Kirilenko matched her best performance at a grand slam when she defeated Italy's Roberta Vinci 7-5, 7-6, showing that her first round win over Maria Sharapova was no fluke. Ukraine's Alona Bondarenko also advanced, beating Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-2, 6-3 and extending the former world number one's poor run in grand slams over the past 19 months. Andy Roddick recovered from a set down to defeat Spain's Feliciano Lopez 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 in the men's draw. The American will next play Fernando Gonzalez of Chile after the 2007 Australian Open runner-up outlasted Evgeny Korolev 6-7, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3,
