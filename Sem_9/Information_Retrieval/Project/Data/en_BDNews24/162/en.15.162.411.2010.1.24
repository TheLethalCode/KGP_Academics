 Rangamati, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--Rangamati hill district's indigenous residents barricaded the Dighinala-Baghaichharhi-Baghaihat road from early on Sunday after tension ran high the night before in the main town as a land dispute sparked clashes between Bengali settlers and the indigenous locals. During the daylong road blockade staged by the hills people in Sajek valley area on Sunday morning, the Bengali settlers allegedly attacked the local people. A local people's representative said clashes occurred when the Bangalee settlers and the local hill people stood face-to-face over land rights issues during the road blockade. Upazila Parishad chairman Sudarshan Chakma told bdnews24.com that as a convoy of three to four buses carrying the Parbatya Bangalee Chhatra Parishad (PBCP) leaders and activists were headed for Khagrachharhi district headquarters at around 10am to join an activists' conference there, the blockaders stopped them at Naimile point. The PBCP activists then returned to Baghaichharhi Upazila Sadar, equipped themselves with sticks and staffs and launched attacks on the hill people, who had arrived to do weekly groceries shopping and collect old-age allowances, injuring 10 of them, he said. Vijay Chakma, Sohel Chakma and Doyel Chandra Chakma were admitted to the Upazila Health Complex in critical condition. The Bangalee settlers detained the Baghaihat High School headmaster and 12 SSC examinees within the school, who were later rescued by the police and the army personnel. The Parbattya Bangalee Chhatra Parishad is an organisation of the Bangalee students in the hills who opposed the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. Rangamati deputy commissioner Shourendra Nath Chakravarti said though there were flare-ups in the morning, the situation was under control. The authorities were observing the situation and efforts were being made to assist the belligerent parties to reach a consensus. The PBCP district general secretary Mir Mohammed Mohiuddin said in a statement that the hills people attacked their activists and vandalised their buses in the morning as they were going to a conference, injuring 8-10 activists. Witnesses at Baghaichharhi, local reporters among them, said the blockaders took up position at several major intersections on the main road of the Upazila headquarters from 6am. The picketers reportedly vandalised a Marishshya-Khagrhachharhi bus at 'Nine Mile' point in the early hours. Tension also prevailed in Baghaihat Bazaar area on Sunday, among disgruntled groups of the local hill people and Bangalee settlers. The roadblock was enforced in response to a call by the Sajek Naree Samaj, a local women's rights group, to press for return of occupied lands and protest a reported assault on eight members of the indigenous community. The indigenous protestors also demanded a halt to harassment by officials and army intervention in the hill districts. Officials said an alleged bid by the Bangalee settlers brought the two battling parties face to face at Baghaihat bazaar on Saturday evening. Locals said the clashes began at around 8:30pm and continued well beyond the midnight, but police and army intervened to tame the two groups. "The army along with the police brought the situation under control," Sourendro Nath Chakravarty, the Rangamati deputy commissioner, told bdnews24.com. Indigenous residents of the area allege the Bengalis have been trying to build houses on indigenous land at Baghaihat and Gangarammukh under Sajek union. bdn
