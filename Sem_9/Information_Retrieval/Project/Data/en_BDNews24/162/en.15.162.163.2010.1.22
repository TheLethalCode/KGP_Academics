<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)- A prime minister's adviser has said that those who had stolen food in parliament's canteen were raising an uproar over agreements with India because the deals did not serve 'their masters'. Sheikh Hasina's establishment affairs adviser HT Imam did not take names, but the tirade is apparently aimed at BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. A parliamentary watchdog has accused Delwar, a former chief whip in parliament, of stealing foodstuff. Imam said, alluding to the main opposition BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami: "The alliance is making a hue and cry over the deals only because their masters' interests have not been protected." The adviser was speaking at a discussion organised by the Dhaka City Puja Committee at Dhakeshwari National Temple on Friday. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said, in reaction to the prime minister's India tour, that Hasina had failed to bring back anything from India and that the deals amounted to 'a sell-out' on Bangladesh's interests. Imam said each of the 50 articles of the joint communiqu issued by the two prime minister's visit were examined in detail. "They uphold the interests of the country." He warned that no anti-India activities would be allowed in Bangladesh. "We won't allow anyone to operate from Chittagong Hill Tracts for serving Pakistan's interests. We won't allow (Assamese separatists) ULFA activities ." Imam mentioned that during Hasina's visit both sides had agreed not to allow any activities in their territories that go against the other's interest. The Hindu community leaders sought government assistance to recover lands of the Dhakeshwari temple that had been encroached upon. b
