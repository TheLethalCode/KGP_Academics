<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Strict security measures were being observed on Sunday as the Supreme Court began hearing review petitions of the five killers convicted and sentenced to death for the 1975 murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. A special four-member bench of the Supreme Court, with chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam and justices BK Das, Mozammel Hossain and SK Sinha, began hearing the petitions at 9.30am. The judges arrived at the court with special police convoys, while the court premises and all its entrances were being patrolled and guarded by contingents of police, RAB, Special Branch and other security agencies. For the five convicted former army officers, Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, review of the appeals verdict is a slim chance to defer death by hanging, due within days. Mohiuddin and Faruque filed review petitions on Jan 19, the deadline for submission, their counsel Khan Saifur Rahman told reporters. The other three, Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Rashid, had submitted separate petitions earlier, between Jan 10 and 12. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque said at the time that hearing on all the review petitions would be held simultaneously on Jan 24. Haque has also said that review petitions rarely result in a change of verdict. The Supreme Court last year, concluding years of proceedings, rejected the appeals of the five jailed killers and upheld the High Court's death penalties in the case. The Appellate Division gave its final verdict on Nov 19 last year after 29 days of hearings on the appeals that began on Oct 15. The court released the full 417-page judgment on Dec 17, making way for the following phase of legal procedures, including issuance of death warrants and submission of review and clemency petitions by the condemned men. The Dhaka district and sessions judge issued the death warrants on Jan 3. Prison authorities at Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in the condemned cells, began preparations for the executions on issuance of the death warrants. Death sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. bdne
