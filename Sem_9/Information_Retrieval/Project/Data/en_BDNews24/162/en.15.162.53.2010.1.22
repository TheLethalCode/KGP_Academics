 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)--All corruption cases against politicians should be settled fast, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh (BDB) president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury said on Friday. "Democracy cannot be consolidated if corruption is not rooted out," he also said at the inaugural of his party's special council at the auditorium of Institution of Diploma Engineers in Dhaka. Many politicians faced corruption cases during the 2007-08 military-installed caretaker government. Some of them also faced penalty. After coming to power, Awami League-led coalition government decided to withdraw around 2,500 cases, which it said were filed for political persecution. However, opposition BNP alleged that the government is only withdrawing the cases against the leaders of Awami League and its allies. The BDB's Special Council-2010 began at 11am to pass some amendment proposals in its constitution. The party's joint secretary general Mahi B Chowdhury also said no new committee will be formed in this council. Former president Badruddoza Chowdhury criticised both the government and the opposition. "Neither does the government nor the opposition speak the truth. So, there has been a crisis of confidence among the public in politicians. Alternative power to democracy may seize power again in the future if it continues." He said the new government has not been able to deliver on its promise of good governance in its one-year rule. Extra-judicial killings and brandishing of arms are still ongoing on the campus. "But the opposition's claim that the government has failed hundred percent is not correct. There is nothing as 100 percent failure," the former BNP stalwart said. Chowdhury asked both the government and opposition BNP to together make parliament effective in the interest of democracy. "Bring the opposition party back to parliament by giving them more facilities," he said, referring to the speaker. He also criticised the sneering speeches in parliament about late leaders. He advised the government not to make any compromise in reaching an agreement with India on fair share of waters of common rivers. Chowdhury apparently approved of the deal to allow neighbouring countries to use Chittagong and Mongla ports and also called on the government to keep an eye on the security of the country. The BDB president called on the leaders and workers to be more active in strengthening the party. BDB secretary general MA Mannan delivered the welcome speech. b
