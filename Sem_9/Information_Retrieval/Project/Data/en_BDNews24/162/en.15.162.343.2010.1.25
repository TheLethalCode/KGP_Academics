<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is showing its true colours of intolerance just as it did in 1975 when single-party BAKSAL rule was announced, a senior opposition leader has alleged. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, a BNP policymaker, said, "The government is being so partisan in trade, commerce and public administration that other schools of thought don't get any opportunity there." Referring to BAKSAL, he said, "The government has re-launched that one-party system system in the country." He was speaking at a discussion on what the main opposition BNP said was 'democracy killing day' as this same party introduced the concept of a one-party system through the fourth amendment on Jan 25, 1975. BNP standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Nazrul Islam Khan, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, Jamir Uddin Sarcar, among others, spoke at the discussion. Bangladesh struck some treaties, including one on extradition of criminals with India, during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit there. Criticising those treaties, he said, "The country has been sold out through those treaties. Today, our independence and sovereignty are on threat." He asked people to prepare for days to come, which he believed would not bode well for them. Now a BNP standing committee member, Moudud Ahmed was arrested on Dec 29, 1974 under Special Powers Act. He said the ruling AL's apparent intention to revert to the origingal constitution of 1972 was all talk. "They never can do this." He said the Act and amendment for promulgating emergency have to be amended, but the AL would never do that either. When it goes to power, BNP will put plotters of the changeover of Jan 11, 2007 on trial, if Awami League does not try them in its regime, said Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Demanding trial of the former army chief Moeen U Ahmed and others who allegedly plotted Jan11, Chowdhury said, "Rule of law will not be established in the country by only trying murders of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman." "BNP must try them if the present government does not."
