 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com) Mahmudullah took Bangladesh to tea with a responsible half-century in the second and final Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. He was batting on 65 as the Bangladesh moved to 197-8 before the interval. The Tigers, who won the toss and elected to bat, had made a brilliant recovery after slumping to 84-5 by lunch. Mahmudullah, who top-scored in Chittagong in the first innings, watched as the home side lost three more wickets in the post-lunch session. Mushfiqur Rahim fell lbw to Ishant Sharma for 30. Then Shakib Al Hasan (34) played a reckless shot and was caught in the slips off Zaheer Khan. The last man to go was Shahadat Hossain who was stumped off Pragyan Ojha. The home side earlier made a shocking start when Imrul Kayes caught behind off Ishant Sharma at the start of the second over without a run on the board. Though TV replays showed the ball made no contact with the bat and only clipped the top of the pad before going through. Zaheer then grabbed the wickets of Tamim Iqbal (0) and Junaid Siddique (8) to leave the Tigers wobbling at 13-3. Tamim was bowled by a good length that nipped back and crashed into the stumps. Siddique was gone after gloving the ball to the wicketkeeper for a straightforward dismissal. They lost Raqibul Hasan and Mohammad Ashraful either side of the drinks break. Raqibul was caught by Rahul Dravid in the slips playing away from his body off Sharma while Ashraful (39) was stumped off the bowling of slow left-arm spinner Ojha, who had just been introduced into the attack. The hosts made one change bringing in Siddique to replace Shahriar Nafees. The tourists, who won the first Test in Chittagong by 113 runs, dropped lerg-spinner Amit Mishra. Pragyan Ojha came into the side in his place, with MS Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh also returning after missing the first Test through injury. However, they were missing VVS Laxman and Sreesanth as both returned home inj
