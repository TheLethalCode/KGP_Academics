<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)--Rajuk will soon begin demolish unauthorised parts of 5000 installationsin the capital, the city development agency's chief said. At a meeting at Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakkho on Friday, RAJUK chairman Mohammad Nurul Huda said the buildings were constructed defying the designs that they had approved. RAJUK recently ordered Jamuna Future Park authorities to dismantle the unauthorised parts of the structure. "We have identified 5,000 residential and commercial structures and served notice on the owners asking them to demolish the unauthorised parts of the structures," Huda said. He also talked about the shortage of workforce which is hindering the demolition work. The chairman said, "Demolition drive is not getting momentum due to a lack of adequate manpower as one magistrate has to do the work of eight." Jamuna Future Park authority has appealed against the RAJUK order in the High Court. Another 5000 such cases are pending against RAJUK. Regarding the cases, the chairman said, "RAJUK is losing the legal battle because of the absence of proper steps as it has to run its activities through numerous internal and external hurdles. Huda urged the city dwellers to keep away from brokers and directly approach RAJUK for approval of design of structures. He also called on all not to purchase plot and flat from the housing companies not registered with Rajuk and said steps were being taken against the corrupt employees of Rajuk. The chief said 12 employees charged with irregularities and illegal activities have been handed punishment and eight have already lost their job. bdnew
