 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)The government has moved to recover 90 acres of the forest department's land in Gazipur illeaglly occupied by 69 persons including Jamuna Group chief Nurul Islam Babul. "The order has been passed to the district commissioner to recover the land and declare it a 'restricted area'," forest and environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumdar told reporters at the Secretariat. "Jamuna Group applied to purchase 12 kathas at Shafipur in 1998. But it began to cut down trees and filling up the land even before the process had been finalised." "Later it also grabbed 4.53 acres under the forest department," he said. A case was filed in 1999 which the home ministry withdrew in 2002. Another case was filed just afterwards and the process is still ongoing, said Majumder. "The land is currently under the possession of Jamuna Group," Majumdar said. The ministry produced a list of 69 encroachers which stated that the Jamuna Group possessed 4.53 acres. Cocola Food Products with 12.35 acres has forcibly occupied the most part, according to the statement. State minister for forest and environment Hasan Mahmud recently disclosed the list in parliament. Following this, the daily Jugantor, a newspaper owned by the Jamuna Group, on Friday carried a news titled 'Challenge by Jamunademanding resignation of the state minister for environment upon failure to prove the case'. The secretary said, "We don't mean to put up a counter challenge. We only wish to say what is true." "The list provided in parliament is correct," he added. Tension between Babul and the government came to a head recently, especially after the suspension of Jamuna TV's test transmission, another venture of the group, for not having a 'no objection certificate'. Last week, Rajuk ordered demolition of unauthorised portions of the multi-storey shopping complex, Jamuna Future Park, owned by the group. At this point, Babul signaled involvement of a minister behind these measures. Although there were 69 names on the list, the secretary mainly spoke about Babul. Majumdar said some 2.5 lakh acres of the forest department around the country were under illegal occupation, of which 11,639 acres in Dhaka, are under the possession of around 50,000 people. bdnew
