 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)--A batting master-class by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid put India in a commanding position in the second Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Monday. The pair notched up a 222-run partnership for the third wicket that effectively put the game beyond the hosts as India closed the second day's play on 459-5, a lead of 226. Indian captain MS Dhoni was batting on 22 with Harbhajan Singh edging Shafiul Islam to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim for 13 off the last ball of the day. The No. 1 ranked Test team toyed with the Bangladesh bowlers to tighten their grip over the match and their partnership left Bangladesh, trailing the two-match series 1-0, no room for a comeback. The stand was halted by a Shahadat Hossan bouncer that didn't lift appreciably and smashed into the side of Dravid's face. He retired hurt on 111 straight away. Bangladesh, who trail the two-match series 1-0 having lost in Chittagong by 113 runs on Jan 21, made 233 all out in their first innings on the opening day. The Tendulkar-Dravid show registered the world record of most 100-plus run partnership by any pair. They have now 17 100-plus partnerships, one more than the Australian pair of Mathew Hayden and Ricky Ponting, and West Indians Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, who have 16 such stands. The stalwarts of Indian cricket had carried on the good work done earlier before lunch by openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir who put on a century stand after resuming the battle on 69 without loss. The day began well for the Tigers when with the score on 103, Sehwag was forced to fend off a snorter from Shahadat Hossain and was caught behind. He made 56 off 63 balls with eight fours. Gambhir (68) joined his partner back in the dressing after he was out in a similar manner to the bowling of Shafiul Islam half an hour before the break. He was surprised by a well-directed bouncer which had him jumping in the air before the ball looped towards the keeper. Gambhir was trying to become the second batsman after the great Donald Bradman to score sixth consecutive Test hundreds. He did however equal Sir Viv Richards with the most number of fifties in succession  11. Dravid was lucky to still be there at lunch after getting the benefit of doubt when he was out of the crease at the non-striker's end while on nine and then being called back after getting caught off a Rubel Hossain no-ball. Bangladesh captain Shakib also accounted for Murali Vijay--only batsman in the top half of Indian batting line-up to miss out on a half-century-- just before close for a 49-ball 3
