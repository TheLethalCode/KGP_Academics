<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)Thirty-eight political parties have submitted their fully ratified constitutions to the Election Commission up to the Sunday (Jan 24) deadline. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, talking to reporters at the EC secretariat, said only the Freedom Party, of 39 parties registered with draft constitutions before the December 2008 general elections, had failed to place its final constitution by the deadline, risking cancellation of registration. The 39 parties were registered on submission of newly drafted constitutions in line with the amended Representation of the People Order in 2008, which made such registration mandatory for taking part in national elections. Ruling Awami League submitted its constitution on July 25 last year and opposition BNP on Jan 21 this year. Bangladesh Samajtantric Dal placed its constitution on Sunday, the last day. Election officials said Syed Tareque Rahman, son of Freedom Party chairman Syed Faruk Rahman, one of five death-row convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case, wrote a letter to the EC earlier in the week saying it was not possible for the party to ratify its constitution through a national council in the "prevailing political atmosphere". A number of leaders and activists of Freedom Party, founded mainly by the assassins of president Shiekh Mujibur Rahman in the mid-80s with the support of former president HM Ershad, were arrested after the present Awami League-led alliance swept to power in 2008 elections. Jatiya Party of Ershad is a key ally in the governing coalition. Some family members of Freedom Party leaders were also arrested following the Oct 22, 2009 bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash. The Freedom Party arrestees include son of Sheikh Mujib murder convicts Faruque Rahman's son, Bazlul Huda's two nephews, Abdur Rashid's daughter and Mohiuddin Ahmed's two sons. Sakhawat said on Sunday registration is always open to political parties. "Any party having its registration cancelled can get fresh registration on proper application, following the provisions of the RPO." CCTV AT VULNERABLE DCC POLL CENTRES Sakhawat said the commission would install close circuit televisions (CCTVs) at vulnerable centres during the upcoming Dhaka City Corporation polls. He said the commission has decided not to deploy army personnel and is also thinking of not engaging border guards as security in the city polls. "Police personnel from outside Dhaka will be hired if necessary," he said. The commissioner said preparations for the DCC election had neared completion. He said highest security measures would be taken to avert any untoward incident. "We want to see the DCC election as a model one. Apart from administrative and judicial magistrates, EC's own monitoring teams will remain vigil." Election officials said the schedule for DCC elections will be announced in mid-February and elections held in March. They said the commission does not want further delay in the crucial vote. The officials said the draft Election Rules, Code of Conduct and Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) Rules are waiting vetting by the law ministry. bd
