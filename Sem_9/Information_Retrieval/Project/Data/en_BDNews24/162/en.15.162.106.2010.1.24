<TITLE> SEC not appealing ruling on MFs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--The stock market regulator has thought better of appealing against a High Court ruling on mutual funds (MFs), an official said on Sunday. Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan, executive director at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the media that the market regulator had decided not to appeal against the order which allows mutual funds to issue rights and bonus shares. On July 22, 2007, the SEC amended its rule prohibiting mutual funds to increase its paid-up capital through issuing rights shares. The decision also stopped mutual fund operators issuing bonus shares as dividend. The restrictions, just two days before the closing of accounts of mutual funds, angered retail investors who staged demonstrations and caused a slump in the prices of MFs. The market slipped into the red due to sell-offs as investor confidence in the market took a tumble. Investors Ibrahim Akand, Raihana Haque and Delwar Hossain petitioned the High Court on Aug 28, 2008 to declare the SEC unlawful. On Nov 8 last year, the High Court in its ruling allowing MFs to issue rights and bonus shares, but withheld it the same day, for seven days. The move was made after pleas from lawyers defending the SEC as they would appeal against the decision. Consequently, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Nov 11 halted for two weeks the High Court order upon the SEC's move but the market regulator finally gave up.
