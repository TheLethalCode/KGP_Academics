 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were in disarray at lunch on 84-5 after winning the toss and electing to bat in the second and final Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday.

Zaheer Khan then grabbed the wickets of Tamim Iqbal (0) and Junaid Siddique (8) to leave the Tigers wobbling at 13-3. Tamim was bowled by a good length that nipped back and crashed into the stumps. Siddique was gone after gloving the ball to the wicketkeeper for a straightforward dismissal. They lost Raqibul Hasan and Mohammad Ashraful either side of the drinks break. Raqibul was caught by Rahul Dravid in the slips playing away from his body off Ishant Sharma while Ashraful (39) was stumped off the bowling of slow left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, who had just been introduced into the attack.
