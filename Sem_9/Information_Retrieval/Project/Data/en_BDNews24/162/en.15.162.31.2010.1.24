<TITLE> Bangladesh look to square series with India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)- Hosts Bangladesh will be looking to square the two-match Idea Cup series when they face India in the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. Although the Tigers lost the first Test at Chittagong's Zohur Ahmed Cricket Stadium by 113 runs despite dismissing India for 243 in the first innings, opening batsman Tamim Iqbal still believed their opponents are not invincible. "We have not come here to participate. We are here to compete and fight. We can draw the series," he said on Saturday. "We played well in Chittagong. Yes, we made some mistakes. But we won't try to repeat those. Our objective is to get a positive outcome be it a win or a draw. He thought most of team-mates lacked concentration and as a result often threw their wickets after getting starts. "It is really annoying after doing all the hard work to get out to a soft dismissal. Ashraful is one such player who falls into that category. But we have to remember is he has scored five Test centuries. So, he has the quality to make good scores." Bangladesh will take heart from some of the positive things they achieved during the Chittagong Test. Musfiqur Rahim scoring the fastest hundred by a Bangladeshi batsman and Shahadat Hossain and Shakib Al Hasan both grabbing five wickets each. The home side may make some changes at the top of the order by bringing in Junaid Siddique to replace either Shahriar Nafees or Imrul Kayes. On the other hand, India welcomed back captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh from injury. Dhoni was ruled out due to back strain. But they will be without batsman VVS Laxman and pacer Sreesanth. Sreesanth returned home ahead of the second Test because of a thigh strain he suffered while bowling on the final day of the Chittagong Test. Laxman has been ruled out of the Test as well, creating an opportunity for M Vijay to add to his two Test caps. Laxman was supposed to have left for India on Friday but there had been a change of plan. Laxman had hurt his left hand when he dropped a catch at third slip in the first Test and had ten stitches to his hand. He was seen practising two days before the second Test, using only his non-injured hand, and on the eve of the match he was declared not fit. Dhoni was optimistic of clinching the series 2-0. "It's not the margin of victory that is important. I think it is winning that is important. It's important that we get a good start and after that you can really dictate terms to set your target and look to achieve it." "Gautam Gambhir is a very good batsman who is doing really well for us. Match after match he comes up with good score. We are just hoping he gets one more in the coming two innings (in Dhaka Test). It will be a proud moment for him and for us.' "Competition gets the best out of a player. It's important that players are pushing each other to get a slot in the longer format." When asked can Bangladesh take 20 wickets, Dhoni said: "That's why they are playing Test match. They are expected to take 20 wickets. "You should not really take any side lightly. At the end of the day you need to bowl ten balls in the right areas. It does not the matter who the bowler is. If you bowl in good areas, the batsman can commit any mistake. There are no good reasons why your side can't take 20 odd wickets. It's about creating that pressure. It is very important to bowl in good areas. That's what they need to do right now
