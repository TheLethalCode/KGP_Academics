 BAGHDAD, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Vice President Joe Biden met Iraqi officials in Baghdad on Saturday amid a row over a decision to bar scores of candidates from a March election over suspected links to Saddam Hussein's Baath party. The move by an independent panel has outraged Sunnis who dominated Iraq for more than two decades under Saddam and who see it as an attempt to marginalise their community, casting doubt on the inclusiveness and legitimacy of the March 7 vote. US officials privately say the arbitrary way the list appears to have been drawn up and the questionable legitimacy of the panel could undermine the election. But Iraqi officials told Biden they did not need nor seek US interference. "The issue of accountability and justice is an Iraqi issue and there is no foreign role in it, nor is there a role for foreign influence," government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Reuters after Biden met Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. "There is no role for Biden in this issue and he didn't come to interfere in this issue but to help Iraq in its strategic relations with the US," Dabbagh added. The sectarian violence between minority Sunnis and majority Shi'ites unleashed by the 2003 US invasion has begun to fade. But Iraq's security remains fragile, and is frequently put to the test by suicide bombings and killings carried out by suspected Sunni Islamist insurgents such as al Qaeda, or attacks US officials blame on Shi'ite militia supported by Iran. The March election is a test of whether Iraq can sustain the growing peace and build a future of stability and prosperity on the back of multibillion-dollar contracts the country has started to sign with global oil companies. One of the officials Biden met was Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani, who is presiding over deals with oil firms that could catapult Iraq to third place from 11th among oil producing nations and make its crude output rival Saudi Arabia's. "I just want to say in light of your newfound prosperity, I'm available for adoption," Biden joked during a photo call. ELECTION ROW But the election row is potentially serious. Sunnis largely boycotted the last national elections in 2005, feeding resentment and fuelling the insurgency against US troops and the Shi'ite-led government. That could happen again if Sunnis feel unfairly excluded from this election. A US official travelling with Biden on his third visit to Iraq since US troops pulled out of urban centres in June said he was confident the furore would be resolved by Iraqis. "I would say, based on the recent months especially, that what we've seen is a growing and significant ability of Iraqis to resolve their differences and disputes through the political process," said Biden's national security adviser Antony Blinken. "And so I don't think it's the place of the United States or any other outside country to resolve these kinds of problems for Iraqis because they are demonstrating they are more than capable of resolving it for themselves," Blinken said on Friday night. The list of 511 banned candidates included more Shi'ite politicians than Sunnis. It was weighted against secular groups expected to fare well in the election against the Shi'ite Islamist parties that have dominated Iraq since the invasion. More of the 6,500 candidates in total standing in the election are expected to be banned for other reasons, such as for having criminal records or using fake university degrees
