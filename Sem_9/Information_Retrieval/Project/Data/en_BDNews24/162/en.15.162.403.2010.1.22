 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)--Local government activities need to be further augmented to ensure citizens' rights, speakers say at the Citizen Rights Fair. The two-day fair, which kicked off on Friday, brought about sixty NGOs and human-rights organisation together with an attempt to create awareness about rights that the people entitled to as citizens. Former caretaker government chief Justice Habibur Rahman inaugurated the fair at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. There is no alternative other than building a good democratic system for ensuring citizen rights, said Rahman at the inaugural ceremony. "For that, the local government should be strengthened, based on which a strong democracy can be developed. Only then citizen's rights would be fulfilled," he added. An Upazilla Parishad vice chairman also stated that local governments are far from being empowered. "We have no work to do; our jurisdiction is not defined even a year into our election," Jostina Nokrak from Modhupur upazilla of Tangil district told the gathering. Professor Wahiduddin Mahmud said Bangladesh has done quite well in some of the indicators of citizen rights like school enrolment, infant mortality rate and birth control. "But on issues like health services, quality of education, human rights especially ensuring rights for the poor people, we are far behind." Mahmud, who teaches economics at the University of Dhaka, echoed Justice Rahman on the need of strengthening democratic institution and the leadership for citizen rights. The fair, organised by Nagorik Odhikar Mela (Citizen Rights Fair) Organising Committee, a consortium of several NGOs and the Development Institute of BRAC University, aims to address the general perception that all citizens are not equal. A study in 2007 by the BRAC Development Institute found that although most people at the grassroots level think they are citizens, not everyone believes that all citizens are equal. Equality of citizens is linked to equal access to rights and it is the less educated, children, women and the elderly that do not have the access, according to the report. One of the prime objectives of the fair is also to establish that every Bangladeshi has the "right to have rights" guaranteed by the constitution, reads a statement by the organisers.
