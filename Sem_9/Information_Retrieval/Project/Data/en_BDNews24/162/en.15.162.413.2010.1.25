 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka stocks touched new record for a single-day turnover and key index once again on Monday amid concerns of sustainability without supply of new issues. The premier bourse for the first time crossed the Tk 1.5 billion mark while the benchmark index closed on 5312.44 points, shooting up 3.02 percent or 155 points. On Sunday, shares worth Tk 14.52 billion changed hands against the earlier record of Tk 14.38 billion, while the benchmark general index or the DGEN closed on 5156.61 points, breaking the height of 5095.21 points in the past session on Thursday. Market experts, however, were sceptical about the sustainability of trend but ruled out a heavy price fall. "Price correction is imminent but it is hard to say whether it would be heavy," Moin Al Kashem, chief executive of Prime Finance Asset Management Company, told bdnews24.com. The market is seeing an influx of new investors, hence injection of funds every day, which would cushion the price correction, he added. "So, the price correction would not sustain also." He said that the market P/E (price earning) is rising substantially, signalling that investment is getting more and more unsafe. The market P/E was stood at Tk 25.65 at the end of the last year, jumping from Tk 18.42 a year ago. Supply constraint is a grave problem contributing to the overpriced market, according to Kashem. "The market urgently needs supply of fresh shares, that's the only way to cool it down." Issues from sectors like telecom, ship building and power should be brought in to the market, he added. Mutual funds, power, insurance and market leader Grameenphone spearheaded the day's gains. The market bellwether, banks, eroded Sunday's gains. Heated trades in mutual funds and GP contributed much to the turnover, according to brokerage house officials. The market regulator's decision not to appeal against a High Court order, allowing brokers to issue rights shares and bonus shares, spurred the sector's gain. Meanwhile, market roller GP saw a hefty hike. It was traded between TK 275 and Tk 288 against the previous day's close of Tk 252. It was the turnover leader with shares of Tk 1.28 billion changing hands. Beximco Pharma, Beximco, Shinepukur Ceramics and Navana CNG were the other turnover leaders.
