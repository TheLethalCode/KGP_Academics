<TITLE> Dream come true for Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com) H M Ershad's dream of seeing Rangpur become a division has finally come true. It has been a long-cherished dream of the former military dictator, currently part of the Awami League-led ruling coalition as Jatiya Party chairman. Originally from the district of Rangpur, Ershad had previously wanted to see it upgraded to higher administrative unit of division. The government on Monday carved out the northwestern region as a new administrative division comprising eight districts of greater Rangpur and Dinajpur. Welcoming the decision, which also happened to be part of Awami League's election manifesto, the ousted dictator demanded sufficient gas supply to the poverty-prone area. In an instant reaction, Ershad told bdnews24.com on Monday, "It was like a long yearning for us. The people of Rangpur are happy today. I thank the honourable prime minister." Both Awami League and Jatiya Party pledged to turn Rangpur into a division. Ershad said, "I'm happy thinking that both the parties' pledges have been fulfilled today." Ershad remained in power for nine years as a military dictator since 1982 during which time he did substantial development work, especially road communications, in his home district and is fondly remembered in the area for those efforts. The general told bdnews24.com about a perennial problem that has plagued the entire northern region for years. He stressed infrastructure and said that it should be the next step to facilitate industrialisation of the region. "As this region has fallen back, industrial institutions should be established there as soon as possible." But for that, the region would require gas supply, he said. "The people of Rangpur will forever remain grateful to the prime minister if she can supply gas to Rangpur." bd
