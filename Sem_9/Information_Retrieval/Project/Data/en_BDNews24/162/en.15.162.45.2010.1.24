 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has once again deferred a hearing on petitions filed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and son Tarique Rahman for staying proceedings of the Zia Orphanage Trust case. A High Court Division bench, of justices Md Abdul Wahhab and Md Abdur Razzak, on Sunday set January 27 as the next hearing date on a motion by the state counsel, attorney general Mahbubey Alam, seeking more time. The court on January 21 deferred the hearing to Sunday on a similar motion by the state. The case, filed with Ramna police station in July 2008, accuses Khaleda, Tarique and four others of embezzling more than Tk 20 million from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. The others, accused in the case, include late president Ziaur Rahman's nephew Mominur Rahman, former bureaucrat Dr Kamaludddin Siddiqui and former BNP MP Quazi Salimul Haq. The metropolitan sessions judge's court took cognisance of the charges last September. Khaleda, leader of the opposition, and a two-time former prime minister, and Tarique, senior vice-chairman of BNP, have both received bail in the case. Tarique is currently receiving medical treatment in the UK. b
