 NEW YORK, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Spice Girls are out to conquer the world again with a musical based on their hit songs. The British all-girl band is collaborating on the show, which will have an original story and be built around Spice Girls hits. It has the working title "Viva Forever" after the group's 1998 British No. 1 single. The show is being created by the band's former manager Simon Fuller and Judy Craymer, who produced the musical "Mamma Mia!" featuring the songs of Swedish band Abba, which was a worldwide hit. The group's five members are "Sporty Spice" Melanie Chisholm, also known as Mel C, "Posh Spice" Victoria Beckham, "Ginger Spice" Geri Halliwell, "Baby Spice" Emma Bunton and "Scary Spice" Melanie Brown. The creators hope the show will have its debut on the London stage in two or three years and, if successful, could be performed in other countries.

Craymer said in a statement that the musical would be "a unique celebration of the band and its music, with its own flavor and joyful message.
