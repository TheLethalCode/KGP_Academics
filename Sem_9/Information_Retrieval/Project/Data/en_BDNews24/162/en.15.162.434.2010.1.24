<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has stayed for one week a High Court order on handover of key of Proshika headquarters to the incumbent governing body. Appellate Division chamber judge Justice Mozammel Hossain gave the order on Sunday on a petition filed by ousted chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed. Faruque has been asked to file a leave to appeal by this period. Proshika staff returned to work on Saturday after police handed back the keys to the incumbent governing body following clashes earlier this month that led to a lockdown at the headquarters of one of the country's largest NGOs. On Jan 19 the High Court ordered police to return the key to the governing body and ruled that Faruque and his supporters could not go near the building until his petition was resolved in court. The incumbent governing body removed Faruque from the chairman's office in May last year following allegations of corruption. He has since petitioned the High Court challenging the legality of the decision. Faruque's men had marched on Proshika Bhaban on Jan 12, entered and forced Proshika staff out of the building. Tensions ran high for 24 hours in and around the headquarters as his supporters and those loyal to the current governing body fought for control of the building. Police locked the main entrance on Jan 13 and cordoned off the area to prevent clashes. bdne
