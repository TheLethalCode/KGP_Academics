 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)--The Bangladesh government wants to sign agreements with India on sharing of all common rivers, including the Teesta, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said on Saturday. Briefing journalists at the foreign ministry Saturday, the secretary also said Myanmar's recognition of the equity principle for demarcating their maritime boundary had resolved a long-standing dispute that threatened 17 of Bangladesh's blocks in the Bay of Bengal. He defended the government's move of an "ad hoc deal" on Teesta water sharing and said such an interim agreement would give a common ground to strike a full treaty in the long term. "We want to sign a long term deal on Teesta's water sharing, but it requires hydrological survey data, which is a time consuming process," Quayes told reporters at foreign ministry conference room. "Therefore, we want to sign an interim deal on the Teesta's water sharing and this accord will give a foundation for the desired long term deal in future," he said. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, three days ago, said that the government was looking to sign an "ad hoc" deal with India on sharing Teesta waters. "Not only the Teesta, but we want to sign agreements on all common rivers (with India)," said the foreign secretary adding that India during prime minister's visit recognised Bangladesh as "important" in the region. Lower riperian Bangladesh shares 54 common rivers with India and the two neighbours have signed only one water sharing agreement to date, on the Ganges, the lifeline of Bangladesh's north and southwest, in 1996. SEA BORDER DEADLOCK 'RESOLVED' The secretary said Bangladesh and Myanmar during Jan 8-9 maritime boundary talks had emerged from a long deadlock over the demarcation procedure. "Myanmar for the first time recognised the 'equity method' to demarcate the sea boundary. This is a very big development in the maritime talks," said Quayes. He said Myanmar in the past had always pushed for the 'equidistance method' for delimiting the sea boundary. The equidistance method would deprive Bangladesh of 17 out of 28 offshore blocks in the Bay of Bengal and Bangladesh's sea zone would be locked. "Therefore, we need not appoint arbitrator at the UN tribunal to settle the disputes over maritime boundary delimitation with Myanmar," said Quayes. "But we are still in the process of appointing arbitrator for settling the maritime disputes with India," he said. The secretary said Bangladesh-Myanmar maritime delimitation had been referred to the United Nations tribunal under UNCLOS. "If Bangladesh and Mynmar could settle the remaining issues through bilateral talks, the UNCLOS tribunal would be redundant," said the secretary. The technical level meeting on Jan 8-9 in Chittagong agreed that Bangladesh and Myanmar would demarcate the common sea boundary through a combination of equity and equi-distance methods. "The agreement with Myanmar means Bangladesh no longer need worry about losing 17 blocks in the Bay of Bengal," Commodore Khurshed Alam, an additional secretary, told reporters. Alam led the Bangladesh side at the maritime talks with Myanmar in Chittagong.
