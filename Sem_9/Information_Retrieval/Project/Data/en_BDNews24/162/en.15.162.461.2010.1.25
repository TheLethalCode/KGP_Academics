 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission has found Jamaat-e-Islami's constitution inconsistent with the law and told the party to amend it. An EC secretariat official said on Sunday that the Islamist party, a major ally of opposition BNP, had been notified in writing that their constitution did not adhere to the provisions of the Representation of People Order. The Election Commission has also written to Tarikat Federation, Bangladesh Khelafat Andolan for amending their constitution accordingly and five other parties for correcting clerical mistakes, Sabed-Ur-Rahman, assistant secretary of the Election Commission secretariat told bdnews24.com. The five other parties were Jatiya Party, Ganatanti Party, Workers' Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesh National Awami Party-NAP, Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal and Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh, he said. Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain said, "We have received all ratified constitutions of political parties except the Freedom Party and will write to all after scrutiny." Referring apparently to Jamaat-e-Islami, he said, "As long as their constitutions are inconsistent with the constitution and the RPO registration clauses, we will not accept them." "So we are writing to them for amendment," he said. "We are only thanking those parties that have submitted an acceptable version of constitution after ratification within the party." The Election Commission has already sent letters of thanks to Communist Party of Bangladesh, Liberal Democratic Party, Awami League and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu). A high official of the commission, who is also on the committee for scrutinising the ratified constitutions, said Jamaat's constitution contradicted the country's constitution despite requests for amendment. He said, "Jamaat-e-Islami submitted their ratified constitution on July 23 keeping those sections intact, which were in place before Dec 29 elections last year." The official said sub-clause 5 of the clause 2 stated that it did not acknowledge any entity other than Allah as a sovereign and the supreme being. According to the committee, this provision essentially undermines the authority of the parliament and elected legislature. Sub clause 3 of the same clause states that the party strives to establish Islamic law. The committee observed that there was no such scope according to the constitution of the land and in fact, it ran contrary to the constitution. According to the review committee there are seven such provisions in Jamaat's constitution that contradict the RPO. It also said that most other parties also have minor lapses as far as 33 percent women's representation by 2020 is concerned. The RPO states that none of the parties' constitutions may contradict that of the national constitution and that there will be no discrimination on the basis of religion, sect, language or gender. Jamaat had protested against both the provisions and lobbied to strike them off the RPO in their consultation with the Election Commission during the regime of the military-controlled interim government. bdnew
