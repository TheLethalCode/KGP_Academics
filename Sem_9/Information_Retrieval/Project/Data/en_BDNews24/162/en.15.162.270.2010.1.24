<TITLE> Mahmudullah shines as India look to bat big </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Lenin Gani Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  A career-best half-century by Mahmudullah was the highlight of a disappointing performance by Bangladesh on the opening day of the second and final Test against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. The 23-year-old middle-order batsman was left stranded on 96 not out after salvaging the hosts' cause that at one stage looked absolutely hopeless. By the time last man Rubel Hossain was dismissed, the Tigers had reached a respectable 233 in their first innings. Openers Virender Sehwag (41) and Gautam Gambhir (26) batted India through to the close on 69 without loss. Mahmudullah, who came to the crease at 106-6 put his seniors to shame with a responsible 156-ball knock that featured 13 fours. Although he was left with the lower-order, he came within striking distance of a deserved maiden Test century only days after top scoring in the Chittagong Test. Whereas experienced team-mates Mohammad Ashraful and even skipper Shakib Al Hasan played ordinary shots to get out after Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat, the young right-hander, Mahmudullah, who only made his debut during last year's tour of West Indies, read the situation. The Tigers got off to a bumpy start after Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan tore through to leave them 13-3. Only Imrul Kayes could consider himself unlucky after being caught behind off Sharma at the start of the second over without a run on the board. TV replays showed the ball made no contact with the bat and only clipped the top of the pad before going through. Zaheer then grabbed the wickets of Tamim Iqbal (0) and Junaid Siddique (8). Tamim was bowled by a good length that nipped back and crashed into the stumps. Siddique was gone after gloving the ball to the wicketkeeper for a straightforward dismissal. Bangladesh went from bad to worse after Raqibul Hasan and Mohammad Ashraful departed to make it 51-5. Raqibul was caught by Rahul Dravid in the slips playing away from his body off Sharma while Ashraful (39) was stumped off the bowling of slow left-arm spinner Ojha, who had just been introduced into the attack. First Test centurion Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib steadied the ship putting on 33 runs for the sixth wicket before lunch. But Sharma came back after the break to end the 55-run stand when he trapped the Bangladesh wicketkeeper lbw for 30. Shakib showed even he could succumb to pressure after he decided to chase a ball he should have left alone from Zaheer and it fell into MS Dhoni's gloves. By the time the eighth wicket had fallen, those watching in the 'home of Bangladesh cricket' must have been wondering whether it was game over. But Mahmudullah, playing in only his third Test, and tail-enders Shafiul Islam and Rubel Hossain frustrated their opponents pushing the score towards respectability. Harbhajan eventually ended Bangladesh's resistance with a ball that went through Rubel's defences leaving Mahmudullah agonizingly four runs short of a land
