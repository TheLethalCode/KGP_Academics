<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court asked authorities on Monday to explain a distorted depiction of Shekh Mujibur Rahman's role in the liberation war in 1971. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin and Borhanuddin asked authorities to explain why the depiction of Sheikh Mujib's call to war for liberation should not be rewritten and why the textbooks, with such distortion, should not be confiscated. It also warned authorities concerned to refrain from publishing such materials. The ruling came after the court heard a petition by Aftabuddin and Mahmud Hossain, two Supreme Court lawyers seeking correction of distorted national history. The court issued the order asking 15 persons including the Bangladesh Open University vice chancellor and education secretary to provide their explanation within a week. The court set Feb 2 for the next hearing. The petition alleged that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's role in declaring national independence and in the war of liberation was portrayed in a distorted manner in June 2009 editions of the Open University's higher secondary textbooks for social science, civics and history. Advocate Belal Hossain Joy represented the petitioners. bdnew
