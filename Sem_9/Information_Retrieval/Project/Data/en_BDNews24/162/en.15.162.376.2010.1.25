 Feni, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Fifty-eight border guards have pleaded guilty to acts of rebellion in Feni, sparked by the bloody mutiny at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka last February, and sought pardon from the trail court. Of 62 accused, 18 pleaded guilty to charges and sought pardon on Monday and 40 on Sunday as the Feni mutiny trial resumed in special court after a month-long recess. Four have pleaded not guilty. Commander of 19 Rifles Battalion Lt Col Gazi Md Salahuddin, prosecutor in the case, told journalists in the afternoon that the speical court, set up at the Jailashkar battalion headquarters in Daganbhuiyan Upazila, had postponed the proceeding until Mar 28 after hearing from 10am to 5pm. A panel of judges, led by BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam, heard from 18 witnesses during Monday's proceedings. The court heard from the plaintiff of the case, company commander Subedar Jalal Ahmed the previous day. The other judges are Lt Col Md Akhtaruzzaman and Major Md Maksudul Alam. Advocate Md Forhad Ahmed was present during the proceedings as a representative of the attorney general. Daganbhuiyan police filed a case accusing the 62 border guards of armed rebellion in Feni in support of the Feb 25-26 mutiny in Dhaka last year. All 62 accused are being detained in Feni jail. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed in the mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. Among the acts of rebellion during that time, a contingent of Feni border guards took up arms, fired shots in public and blocked the Feni-Maizdi Road on Feb 26. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases of mutiny and rebellion around the country. The first trial began in Rangamati on Nov 24, followed by one at Satkhira beginning Dec 7. The Feni trial began on Dec 20. bdnews
