 Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com) -- New Zealand batsman Jesse Ryder will not be considered for selection for the home series against Bangladesh as he continues to struggle with a lower stomach muscle injury, reports Cricinfo. Ryder had a recurrence of the injury while training, and there are serious doubts over his availability for New Zealand's home series against Australia as well as the ICC World Twenty20 in May.

"Anything else we can have players ready for, like the world Twenty20, that's fantastic, but our focus is the World Cup and I want the New Zealand selectors to be able to choose from every player we have to make that squad.
