<TEXT>
 Rangamati, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  CHT regional council chairman Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, on Saturday asked the government to remove barriers for full implementation of the CHT peace accord. He also called upon the government to ban the United People's Democratic Front saying that it stands in the way of implementing the accord. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity chief Santu Larma made the demand speaking at the conference of the Sanghati Samity activists' conference at the municipal auditorium of Rangamati. Santu Larma said he thought that some men of the Samity, known as reformists, are also responsible for impeding the accord's implementation. Jana Sanghati Samity's Rangamati municipality's acting president Nilotpal Thisa presided over the ceremony where Rangamati district Jana Sanghati president Gunendu Bikash Chakma, among others, were present. Speakers at the ceremony demanded a timetable on action plan for implementing the accord and said the government had failed to take any step regarding implementation of the accord's basic issues even in the first 13 months of its tenure. They also doubted about the sincerity of the government regarding implementation of the accord. The CHT peace accord was signed on Dec 2, 1997 during the previous tenure of the currently ruling Awami League. bdnew
