<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leeds United's victory at Manchester United gave their fans a taste of the stage they feel their club should still be playing on, and Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at Tottenham Hotspur offers a juicy second bite. The fourth round draw was short on blockbuster ties but the clash between a club still climbing off the canvas after a spectacular fall from grace since reaching the Champions League semi-final in 2001, and one with a massive Cup pedigree, will guarantee an old-fashioned atmosphere at White Hart Lane. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, whose side lost 2-0 at Liverpool Wednesday, can never be accused of taking the Cup lightly and will have his sights set on a May afternoon at Wembley. "Cup final day is the best day of the year for me," Redknapp, who won the competition with Portsmouth in 2008, told www.thefa.com. "When I was growing up, everyone looked forward to watching the Cup final. For me, it will always have great importance and I know what it means." With Jermaine Beckford's goal having dispatched 11-time winners United and seven-time winners Liverpool humbled by Reading, two of English football's big four have already bitten the dust. Chelsea and Arsenal will not be taking anything for granted either, as they face testing away ties. Arsenal, top of the Premier League after a 4-2 win over Bolton Wanderers Wednesday, are away at Stoke City on Sunday, while Chelsea travel to Championship (second division) Preston North End Saturday. "It gives you a better chance with two of the big guns out," Redknapp added. "But we've drawn a team in Leeds which will present a difficult game for us. "I know just how hard it's going to be. They were fantastic that day at Manchester United, their work rate and the way they played, they looked more like a Premier League team than a League One team." Leeds's joy at beating United was tempered by league slip-ups against Wycombe Wanderers and Exeter City but they have been boosted by the news that the prolific Beckford is staying at Elland Road, despite interest from Everton. "It's another away draw for us," Leeds manager Simon Grayson told the club's website (www.leedsunited.com). "But we'll take great confidence from our win at Manchester United." Portsmouth face Sunderland and Everton host Birmingham City in the other all Premier League ties. The competition's lowest placed survivors, League Two (fourth division) Accrington Stanley, have a dream tie at home to top flight Fulham. More than just a chance to get one over a team packed with household names, the match at Fraser Eagle Stadium could be the difference between staying afloat and going under for Accrington. This week they managed to pay a tax bill after a High Court winding up order was issued against the Lancashire club. "Financially it's a great boost for us," manager John Coleman told BBC radio. "I'd like to think we'd have a bumper crowd Saturday. My lads have given everything all sea
