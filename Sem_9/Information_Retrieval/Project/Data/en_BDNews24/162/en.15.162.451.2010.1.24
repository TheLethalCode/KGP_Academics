 JERUSALEM, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he heard "interesting ideas" from a US envoy on resuming peace talks with the Palestinians but gave no indication any significant progress had been made. Minutes after meeting envoy George Mitchell, Netanyahu reaffirmed at the weekly cabinet session his intention, also voiced by previous Israeli prime ministers, to retain major settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank in any peace deal. "Today I heard some interesting ideas for renewing the (peace) process," the right-wing leader told the cabinet, without elaborating. "I also expressed my hope that these new ideas will allow for the renewal of the process. Certainly if the Palestinians express a similar readiness, then we will find ourselves in a diplomatic process," Netanyahu said. Mitchell, US President Barack Obama's Middle East envoy, told Palestinian leaders on Friday they must resume talks with Israel if they want the US help to achieve a peace treaty that creates a Palestinian state. The Palestinians, who hope to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, refuse to talk until Israel stops all settlement construction in the territory it captured in a 1967 war. Negotiations have been suspended for the past 13 months. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas repeated that demand in talks later on Sunday with Mitchell in Amman, a spokesman for Abbas said. "It's premature to talk about a real breakthrough," said the spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah. "President Abbas reassured (Mitchell) about his commitment to peace." MORATORIUM In what he called a bid to restart talks, Netanyahu announced in November a housing-start freeze in West Bank settlements other than around Jerusalem for 10 months. Despite US pressure, Abbas has not relented on settlements, citing a 2003 peace "road map" obliging Israel to freeze "all settlement activity" and the Palestinian Authority to begin "dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure". After the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu travelled to the West Bank to plant trees, marking Israel's Arbour day, in Maale Adumim and Ariel -- the two largest Israeli settlements -- and in the Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem. "This expresses the unity that exists within the nation about how important it is for these places to remain part of the State of Israel forever," he said. Previous Israeli governments have designated Maale Adumim, Ariel and the Etzion bloc as areas that Israel intends to keep in a future peace deal with the Palestinians that would entail territorial swaps. The World Court has ruled that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal. Many Jewish settlers claim a God-given right to the West Bank, which they call by the biblical names Judea and Samar
