 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Jahanara Begum, 65, had queued for hours despite the freezing cold in front of the UNO office at Patgram in Lalmonirhat. Her clothes were hardly enough to fight the chill. The old woman ran to any well-dressed man she could spot pleading with him to include her name in the list of people to get warm clothes. "Please check whether my name is in the list. And if it is not, then please put it in," she repeated over and over. Jahanara was just one among hundreds of people waiting for three days to get warm clothes from the government last week. She and others in the line alleged that the ward councillors were enlisting names of their supporters only. "We are poor and that's why the leaders don't like us," said Momena Khatun, a fifty-year old woman from Hakuatari village of Patgram. Every year the media reports deaths from severe cold in the northern districts. Persistent fog during the cold wave worsened the situation this year. To aid the poor of this region, the government distributes warm clothes in remote villages and enclaves every year. But the cold-stricken poor alleged that the people's representatives have only enlisted people they favour. "I do not even have sandals in my feet in this cold," said Ambia Khatun, 65, from Dhabalsuti of Patgram showing her bare feet. She alleged that the allocated warm clothes are ending up at the homes of well-off people leaving people like her shivering in the chilly winter. Patgram township mayor Shamsher Ali denied the allegations. "The list has been prepared by the upazila administration officers with the suggestions of ward councillors. Therefore, there is no chance for nepotism," he told bdnews24.com. The plight of the residents of Dahagram-Angarpota enclave, surrounded by India, is even more miserable. Badsha Rahman, 60, from Panbari of the enclave was gladly flapping a blanket he got from UNDP. He had got it only after waiting for several days in front of the UNO office. But he became sad within moments thinking of the eight members of his family. "Will it be possible to cover them all with this blanket?," he wondered. "I got this blanket after pleading with many people in the village including the government officers," he said. The amount of warm clothes distributed by the government is very low, said Mohibul Islam, a grocery shop owner at Thanpara of the enclave The chairman distributed a few blankets, he said. "The warm clothes went to the houses of the better-off people," said Beljan Begum, an old woman from Rahmatpur village. "People like us did not get the clothes," she said. However, Dahagram-Angarpota union council chairman Saiful Islam Pramanik denied the allegations. "It is not possible to satisfy everyone who needs a blanket. That's why some people may have made these allegations," he said. The government officials admit the inadequacy of warm clothes. Rotary International, a voluntary organisation, has distributed 10,000 warm clothes including blankets and jackets in the Rangpur-Dinajpur and Lalmonirhat areas until Jan 18. But, there are allegations of anomalies against this organisation too. "The situation is very bad here. Many people are yet to get warm clothes," said Rotarian Maksudul Alam. He went to the enclave to inspect the situation. "Some more warm clothes will be sent here (enclave). But this time the list will be prepared through the headmistress of the school," he said. Not only in Lalmonirhat, similar allegations came from remote areas of Rangpur, Nilfamari, Panchagarh and Kurigram. "The greed of chairmen and members is limitless. The elephant's stomach will be full but not theirs," said Liton Mia, a labourer from Panjarbhanga village under Balapara Union of Kaunia upazila in Rangpur. "I only hear about relief (warm clothes) but I am yet to see that with my own eyes," he said.
