 Abul Hossain bdnews24.com Gazipur correspondent Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)--Tanjim Ahmed, popularly known as Sohel Taj, who resigned as state minister for home, is returning on Wednesday after a seven-month stay abroad. A source close to Tanjim, son of the country's first prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, said he has bought a ticket for Qatar Airways scheduled to fly Monday night from Dulles Airport in Washington DC. Kapasia upazila Awami League president Md Azgar Rashid said, "We hear that he is coming back to country at 9:30pm on Wednesday. But he has forbidden any reception in advance." Rashid said AL supporters will be still at the airport. "After his return we will initiate a number of development activities." Kapasia general secretary Ruhul Amin said people are in a festive mood as if Eid were here. General secretary of Kapasia unit of pro-AL Bangladesh Chhatra League, Shakhawat Hossain, said the locals would go to the airport, although there were no arrangement as such. "We were like orphans without him," he said. RESIGNATION There was wide speculation on June 1 that the Tanjim would resign. Some dailies published news stating that he had, in fact, resigned due to conflicts with his senior, Sahara Khatun, the home minister. He went to Jamuna to meet the prime minister where he spent more than an hour, an official had told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. Sahara said he had applied for leave citing personal grounds, amid widespread rumours of his resignation. She said she was not aware of Tanjim's resignation, as had been published in the media. Tanjim, who attended office on June 4, also brushed aside rumours, but said he would not take leave since the budget session began. He left for the USA on June 9 to spend some time with his family. But he did not return on July 3, as expected. On July 19, News World, a Washington-based news agency, said, quoting Taj, that he had submitted his resignation before leaving Bangladesh. But Tanjim denied to disclose the reason specifically, "Ethics, philosophy and self-esteem are important to any human being." Sahara on July 21 said, "I know nothing about the resignation. I only know he's on leave." On September 10, Tanjim was included in the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs. Earlier, he had been in the USA during the BDR mutiny in February last year. bdnews24.com/c
