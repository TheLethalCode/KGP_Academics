<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has postponed until Monday hearing of the petition against a Rajuk order for demolishing unapproved portions of Jamuna Future Park. The bench of Justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Justice Md Borhanuddin heard the petition on Sunday and postponed the hearing for a day. The court on Thursday deferred the hearing to Sunday after additional attorney general Murad Reza filed a petition seeking time for hearing. The Dhaka City's development authority Rajdhani Unnayan Kortripakkho last week gave the authorities seven days to knock down the illegal installations of the Park, a project of Jamuna Group. Rajuk official Shaqur Rahman had told bdnews24.com that Park had built beyond the approved six floors. Nurul Islam, chief of Jamuna Future Park and owner of the daily Jugantar newspaper, challenged the Rajuk order in court. The much-vaunted Future Park is being constructed on 10 acres of land in the capital's Bashundhara area. Jamuna has been claiming that it would be the largest shopping mall in South Asia
