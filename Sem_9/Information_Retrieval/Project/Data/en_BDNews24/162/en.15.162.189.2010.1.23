 MELBOURNE, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Normal service resumed at the Australian Open on Saturday as Roger Federer and Serena Williams booked their places in the second week of the championship. Nadia Petrova had given hope to the would-be giantkillers still left in the tournament when she upset Kim Clijsters on Friday but everything went according to the script in Saturday's third round clashes.

Federer made a shaky start in his opening round match against Russian Igor Andreev but has gradually improved with each match. He plays either Lleyton Hewitt or Marcos Baghdatis next. "I don't want to say I'm playing the best tennis of my life, because I haven't had to so far," the world number one said. "I'm happy I survived a scare against Andreev.
