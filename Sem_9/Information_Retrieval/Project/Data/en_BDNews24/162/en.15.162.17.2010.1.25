 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun has told parliament that the law enforcers have been instructed to look for sub-standard, outdated CNG gas cylinders in cars. Replying to a notice on Monday, she said the government would form mobile teams to inspect whether the used CNG cylinders in vehicles were retested as prescribed by the authorities. "We have already instructed the law enforcers to examine whether faulty CNG cylinders are being used in the vehicles," said Sahara, in reply to a notice served by Awami League MP Tahura Ali. "They will also check if the cylinders are being retested after every five years." "If necessary, we will deploy mobile teams to check the cylinders". The minister drew the attention of the communications minister in regulating the import of sub-standard gas cylinders. Ali in her notice said a section of dishonest traders had been fitting vehicles with sub-standard, outdated gas cylinders. She said the dishonest businessmen were converting the vehicles with the outdated oxygen and LP gas cylinders. "This can cause serious accidents," Ali said. The minister stressed the need for awareness of the people about the malpractices.
