<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Sunday granted police three days to quiz Mohammed Murad Mridha who is accused of driving a schoolgirl to commit suicide. Metropolitan magistrate Syeda Minhazum Munira gave the order on a petition filed by Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police. Police in the petition asked for seven days to remand him in their custody after arresting Murad in Khalishpur of Khulna on Saturday. Nashfia Akhanda Pinky, a ninth-grade student of Shyamoli Ideal School and College, killed herself on Jan 19 in the living room of her uncle's 162/Ka/C house at Shyamoli road no. 2. A saree was tied around the neck. Investigating officer for the case, sub-inspector ASM Sayed said they need to interrogate Murad to see if he had taunted her, and whether he had slapped her on the road before she committed suicide. The court on Sunday also rejected a plea to ignore the remand petition. Lawyers for Murad said it was baffling why Pinky's uncle, not her parents, filed the case. bd
