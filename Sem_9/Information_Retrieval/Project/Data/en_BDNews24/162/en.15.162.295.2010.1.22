 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission has proposed a substantial raise in ceiling on polls expenditures for candidates in the city corporation elections.

Chief election commissioner A T M Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com on Thursday that they had formulated the draft Conduct of Election Rules, Code of Conducts and Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) Rules and sent those to the law ministry the same day. The commission proposed fixing election expenditure limit for mayoral candidates at Tk 50 lakh for cities having more than 20 lakh voters, TK 30 lakh for cities with 10-20 lakh voters, Tk 20 lakh for cities having 5-10 lakh voters, and Tk 10 lakh for cities with 5 lakh voters.

The Local Government (City Corporation) Ordinance promulgated by the past caretaker government allowed mayoral candidates of any of the six city corporations to spend up to Tk 15 lakh. Polls to Khulna, Barisal, Sylhet and Rajshahi city corporations were held in August, 2008 under the ordinance. DCC balloting has been pending since May, 2007 while the tenure of the incumbent CCC mayor and councillors expire on May 9.
