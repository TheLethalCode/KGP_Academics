 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)The government Monday tabled a bill in parliament that would empower the Islamic University in Kushtia to regulate higher madrasa education. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid initiated the Islamic University (Amendment) Bill 2010, which would insert new sections and change some wording of the Islamic University Act 1980. The bill was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on education ministry for further scrutiny before its passage. The law, if passed, will authorise the Islamic University authorities to form one or more curriculum committee to manage Fazil and Quamil degrees, which are equivalent to graduate and post-graduate level degrees respectively. The BNP-led government before leaving office in 2006 gave Fazil and Quamil degrees equivalent status to graduate and post-graduate degrees. The bill will also empower the Islamic University to form an academic committee headed by a pro-vice chancellor of the university to regulate the madrasas offering Fazil and Quamil degrees. The academic committee will also determine the number of curriculum committees and the subjects to be included in the curriculum committees. The parliamentary standing committee was given two weeks to examine the bill before referring back to the House.
