 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government is working to reduce Bangladesh's poverty rate to just 15 percent by 2021, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Sunday. "Bangladesh will be a poverty free country in the near future," Ashraf said, while inaugurating the 2nd CIRDAP ministerial meeting in the capital. An estimated 45-50 percent of Bangladesh's 150 million people live below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day, according to the most recent figures of the government, World Bank and Unicef. In comparison, and according to similar sources, around 12 percent of Americans live below the same poverty level. Delegates of 14 countries are participating in the five-day meeting of the Centre of Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP) in Dhaka. Ashraf said Bangladesh wants CIRDAP to play a stronger role for poverty alleviation and development of poorer nations. "We are struggling against poverty. We are working to ensure food security. "Delegates of rich and poor nations are participating in this conference. All of us must set the work plan for poverty alleviation and development of Asia and Pacific regions." The minister asked all to come forward to promote agriculture and rural development in particular. "We are working hard to develop agricultural sectors by, for example, subsidising modern tools," he said. State minister for local government, Jahangir Kabir Nanok, reinforced the rural focus: "Since South Asian countries are rural based economies, we have to work for the development of rural areas and populations. "Bangladesh is making a concerted effort to eradicate poverty by strengthening the rural economy," he said. Elena C Cabanes, chairman of the CIRDAP ministerial-level meeting preparatory committee, chaired the opening programme at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. b
