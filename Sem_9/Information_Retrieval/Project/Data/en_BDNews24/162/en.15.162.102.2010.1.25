 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Monday approved special quotas for wards of freedom fighters for government appointments. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after a cabinet meeting that it had been decided in 1997 that 30 percent jobs in governmental, nongovernmental and autonomous institutions would be reserved for freedom fighters. It was also decided that if no freedom fighters could be found to be suitable enough, the quota would be filled up with skilled dependents of freedom fighters. However, that was never followed appropriately. The press secretary said that the prime minister also ordered to include the disabled and women in this quota. Drafts of the Acid Control (amendment) Act-2009 and Private University Act-2009 were also given final approval, he said. Azad said issues like acid importing, stockpiling, selling and rehabilitating acid victims were considered while approving the Acid Control (amendment) Act. However, a draft of 'Bangladesh Public Private Partnership Policy and Guidelines Act-2009' was withdrawn from the meeting, said the press minister. The prime minister had directed ministers and secretaries to be more active to implement the governmental projects, Azad said. A quarterly report was also placed at the meeting to evaluate the developments of decisions between October and December. bd
