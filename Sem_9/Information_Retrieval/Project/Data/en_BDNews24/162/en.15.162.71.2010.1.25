 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)--A police officer foiled an attempted bus robbery when he chased it down and arrested five men early on Sunday in Dhaka. The gang included former bus driver and conductor of Jahan Paribahan that operates on Sayedabad-Gabtali route. Additional deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Ramna Zone, Syed Nurul Islam, said he heard the passengers crying out for help at Shabagh at around 2:30am and ordered and his driver and bodyguard to pursue it. They intercepted the bus that had six members of a family riding it near Asad Gate. The arrestees are driver 'Bawa Babu', 25, 'Selim', 20, 'Robin', 20, Jafar, 19, and conductor 'Aminul', 20. Deputy police commissioner of Ramna Zone Binoy Krishna Saha told bdnews24.com, "We had information that a gang of robbers have been committing robbery on the bus at night for a long time." "We are expecting to capture the others of the gang on the basis of information gleaned from the arrestees," he said Nurul Islam said he saw the bus speeding away without stopping at Shahbagh, not even slowing down before a speed-breaker. "I heard women shouting and saw passengers scuffling on the bus." "We arrested three on the spot and another two on the basis of their confession," he said. Police seized a knife, a belt and cash money from their possession. The victims, including children and women, were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. A case was filed with Shahbagh Police Station against five and the bus is now under police custody. bd
