 Dhaka, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Former army chief Moeen U Ahmed has denied any intentional wrongdoing, perceptibly referring to the two-year long state of emergency in Bangladesh from January 2007 to December 2008. Evidently refuting numerous allegations of irregularities and unlawful acts in relation to the imposition of emergency and tenure of an army-backed caretaker government, while he was army chief, Moeen said on Saturday: "I did not do anything wrong knowingly, no matter who says what." He was speaking at the 75th foundation anniversary programme of Tejgaon Government High School. While he was much in the public eye during the emergency period, he has been maintaining a low public profile since his departure as army chief. After a long stay abroad with his wife, Moeen returned home last November. He still resides at his cantonment house. Currently on Leave Preparatory to Retirement, the former army chief said he fills his days reading and translating. He also said he spent most of his time with family members. Many accuse the former military chief, appointed during the BNP-led government and whose term was extended by another year under the caretaker government, for his close involvement with the regime change of Jan 11, 2007. Moeen had superseded several senior army officers during BNP's tenure. He is currently facing a defamation case by BNP's former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, for alleging "massive corruption" at the power ministry during BNP's tenure. bdnews
