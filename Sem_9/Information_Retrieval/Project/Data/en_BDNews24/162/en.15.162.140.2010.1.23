 Tongi, Jan 23 (bdnews24.com)  Tens of thousands of devotees were braving the cold and fog on the second day of the annual Biswa Ijtema on the outskirts of Dhaka, with some sleeping out in the open overnight unable to find any space inside designated shelters. The second day of the Tablighi Jamaat Islamic congregation began with the Aam Bayan, or principal sermon, after the Fazr, or early morning, prayers on the banks of the Turag river at Tongi outside the capital. Maulana Mohammed Jamsher from India and Maulana Abdul Matin from Bangladesh led Saturday's early morning sermon. According to Ijtema tradition, a dowry-free wedding will be conducted after Asr prayers on Saturday. The mass wedding will be held beside the Bayan stage with the consent of the bride and bridegroom and their guardians, organisers said. Ijtema organiser, and Tabligh Jamaat leader, Abdul Kuddus told bdnews24.com that they were expecting more than 100 couples to be wed. The three-day annual Ijtema, the second largest Muslim congregation after the Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah, will conclude with the Akheri Munajat, or final prayers, on Sunday. President Md Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia are expected to attend.
