 Dhaka, Jan 24 (bdnews24.com)A United Airways aircraft on Sunday made an emergency landing within 10 minutes of taking off from Dhaka. The plane headed for Cox's Bazar had taken off from the Zia International Airport at 2:45pm but soon developed mechanical problems and was forced to return for an emergency landing, said the private carrier's spokesman. "The plane with 21 passengers on board faced mechanical problems soon after take-off, but landed within 10 minutes," United Airways public relations officer Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com. The passengers were said to be safe. Zahed Chowdhury, a passenger on board the 37-seater Canadian Dash-8-100, said, "We saw that one of the propellers shut down soon after take-off and there was strong stench in the cabin." "Passengers began to cry in fear. Then there was announcement that the aircraft had developed mechanical problems, so it would land shortly." "The plane landed safely and there were no casualties," said the passenger. United Airways began its operations in in July 2007 with two Dash-8-100 planes, and later added a 155-seater Macdonell Douglas-83. The private carrier connects five international and four domestic destinations. bdne
