 Khagrachhari, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  At least four people were seriously injured in a clash, spanning several hours, between the indigenous and Bengali settlers in Khagrachhari on Saturday. The clash occurred when a jeep hit a CNG-run autorickshaw. The injured are Shubodh Chakma, 32, Kalachan Marma, 37, Mongeon Marma, 32, and the jeep driver Abdul Wahab, supposedly in his thirties. All four are undergoing treatment at local hospitals. Wahab's condition is said to be critical. Police and witnesses said that after altercations over the slight accident, goons of one Rafique group beat up the Chakma autorickshaw driver at Pankhaiya Para in the afternoon. In retaliation, Chakma boys beat up Abdul Wahab at Chengis Para at about 8.00pm in the evening. This sparked severe violence between the locals and Bengali settlers which continued in waves through the evening. Shops were shut down as fear of widespread ethnic violence spread though the district town. At one point Bengalis beat up Mongeon Marma, a civil servant, when he reached the College Gate area by his motor bike. The Bengalis burnt his bike as well. Passers by became panicked when this led to a bout chase and counter chase between groups armed with sticks in that area. Upon receipt of information, officer in charge of the Sadr police station, Shahriar Khan and SI Shubir Datta came to the spot and recovered the motor bike. According to information the entire town was still tense at 11.30pm with visibly beefed up police deployment.
