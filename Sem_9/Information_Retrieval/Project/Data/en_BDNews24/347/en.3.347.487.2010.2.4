 HERZLIYA, Israel, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday he had reason to hope stalled peace talks with the Palestinians could resume within weeks. "I have a basis to hope, in a realistic way, that in the coming weeks we will renew the peace process with the Palestinians," Netanyahu said at a keynote national security conference in Herzilya, near Tel Aviv. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asked in Washington about the prospect of talks, said the United States hoped to relaunch talks as soon as possible.

Palestinians want the city to be capital of a future state. Netanyahu's upbeat comments followed weeks of renewed efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama's peace envoy, George Mitchell, to get the sides back to the negotiating table, which had thus far turned up no results. Clinton, noting months of intense diplomacy by Mitchell, said the United States believed that talks should be based on borders prior to the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the West Bank, while taking into account Israel's desire to retain major West Bank settlement blocs. "We've made clear that we think all of the main issues have to be on the table and the parties have to work through them and come to resolution. And we'd like to see that start soon and move as quickly as possible forward," she sa
