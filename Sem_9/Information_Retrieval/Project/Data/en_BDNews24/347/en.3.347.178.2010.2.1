 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina stressed the role of books in a nation's development as she inaugurated the Bangla Academy's annual Amar Ekushey Boi Mela on Monday. She urged everyone to buy and read books, highlighting their importance in human endeavours. "The link between culture and education is a necessity for development of humanity. And books play the most important role for establishing this link." The prime minister requested publishers to support the works of new, young writers as well as established authors. She also assured all assistance to develop Bangla Academy into "the pride of the nation". She said Bangla should be made an official UN language. "Currently six languages are used for official work in the United Nations. The government is now working to include Bangla in that list. I myself address the UN in Bangla," Hasina said. On the long-proposed International Mother Language Institute, she said: "We took steps to construct the institute when we last formed government in 1996. The then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid the foundation stone of the institute." Hasina condemned opposition BNP for halting the work, saying, "They do not understand the real value of their mother language." Work had resumed on the institute under the current government, the prime minister said. "We are hoping to finish it by this month." She said the world-class institute will carry out research on minority languages around the globe, and create a database on endangered languages. Hasina repeated the AL government's pledge during their last tenure to create a cultural belt encompassing Bangla Academy, Suhrawardi Udyan and Dhaka University. 'PRIDE OF THE NATION' She said, "This academy has to be made the pride of the nation. For that we want dedicated workers, researchers and officials. We will provide all sort of assistance for this. There will be no shortage of funds." Bangla Academy director general Shamsuzzaman Khan presented a vision to make the academy a "true research organisation for Bangla language and literature". He said, "Until now, the academy has only published educational books. We want to move on from this and start publishing research books. We are requesting the prime minister for financial assistance for this." Khan said the academy had also taken steps to publish an authentic Bangla grammar book. "At present, a mixture of English and Sanskrit grammar is followed. The irregularities of the language will be eradicated once a proper Bangla grammar is established." The inauguration was presided over by National Professor Kabir Chowdhury and attended by culture minister Abul Kalam Azad and culture state minister Promodkumar Mankin amongst others. After her inaugural address, Hasina opened the Language Movement Museum at the academy premises, and went on to visit stalls of the month-long fair. This year's book fair will see 366 organisations hosting a total of 505 stalls including 26 stalls for little magazines. Of them, around 100 stalls are set up on the street outside the Bangla Academy premises. The director general of the academy said that there will be space for small publishing houses and individuals at the stall of the Jatiya Gronthokendro. He also said the academy has formed a task force to keep the fairground, divided into nine sections named after language martyrs, writers and poets, free of illegal publications. b
