 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Angry Dhaka University students clashed with police on campus following the death on Wednesday of a fellow student who was seriously injured during violence between rival Chhatra League factions the previous day. Abu Bakar Siddique, a third year Islamic History student, died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital at around 9:30am, his uncle Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. Relatives took the body of Bakar at around 1-30 pm for burial at his home district in Tangail. As news of the death reached the campus in the morning, students of the Islamic History department went on a rampage smashing the proctor's office and three vehicles. The students then marched towards the vice-chancellor's residence and hurled brickbats at the police, who responded by firing teargas shells. The 'Progressive Students Alliance' also brought out a procession protesting Bakar's death and demanding punishment of the culprits. "This is very unfortunate. The responsible students will have to face punishment", vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said. Siddique said a probe committee would be formed later in the afternoon. He added: "We do not want such tragic incidents to recur". He later went to DMCH to see the victim and family. Bakar was a resident of Sir AF Rahman Residential Hall. At least 25 students were injured there in the early hours of Tuesday as the two Bangladesh Chhatra League factions fought over control of the hall. Police later arrested the president of the hall's BCL unit Sayeduzzaman Faruk and eight other activists. They were sent to the court on Wednesday, Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim said. Abu Bakar's family have said the dead student was not active in campus politics, although a faction of Chhatra League claimed he was a member of the pro-ruling party student front. Sayeduzzaman Faruk said Bakar was a BCL activist and his supporter, but the rival faction's Mehdi Hasan, general secretary of the hall unit, said Bakar was not a Chhatra Leaguer. Ramna zone deputy police commissioner Krishnapad Roy told bdnews24.com police had fired tear gas shells on Tuesday to bring the situation under control. "But we're not sure whether the tear gas shells hit that student," Roy said. Everything would come out after the police probe, he said. "But the situation turned violent again this morning (Wednesday) following his death. We tried to control the situation." Chhatra League activists also became involved, he said "to tackle the angry students." BCL's DU president Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com: "Death of a university student is terrible. We should be careful to prevent destabilisation of the campus." "It is natural that students will demonstrate but we should be alert so that the situation does not turn violent," he said. bd
