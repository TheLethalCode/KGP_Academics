 TOKYO, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will announce on Monday details of its plan to fix accelerator pedals that have led to the recall of 2.4 million cars in the United States as it scrambles to put its worst public relations crisis behind it. Toyota Motor Sales USA., its local sales company, said it would issue a news release at 6:30 a.m. EST (1130 GMT), followed by a conference call for media at 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT).

The remedy being readied by Toyota and its supplier CTS Corp involves a shim, also called a spacer, that will be placed in the accelerator to keep it from sticking, sources said. Toyota also kicked off a media blitz on Sunday with full-page ads in major newspapers alerting consumers to the recall and production shutdown. Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA., is also due to appear on a US morning TV show, the Today Show. A company source has said top executives from Toyota headquarters were preparing to address media in Japan soon after the solution is announced in the United States to quell criticism over the lack so far of an official public apolo
