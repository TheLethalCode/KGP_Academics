 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) - Home minister Sahara Khatun has termed the most recent spate of violence on Dhaka University campus by Bangladesh Chhatra League, which led to the death of a student, an "isolated incident" "These things can happen," she said Thursday, referring to the clashes between two feuding factions of the pro-ruling party Chhatra League that left one dead and dozens injured earlier in the week. Following a meeting with the law minister and foreign minister, the home minister was questioned by reporters on the campus law and order situation in the wake of the student death at DU and the reported role of BCL on countrywide campuses in admission of students. Sahara replied: "These are no matter. What is important is what the government is doing, what steps we are taking." Asked what those steps were, she said, "The measures generally taken against criminals are being taken. Whatever it betender terror, extortion or the admissions tradetough steps are being taken." The clashes between two groups of BCL activists over control of a DU Hall early Tuesday caused public concern when a general student died of injuries the following day. Besides, national dailies have been carrying numerous reports of admissions fixing by Chhatra League at different colleges and universities. On the meeting between the three ministries, law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters the talks focused on how the fugitives consvcited of killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahmancould be brought back home. He said the meeting decided after identification of the fugitive killers, steps will be taken for their return through diplomatic channels and Interpol. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said, "We (the Awami League government) set up a coordination cell in 1996 to bring the killers back. We have done so also this time. We want to work in a coordinated way." b
