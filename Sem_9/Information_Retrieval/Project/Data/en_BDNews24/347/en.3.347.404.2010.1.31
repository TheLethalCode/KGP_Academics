 Mohsinul Karim, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)--The government has found evidence of corruption and misappropriation in the purchase of five giraffes, hiding their age, at nearly Tk 5 crore for Dhaka Zoo. The giraffes were bought in September 2008 but three of them died after fourteen months, prompting the government to launch investigation into the age of the animals. Probe committee chief and fisheries and livestock ministry joint secretary Shamsul Kibria told bdnews24.com on Saturday there were flaws in determining the age of the giraffes. The ministry is going to take steps against all those involved with giraffes' inspection, selection and purchase. It can be divisional action and the misappropriated money can be taken back, he said. Also, it can implicate the then deputy director of livestock department Dr Habibur Rahman. The enquiry committee report says that the giraffes were not purchased following the circular of the zoo. According to the circular the age was supposed to be from 18 to 24 months, but the purchased giraffes were aged from five and a half to six years. The report says that Dr Rahman stayed at South Africa from June 14 to 17 of 2008 as the chief of the inspection and selection committee. The giraffes were bought following papers submitted by him. But the giraffes were 'full-mouthed' at the time of purchase: usually, full-mouthed animal age from five and a half to six years. "Though the chief of inspection and selection committee travelled to South Africa spending government funds he did not submit any document," said Kibria to bdnews24.com. "He only submitted a certificate from South Africa's business association regarding the age of the giraffes. "After checking the age of the dead giraffes no semblance with that certificate was found. That committee has made mistake in determining the age of the giraffes," he added. The report also says that there were four committees on the purchase of giraffes and then the deputy curator, Dr AKM Nazrul Islam, who was later suspended, sat on all committees. The government had to incur a loss of Tk 4.97 crore for the failure of animal inspection and selection committee and animal purchase and receiving committees, according to the report. The government incurred a loss of Tk 99.48 lakh against each giraffe and the reputation of the zoo was tainted. However, Dr Rahman has denied the allegation of his involvement with the anomalies. "There is no question of my involvement in this corruption because I was not in any key post at that time. I was the deputy director," he said. "I was sent to South Africa as the chief of pre-inspection committee. I had given my opinion based on the papers of those related with animal selection. There were secretary, joint secretary, director and zoo's curator and director over me. "If there is any anomaly then the responsibility is theirs," he said. Sources at his office said that he is yet to get the report. b
