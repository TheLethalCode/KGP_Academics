<TITLE> Selim to BNP: Prove Zia's body lies in grave </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim has challenged BNP to prove that slain president Ziaur Rahman's body is buried at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, just as the main opposition party has hinted it might return to parliament if the atmosphere is conducive. Selim, during a statement on the president's recent parliamentary speech, repeated a comment of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and said General Zia's corpse was "thrown into the Bay of Bengal". Selim, Hasina's cousin and a senior ruling party figure, said nobody including family members had seen the dead body of Zia, who was killed in a failed military coup in Chittagong on May 31 1981, when he was buried. Hasina commented recently that Zia's body was not at the Sher-e-Bangla gravesite to the north of the parliament complex where BNP and its associated organisations pay respects or lay wreaths on different occasions. "The prime minister rightly said that Zia's dead body was not inside that grave," Selim said on Tuesday. "We know his body was thrown into the Bay of Bengal. An empty coffin was placed inside the grave," said the AL leader. His comments come as BNP has given indications that they will return to parliament, ending a boycott since June 4 last year. Selim said it was the responsibility of BNP to prove the presence of Zia's dead body in the graveyard. Selim, who was an MP at the time, said he demanded in parliament in 1981 that the then government should release a photo of Zia's dead body. "But they could not. It proves that people's confusion was correct," he said. "So, my proposal is: let there be a DNA test. If Zia's dead body is not there, the coffin should be removed from the graveyard," said Selim. Hasina's cousin also requested the governments of the countries, where the killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman have been living, to send them back. "We should unmask those who did not come to rescue Bangabandhu (on Aug 15, 1975)  I also propose formation of a probe commission to expose those who rewarded the killers," Selim said.
