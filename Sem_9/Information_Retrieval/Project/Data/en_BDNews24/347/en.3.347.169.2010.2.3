 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University students went on the rampage following the death of a fellow student on Wednesday, who sustained injuries during Bangladesh Chhatra League factional clashes the previous day. Abu Bakar Siddique, a third year Islamic History student, died in Dhaka Medical College Hospital at around 9:30am, his uncle Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. As news of the death reached the DU campus, students of the Islamic History department brought out a procession protesting the death at around 11am. The angry students locked in clashes with police, and smashed the proctor's office and three vehicles. Additional security measures have been enforced on the campus. Authorities said additional riot police were deployed on the campus after the news of death. General students also brought out a procession. As they marched towards the vice-chancellor's residence they hurled brickbats at the police. Police retaliated by firing teargas shells. DU vice-chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique said: "This is very unfortunate. The responsible students will have to face punishment." He said the authorities would form a probe committee at a syndicate meeting to be held later in the afternoon. A case will be filed on behalf of the DU authorities, he added. At least 25 people were injured as the two Chhatra League factions fought over control of Sir AF Rahman Residential Hall at Dhaka University in the early hours of Tuesday. Police later arrested the president of the hall's BCL unit Sayeduzzaman Faruk and eight other activists of the Chhatra League. Abu Bakar's family said that he was not active in student politics, although a faction of Chhatra League claimed he was a member of the pro-ruling party student front. Faruk said Bakar was a BCL activist and his supporter, but the rival faction's Mehdi Hasan, general secretary of the hall unit, said Bakar was not a Chhatra Leaguer. Bakar's uncle said his nephew was only involved with his studies. bd
