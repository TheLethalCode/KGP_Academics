<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  A judicial enquiry commission has requested information and evidence from the public on reported incidents of violence, including murder, rape and looting, that followed the eight parliamentary elections in 2001. The request was made through a press release undersigned by the commission chief Mohammed Mohiuddin on Tuesday. "Detail of accusations, statements and evidences, photographs, CDs, etc of violation of human rights including violence, eviction from homestead and grabbing of property should be submitted by the affected individual, sect or political organisation within 20 days of this release." Evidence and information can be submitted from 10am to 2pm every weekday to the commission's office at Circuit House Road. They can also be mailed to the commission. The release also asked for voluntary assistance from individuals, professionals and human rights organisations. The High Court, on basis of a petition by a human rights organisation on May 6 last year, asked the government to form a probe commission to investigate the violence, including reported torture of opposition party and minority members, following the 2001 elections in which the BNP-Jamaat coalition came to power. The current Awami League government formed a three-member judicial investigation commission last December in line with the High Court order. b
