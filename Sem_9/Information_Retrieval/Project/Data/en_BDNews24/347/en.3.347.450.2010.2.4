<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, ahead of the scheduled secondary school certificate exams, has announced that any examination centre alleged to harbour an 'environment' for cheating or plagiarism will be closed down. Any teacher or official trying to help students cheat will also be discharged and their MPOs will be withdrawn, Nahid told a press briefing on Thursday. The decision to take these strict measures was made at a meeting with the education board chairmen to ensure healthy environment during the upcoming SSC exams scheduled to start from Feb 11 across the country. Around 1.2 million students are expected to sit the exams. Commenting on the fact that the number of examinees has increased by almost 10 per cent this year, Nahid said it proved that the number of drop-outs had decreased. He also hoped that the number of examinees would rise further in future. Regarding a plagiarism-free environment, Nahid said cheating in the exams is a grave problem. He vowed to take all necessary actions to root out plagiarism. Nahid cautioned that there would be instant punitive actions against officials showing the least tolerance for cheating. He said that his main goal is to guarantee a peaceful, secure and congenial environment for the exams. The total number of examinees this year is 1,206,019. Of them, 627,672 are male and 578,347 female. Dakhil examinations, of the Madrasa Board, will be taken by 211,860 students, of which 112,119 are male and 99,741 female. Technical Board exams expect 77,979 students, with 55,369 male and 22,610 female. bdnews
