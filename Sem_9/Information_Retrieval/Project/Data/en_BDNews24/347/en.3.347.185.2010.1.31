 Africa, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- A prisoner jailed for allegedly practising withcraft in the Central African Republic says his case highlights some of the failures in the judicial system. Every year, hundreds of people in the Central African Republic are convicted for allegedly practicing witchcraft. We meet a convict who's serving a 4 year sentence and says that his case highlights some of the failures of the country's judicial system. Ange Mberkoulat is desperate for divine intervention, so he regularly comes for early morning mass at the catholic mission in Bozoum, about 300 kms from Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic. Ange was convicted of witchcraft, after his village chief accused him of trying to kill his relative. He is officially a convict but is serving a four year sentence away from jail because of a lack of resources in prisons Ange says he was accused falsely. To make things worse arsonists in support of the chief burned down his house and beat up his wife. He and his family of 3 have since moved in with his sister-in-law. One person was convicted for the vandalism and sentenced to two months imprisonment. Nguete Roger is the chief at Ndombandi village and is responsible for dealing with issues like theft. In Ange's case, the victim being Nguete's sister-in-law led to an even heavier penalty. Human rights activists say that judicial corruption and abuse of prisoners are still a problem. Witchcraft is a criminal offence here and is even punishable by execution in cases of homicide. The manner in which investigations are carried out is also often questionable.

Once the accused is found, he has to unearth the fetishes. Sometimes they will be found in the field or under the bed of the person and so on. In general, those are the indications." We were not allowed to film inside the Bozoum prison but were able to obtain photos that show the poor conditions in prisons here. The state is unable to provide food and proper accommodation for inmates, so they have had to let some prisoners go back home and serve their sentences by doing community service. The UN is also trying to improve the situation here by running a programme known as PRED or Project aimed at Strengthening the Rule of Law. They train residents on their human rights and raise awareness on legal assistance. A few weeks after Ange recounted his experience to Africa Journal, he was imprisoned again. The Central African Republic is scheduled to hold its general elections later this year and many convicts hope that the leaders elected can help reform the country's legal system into one that metes out justice fairly to every
