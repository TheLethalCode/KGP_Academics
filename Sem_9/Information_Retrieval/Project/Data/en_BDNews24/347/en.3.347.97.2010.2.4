 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh opposition led by BNP has decided to return to parliament next week after more than 60 days of boycott. BNP chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque disclosed the decision of the party's parliamentary committee meeting to a press briefing at the parliament's media centre on Thursday evening. "Opposition parties including BNP have decided to join the parliament for the interest of the country and its people", he said. "There we will discuss various issues, especially torture and suppression of the opposition by the government, security of opposition leaders, Tipaimukh project, treaties made against interests of state, criminal activities in educational institutions, admission business, deaths in police custody, etc." The opposition whip also said, "We would also demand removal of the speeches given about the body of late president Ziaur Rahman by prime minister Sheikh Hasina and MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. They made derogatory comments about our late leader." The chief whip, however, refused to mention a specific date of the return and said, "You will know. We will inform the countrymen and return to parliament. We have decided to go to parliament to raise these issues. We will demand discussion." He also informed journalists that the meeting strongly condemned the abduction of a BDR member, Mujibur Rahman, by the BSF. The parliamentary party meeting, presided by opposition leader Khaleda Zia, started at 4:10pm at the parliament's opposition party meeting room. The meeting lasted more tahn an hour and was attended by 31 BNP MPs. Jaamat-e-Islami MPs Shamsul Islam and Hamidur Rahman Azad, and BJP's Andaleeb Rahman Partha represented the other parties in the coalition. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) walked out of parliament on April 7 and has since boycotted the sessions for what they termed "lack of a conducive atmosphere" in the House. The opposition remained absent for 62 consecutive working days. According to the constitution, seats of MPs who abstain from parliament for 90 consecutive working days will be declared void. bdne
