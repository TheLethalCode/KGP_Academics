 BEIJING/WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan welcomes US arms deal as China reacts angrily suspending Sino-US military exchanges and threatening sanctions. A guard stands on duty outside the US embassy in Beijing on a day that saw relations chill between the US and China. China reacted angrily to a US arms deal with Taiwan threatening sanctions on American firms and suspending all military exchanges between the two sides. On state television, Beijing warned the deal would jeopardize unification. (SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) CCTV NEWS PRESENTER READING FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT "U.S. logic that the arms sale will strengthen Taiwan's stance on negotiating with China is completely feeble. The US weapons sales will only send out a wrong message to Taiwan, fan flames of Taiwan independence, put obstacles and troubles in the path to peaceful cross-strait development." Despite Chinese opposition, Washington confirmed the deal. (SOUNDBITE) (English) US STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN P.J. CROWLEY SAYING: "The notification includes UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters, Patriot Advanced Capability missiles, technical support for Taiwan's Command-and-Control Communications, computers, intelligence surveillance and Reconnaissance System, the C4ISR, two Osprey-class mine hunting ships, and Harpoon telemetry missiles." Meanwhile Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou thanked the US while urging China not to be concerned about the weapons. Taiwan has been ruled separately since 1949, but since then, China has demanded the nation accept unification. US officials say Taiwan needs updated weapons to give it more sway when negotiating with Beijing. Charlotte Turner, Reut
