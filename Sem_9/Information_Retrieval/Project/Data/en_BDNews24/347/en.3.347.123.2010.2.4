 DUBAI, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yemeni forces killed 16 Shi'ite rebels, including a number of their leaders, state media reported on Wednesday following Sanaa's rejection of a cease-fire offer from the northern-based insurgents. The rebels died in clashes in their stronghold of Saada. Yemeni troops also re-opened a blocked highway in the northern provinces and seized farms there that rebels were using as hideouts, the Defence Ministry's September 26 online newspaper said. Earlier this week Yemen rejected a truce offer from the rebels because they did not promise to end hostilities against neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter. Riyadh, which last week declared a full victory over the insurgents, was drawn into the conflict in November after rebels seized some Saudi territory.

The online newspaper did not say when the clashes in Saada had taken place but reported that another rebel leader was wounded in the province of Dahyan on Saturday. The rebels, who say they have fully withdrawn from Saudi territory, reported fresh attack by the kingdom's armed forces. Saudi fighter planes carried out 36 strikes on northern districts since late on Tuesday and fired more than 460 rockets and rounds of heavy artillery, the rebels said on their website.

Western powers and Yemen's neighbours fear the country's instability could allow al Qaeda to strengthen its operations there and use it as a base for more international attacks. The global militant group's regional wing is based in Yemen and drew world attention when it claimed a failed bomb attack on a Detroit-bound plane in December. Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemen-based US Muslim preacher linked to a gunman who ran amok at a Texas army base, has said he supported the failed attack on the plane but that he did not encourage it, according to Al Jazeera television's website. Awlaki denounced Yemeni leaders for air strikes on al Qaeda militants in Yemen, which the group said were carried out by US planes. "The Yemeni government sells its citizens to America ... (against) funds from the West. Yemeni officials say to the Americans: 'Attack whatever you like, but do not claim this so as to not instigate the people against us...'," he sa
