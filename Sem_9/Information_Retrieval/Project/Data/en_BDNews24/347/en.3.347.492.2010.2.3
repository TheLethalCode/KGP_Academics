 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harmony on and off the pitch is vital if West Indies cricket is to have a chance of reviving past glories, new head coach Ottis Gibson said Wednesday.

West Indies played well in patches during the 2-0 Test defeat by Australia before Christmas and Gibson said he also saw enough on England's recent tour of the Caribbean last year to feel optimistic about the future.
