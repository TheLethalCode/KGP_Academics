<TITLE> Govt mulls MoU to extradite fugitives </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said the government will have memoranda of understanding where there were no extradition treaties in force to extradite the absconding convicts found guilty of murdering founding president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He said on Sunday the Awami League-ruled government would do everything possible to bring back convicts for the Aug 15, 1975. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had vowed to hunt down the Aug 15 fugitives and punish them at the ruling Awami League's extended meeting just the day before. Evidently responding to reports that Canada would not be willing to extradite Noor Chowdhury if he is hanged, the minister told reporters that the government would undertake special measures if extradition treaties do not apply in case of certain countries where Bangabandhu murder case convicts are said to be hiding. Noor Chowdhury, one of the six found guilty of independence hero Sheikh Mujib assassination, is apparently on the run and has been living in Canada for years. But his application for asylum in Canada would probably become much more credible after five captured convicts of the murder case were executed in the early hours of Jan 28. There are five other convicts, on the run, in different countries with whom Bangladesh may not have extradition treaties. Shafique did not agree with the widely published reports that Canada would refuse to extradite Chowdhury. "We are continuing discussions through diplomatic channels with all the countries." He said that the ministries of home, foreign affairs and law were looking into the matter. bdn
