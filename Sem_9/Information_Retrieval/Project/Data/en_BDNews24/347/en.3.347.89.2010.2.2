 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)A Project Evaluation Committee gave approval to resume work on an industrial park at Sirajganj, the industries secretary said Tuesday. The PEC of the planning commission approved a revised proposal for what would be the country's largest industrial park, at a meeting earlier in the week, Dewan Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com. "The proposal will now be placed to the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) meeting for the final nod" he said. Industries minister Dilip Barua will visit the project site on Wednesday with respective officials, ministry sources said. The project would accommodate some 570 industries over 801 plots. Around 100,000 people could be employed through the industries to be set up in the park. Necessary infrastructure, along with the roads, utilities and security will be provided under the project. Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) is tasked with implementing the industrial on the 400 acre land which is yet to be wholly acquired. The foundation stone of the stalled project, approved by ECNEC, was placed in 1999. But the preliminary development works came to a standstill in 2004 after Tk 1.62 crore was spent during the period for feasibility study, manpower recruitment and purchase of vehicles. The process of land acquisition was not completed, the secretary said. BSCIC placed the revised project to the PEC on Nov 9 last year. Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Planning Commission gave its nod to the project on Nov 25 last year after evaluation. IMED cut down the proposed cost from Tk 467 crore to Tk 384 crore. Sunday's meeting was also attended by the industries secretary and planning division secretary Habib Ullah Majumder. There is an existing industrial estate in Sirajganj, founded in 1998, on 10 acres of land where 16 industrial units are currently functioning.
