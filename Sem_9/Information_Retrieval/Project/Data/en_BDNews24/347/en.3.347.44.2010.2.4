 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Biman Bangladesh Airlines emerged with a major makeover Wednesday as a new logo, livery and two New Generation Boeing aircraft, a 777-200ER and 737-800NG, were added to its fleet. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the new look at the VVIP Terminal at Zia International Airport in the morning. After her speech wishing Biman all the best in it's future endeavors, an automated curtain unveiled the new logo and livery along with a computer graphic showing the new fleet flying high. A video clip also showed the arrivals of the two new aircraft touching down for the first time in Bangladesh. Hasina also cut the logo embedded cake and went on board one of the aircraft painted in Bimans' new logo and livery. The event also showcased seven new uniform saree designs for Biman's in-flight crew and on the ground staff. New generation Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 737-800NG in the fleet of Biman Bangladesh Biman Airlines Ltd will fly soon, Muhammad Zakiul Islam, Managing Director & CEO of Biman, told bdnews24.com. Earlier in the week, he had told bdnews24.com that the airline was hoping to resume flights to Delhi, Bangkok and Mumbai by the start of March. "Besides, we have plans to initiate flights to Tripoli, Colombo and Guangzhou," he said on Wednesday "The Dhaka-New York flights will also hopefully resume within March,' said Islam. Biman had suspended these flights in July 2006. Islam also said the long-haul routes like Dhaka-London would be operated by two Boeing 777-200 ERs, of which another is expected by March. The regional routes will be operated by the Boeing 737-800s. An Airbus A310 was also expected to be added to Biman's fleet by March, he said. Islam said all four aircraft were being leased on a temporary basis till Biman procures new planes. Currently Biman connects to 16 international and 3 domestic destinations with its fleet of four DC-10s, two Airbus-320s, two F-28s and two rented Boeing 747s. In 2008, Biman signed a deal with Boeing for four 777s, four 787s and two 737s at a cost of $2.5 billion. UK-BANGLADESH FLIGHTS SET TO SOAR Meanwhile, travellers flying between the UK and Bangladesh are set to enjoy more frequent flights and a greater choice of destinations following an agreement signed between the two countries recently. According to the agreement, the number of flights between the two countries will more than treble from 10 to 31 a week on each side. The new arrangements also allow airlines from either country to operate services between anywhere in Bangladesh and the United Kingdom, replacing the existing regime which only allowed flights between Heathrow, Manchester and Dhaka. The move paves the way for direct flights to the UK from Sylhet, the north-eastern Bangladesh district where the majority of the UK's large Bangladeshi community originate. The new arrangements also mean Biman Bangladesh Airline will be free to start its new service from Dhaka to New York via Manchester, which is expected to be launched next month. b
