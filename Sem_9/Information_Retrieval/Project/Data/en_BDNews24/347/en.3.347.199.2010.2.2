 Habiganj, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)- Former BNP state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar has been shown arrested in the Kibria murder case. Public prosecutor Akbar Hossain Jitu told journalists in Habiganj on Tuesday that Babar "confessed" in connection with the killing of former finance minister SAMS Kibria, while being interrogated in the August 21 grenade attack case. CID police super Rafiqul Islam, who is the investigation officer in the case, made a plea to Habiganj senior judicial magistrate Shamsul Islam on Tuesday to include his name as accused in the Kibria case. Islam also asked for a ten-day remand for further questioning of Babar. The judge asked Babar, currently serving 17 years behind bars in an arms case, to appear before the court on February 11. Babar has already been shown arrested in connection with the August 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally during his term as state minister for home. The Criminal Investigation Department quizzed Babar and two other suspects last month for allegedly suppressing the case in connection with the deaths of former Awami League finance minister Kibria and four others in a grenade attack in Habiganj on January 27 2005. More than 70 people were injured too. Abdul Majid Khan, general secretary of the AL district unit filed two cases in connection with the incident. The case had been languishing for three years when it was taken up for further investigation as per directives of the High Court to find out the mastermind behind the grenade attack. Six accused are now detained in jail, including HuJI leader Mufti Hannan. Meanwhile, the Sylhet Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal last month fixed February 7 for CID to submit its report on further investigation in the Kibria murder case, after three deadlines have been extended so far. bdnews2
