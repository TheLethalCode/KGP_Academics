<TITLE> Adviser blamed for law ministry woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)  A parliamentary standing committee has found that the law ministry could not appoint a secretary due to intervention of a prime ministerial adviser. Members of the committee in a meeting on Sunday night also observed that the ministry could not take any policy decisions from Dec 17-Jan 31 as there was no secretary. Neither the chairman nor the standing committee members disclosed the issues discussed in Sunday's meeting to the press. Standing committee chairman Suranjit Sengupta told bdnews24.com on Monday, however, that the adviser's intervention in the ministry had "surprised" him. "The law ministry was run without a secretary, who is also the principal accounting officer, for one month and 14 days. No one acted as secretary in-charge, meaning that the ministry could do nothing since Dec 17," Sengupta told bdnews24.com at his office. He said the law ministry officials had informed him that it took measures to appoint an interim secretary, but could not do so due to the establishment ministry's inaction. "When I pressed the establishment ministry's additional secretary, he confided that an adviser had ordered them not to appoint a law secretary," said the committee chairman. "The whole committee was surprised at this discovery." The standing committee summoned the establishment secretary, as the ministry is in charge of all appointments, to ascertain causes behind the delay in appointing a law secretary. An additional secretary turned up in the absence of the secretary. Sengupta said that his committee recommended that the government appoint a law secretary on the basis of seniority and service rules in line with the court's judgment. Ministry officials attending the meeting said the Supreme Court had given the directive for appointment of a law secretary on Sunday. This is second time the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry came up with the allegation of a prime ministerial adviser's meddling since August 2009. In August, the standing committee unanimously observed that adviser HT Imam had persuaded Sheikh Hasina to send two judges into forced retirement because of their protest over separation of the judiciary from the executive. The watchdog body also summoned HT Imam, enjoying the rank of a cabinet minister, for his alleged role beyond his jurisdiction. The government later withdrew the suspension order faced with the threat of a strike by judges. H T Imam, however, did not have to face questioning in front of the standing committee as the then law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal unconditionally shouldered the entire responsibility of wrongly suspending the two judges. The post of law secretary, however, became vacant since Dec 17 as the court in its verdict termed the appointment of Kazi Habibul Awal as 'illegal'. Awal appealed against the verdict. Although Suranjit Sengupta disclosed the name of the adviser, bdnews24.com has not yet been able to secure the adviser's reaction or comments and therefore refrains from disclosing the identity. b
