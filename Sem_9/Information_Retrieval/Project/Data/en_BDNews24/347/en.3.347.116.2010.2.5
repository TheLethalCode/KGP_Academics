 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Two private companies have signed deals with the government to set up three rental power plants to add up to 265MW to the power-starved national grid. Power Development Board chairman ASM Alamgir Kabir said after the signing on Thursday at the board's office, "This is the first deal to establish rental power plants after the current government came to power. We have decided to establish a number of such power stations." PDB signed up Quantum Power Systems, an associate venture of Otobi Limited, for a diesel powered 110 MW station in Kushtia's Bheramara and a furnace fuel powered 105MW station at Jessore's Nowapara. RZ Power, a venture of Rahimafrooz, will establish another diesel powered 50 MW station in Thakurgaon. Two of the three stations will start production of 160MW within four months and the remaining 105MW plant will come online within nine months, according to the contracts. The PDB chairman said that other than these, another two deals for 300MW would be signed next week. The current government is looking at another 530 MW rental power from eight organisations but is yet to sign deals. Kabir said these deals too will be completed soon. Currently there are 11 rental power plants around the country with a production capacity of 419.5 MW. Bangladesh's current power production stands at around 4000 MW against an estimated daily demand for 5500 MW. b
