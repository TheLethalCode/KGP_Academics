 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)Only a quarter of the country's 70,000 inmates have been convicted. According to Brig Gen Ashraful Islam, the inspector general of prisons, only 23 percent of the inmates have been convicted and the rest were on trial. It became apparent from the figures he cited after emerging from a meeting of a German-funded Tk 260 million GTZ project to alleviate overcrowding in the prisons. It was also clear from Islam's comments, as well as those coming from a home ministry official, that there were a large number of inmates in the 68 jails who are there due to lack of legal support, back log in courts and neglect of the authorities. The prison chief, also the deputy head of the project, told reporters that the government had freed 14,000 inmates last year after the home minister undertook the pilot project. Of them 3,000 had been released with legal aid provided through the German project. Islam told bdnews24.com that the country's 68 jails were overcrowded with over 70,000 inmates. "Seventy-seven percent of them are on trial." Planning wing deputy chief of home ministry Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that although the project officially started in mid-2008, release of prisoners began in January 2009. The home minister launched this three-year project in July 2008 to ease the burden of inmates by releasing poor prisoners, detained on minor charges for years without trial, he said. "These prinsoners are just too poor to pursue their cases." Although down from the previous year's 86,000 inmates, when the Awami League government took over, prisons are still overcrowded 2.5 times over their normal capacity of 27,000. The Dhaka Central Jail alone has 10,000 prisoners, which is over three times its normal capacity of 3,000. The first phase of the pilot project assigned two persons who collect lists of poor inmates held without trial. Anwar Hossain said that the number of such prisons would be increased from three to about 5-10 given the huge success of the pilot project. Home ministry officials said although the government had no plans to establish new prisons, it does plan to improve infrastructure and facilities for the prisoners. Home minister Sahara Khatun presided over the Sunday meeting and expressed her satisfaction at the project's progress. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, additional secretary and project director Golam Hossain, officials of home ministry's planning wing and GTZ attended the meeting. b
