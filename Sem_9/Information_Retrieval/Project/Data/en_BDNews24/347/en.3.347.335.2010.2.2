 BEIJING, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said on Tuesday that a possible meeting between US President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama would hurt trust between the two countries, already at odds over Washington's arms sales to Taiwan. Zhu Weiqun, a Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department of China's ruling Communist Party, told a news conference that his government would vehemently oppose any meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader who Beijing deems a dangerous separatist.

China has becoming increasingly assertive in opposing meetings between the Dalai Lama and foreign leaders, especially after violent unrest spread across Tibetan areas in March 2008. Previous U.S. Presidents have met him. The Dalai Lama has said he wants a high level of genuine autonomy for his homeland, which he fled in 1959. China says that his demands amount to pressing for outright independence. China recently hosted talks with envoys of the Dalai Lama, but those talks achieved litt
