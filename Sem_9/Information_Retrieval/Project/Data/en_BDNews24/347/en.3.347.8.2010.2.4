<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam has said that negotiations with India's Border Security Force are underway following the kidnap of a Bangladesh border guard on Thursday. Maj Gen Moinul also said there had been a "misunderstanding" between the two border forces, adding, "negotiations are going on for the return of our man". He also dismissed the report that a BDR member was injured during shooting by the BSF that morning. Lt Col Khandker Zahirul Alam, commanding officer of 21 Rifles Battalion, earlier told bdnews24.com that a 15-20-member team of India's BSF entered about 50 metres inside the Bangladesh territory near the border at Jaintapur at around 10am. He said they fired two shots injuring BDR nayek Mujibur Rahman, adding: "The BSF members kidnapped him across the border as our BDR men tried to intervene." When asked, the BDR chief said it would not be possible to comment on any allegations of mistreatment until the border guard returned. bdnews
