 Cox's Bazar, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)Nineteen fishermen floated back to Bangladesh on their trawler after being in the sea for two months without supplies and engine following a pirate attack on their vessel. They went to sea on board 'FB Mayer Momota' on a fishing expedition from Chittagong's Fishery Dock on Dec 9, 2009. Mohammad Faruk, one of the crew, said, "We were attacked by pirates on Mohipur coast in the southwestern regions of Bangladesh on Dec 14. They looted everything we had and even took away the engine of the trawler." According to him, they floated to Yangon coast of Myanmar after the loss of their engine where Myanmar's border forces took them into custody. They were imprisoned for eight days after which they were set afloat in the trawler. Maulana Firoz Ahmed, chairman of Saint Martin's Upazlia, said that the fishermen floated into the island after two months on Sunday afternoon. They have been given primary medical treatment.
