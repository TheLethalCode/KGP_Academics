The bench of Justice AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Justice Md Borhanuddin gave the order on Wednesday. The order means Dhaka city development authority Rajuk faces no bar in seeing the unapproved levels pulled down, AFM Mesbah Uddin, lawyer for Rajuk told reporters after the ruling. The Rajdhani Unnayan Kortripakkho on Jan 17 gave the Jamuna Future Park authorities seven days to knock down the illegal parts of the under construction development of Jamuna Group.

The much-vaunted Future Park is being constructed on 10 acres of land in the capital's Bashundhara area. Jamuna claims it will be the largest shopping mall in South Asia once complete. b
