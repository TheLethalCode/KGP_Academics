 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Travellers flying between the UK and Bangladesh are set to enjoy more frequent flights and a greater choice of destinations following an agreement signed between the two countries recently. According to the agreement, the number of flights between the two countries will more than treble from 10 to 31 a week on each side. The new arrangements also allow airlines from either country to operate services between anywhere in Bangladesh and the United Kingdom, replacing the existing regime which only allowed flights between Heathrow, Manchester and Dhaka. The move paves the way for direct flights to the UK from Sylhet, the north-eastern Bangladesh district from where majority of the UK's large Bangladeshi community originate. The new arrangements also mean Biman Bangladeshi Airline will now be free to start a new service from Dhaka to New York via Manchester, which is expected to be launched later this month. Paul Clark, Minister for Department of Transport, welcomed the agreement. "This is especially good news for the Bangladeshi community. With so many UK Bangladeshis having links to Sylhet, the possibility of direct flights will be especially welcome, and I would like to thank all who have worked in both countries to make this possible", he said. His predecessor, MP Jim Fitzpatrick, was particularly happy: "This is great news for people wishing to fly to Sylhet", he said enthusiastically. His East London constituency includes Britain's biggest Bengali community. At present there are no UK airlines flying to Bangladesh. British Airways used to operate three flights a week to Dhaka but those were cancelled in March 2009. On the Bangladesh side, Biman currently operates five flights a week between Dhaka and Heathrow, via Dubai and United Airways (BD) Limited started operating two services per week between Dhaka and Gatwick in November
