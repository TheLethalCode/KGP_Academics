 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)--Whip Sagufta Yasmin Thursday told parliament that the main opposition BNP was acting in Pakistan's favour and waging a "proxy war" against India. While delivering her speech in parliament on president's parliamentary address, Yasmin said the BNP's anti-Indian stannce was not for the country's sake. She also termed prime minister Hasina's India visit very successful. "The prime minister's India visit was fruitful and opened up a new era for Bangladesh," she said. "The BNP is waging a proxy war against India on behalf of Pakistan," said the whip. She praised the government decision of allowing India to use Chittagong and Mongla ports. "Iran allows the European and the neighbouring countries to use its ports. "The major share of Singpapore's economy comes from use of port," she said. "Allah has blessed us with two beautiful ports. Why should we not earn from the ports," said Yasmin. The whip told parliament that son of a Jamaat leader spoke ill of prime minister Sheikh Hasina while performing Hajj instead of praying to Almighty Allah.
