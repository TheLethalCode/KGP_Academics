 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces backed by helicopter gunships have killed 15 Taliban in clashes that erupted after militants attacked a military post and convoy in the northwest of the country, an official said on Monday. Security forces have in recent days intensified operations against al Qaeda-linked militants in Bajaur, an ethnic Pashtun tribal region on the Afghan border, as part of its efforts to defeat Pakistani Taliban militants fighting the state.
