 PARIS, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--The remains of one of the 250 British and Australian soldiers unearthed from a World War 1 battlefield in northern France are buried in a military ceremony. The British and Australian flags are raised for a funeral ceremony that almost never happened. In 2008, mass graves containing the bodies of 250 soldiers from WW1 were discovered here in northern France. Of these men, this unidentified soldier is the first to receive a proper burial. (SOUNDBITE) (English) MAJOR GENERAL PAUL SIMON, DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARMY, SAYING: "To almost a hundred years later, finally lay to rest those who were so stoic and such brave young men and it's a great feeling, great feeling for Australians, great feeling for the British that are here, and the French of course have just been so generous and so kind. It's been a very special morning." When the remains were found, special teams were sent in to excavate them. Many are still in the process of being identified. The soldiers were among 7,000 troops who lost their lives over two days in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ALAN GRIFFIN, AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS, SAYING: "During the Great War, the war that was meant to end all wars, this village was also typical of many along the frontline. Devastated by shock and shell, a muddy, blood-drenched killing field, where too many of the cream of a generation were slaughtered and maimed." All of the 250 bodies will be buried throughout February and the cemetery will open to visitors from July. Charlotte Turner, Reu
