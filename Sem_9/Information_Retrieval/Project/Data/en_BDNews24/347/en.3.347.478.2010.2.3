<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has said the Supreme Court's dismissal of Fifth Amendment petitions raises questions over the apex court's "neutrality and independence", while the country was thrown into a "constitutional crisis" by the ruling. Former law minister Moudud Ahmed said crucial political issues were intimately related with the High Court verdict that cancelled the Fifth Amendment and the opposition had appealed to the Supreme Court to remain above politics during the hearing of the petitions challenging the High Court verdict. The senior BNP leader said: "The Supreme Court has raised questions in people's minds over its independence and neutrality with its ruling." The statement came a day after the Supreme Court dismissed two petitions challenging the 2005 High Court ruling that declared the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution illegal. In its ruling, the High Court declared three regimes unconstitutional between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman, BNP's founder. BNP senior joint secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the country was in a constitutional crisis following the effective undoing of the Fifth Amendment. "What position is the country now in, under BAKSAL rule or back under the 1972 Constitution?" the newly promoted BNP leader asked. "The country remains in extreme crisis." Both leaders were speaking at a rally, in front of the main opposition party's central office in Nayapaltan, protesting the death of a JSS leader in police custody on Jan 28. Criticising the deterioration of law and order, Moudud said people have been impatient with mugging and criminal incidents, which leaders of ruling parties are backing, and so law-enforcers have been helpless. He also criticised extra-judicial killings and deaths in police custody over the last one year. BNP standing committee members Mirza Abbas and Goyeshwar Chandra Roi, among others, were present at the event presided over by Juba Dal president and BNP joint secretary general Barkat Ullah Bulu. b
