 ALMATY, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A private foundation set up by billionaire financier George Soros Tuesday urged Kazakhstan to free a jailed human rights defender, saying he was imprisoned in "an unfair trial." The ex-Soviet nation is under scrutiny from the West this year after it assumed the 2010 rotating chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on promises to bring more democracy.

In hearings held last September, Zhovtis, who chaired Soros Foundation Kazakhstan between 1999 and 2002, was sentenced to four years for fatally hitting a pedestrian on a highway outside the financial capital Almaty. Zhovtis says he could not have prevented the accident. There were no allegations that he was drunk or speeding.
