 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)  India's Border Security Force has handed back an abducted Bangladesh Rifles border guard, nayek Mujibur Rahman, after a flag meeting between the two sides on Thursday. BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com that the incident ensued from a misunderstanding between the two border forces. Lt Col Khandaker Zahirul Alam, commanding officer of 21 Rifles Battalion led the BDR delegation in the meeting, from 7:10pm and lasting an hour and ten minutes, on the Tamabil border. The BSF side was led by company commander S Tirki. The Indian border force assured Bangladesh that no such border encroachment would take place in the future on their part, said Khandaker. Earlier in the day, he had told bdnews24.com that a 15-20-member team of India's BSF entered about 50 metres inside Bangladesh territory at around 10am near the border at Jaintapur. He said they fired shots, possibly injuring Rahman, whom the BSF members then kidnapped across the border. After Rahman's return, another BDR official wishing to remain unnamed said that the abductee did not sustain any bullet wounds but may have been mistreated while held captive. bdnews24.com/co
