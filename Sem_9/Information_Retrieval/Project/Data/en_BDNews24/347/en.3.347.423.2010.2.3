 COLOMBO, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's elections commissioner on Wednesday rejected opposition allegations of counting fraud after last week's election, but said he would investigate complaints of vote-rigging brought to his office. Losing candidate General Sarath Fonseka and his supporters have alleged President Mahinda Rajapaksa stole the Jan. 26 election, which he won with a landslide 18 percent margin, equal to 1.8 million votes.

The opposition late on Tuesday said it had found a few bundles of ballot papers marked for Fonseka, some of which were burnt. Dissanayake said he would investigate after Fonseka met him on Wednesday to complain.
