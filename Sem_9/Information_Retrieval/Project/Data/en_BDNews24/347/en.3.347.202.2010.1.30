 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com) Two of the six Nepalese athletes, injured in the lift accident at Hotel Imperial on Friday, had their legs operated upon. Of the three judokas undergoing treatment, Kulu Man Tamang and Ramesh Magar had operations on ligaments in the right foot, said Dr Ashish Saha of Square Hospitals. The other judoka, Debu Thapa was released today and will be participating in the SA games with her team. Four of the seven taken to Square Hospitals were released after primary treatment on Friday. Six Nepalese athletes and an official were injured on Friday when an elevator of the hotel crashed, three and a half hours before the inauguration of the South Asian Games where they were supposed to take part. The injured are Radha Devi Rai, Debu Thapa, Kulu Man Tamang, Ramesh Magar, Gyan Bahadur Shrestha and Gopal Shrestha. The injured official is Dem Basnet. Marketing manager Mahbub Ullah of Hotel Imperial in Gulistan on Friday told bdnews24.com that the accident had occurred at around 12:30pm. The seven were taken to Square Hospitals. Members of the Nepalese judo and weightlifting teams taking part in the Games were staying at the hotel. He said 21 people had boarded the 13-passenger lift. He rejected allegations that the accident happened due to cables snapping and said the lift mechanism failed due to excess weight and the elevator fell to the ground. There were no fatalities thanks to the spring jerky system of the elevator, Mahbub Ullah said. But scouts members assigned to guide the Nepalese team dismissed the claim that eight extra passengers got into the elevator and said it fell after the fourteenth passenger had boarded. bdnews2
