<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Bangladesh's original Constitution will be restored with the Supreme Court's dismissal Tuesday of two petitions challenging the 2005 High Court ruling that declared the Fifth Amendment illegal. "The spirit and values of the Liberation War will be re-established with the petitions cancelled; the Constitution of 1972 will be restored," the minister told reporters on Tuesday in an instant reaction to the order of the Supreme Court. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Md Tafazzul Islam, on Tuesday dismissed the petitions, "with modifications and observations", after six days of hearings that began on January 19. Shafique said, "The Supreme Court as the protector of the Constitution has declared it as the highest law. None can alter it. Even parliament doesn't have that right. "Moreover, its cancellation by military rulers was also illegal," he said. Citing Tuesday's verdict as a milestone for future generations, Shafique said, "The government will initiate all necessary measures to build a secular society and give democracy an institutional shape." He said there should be no scope for "dispute" over the verdict. Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta also told parliament Tuesday that the Supreme Court's dismissal of the two petitions had "paved the way for Bangladesh's return to its original Constitution framed in 1972". During an unscheduled discussion, Sengupta also urged the main opposition BNP and its allies to accept the Supreme Court order, given earlier in the day, which dismissed the petitions and upheld the 2005 High Court ruling that the 5th Amendment was illegal. "Today's Supreme Court order on the 5th Amendment has cleared all obstacles for restoration of the 1972 Constitution," Sengupta told parliament taking floor on a point of order. "As the Supreme Court has (in effect) rejected the 5th Amendment, it will be considered as law of the land. It will be applicable to all including the government and the opposition," he said. "I urge the opposition to accept the Supreme Court verdict". The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  following the 1975 assassination of the founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But the High Court gave a ruling in August 2005, declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal, in response to a petition challenging the legality of the Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The ruling exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government from August 15, 1975 right up to the national elections of 1991 were unconstitutional. The present Awami League-led government's withdrawal from a petition made by the previous BNP-led regime, against the High Court ruling, prompted the two petitions by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three pro-Jamaat lawyers last month. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the Supreme Court's dismissal of the two petitions that the ruling essentially upheld the previous HC judgment. Suranjit told parliament: "The Supreme Court, the guardian of the constitution, after 34 years, upholds that the Amendment is illegal." "I salute the judiciary for its verdict," said Suranjit, who was the only MP recently to vote against the re-adoption of the 1972 Constitution. He also criticised some judges for collaborating with the military rulers. "Some judges shared power with the military rulers stigmatising the judiciary. This verdict has freed the judiciary from that stigma," he said. bdnews2
