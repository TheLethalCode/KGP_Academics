 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court sent former primary and mass education adviser Jahanara Begum to jail for concealing her wealth. Senior special judge ANM Bashirullah gave the order on Sunday rejecting her bail petition. Earlier Jahanara surrendered to the court and sought bail in a case alleging her of concealing wealth information from the Anti-Corruption Commission. The High Court on Nov 18, 2009 ordered Jahanara, the secretary general of Liberal Democratic Party, to surrender before the trial court within nine weeks. The ACC filed the case with Ramna Police Station against her for withholding information about assets worth Tk 1.93 crore.
