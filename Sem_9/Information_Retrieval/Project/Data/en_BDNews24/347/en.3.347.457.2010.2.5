<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)Over 250,000 people are still living in makeshift homes on the embankments of three coastal districts after the devastating Cyclone Aila struck southern Bangladesh last May, the director general of Disaster Management Bureau said on Thursday. "They cannot return to their localities to construct new homes as their areas are still at threat because the embankments have not been not renovated yet," Farhad Uddin said at the first meeting of the National Disaster Management Advisory Committee meeting at the DMB office in the city. The dykes need major repairs at 138 points in the coastal districts of Satkhira, Bagherhat, Khulna, the DG said. An official of Water Development Board said it had taken measures to repair 48 affected areas. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaque said the renovation work will be completed before the next rainy season arrives. "The procedure is underway," Abdur Razzaque told bdnews24.com after attending the meeting. In the meeting, he stressed advance preparedness to mitigate damage from natural calamities. The committee, consisting of parliamentarians from disaster-prone areas, representatives from civil society, donor agencies, NGOs and different ministries, sat Thursday for the first time after it was formed on Nov 19 last year. Participants discussed several government decisions including the Standing Order on Disasters (SOD), National Plan for Disaster Management (NPDM) and Disaster Management Act (DMA). The meeting approved the decisions for adding earthquakes to the SOD and climate change issues to the NPDM. Discussants highlighted the need for immediate passage of the act which was first initiated in 1994, but was returned by the cabinet three times. Moreover, the NPDM is also facing delay, they said. The proposed new warning signal system initiated by the meteorological department was also discussed as the plan has come to a halt due to lack of funding. The committee chief MA Kashem, also former DG of Water Resources Planning Organisation (WARPO), suggested that the new signal system should be launched in a year while the necessary public information campaigns are launched.
