<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has set Tuesday for an order on two petitions against the repeal of the Fifth Amendment. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, set the date on Monday. BNP secretary general Delwar and three pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Supreme Court lawyersMunshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyanfiled the two petitions seeking a stay on the 2005 High Court judgment that declared the Fifth Amendment illegal. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  following the 1975 assassination of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of the Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, it declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The ruling exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government between August 15 1975 right up to the 1991 national elections were unconstitutional. The Awami League-led government withdrawing the previous BNP-led administration's leave to appeal for a stay on the High Court ruling prompted the petitions by Delwar and the three pro-Jamaat lawyers last month. b
