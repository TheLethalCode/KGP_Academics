 LONDON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier League leaders Chelsea could only draw 1-1 at relegation-threatened Hull City on Tuesday as they squandered the chance to move four points clear of Manchester United in the title race. Didier Drogba's free kick shortly before halftime cancelled out Hull's opener scored by Steven Mouyokolo but Chelsea could not force the winner after the break despite late pressure.

Stephen Hunt swung in a corner and Mouyokolo found himself unmarked to head past Petr Cech from close range. The goal stung Chelsea into action and Hull's joy was cut short three minutes before halftime when Drogba curled in a free kick for his first goal since returning from African Nations Cup duty with Ivory Coast. Anthony Gardner missed a great chance to put Hull back into the lead while Daniel Sturridge nearly grabbed a vital win for Chelsea with a late effort saved by Myhill.

Terry's future as England captain could be decided this week by coach Fabio Cap
