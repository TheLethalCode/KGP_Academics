 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has stayed controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun's bail in a money-laundering case. Appellate Division chamber judge Justice Md Muzammel Hossain gave the order on Sunday on a plea by attorney general Mahbubey Alam. Mamun secured bail from the High Court on Jan 28. The Anticorruption Commission filed this case against Mamun, a close friend of BNP senior vice-president Tarique Rahman, in October 2008 with the Dhaka Cantonment Police Sstation. Mamun faced a number of cases filed during the antigraft purge of the military-controlled interim government regime between January 2007 and December 2008.
