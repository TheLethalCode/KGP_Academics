 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University student Abu Bakar Siddique died in hospital on Wednesday after being injured in Bangladesh Chhatra League clashes the previous day that left dozens hurt. Uncle Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com that doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital declared him dead at 9.25am. His family say Bakar, a third year Islamic History student , was not involved in student politics, although a faction of Chhatra League claim he was a member of the pro-ruling party student front. At least 25 people were injured as the two Chhatra League factions fought over control of Sir AF Rahman Residential Hall at Dhaka University in the early hours of Tuesday. Police later arrested the president of the hall's BCL unit Sayeduzzaman Faruk and eight other activists of the Chhatra League. Faruk has said Bakar was a BCL activist and his supporter, but the rival faction's Mehdi Hasan, general secretary of the hall unit, said Bakar was not with the student front. Bakar's uncle said his son was only involved with his studies. According to witnesses, the clash erupted at around 1am Tuesday morning while Faruk's supporters were trying to place a student in the room of the hall's BCL unit general secretary Mehdi Hasan. The two groups of BCL reportedly attacked and chased each other with machetes, clubs and hockey sticks. They also lobbed flaming bottles filled with petrol and vandalised at least 20 rooms in the hall, students on campus said. Several rounds of gunfire were also heard, they said, adding that the rampage also caused tensions among BCL activists in other halls. Armed police entered the hall at around 2am and forcibly dispersed the battling factions. They used 20 rounds of teargas shells to disperse them, police said. Police recovered 20-25 metal bars, one machete, clubs and sticks from the scene. Among the injured were the hall's BCL unit general secretary Mehdi Hasan and BCL cadres Omar Faruk and Aminul Islam. They were admitted to university medical centre and Dhaka Medical College Hospital. bd
