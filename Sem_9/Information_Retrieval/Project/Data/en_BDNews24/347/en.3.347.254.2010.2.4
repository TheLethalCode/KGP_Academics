The bench of justice Syed Refaat Rahman and justice Moinul Islam Chowdhury gave the order on Thursday.

The position of district judges and equivalent ranked officials, including additional judge, chief judicial magistrate and chief metropolitan magistrate, is 24.

The court will review the progress on May 13 and give a next ruling on May 25. The court said that constitutional positions should be duly prioritised according to their importance.
