 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)--The government will construct 400,000 flats in four satellite townships around Dhaka to solve housing problems, housing minister Abdul Mannan has told parliament. While answering a question by woman MP Apu Ukil, the minister said four housing projects would also be built in two other divisional cities Rajshahi and Khulna. "We have adopted the policy of distributing flats instead of plots," Mannan told parliament replying to a private member's resolution supported by other MPs. "To solve the housing problem, RAJUK will construct four satellite townships around Dhaka city. Each of the townships will consist of one lakh flats," said Mannan.
