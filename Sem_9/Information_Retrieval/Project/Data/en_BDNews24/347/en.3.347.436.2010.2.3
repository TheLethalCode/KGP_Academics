 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)Planning minister AK Khandaker has said the new public-private stakeholders committee (PPSC), which convened for the first time Wednesday, will help bring much-needed transparency and accountability in the public procurement process. "The committee will create ways to institutionalise social auditing in public procurement, which is admittedly a sensitive area in our efforts for good governance. It'll ensure transparency and accountability of the whole process," he said at the first meeting of the PPSC at the Planning Commission. The minister termed the committee (PPSC) a unique expression of public-private partnership. The 23-member PPSC was formed in March last year with representatives from the business community, think-tanks and civil society organisations alongside government officials. The committee will evaluate the broad impact of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) and Public Procurement Rules (PPR) annually, hold discussions with stakeholders and recommend appropriate changes needed to PPA and PPR. Khandaker termed public procurement "a complex and wide-reaching issue". "Either by design or by default, it creates greater temptations or offers more opportunities for corruption and misuse of funds." He said corruption and other losses often cost as much as 40 to 50 percent of a contract value. He also cited the international obligation of Bangladesh to ensure accountability as a signatory to the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). The minister stressed the need for a body of skilled manpower to rigorously implement the PPA and PPR. Wednesday's meeting was also attended by officials of different government agencies and civil society representatives. The public-private stakeholders committee will sit every three months to discuss the progress. The committee was instituted under the Public Procurement Reform Project-II (PPRP-II) which aims to improve performance of the public procurement system, and is being executed by the Planning Commission's Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division. The four components of the PPRP-II are capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, e-government procurement (e-GP) and communication, behavioral change and social accountability (social awareness and citizen engagement). The four components are being managed by different agencies, including FinEurop of Italy, IMED's Central Procurement Technical Unit, Bangladesh Centre for Communication Programmes (BCCP) and Institute of Governance Studies of BRAC University. bd
