 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)--Food minister Abdur Razzaque on Sunday warned of stern action if low-quality rice is sold through the open-market sale (OMS) programme. After the inauguration of newly elected committee of Bangladesh Food Inspector Association at the Food Bhaban, the minister told reporters that some sacks containing sub-standard rice were found in some places including Dhalpur in capital Dhaka. Those involved will face stringent action, he said Regarding the sale of low quality rice, the minister said, "We will be more alert so that low quality rice cannot be sold." He said people are showing no interest in buying rice 11 days into the launch of the programme. Dealers are sitting idle until 8:00pm though the sale is supposed to run from morning to afternoon, according to him. Price of rice has dropped a little thanks to the launch of OMS, Razzaque said. The government will extend OMS programme in the neighbouring districts of Dhaka, he said and added that new dealers will be appointed. OMS is also being conducted on 50 trucks in densely populated areas apart from dealers, the minister said. Razzaque said the government has a stock of 9 lakh metric tons rice and 1.5 lakh metric tons wheat. "There will be no food crisis as the government is set to import 6-7 lakh tons of wheat in two or three months." Dismissing the possibility of rice import from India, the minister said some traders have hiked the price of rice by spreading the rumour. He said the other cause of price hike of rice is low production of Aman crops. b
