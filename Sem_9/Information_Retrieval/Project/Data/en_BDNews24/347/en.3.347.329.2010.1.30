 LONDON, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mother appeared in court on Saturday charged with murdering her two young children after their bodies were found in the boot of her car in East Sussex. Fiona Donnison, 43, was remanded in custody by Lewis Magistrates Court and told she must appear at a later date over the deaths of three-year-old Harry and two-year-old Elise Donnison, the Press Association reported. Their bodies were found after their mother went to a police station in Heathfield, in a distressed state on Wednesday and told officers about the dead children. Police believe the pair may have been asphyxiated. Donnison of Marshwood Road, Lightwater, Surrey, was accused of committing the double murders between January 25 and 28. Flanked by two security guards, Donnison, wearing a long blue jumper, held her hands clasped in front of her as she spoke only to confirm her name, date of birth and address during the 10-minute hearing. There was no application for bail and no plea was entered during the hearing. The case was adjourned and Donnison will next appear at Lewes Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on February 12. Donnison, who is estranged from her husband, was briefly hospitalised after going to the police, for what officers said appeared to be self-inflicted wounds
