 ISLAMABAD Feb 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will take all steps to secure the release and return home of a Pakistani woman convicted in a US court for shooting at her US interrogators in Afghanistan, a government spokesman said on Thursday. Aafia Siddiqui, 37, was convicted in a New York court on Wednesday for grabbing a US officer's rifle while she was being questioned in 2008 in Afghanistan and firing at FBI agents and military personnel as she was wrestled to the ground. The jury gave a unanimous verdict on seven counts, including attempted murder and assault. Though guilty on two attempted murder counts, the jury said the crime was not premeditated. Siddiqui is a US-trained neuroscientist who spent years living in the United States, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

None of the US agents or personnel was injured in the July 2008 incident but Siddiqui, who the US government has accused of links with al Qaeda, was shot. About 2,000 Islamists protesting against Siddiqui's conviction chanted slogans against the United States and support for Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in the southwestern city of Quetta. Protests were also held in the capital, Islamabad, and the eastern city of Multan. Siddiqui was arrested by Afghan police, who said she was carrying containers of chemicals and notes referring to mass-casualty attacks and New York landmarks. She was not charged in connection with those materials and the charges she was convicted of do not mention terrorism. Instead, the case centred on the incident that occurred the day after she was arrested in the Afghan police compound, where US soldiers and FBI agents sought to question
