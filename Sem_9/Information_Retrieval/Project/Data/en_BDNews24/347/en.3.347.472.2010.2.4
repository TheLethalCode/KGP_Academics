 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh believes that terrorists responsible for the Aug 21 2004 grenade attacks on an Awami League rally in Dhaka might be hiding in India and has formally requested the government of the neighbouring country to detain and hand them over. Bangladesh High Commissioner to India Ahmed Tariq Karim said that Dhaka had formally requested New Delhi to look for the terrorists responsible for the 2004 grenade attack that had killed 23 people and left many injured. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then leading the opposition, was among the injured and the dead included several Awami League leaders, workers and supporters. "There are a number of people whom we want and could be living somewhere in India... those people who were involved in attacking political rallies in 2004... We want them back," Karim told journalists in Guwahati  the main city of India's northeastern state of Assam. "We have made a formal plea to India to hand them back to us. The process has already started and is moving in the right direction," he added. The envoy was replying to queries on cooperation between Dhaka and Delhi in combating terrorism. Assam has a 272 km long border with Bangladesh. The northeastern Indian state has been the scene of several insurgencies and ethnic conflicts since early 1970s. The outlawed United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) is the most prominent among the insurgent organizations of the troubled state. India has long been claiming that the ULFA and several other militant outfits of its northeastern region have bases and facilities for guerrilla warfare training in Bangladesh. Dhaka's tacit cooperation with New Delhi in November and December last year resulted in the arrest of as many as five ULFA leaders and activists its 'Chairman' Arabinda Rajkhowa, 'Deputy Military Chief' Raju Barua, 'Finance Secretary' Chitraban Hazarika, 'Foreign Secretary' Sashadhar Choudhury and Rajkhowa's bodyguard Raja Bora. Neither Dhaka, nor New Delhi, however, recognized the role of Bangladeshi agencies in creating the situations that led to the arrests of the five. But, as New Delhi's official versions go, all of them were arrested after India's Border Security Force (BSF) personnel spotted them near the Indo-Bangla border. The ULFA general secretary Anup Chetia was arrested in Bangladesh in 1997 for illegally entering the country and staying there without valid documents. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Chetia was not handed over to India due to the absence of any extradition treaty between the two countries. New Delhi, however, has been requesting Dhaka to hand over Chetia. Though India and Bangladesh signed an agreement for transfer of sentenced persons during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Delhi last month; the deal does not cover Chetia as he has already completed his prison term. Hasina then told a news conference that New Delhi and Dhaka were discussing an extradition treaty, which could also be signed in future. The ULFA military wing chief Paresh Barua is also believed to have been based in Dhaka until recently, although Indian intelligence sources said that he had left Bangladesh late last year. In March 2008, Mohammed Hafijur Rehman and Din Mohammed, both prime accused detained in the Chittagong arms haul case, had confessed to a Bangladesh magistrate that 10-truck arms consignment, seized in the port city in 2004, had in fact been meant for the ULFA. Rehman also alleged that Barua, himself, had supervised the arms-smuggling operation. Asked if Bangladesh would in return hand over Chetia and other ULFA leaders to India, Karim avoided a direct reply, but indicated that Dhaka would continue to cooperate with New Delhi in the fight against terrorism. He reiterated that Bangladesh was committed not to allow use of its territory for any nefarious activities against India. The envoy made it clear that Dhaka also expected reciprocal gestures from Delhi. "We also should get what we want," Karim told journalists in Guwahati.
