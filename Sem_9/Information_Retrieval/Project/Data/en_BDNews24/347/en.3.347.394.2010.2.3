 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Voters under Dhaka City Corporation now stand at 3.7 million, according to the Dhaka district election office, which published the final voter list on Wednesday. The latest numbers showed an increase of more than 23o,000 since the previous list. Biswas Lutfar Rahman, deputy election commissioner of Dhaka division, told bdnews24.com that some 230,681 new voters had been added to the updated list. "There is still scope for fresh enlistment", Rahman said, adding that "those failed to get enrolled can still do so by contacting the district election office". Officials said that the final voter list was being made available in thana election offices, ward council offices, venues used as polling centres and other public places. The Election Commission earlier said the DCC elections, delayed by two-and-a-half years, would start the process of holding the polls after the final voter list was completed. The term of the current DCC elected officials, including the mayor, expired on May 24, 2007. The EC plans to hold the polls next month but it is subject to resolution of the writ petition filed by Shamim Molla, a Dhaka voter seeking fresh demarcations of the city corporation boundaries. The High Court last month issued a rule nisi, based on the petition, asking the government and chief election commissioner to explain within four weeks why they should not demarcate the DCC wards based on the latest population census. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said a few days ago that the commission wanted to re-demarcate Dhaka's wards after the elections if the court allowed. He said that delimitation was a complicated task and it could not be completed in less than six months. The CEC said the commission would try to convince the court of this. bdne
