<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com) The French have offered Bangladesh technical and financial support in a project aimed at ensuring 'green production' processes in the textile sector. French firm Callebaut de Blicquy (CDB) will implement the test-project with two member mills of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) by installing environment friendly and cost efficient machinery and helping to operate them for a year. CDB, with two other French companies Dewailly Conseils and L'Eau Pure, will provide the technical and training support to Purbani Fabrics Ltd and Comfit Composite Knit Ltd. Laurent Estrade, trade commissioner at the French Embassy in Dhaka, on behalf of the French government took part in the signing ceremony of the agreement between CDB and Youth Group, which owns the two mills, on Wednesday at the BTMA office. Laurent in his short address hoped that the pilot project would be a success. He also said the example of efficient and pollution reducing machinery should encourage other private industries to launch such initiatives. CDB will instaan Optilab, which will identify chemicals responsible for pollution, and a Submerged Bio-Reactor (SBR) that allows very efficient reduction of the final effluent pollution. Nathalie Orliange, project engineer of CDB, told bdnews24.com the Optilab would reduce dyeing time and the quantity of chemicals by 25 percent, which would reduce pollution by 30 percent. Moreover, she said SMBR will reduce the suspension of solid materials by 99 percent. Experts from France will conduct one month training for the operators. The project cost is estimated at around 200,000 Euro, Syed Monzurul Huq, BTMA vice president, told bdnews24.com. "If we find the pilot project successful, we'll suggest other mills to adopt the technology," he added. Laurent told bdnews24.com, "France wants to assist in more projects in Bangladesh, especially in arsenic mitigation programmes."
