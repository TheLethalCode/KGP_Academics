 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Rajuk on Thursday began demolishing the unapproved top floors of the mega-mall, Jamuna Future Park. just a day after the High Court dismissed Jamuna Group's petition challenging the demolition order issued by the capital develeopment authority on Jan 17. The first-day demolition work, led by Rajuk magistrate Rokonuddoula, began at around 11.00am and lasted for about two and half hours with heavy police presence. Police barricaded the park site near the Baridhara diplomatic enclave since early morning. Rajuk planning and development director Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com that demolition would resume soon but did not specify when. Rajuk officials faced some obstruction from Jamuna authorities before they could begin demolition at the 10th floor. Rajuk workers then started demolition of the 9th floor. A Jamuna employee alleged that the office of the group chairman located on the 9th floor was ransacked during the drive. The Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) on January 17 gave the Jamuna Future Park authorities seven days' notice to knock down the unauthorised parts of the huge shopping complex claimed to be the largest in South Asia. Rajuk official Shaqur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the owner of the sprawling complex across 10 acres of land (1000 decimals) had iilegally built four floors on top of the approved six floors. But Nurul Islam, chief of the Jamuna Future Park development and owner of a Bengali newspaper, the daily Jugantar, disagreed with Rajuk and challeged its decision in court. Jamuna Group director Abdul Wadud said they were preparing to appeal against the High Court ruling before the Appellate Division. bdnews
