<TITLE> Instant view: US 2010 budget deficit to hit record $1.56 trln </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are analysts' comments after President Barack Obama on Monday projected in his budget for the fiscal year to September 30, 2011 the US budget deficit would soar to a fresh record of $1.56 trillion in 2010. LATEST COMMENTS MARC OSTWALD, CURRENCY, RATES STRATEGIST, MONUMENT SECURITIES, LONDON "When the deficit is that size and you want to cut it meaningfully, you have to do more." "It is still tinkering around the edges. One has to look at more meaningful things in terms of what will actually reduce the deficit, (which is) the revenue picture." "This is really something that is going to have an impact on equities, rather than the dollar or Treasuries because it's individual areas (such as aerospace) what may be impacted." EARLIER COMMENTS SIMON DERRICK, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, LONDON "A projected budget deficit of around one and a half trillion was around what was expected, maybe a little higher, but the market is not reacting to this. In terms of the dollar reaction, given risk aversion is on the table anyway, this counteracts what Obama is saying because risk aversion makes ownership of US government paper more attractive." KORNELIUS PURPS, STRATEGIST, UNICREDIT MIB, MUNICH "The problem of how we're going to deal with these huge deficits, not only in Greece but in the UK, Germany, this question is unsolved and today's (US) budget figures are just another confirmation that it's probably a huge problem. The bond markets have little choice when it comes to investing in triple-A securities like US or German Bunds because other countries are probably faring even worse than these triple-A rated countries, so I wouldn't expect a particularly negative bond market reaction." PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK, LONDON "Probably the spending cuts are not really sufficient to generate the kind of savings required to get the US fiscal balance back in order anytime soon. It looks like we are going to have a situation in which the US budget deficit and consequently the amount of debt will be an issue." NICK STAMENKOVIC, RIA CAPITAL MARKETS "This is just a confirmation of what he said in the State of the Union address last week and it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to markets." DAVID PAGE, ECONOMIST, INVESTEC "The US budget deficit is only projected to be curtailed back to 3.9 percent by five-years time, whereas in the UK we're hoping to see a sharper curtailment. "So the plans include aggressive deficit reduction but not as aggressive as in European nations." KENNETH BROUX, MARKET ECONOMIST, LLOYDS TSB, LONDON "It looks to me like they are bumping up the deficit forecasts very near term so frontloading the spending just to stabilize the labor market. That's what they want to concentrate on going into the Congressional elections in November. Raising spending near term, get the deficit up but bring it down after that. If they will bring it down below 10 percent next year it will be some unqualified success." DAVID BUIK, PARTNER, BGC PARTNERS, LONDON "They have chosen the path of glory which is to spend their way out of trouble and this just endorses it. The taxpayers will pay for this and I think it will damage growth very bad
