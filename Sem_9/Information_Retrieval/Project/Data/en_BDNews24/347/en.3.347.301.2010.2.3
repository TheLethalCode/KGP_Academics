<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has dismissed allegations of the opposition that she signed a secret treaty with India during her visit to Delhi last month. Answering a supplementary question in parliament Wednesday, of Fazlul Azim, an independent MP, the prime minister challenged the opposition to disclose evidence of any such secret deals in public. The opposition leader, Khaleda Zia, made the accusation on Hasina's return from Delhi. The BNP chairperson said the prime minister signed a "secret security deal" with India and requested that the government reveal it to the people. Hasina said Wednesday, "No question of secret treaties with India arises. We have not made any such deals. If the opposition has any evidence to support the accusations, they should publish them." 'ACCORD ON MUTUAL ISSUES' The prime minister said Bangladesh had seen eye to eye with India on speedy resolution of various mutual issues. "Work on transportation and power in the Angorpota-Dahagram enclaves is already underway." She said a meeting would soon be held of the Joint River Commission regarding the rightful share of river water, including the Teesta. "No time limit has been set for solving these issues, but initiatives will be taken soon," said Hasina. In answer to the original question by AHM Hamidur Rahman, Jaamat-e-Islami MP from Cox's Bazar-2 constituency, which was presented by Fazlul Azim in his absence, Hasina read out a written answer outlining the successes of her visit to India. She also detailed discussions with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh and the treaties signed during the visit. The prime minister, in response to another query by Mosharraf Hossain MP, of ruling party Awami League, said that currently 40 percent of the Chittagong port and 10 percent of the Mongla port is being utilised. Giving access to these two ports to India, Nepal and Bhutan, after infrastructural development, would greatly profit the country by increasing revenue earnings. In answer to a supplementary question of Shamsul Haque Chowdhury, MP from Chittagong  11, Hasina said that a computerised container terminal management system would be launched within a year at the Chittagong port that would increase the efficiency of the port reducing both container congestion and corruption. b
