 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has set Tuesday for an order on two petitions against the repeal of the Fifth Amendment. A full six-member bench, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, set the date on Monday after six days of hearings on the petitions that began on Jan 19. BNP secretary general Delwar Hossain and three pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Supreme Court lawyersMunshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyanfiled the two petitions seeking a stay on the 2005 High Court judgment that declared the Fifth Amendment illegal. The petitions came in the wake of the Supreme Court's Jan 3 vacation of a stay order on the High Court ruling. Chief state counsel Mahmudul Islam said: "Parliament has no authority to suspend the constitution. It does not even have the authority to ratify a suspension as was done through the Fifth Amendment." Islam, a former attorney general, said the petitioners' argument that the Fourth Amendment warranted the Fifth was baseless. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said: "The Fifth Amendment was passed in parliament on April 5 1979 to give validity to Martial Law up to April 9 that year. But Martial Law was withdrawn the next day (April 6)." "So this amendment, made during a period of martial law, cannot be valid now," he argued. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  military or otherwise  following the 1975 assassination of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But the High Court gave a ruling in August 2005, declaring the Fifth Amendment illegal, in response to a petition challenging the legality of the Martial Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman. The ruling exempted certain measures of those regimes initiated for public welfare. But the court in its judgment said all the changes in government between August 15 1975 right up to the 1991 national elections were also unconstitutional. The present Awami League-led government's withdrawal of a leave to appeal against the High Court ruling, initiated by the previous BNP-led administration, prompted the petitions by Delwar and the three pro-Jamaat lawyers last month. Delwar's lawyer Moudud Ahmed said in Monday's hearing: "The High Court ruling said that Ziaur Rahman had taken over power. But at that time his movement was restricted indoors." He claimed that Zia was freed from his house by civilians and army personnel who brought him to power. "Zia did not suspend the constitution, nor did he impose martial law. Everything was done beforehand. Zia was not responsible for those actions." Moudud, who was a minister in both martial administrations of Ziaur Rahman and HM Ershad, said: "The Supreme Court should not give any ruling that reflects the wish of a certain political party. This should not be a political issue." "The court should not involve itself in such a matter. It will increase tension and create conflict on an issue that has long divided the nation." He also said when the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it was stated in the parliament that the issue "would not be questioned later." "But parliament's authority is now being undermined as the court questions that decision." Another of Delwar's lawyer TH Khan said the government wanted to uphold the High Court ruling by using the Supreme Court's seal to avoid a referendum. "The parliament could actually resolve this issue. But the government is using the court instead," he said. bdne
