<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed that fugitives of Bangabandhu murder case will be hunted down and brought to justice. She made the pronouncement, at the extended meeting of the ruling Awami League on Saturday, just days after the five captured convicts found guilty of murdering Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975, were executed. The five, all former army officers and freedom fighters, were hanged between midnight and 1.00am on Jan 28 after the due legal process had been exhausted, with the president rejecting the last of the mercy petitions on the evening of Jan 27. Six more former officers, convicted in their absence, are believed to be on the run abroad while one is believed to have died. Hasina also cautioned her party members to beware of opportunists and the propaganda being spread by the main opposition. Hasina said that the government would also hold trials for the killing of the four AL leaders in Dhaka Central Jail in 1975. This was the first such meeting that the ruling Awami League has held after formation of its central committee. Presidents and general secretaries of Awami League's countrywide chapters attended this meeting held on the Ganabhaban premises. The government has been trying to extradite rest of the convicts absconding overseas, some ministers also said. Hasina said that history never forgave criminals and said that the aspirations of the people, as well as the Awami League leaders and workers, have been fulfilled through the execution of the verdict. The prime minister said that she would also hold trials for the murder of the four AL-leaders in the Dhaka Central Jail in 1975. "There will also be trials of war crimes and BDR killings one after the other if I am alive. I will not accommodate any crime in this country." AL general secretary Ashraf said women members will have to give special attention to ensure that women make up 33 per cent in each committee. Young members also have to be increased. bdne
