<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  Britain will resume processing visa applications from Bangladeshi students as soon as possible, an official of the British High Commission in Dhaka said on Monday Stuart Percival, UK Border Agency operations manager in Dhaka, was speaking to newsmen at a views-exchange meeting in Sylhet city a day after the UK announced a temporary halt in processing Bangladesh student visa applications. Percival had also said on Sunday: "I am keen that genuine students from Bangladesh continue to study at high quality institutions in the UK. This temporary measure is designed to protect genuine students, professional agents and good education providers." "We will continue to review the situation and hope that a normal visa service will be resumed for genuine students who want to study in the UK." The Border Agency, via a statement on Sunday, temporarily suspended all applications made under Tier-4 of the Points Based System in Bangladesh and said it would not accept visa applications at the centres in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet from Monday. The UKBA said it had taken the decision in response to unexpectedly high numbers of student visa applications at this time of year in parts of South Asia, and would therefore stop accepting any new applications under the Tier-4 student route in affected areas, including Bangladesh, Nepal and North India. ] Those making applications in others categories would not be affected, the statement also said. bdn
