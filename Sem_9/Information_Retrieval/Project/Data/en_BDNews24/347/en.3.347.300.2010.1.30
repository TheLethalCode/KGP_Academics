Yemen has gained a reputation as a haven and a training and recruiting centre for al Qaeda militants since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Authorities stepped up operations against the group after its Yemeni wing said it was behind an attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound US airliner on December 25. Yemen is also fighting a war with Shi'ite rebels in northern regions bordering Saudi Arabia and facing simmering separatist sentiment in the south. The Shi'ite rebels, known as Houthis, made a truce offer last week and said they had withdrawn from all Saudi territory.

The rebels said on Friday that Saudi air and artillery attacks had continued despite the truce offer
