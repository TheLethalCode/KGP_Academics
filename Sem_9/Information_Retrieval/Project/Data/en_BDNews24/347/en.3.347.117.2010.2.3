<TITLE> JMB 'on the wane' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top police official has said that banned Islamist outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) has been tamed, while other law enforcers agree the extremist group is "on the wane" with members decamping. Inspector general of police, Nur Mohammad, in response to journalists' queries at an annual police conference in Chittagong on Tuesday, said JMB had been brought "under control". He termed the murder of a former JMB member, 28-year-old Rashidul Islam, in Dhaka on Monday "unrelated" to extremism. However, Rashidul's wife claims that he was murdered by his former JMB compatriots for criticising and quitting the militant outfit. JMB is believed to have been founded in the late 1990s in Jamalpur district. While its exact origins are shrouded in mystery, the extremist Islamist outfit came to the limelight after they carried out a serial bomb attack across Bangladesh on August 17, 2005, that killed at least 25 people. Six of its top leaders, including JMB supreme commander Maulana Abdur Rahman and second-in-command Siddiqul Islam, alias Bangla Bhai, were executed in March 2007. No terrorist attack has so far been recorded in 2009 by the Islamist militants. The IGP said on Tuesday there were "no more organised or powerful" networks of JMB in the country at present. Rapid Action Battalion, the elite anti-crime force and an important player in the drive against militants and extremists, claims the same and also says many JMB members are looking for a way out. According to newspaper reports, 44 leaders and cadres of JMB were arrested during six months from January to July last year. In May last year RAB netted the outfit's top explosive expert Jahedul Islam Sumon. RAB officials have also said JMB cadres are beginning to lean towards use of small arms, rather than explosives, signalling dwindling organisational strength. The elite force's assumption is based on recovered arms and information from recently arrested JMB members. They say the scattered terrorist group is trying to earn money through isolated criminal acts as they are moving away from their ideological moorings with the decline of their organisational strength. Director of RAB intelligence wing Lt Col Ziaul Hassan told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, "JMB's organisational strength has waned considerably; they are not in a position to carry out any massive operation." He also said JMB killed their defiant former operative Rashidul Islam in Uttara on Monday to receive media coverage and as a warning to members against deserting the organisation. "They staged the recent killing only to make their presence felt but we have information that the organisation is getting smaller day by day," he said. "Many JMB members want to leave the organisation and return to normal life," he added. IGP Nur Mohammad, speaking in Chittagong, said even the limited activity of the extremist outfit in various parts of the country was declining due to action of law enforcers and public intolerance for militancy. In Natore on Monday night, locals themselves captured seven JMB extremists and handed them over to the police when they attempted to kidnap a local political leader. The inspector general said: "Continuous combing operations, arrests and seizure of weapons has left them with no scope to regroup and continue operations." Sheikh Hasina, coming to power in January last year, vowed to get tough with militants. Since then security forces have raided reported hideouts, seizing arms and bomb making materials and arresting scores of militant suspects, including top JMB leaders. Last year saw reports of some JMB militants trying to regroup under a new name 'Islam and Muslim'. Though details of their activities have been sketchy, the group was reportedly headed by one Abdur Rahim, who has since been arrested. Chittagong deputy commissioner Fariduddin Ahmed Chowdhury, Chittagong Metropolitan Police commissioner M Moniruzzaman and other high officials were present at the inauguration. bdnew
