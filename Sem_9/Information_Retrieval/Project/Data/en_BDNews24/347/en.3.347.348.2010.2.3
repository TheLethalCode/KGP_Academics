 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh has offered duty-free access to Bhutanese products, commerce minister Faruk Khan said on Wednesday, after meeting with a Bangladeshi business delegation that is scheduled to leave for Thimpu on Friday "The prime minister promised duty free access for18 products from January 1 during her recent visit to Bhutan," said Khan, but it could not be offered on time because of the change in the product list made by the Bhutanese government." He said the products include vegetables, fruits and limestone. "We hope it will be effective within a month." The 24-member Bangladesh delegation will meet Bhutanese government officials as well as members of the business community. Citing business prospects between the two countries as good, Khan said that talks on transit facilities that would enable products from both countries to move through Indian territory opened during the PM's recent visit. "We've advanced a lot on the issue. Infrastructure development including rail tracks have already been started," he added. Bhutanese imports to Bangladesh stood at about $12 million in the fiscal 2008-09, which includes fruits, vegetables, processed food and furniture. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan amounted to just $0.6 million, which includes pharmaceuticals, garment and frozen food
