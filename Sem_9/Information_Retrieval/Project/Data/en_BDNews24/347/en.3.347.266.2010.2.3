<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's losing streak in Twenty20 cricket was extended to ten matches after they suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat against New Zealand at Seddon Park, Hamilton on Wednesday. What was supposed to be a game lasting three hours, turned into a no-contest after the Tigers were bundled out for 78 in 17.3 overs. It was their lowest total, beating the 83 they were skittled for by Sri Lanka in the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007. The Kiwis required less than half of those overs (8.2) to finish proceedings. Brendon McCullum remained 56 not out off 27 balls with seven fours and two sixes. Debutant Peter Ingram was not out 20 off 23 balls. The Bangladesh bowlers, who sprayed the bowl around, were not helped by some schoolboy fielding as they dropped straightforward chances from each of the New Zealand openers. After winning the toss, Bangladesh could not string a meaningful partnership together as each and every batsman who came to the crease played a senseless shot. Raqibul Hasan was top-scorer with 18 off 13 balls, which included two fours and a six. New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori was adjudged the player of the match after picking up 3-6 off his four-over spell that included a maiden. Opting to bat, the tourists got off to a quiet start scoring four runs off the first over. But Tamim Iqbal made a statement of intent in the next one slamming two consecutive fours off Tim Southee's second and third deliveries. He also survived a catch opportunity when the left-hander hooked the same bowler, but the ball rolled over the boundary for another four in a productive second over. The Bangladesh opener however couldn't make the most of the let-off as he was caught behind for 14 off Daryl Tuffey in the third over. Vettori made an immediate impact when he brought himself on to bowl claiming two wickets in his first over. First he got rid of Mohammad Ashraful (11 off 14 balls), who threw his wicket after making room to hit the left-arm spinner over cover but was caught at cover point. Then he trapped Mushfiqur Rahim for a duck. Nathan McCullum's introduction into the attack saw the end of Shakib Al Hasan (3), who was bowled. The spinner also claimed the wicket of Mahmudullah (11 off 23 balls). The two spinners in operation shared five wickets for 21 runs between them. By the eighth over Bangladesh were 42-5. Former ICL rebel Aftab Ahmed fell for 12 off 14 balls after hitting James Franklin for a six in his opening over. But the bowler got his revenge by bowling him. The Tigers, who flew to New Zealand on Jan 29, a day after losing the Test series against India, will now turn their attention to the one-off Test and three
