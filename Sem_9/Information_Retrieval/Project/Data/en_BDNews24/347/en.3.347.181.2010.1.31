<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)The government will set up secondary schools in every area of the capital, said state minister for women and children Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury. She made the pledge speaking at the inauguration of W-8, which is an initiative of eight women from as many countries namely India, Georgia, Maldives, Nicaragua, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Bangladesh. Speaking at the ceremony at the National Press Club on Sunday, the junior minister also called for increased awareness of guardians to encourage schooling of girls until their education is completed. Among others, Rokeya Kabir demanded that the government should recognise education in the constitution as a fundamental human right. She said around 48 percent children could not complete their primary education. "So the government should set up a primary school in every village all over the country to ensure quality primary education for children." W-8 is coordinating its work with 'Amar Odhikar Campaign' (my rights campaign) in Bangladesh. The campaign published a research report on the necessary financial allocation to ensure quality education for all children at the ceremony and made a number of recommendations for ensuring universal primary education.
