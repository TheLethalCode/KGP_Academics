<TITLE> Law ministry gets two secretaries </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  The law ministry has appointed secretaries to its two recently-formed divisions, after more than a month without any secretary at the helm due to a legal ruling on the ministry's former top bureaucrat. Additional secretary Anwarul Haque was made secretary to the Law and Justice Division, while additional secretary Mohammad Shahidul Haque was made secretary to the Legislative Drafting and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The two were appointed after the ministry received a copy of the court order rendering illegal the appointment of former law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. The Supreme Court on in December last year upheld a 2008 High Court ruling that declared Awal's appointment as acting law secretary illegal. Since the Supreme Court ruling on Dec 17, the law ministry was bereft of a secretary until Monday. Deputy secretary ASM Zahirul Haque Dulal told bdnews24.com that the two new appointments were made through an official order of the law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry, to give it its full name. He also said a copy of the original verdict issued by the High Court came to the law ministry on Sunday, following which an official order to appoint two secretaries was issued. Awal, who was removed from the post of law secretary, has now been appointed anew in line with policy formulated in 2001 by the then Awami League-led government, Dulal said. The High Court in its ruling ordered that the policy formulated by the Sheikh Hasina's administration at that time should be maintained and executed as law. According to the policy, 75 per cent posts of the law ministry are preserved for judicial division cadres and another 25 for legislative drafting division cadres. The highest post, that of secretary, was also allocated for a judicial division officer according to the previous policy. However, with the recent division of the law ministry, there is now chance for a secretary from each cadre. bd
