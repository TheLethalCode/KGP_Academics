 Rajshahi, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  A case has been filed with the Motihar Police Station on Saturday, over a clash between the police and students of Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology on Friday. Tofazzal Hossain, officer in charge of the station, said that inspector Arifuzzaman filed the case as the plaintiff. However he refused to divulge the number or identity of students accused. A news release from RUET said that the police administration had assured them of forming an investigation committee to probe into the clash. Students formed human-chains on campus on Saturday protesting against the assault on students and teachers. The university authority vented its frustrations in meetings with transport officials and the police and demanded steps against the accused police officials and compensation for damages to students. The clash erupted on Friday when a Shyamoli Paribahan bus hit a horse carriage in a festive procession brought out electrical engineering students upon completion of their studies. The accident injured six passengers of the carriage. The students got into an argument with transport workers over the accident. Later transport leaders and workers attacked the students and beat up a number of them. The students, protesting against the incident, laid siege to the Dhaka-Rajshahi highway and got involved in a clash with the police that left at least 50 injured. Tofazzal, on Saturday, told journalists that a case had been lodged against the students for assaulting the police and barring police activity. But names of the accused could not be divulged for the sake of ongoing investigations. No one was arrested till evening. But Golam Arif, president of RUET's Chhatra Shibir, which is the student wing of the funamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami, alleged that a case was filed over the incident accusing him and eight other members of his organisation and a number of unidentified students. He demanded withdrawal of the case. RUET students formed a human chain in front of their administrative building for an hour from 1.00pm demanding resignation of the Motihar police station's officer in charge and closure of Shyamoli Paribahan's operations to Rahshahi. Al-Amin and Faisal, both students of the univeristy, told bdnews24.com that students would initiate a stronger movement if route permit of Shyamoli Paribahan is not cancelled and Tofazzal not withdrawn. RUET VC Dr Shirajul Islam Chowdhury presided over the meeting at his office, attended by the police commissioner of Rajshahi, Nowsher Ali, deputy commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin, OC Tofazzal Hossain, the university's registrar, student welfare advisor, deans of various faculties, senior teachers and leaders of district road transport associations including their general secretary.
