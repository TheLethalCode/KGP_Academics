 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)  A top executive of Walmart, the company that buys over a billion dollars worth of RMG from Bangladesh annually, arrived in Dhaka Thursday evening on a short, unannounced visit and will meet, among others, the prime minister. C. Douglas McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International, will meet Sheikh Hasina on Friday morning, BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy said. The BGMEA chief said that 30 percent of Bangladesh's garments exports to the US went to Walmart, the world's largest retail chain. The US is the single largest importer of Bangladeshi garments. Murshedy told bdnews24.com that McMillon would have talks with a BGMEA team at his hotel suite before heading for the meeting with Hasina. "I have no idea about the agenda of the meeting," Murshedy said of the scheduled discussions with the Walmart chief. "He arrived on a very short notice." Famous for its low prices helped by an innovative inventory management system, Walmart says it 'serves customers and members more than 200 million times per week' at more than 8,424 retail units under 53 different banners in 15 countries. With last year's sales at $401 billion, Walmart employs more than 2.1 million associates worldwide, according to the company. The US-based company operates in Mexico as Walmex, owns the giant Asda in the UK, and runs Seiyu in Japan. In countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Puerto Rico, the company has wholly-owned operations. Walmart has it presence on the subcontinent with a retail chain called Best Price in India. bd
