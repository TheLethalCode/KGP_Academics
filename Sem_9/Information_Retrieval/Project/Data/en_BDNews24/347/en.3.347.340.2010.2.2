 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)--The government has approved a project to give away more than 30 million energy saving bulbs countrywide, at a cost of Tk 279 crore, in a bid to save national power consumption. A meeting of the Executive Committee for the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the 'Efficient Lighting Initiative for Bangladesh' project on Tuesday. The two-year project will distribute 1.5 crore (15 million) bulbs in the first phase and 1.75 crore (17.5 million) in the second phase of the project, planning secretary Habibullah Majumder told reporters after the meeting. Majumder said the first phase will be completed by this year and the second phase in the next. He said most of the bulbs will be distributed by Bangladesh Palli Bidyut Samity (PBS), while PDB, DESA, DESCO and other organisations would also be involved. PBS will distribute bulbs in 15 zones in the first phase of the project, said the planning secretary. Asked whether every family would receive bulbs, he said that the distributing agencies would decide on that. The ECNEC meeting, chaired by finance minister AMA Muhith as the prime minister was absent, approved a total of 8 infrastructure projects worth Tk 1,532 crore, including the efficient lighting project, of which Tk 830 crore is expected to come as project aid. bd
