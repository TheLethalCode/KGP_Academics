 BAGHDAD, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A female suicide bomber laden with explosives blew herself up on Monday among Shia pilgrims on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, killing at least 41 people, security officials said. Iraq is trying to leave years of bombings, killings and sectarian slaughter behind as it moves to cement security gains made in the last two years and revamp an oil sector that gives Iraq nearly all of its revenues. The bombing took place as thousands of Shi'ite Muslims flooded the streets for the start of an arduous trek to the southern city of Kerbala, 80 km southwest of Baghdad, for the religious rite of Arbain. An Interior Ministry source and a police official said 41 people had been killed and 106 wounded in the attack on a tent where pilgrims are given food and drink.

Millions of Shi'ites from Iraq, Iran, Bahrain and other nations have defied the threat of suicide bombings since the 2003 US-led invasion toppled the Sunni-led government of Saddam Hussein to visit Iraq's Shi'ite holy sites. Arbain marks 40 days of mourning for Hussein, the Prophet Mohammad's grandson, who died in a 7th Century battle at Kerbala. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, beating their heads and chests in ritual mourning, pour into the city for the rite. Many walk from hundreds of kilometres away. Arbain was once suppressed like other Shi'ite gatherings under Saddam. Tens of thousands of troops and police have been deployed to protect pilgrims and also around the revered Imam Hussein shrine in Kerbala. But suspected Sunni Islamist extremists, who view Shi'ite Muslims as apostates, still manage to get thro
