 Dhaka, Feb 03 (bdnews24.com) -- At least 75 people have been killed on Dhaka University campus since independence in 1971, but so far not a single person has been prosecuted for the violent deaths. The latest victim was Abu Bakar Siddique, a third-year student of Islamic history, grievously wounded during a clash between rival factions of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) at AF Rahman Hall in the early hours of Tuesday. He died on Wednesday morning. The deaths have almost all occurred during violence sparked by political rivalry, control over the campus, extortion and 'tender terror' or factional infighting. The victims include innocent university students, student front activists, hoodlums and a senior government official. DU vice-chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique said on Wednesday the university wants to emerge from the culture in which killers can avoid punishment. "The rule of law has been established (in the country). We want to establish it at Dhaka University so that such incidents don't recur," he told journalists after the death of Abu Bakar.
