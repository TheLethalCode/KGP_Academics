<TEXT>
 Thakurgaon, Feb 3(bdnews24.com)  Trial of 25 Thakurgaon border guards, accused of siding with the BDR mutineers during the bloody events at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters last February, began on Wednesday. The BDR Special Court-2, set up at the Thakurgaon 20 Rifles Battalion headquarters, convened at 10am. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam was heading a three-judge panel as the defendants were produced in court. The 25, including four junior commanding officers of Thakurgaon Rifles Battalion, are currently being held in Thakurgaon jail. Former Thakurgaon police chief Sohrab Ali filed the case last year, in which the 25 border guards are accused of expressing solidarity with the Dhaka BDR mutineers during the uprising last year. They reportedly took position in front of their camp with firearms and grenades. Taking up arms they also barricaded the main highway and fired shots in public. The Peelkhana mutineers killed more than 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary, during the Feb 25-26 mutiny. Rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty verdict, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. BDR trials are also ongoing in Feni, Satkhira and Rangmati. The Thakurgaon trial proceedings will continue on Thursday, said Lt Col Mahfuzur Rahman of 20 Rifles Battalion. bdn
