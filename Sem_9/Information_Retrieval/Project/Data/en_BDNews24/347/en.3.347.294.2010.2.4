<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh will hope to put on a better performance in the first one-day international against New Zealand at McLean Park in Napier on Friday. The match starts at 7:00 am Bangladesh time. The Tigers opened their short trip of New Zealand with an embarrassing 10-wicket Twenty20 defeat against the Black Caps in Hamilton on Wednesday. The tourists were bundled out for 78 in 17.3 overs. It was their lowest total, beating the 83 they were skittled for by Sri Lanka in the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007. The hosts required only 8.2 overs to reach the target. Bangladesh will play two more ODIs on Feb 8 and 11 before playing a one-off Test from Feb 1
