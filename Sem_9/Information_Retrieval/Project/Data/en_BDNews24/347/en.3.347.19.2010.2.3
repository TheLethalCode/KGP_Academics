 Dhaka, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com)-----Intelligence agencies have been directed to prevent suspected war criminals from fleeing the country, home minister Sahara Khatun said on Wednesday. Both the minister and state minister for home, attending a programme at Police Staff College, reiterated the Awami League government's electoral pledge to try 1971 war criminals. "War criminals must be tried. This is our electoral pledge and we must keep our promise," the home minister told the reporters after the programme. Asked if airport and land port authorities had been directed to stop suspected war criminals from fleeing, she said: "We have directed intelligence agencies to this effect." State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku said, "War criminals will not be able to flee the country as there is no route open for them." "If any criminal quits the country, he will be brought back," Tuku said, adding that the government has already shown "how convicted fugitives can be brought to book." War criminals will be tried at any cost on the soil of Bangladesh, he said. Neither senior or junior minister gave a hint on what basis the suspects would be profiled. Bangladesh has several lists of alleged war criminals from the country's 1971 independence struggle with Pakistan. Perhaps the most comprehensive being that of the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee, a group of Bangladeshi war veterans and intellectuals, published in 2008. The list contains nearly 1,600 names, including the chief of opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami, Matiur Rahman Nizami, and other party members. The group that published the list says around half of those listed are still alive. "Out of the 1,597 people on the list, 369 were Pakistani army personnel. The rest were Bangladeshi collaborators," MA Hasan of the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee said when the list was published. The Awami League government, after assuming office in January 2009, initiated the procedure to hold long-awaited trials of 1971 war criminals in line with one of its top electoral pledges. Bangladesh estimates that Pakistani occupation forces and their collaborators killed three million people and raped 200,000 women during the nine-month Liberation War in 1971. A raft of cases has been filed across the country against scores of alleged war criminals, mostly accused as collaborators, for murder, arson and looting in 1971. The government has said it is aiming to conduct internationally acceptable trials by taking advice from countries that have already been through the process. 'FRIENDLY POLICE FORCE' Wednesday's programme at Police Staff College was also attended by home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad and rector of the college Naim Ahmed. The meeting focused on ways to modernise the police force, including encouraging more people friendly behaviour "as the police have to work in closer association with people than other forces," said the home minister Police officials said the meeting also decided to introduce a master's programme at the Police Staff College from next fiscal year. Officers equivalent to additional superintendent rank will have the opportunity of studying 13 subjects on the two-year master's course titled 'Applied Criminology & Police Management' under the National University. The programme is likely to start between July-August, officials said bd
