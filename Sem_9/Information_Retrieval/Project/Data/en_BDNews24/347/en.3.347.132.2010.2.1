 Keraniganj, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)Keraniganj police said a murder suspect committed suicide in their custody in the early hours of Monday. They said that Lutfur Rahman Miah, 38, detained in connection with the torching and killing of a woman named Nazma, had hung himself in the police station's toilet. Also known as 'Manik', the suspect is the son of Addu Miah, from Munshi Nawabdah village in Kalatia union of the upazila. The police said Manik was arrested Sunday afternoon and committed suicide some time after midnight, but his father said he was arrested days ago. Keraniganj police chief Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com that Manik had been brought back to the police station at 3:30am Monday morning after the police arrested two more suspects in connection with Nazma's death. Manik killed himself at around 5:30am, Asaduzzaman said. He said police recovered Manik's body at 10.00am Monday morning after breaking open the door in the presence of magistrate, Md Al Mamun. Manik's father Addu Miah, however, told reporters that the police had picked up his son Wednesday afternoon from a plot of farmland owned by his father-in-law Nurul Islam in Sirajnagar village. Manik was a day labourer and occasional rickshaw puller, with three sons and a daughter, Addu said. Keraniganj police retrieved the burnt body of Nazma, a woman from Maniknagar under Hazratpur, on the evening of Jan 13. Nazma's sister, Mamtaz, filed a murder case and Manik was arrested as a suspect. Police chief Asaduzzaman said his men had first brought Manik in for quizzing on Wednesday, after finding his phone number in Nazma's cellphone. He said Manik was later released, though the police kept an eye on his movements. Manik was formally arrested Sunday afternoon after the police found evidence against him, the police chief said. Taking Manik with them, the police raided a number of places through Sunday night and picked up two more men Anwar Hossain, 30 and Aslam, 48, in connection with Nazma's death. Dhaka police super Iqbal Bahar told reporters after inspecting the scene of the reported suicide, "Unlike other police station toilets, this one wasn't a half-walled affair." Asked if the suicide indicated failure in police monitoring, Bahar said, "Yes, I must admit it's a failure of ours." bdnews24.c
