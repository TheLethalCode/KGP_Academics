<TITLE> UK suspends Bangladeshi student visa </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Britain has temporarily suspended student visa applications from Bangladesh. The UK Border Agency, according to a report by BBC, took this step apparently as a precaution to a surge of applications. According to reports, student visa applications from Bangladesh, Nepal and northern India, have been put on hold for at least a month for now. British officials were quoted saying that the system had been overwhelmed with the number of applications. There also concerns that many cases were not genuine. The British high commissioner in Dhaka, Stephen Evans confirmed that there was indeed a surge of applications. The rate of visa applications has increase by 1000 per cent he told bdnews24.com. But he assured that students who had applied on the last day of January would be exempted of this suspension. Robert Morini, an official of the press section, told bdnews24.com that there was sharp increase in applications. He said that the number of applications during the last three months of 2009 was 9,500. "But it was only 1,200 over the corresponding period of 2008." Director of a student counselling agency, also an approved partner of the British high commission in Dhaka, providing counselling services for prospective UK students, said he was not surprised with the suspension at all. The student counsellor said, "The UK Border Agency had relaxed its previously stringent rules for student visas last year around April or May." According to the new rules prospective applicants only had to provide a proof of funds, sufficient to cover the first year's tuition and fees, and an acceptance letter from any one of the licenses educational institutions in the UK. The problem is that many of these licensed parties are actually what they call 'visa colleges', which readily issue acceptance letters for nominal fees. The counsellor said apparently it would be applicants to these colleges that would suffer. "The reputed universities have their intakes only twice a year, not every month unlike these visa colleges." He said, genuine applicants should not have problems for a temporary suspension. The cousellor, refusing to be named in what he said was a UK government decision, also said the UKBA has cancelled licenses of about 50 such visa colleges, which would surely bring down the number of applications from Bangladesh. However, he could not be certain if the suspension of student visas would be applicable for the high commission's approved partners, that are expected to ensure due diligence and whose applications are fast-tracked. "I still have two students who were going to apply and have not yet done so. There may be such isolated genuine cases." The suspension will be reviewed in February and in the meantime there would presumably be extra monitoring of visa applications
