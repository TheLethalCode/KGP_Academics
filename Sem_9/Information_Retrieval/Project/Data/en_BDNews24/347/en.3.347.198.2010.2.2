 MOGADISHU, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali pirates released the cargo ship MV Filitsa on Monday after a ransom was delivered and the crew are safe, a regional maritime official and pirate sources said. A pirate on board the vessel told Reuters earlier they were expecting to receive $3 million (1.88 million pounds) for the Marshall Islands-flagged 23,709 dwt cargo ship, which was seized in November.

Typically, the pirates hold the captured ships and crews hostage until ransoms are paid. While hijackings in the Gulf of Aden have tapered off, "pirate activity in the Somali basin has grown and grown exponentially," one EU naval official said last week. UN officials say international naval operations and improved coordination have led to a decrease in the rate of successful pirate attacks and have raised the cost of pirate operations. Somalia has had no effective central government since 1991, one of the reasons piracy has flourished. With the aid of African Union peacekeepers, its UN-backed transitional government is struggling to pacify an Islamist insurgency. Since the start of 2007, the conflict has cost 20,000 civilian lives and uprooted more than 1.5 million people from their homes. The government is confined to a few small blocks of the capital Mogadishu and exerts little influence over the sta
