 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government plans to establish a separate ministry for population and family planning, declared the state minister for health and family planning on Thursday. Citing population as one of the major problems for Bangladesh, Mujibor Rahman Fakir said operations of a new ministry should have already commenced. "I talked to the prime minister about it and she said she would consider it while expanding the cabinet," the state minister said while speaking at a book launching ceremony on population. Rahman stressed on more awareness campaigns around the country targeting the poor and illiterate communities. In his speech, the minister spoke of his government's initiatives to improve health services, adding that the previous government's negligence to recruit doctors had virtually halted activities of some 9,000 community clinics around the country. The government is in the process of recruiting 4,133 doctors, 3,000 nurses and 6,650 health workers soon to bring more people under health service coverage, he added.
