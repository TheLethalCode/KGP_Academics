 Dinajpur, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Miners at Barapukuria coal field called off their indefinite strike on Wednesday night after they were assured of fulfilling their demand for increased bonus. Workers returned to their work Wednesday midnight as the mine authorities agreed to pay each worker Tk 4,500 as profit bonus, Robiul Islam, Barapukuria coal mine workers union president, told bdnews24.com. Barapukuria Coal Mine Company managing director Md Qamruzzaman said they had held a two-hour meeting with the striking miners and reached an understanding. Some 1,060 miners went on strike Tuesday to realise their demand. The workers had been demanding payment of a profit bonus since November 18, 2009. At a press conference held at Dinajpur Press Club on January 10 they had warned that they would go for a strike if the management failed to meet their demand by January 20. But they deferred their strike programme to allow the management to meet their demand by Febuary 1, Robiul Islam had said earlier. Barapukuria Coal Mine Company directly employs some 155 Chinese workers and employees and 198 Bangladeshis. But another 1,060 local workers are hired on a temporary basis by a Chinese contractor working for the company. bdnew
