 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Thursday indicted BNP standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy in a case for accumulating illegal wealth. Third special judge Mozammel Hossain also set March 18 for testimony on the case. Roy pleaded not guilty in court. The Anti-Corruption Commission filed the case with Ramna Police Station on January 5 last year on charge of accumulating illegal wealth worth Tk 2.68 crore and hiding his wealth information from the graft watchdog. Chargesheet was pressed against him six months after filing the case. The BNP leader on January 7 filed a petition for acquittal in the case. He had to stay behind bars for one week in last October in connection with the case.
