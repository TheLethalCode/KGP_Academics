 LUANDA, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Substitute Mohamed Nagui scored five minutes from time to hand Egypt an unprecedented third successive African Nations Cup title after a 1-0 victory over Ghana on Sunday. It was a far from impressive performance from the Egyptians but a rare attack near the end of the match gave Nagui his fifth goal of the tournament and snatched a record seventh African championship for his country.
