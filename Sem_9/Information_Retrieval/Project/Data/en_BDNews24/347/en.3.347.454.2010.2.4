<TITLE> Court dismisses SQ Chy case against home minister (CORRECTED) </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 (CORRECTED - Case was not for defamation, as in previous report, but for 'threat to personal security') Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  A judge's court on Thursday dismissed a case against home minister Sahara Khatun by BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Chowdhury filed the case last December alleging the home minister had threatened his personal security. Last month, on January 5, first executive magistrate Md Al Amin rejected the case filed by Chowdhury against the minister for calling him a Razakar (war criminal). After the rejection, Chowdhury went to Dhaka's Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court with the same complaint but judge ANM Bashirullah dismissed the case. Sahara Khatun reportedly said at a function on Dec 17 that "war criminal SQ Chowdhury will be brought to justice". Chowdhury complained in a statement that the minister's remarks had impeded due legal process and breached her oath to office as per article 148 of the constitution. No case had ever been filed against him on charges of war crimes after 1971, the statement said. The home minister also faced similar cases filed by Chowdhury in Chittagong and Bagerhat, which were dismissed by the courts. The Awami League has taken initiatives to try war criminals after coming to power a year ago. State minister for law Quamrul Islam had also said that Chowdhury would be brought to justice over war crimes allegations. "We have evidence of his (Chowdhury) war crimes in 1971. He must be tried," he said. There are long-standing allegations against Chowdhury for his role in establishing a torture camp in 1971 at his Goods Hill residence in Chittagong and of killing the Hindu owner of a local pharmacy.
