<TITLE> US intelligence chief: al Qaeda 'foremost concern' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The al Qaeda group linked to the failed Christmas Day airplane bombing is of "foremost concern" and US intelligence agencies are monitoring its capabilities, intentions and recruitment of westerners, the US intelligence chief said on Tuesday. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula appears to have directed the suspect in the botched bombing, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and provided him training and explosives, Dennis Blair, director of national intelligence, said in testimony at a Senate intelligence committee hearing. "We are still exploring the genesis of this plot and what other homeland plots AQAP and associated Yemeni extremists may have planned," Blair said. "We are concerned that they will continue to try to do so, but we do not know to what extent they are willing to direct core cadre to that effort given the group's prior focus on regional operations," he said. The group is focused on expanding its ranks and plotting in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, Blair said. Western and Arab donors met in London recently to discuss ways to help Yemen fight militant threats after the Dec. 25 botched airplane attack. Some senators expressed concern that Abdulmutallab had been afforded civilian legal rights before he could be fully interrogated about the plot. Blair responded that there should be flexibility to make decisions on a case-by-case basis about whether such suspects go through civilian or military legal process. Al Qaeda, which was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, persists in its desire to attack again on American soil, Blair said. Until al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri are dead or captured that group "will retain its resolute intent to strike the homeland," he said. GAPS SAID TO BE FIXED Blair said he was confident that gaps had been fixed since the Dec. 25 incident and that another similar suspect would be apprehended before he got on the plane. "I'm confident that someone who left the trail that Mr. Abdulmutallab did would now be found," Blair said. "What I can't tell is even with these improvements we would be able to catch someone who took more care." In an audiotape aired recently on Al Jazeera television, a man purporting to be bin Laden praised Abdulmutallab and vowed more strikes at the United States. Bin Laden has eluded a US manhunt and authorities believe he has been hiding in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. "My greatest concern, and what keeps me awake at night, is that al Qaeda and its terrorist allies and affiliates could very well attack the United States," CIA Director Leon Panetta said at the same hearing. The biggest threat is not necessarily another attack similar to Sept. 11, but that al Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways often difficult to detect, he said. Al Qaeda is trying to strike the United States by deploying individuals to the country, and the concern is the group will use people with "clean credentials" who don't have a history of terrorism such as Abdulmutallab who had a visa, Panetta said. "I think they're going to be looking for other opportunities like that," he s
