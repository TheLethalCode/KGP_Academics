<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Abdul Jalil on Thursday urged the BNP to take up the challenge by Sheikh Selim and prove that its founder Gen Ziaur Rahman's dead body was buried at the parliament premises. The prime minister's cousin Selim on February 2 challenged the main opposition to come up with evidence that slain president Ziaur Rahman's body was laid to rest at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. He said that nobody including family members had seen the dead body of Zia, who was killed in a failed military coup in Chittagong on May 31 1981, when he was buried. Zia's corpse was thrown in the Bay of Bengal, said Selim, an Awami League presidium member. "Senior Awami League MP Sheikh Selim has made a proposal (to the BNP). If you have the courage take up the challenge," Jalil told parliament Thursday, while delivering his speech on the president's address. "Let people know what was placed in the so called majar or grave," said the former general secretary of the ruling Awami League Jalil who was punished for his outspoken comments on prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Jalil asked the opposition to come to parliament and criticise the government, including prime minister's recent India visit, there.
