 Rangamati, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  Activists loyal to Santu Larma on Saturday demonstrated in the hilly town of Rangamati to protest an attack on the chairman of Regional Council. They also demanded the United People's Democratice Front (UPDF) be banned. UPDF, which opposes the 1997 peace treaty between the government and the Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), has been blamed by the Sanghati Samity for Wednesday's attack on Larma and Chakma king Debashish Roy. The PCJSS leaders, speaking at a rally, claimed that UPDF was an 'undemocratic, communal and terrorist' organisation. They said that the latter had condemned the historic treaty calling it a 'black' chapter in their struggle. Santu (Jyotirindra Bodhipriya) Larma and Roy were travelling in the same motorcade on their way from Rangamati to Khagrachhari when their cars came under attack. Unidentified gunmen opened fire on Larma's car. bdn
