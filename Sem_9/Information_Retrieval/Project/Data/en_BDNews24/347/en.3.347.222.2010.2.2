 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Wednesday for an order on petitions filed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and son Tarique Rahman to stay proceedings of the Zia Orphanage Trust case. The bench of justice Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and justice Md Abdur Razzaque set the date Tuesday. Meanwhile, a trial court has set March 3 for framing charges in the graft case. The case, filed with the Ramna police station on July 3, 2008, accuses Khaleda, Tarique and four others of embezzling more than Tk 20 million from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. The charge sheet was submitted on Aug 5 that year. Others who were accused, include late president Ziaur Rahman's nephew Mominur Rahman, former bureaucrat Dr Kamaludddin Siddiqui and former BNP MP Quazi Salimul Haq. The metropolitan sessions judge's court took cognisance of the case last September. Khaleda, leader of the opposition, and a two-time former prime minister, and Tarique, senior vice-chairman of BNP, have both received bail in the case. Tarique is currently receiving medical treatment in the UK. b
