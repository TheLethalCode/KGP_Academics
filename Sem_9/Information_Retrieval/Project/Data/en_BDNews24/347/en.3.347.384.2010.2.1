 HAITI, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)-- 10 Americans face a court hearing in Port-au-Prince on Monday after their arrest on suspicion of trafficking children. Arrested for trying to smuggle Haitian children out of the country. Americans from a Christian charity unload their vehicle under the watchful gaze of the Haitian police. The five men and five women were detained while trying to cross into the Dominican Republic after Haitian police conducted a routine search of their vehicle. They discovered 33 children, aged two to 12 inside. The Americans said the children were being taken abroad for adoption - but the authorities said the group had no documents to prove this. (SOUNDBITE) (French) HAITIAN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, ARAMICK LOUIS, SAYING: "The government has given instructions that are very clear about the adoptions, everything has to be done in a formal way and with the international organisations."

The authorities will have to decide whether the group's actions were misguided, but well-intentioned or if there was something more sinister. The children are now in the care of an internationally-run orphanage on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. The director, George Willard said the children arrived in a poor state of health. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DIRECTOR OF SOS CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE, GEORGE WILLARD, SAYING: "They were hungry, they were thirsty, and the little baby was really dehydrated which means we brought him immediately to the hospital, otherwise it would not have been true that he would have survived tonight." The arrests have sparked fears that child traffickers could try to exploit the post-quake chaos, which it's feared has left tens of thousands of orphaned and displaced children. Last month, the Haitian government put the brake on many kinds of adoptions after concerns that countless numbers of children with living relatives may have been flown out of the coun
