<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 04 (bdnews24.com)  The government is inviting pre-qualification tenders by February-end for installing four duel-fuel power plants, which will generate a total of 800-megawatt electricity, an energy ministry official said on Thursday. The plants are Bhola phase-II (150 mw), Bibiyana phase-II (450 mw), Savar (100 mw) and Kaliakoir (100 mw). Secretary Abul Kalam Azad told a press conference at the ministry that the government had also taken initiatives to set up coal-based power plants as adequate supply of gas could not be ensured. He said pre-qualification tenders would also be invited in July for setting up four coal-based power plants in Chittagong, Mongla (Bagerhat), Meghnaghat (Narayanganj) and Jajira, each having 500 mw generation capacity. Prime minister's power and energy adviser Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury, who led the team that recently arranged road-shows in the UK, USA and Singapore to attract investors to Bangladesh's power sector, also addressed the press conference. He said entrepreneurs from the three countries had showed their interest in investing in the power sector. "We tried to make the entrepreneurs convince that Bangladesh's economic condition is stable, remittance flow sound and inflation rate under control," the adviser said. Referring to government's plan to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), he said a team of experts would visit Bangladesh next month to see the feasibility of building an LNG terminal, which is needed before importing LNG. Chowdhury said Bangladeshi officials discussed $5 billion investment for 11 projects during the road-shows with prospective entrepreneurs that include both foreign nationals and non-resident Bangladeshis. He said representatives from 70 firms from the UK, 55 from the US and 88 from Singapore attended the road-shows. Currently Bangaldesh's daily electricity generation ranges from 3800 mw to 4000 mw against the estimated demand for 5500 mw.
