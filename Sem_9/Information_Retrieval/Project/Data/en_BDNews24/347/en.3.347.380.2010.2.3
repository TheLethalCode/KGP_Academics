 Dhaka, Feb 2 (bdnews24.com)  Amnesty International on Tuesday condemned the "hasty executions" of five former army officers found guilty of the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "Transparency was needed over their hasty executions", the UK-based global rights watchdog said in a statement, adding a note of concern over the safety of family members of the convicts. Amnesty also pointed out that the execution of these five men will make extradition of the other convicts in the case highly unlikely as there is a high risk that they, too, would be executed. Six other men sentenced to death in their absence in the same case are living outside Bangladesh, and the government is seeking their extradition The five death-row convicts were hanged between midnight and 1am on Jan 28, within hours of their last-chance review petitions being dismissed by the Supreme Court. The human rights agency said it opposes the execution of these five men, which "should never have taken place". Amnesty said the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members were grave human rights abuses, and those who committed them should be brought to justice. However, bringing people to justice must not in itself violate the human rights of the accused, said the rights watchdog that opposes the death penalty on principle. Quoting local media in Bangladesh, the statement also said family members of the convicts live in fear of being attacked by activists of the ruling Awami League. Amnesty cited a report of AL activists attacking the Manikganj family home of Aziz Pasha, one of the 12 men sentenced to death for killing Sheikh Mujib, on January 31. The attackers reportedly looted and set the house on fire. Pasha is said to have died as a fugitive outside Bangladesh but his brother lives in the family house in Tetra village, Harirampur Upazila. Amnesty called on the government of prime minister Sheikh Hasina to publicly condemn any such attacks and bring anyone involved to justice. b
