<TITLE> BNP counters PM on BDR mutiny </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP on Sunday protested against prime minister Sheikh Hasina's suggestive comments at the extended meeting of the ruling Awami League on Saturday. BNP leaders refuting Hsina's remarks came up with counter allegations directed at the prime minister and her party leaders over the BDR rebellion. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain made the protest at a hurried press conference on Sunday at the party's Naya Paltan central office and dismissed Hasina's statements as 'false' and 'fabricated'. Hasina had hinted at BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman, a newly appointed senior vice chairman of the party, were involved in the bloody rebellion of the Bangladesh border guards on Feb 25-26 last year, which left over 50 army officers killed. The prime minister had claimed that it was rather interesting that Tarique, living abroad at that time, called his mother the previous day and told her not to stay at the cantonment residence. But Mosharraf came up with counter allegations that the investigation of the matter was still underway and it was the prime minister and her party leaders that were still under suspicion. He also said that the government was acting fascist and trying to subdue dissent and opposition across the country. The BNP leader said Hasina had made the suggestive comments only as an extension of the ruling party's propaganda. "Hasina made fabricated claims about Khaleda Zia and our senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman (Saturday)." He reitereated his previous allegations that AL had not been able to discard their 'one-party rule' mentality and was using the administration to suppress dissent and opposition. He also alleged that the ruling party was exploiting its authority using the detective agencies for political work. Standing committee member M K Anwar complained that even after one year of the BDR incident, there has been no charge sheet. "Instead 40 BDR members were killed. The two probe reports were also not publicised."
