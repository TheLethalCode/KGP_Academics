<TEXT>
 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, February 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bhutan has begun using a newly agreed trade route through India's north-eastern region to export its products to Bangladesh, significantly reducing distance, travel time and transportation cost. Three trucks with a consignment of approximately 8300 kilograms of Bhutanese oranges entered Sylhet on Tuesday after crossing the Indo-Bangla border at Dawki in India's north-eastern state of Meghalaya. This was the first consignment that Bhutan exported to Bangladesh after New Delhi, Dhaka and Thimpu last month agreed upon the new transit route through north-eastern India using Dawki-Tamabil Land Custom Stations. Bhutanese exporters have so far been using the much longer route through Siliguri in India's West Bengal state for transporting goods to Bangladesh. Lungpa Tantin, the general secretary of Bhutan Exporters Association, said the new route had considerably lessened the distance that the consignments had to travel from the Himalayan kingdom to Bangladesh. Tantin said that the trucks had earlier had to travel around 430 km from eastern Bhutan via West Bengal to reach Bangladesh. The new route has brought down the distance to just 280 kms, good news for exporters of perishable items. The transportation cost had come down accordingly, he added. Bhutan produces an average 100,000 tonnes of oranges annually. Bangladesh has been a major market for the orange growers of Bhutan. Tantin said that the demand for Bhutanese oranges was rising in Bangladesh. The new trade route through north-eastern India would help the orange growers to access the market in Bangladesh faster, he added. He said that Bhutanese exporters were keen to use the new trade route to transport ginger and other agro-products to Bangladesh too. Dawki is a small town on the India-Bangladesh border. Tamabil is the adjacent town in Bangladesh. New Delhi and Dhaka recently agreed to upgrade facilities in the Dawki-Tamabil Land Custom Station. Norbu Wangdi, the general secretary of Bhutan-India Friendship Association, said that not only the exporters of Bhutan, but the residents living on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border would also be benefited if the facilities in the Dawki-Tamabil Land Custom Station are upgraded for large-scale export of goods from Bhutan to Bangladesh.
