 Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)  Police detained seven leaders and members of pro-opposition student wing Jatiyabadi Chhatra Dal from Dhaka University on Monday as they were reportedly protesting prime minister Sheikh Hasina's presence on campus. The prime minister was inaugurating the Amar Ekushey Book Fair at Bangla Academy, when police detained the protesting JCD activists from the Teacher Student Centre around 3:30pm. Amena Begum, sub inspector of Shahbag Police Station, said the arrestees included deputy secretaries of the central committee, Selina Sultana Nishita and Shawkat Ara Urmi, and central committee members Shahinun Nargis and Moushumi Nasrin. The police official, however, could not give details as to why they were arrested. Assistant general secretary of JCD central committee Salma Sultana Shoma told bdnews24.com, "Chhatra League workers attacked us at the TSC where we were protesting the prime minister's visit. After that the police came and took away a number of our leaders and members." Leaders of opposition BNP, including Jainal Abedin Faruk and Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie, went to Shahbag Police Station in the afternoon and demanded release of the detained student activists. bdnews2
