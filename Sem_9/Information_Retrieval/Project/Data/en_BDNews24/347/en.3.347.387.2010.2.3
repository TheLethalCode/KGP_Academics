<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 03 (bdnews24.com)Parliament Wednesday passed a bill to increase the retirement age of freedom fighter civil servants by two years. All civil servants in Bangladesh have retired at 57 to date. From now on, the civil servants, who fought the War of Independence in 1971, will retire at the age of 59 instead of 57. Local government minister, in charge of the establishment ministry in parliament, proposed passage of the bill and the House cleared the same by voice vote. The lone opposition MP Fazlul Azim (independent) made some amendments to the bill, but his proposals were rejected by voice vote. Azim also urged the House to increase the age of other civil servants. "If the retirement age of the civil servants is increased, the retirement age of freedom fighter civil servants will be raised by two more years," Syed Ashraful Islam told parliament prompting the MPs to applaud his statement. The bill proposes that the public freedom-fighter servants, who went to leave preparatory to retirement (LPR) just before introduction of the new section of the bill, will be re-appointed. Agriculture minister Begum Matia Chowdhury, in absence of Islam, tabled the bill in parliament on Jan 27. President Zillur Rahman on Dec 13 last year promulgated an ordinance to increase the retirement age of the freedom fighter civil servants. Earlier, the cabinet approved the bill for passage in parliament.
