 Madaripur, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain sternly cautioned the media at an opulent reception in his honour in Madaripur on Sunday. Venting his anger for publishing reports of the sumptuous reception, Hossain said there would be 20 more such ceremonies in different unions. He said addressing the national media he was very disappointed with the report published in newspapers over the last two days. "Beware that this does not happen again," he pronounced. He said that no one would get away publishing false news. The communications minister, however, implicitly acknowledged that the reception in his honour had been too lavish when he said that 'it could have been a little more modest'. Taking their cue from the minister, most of the other speakers at the reception also criticised the media. Some went as far as to term the media a 'bunch of conspirators'. Hossain announced that if the situation remained normal then the government would float the tender for Padma Bridge within a month or two. He claimed that there had already been pledges for about Tk 14,000 crore for the project. The public function at Kalkini Sadr's Syed Abul Hossain College premises was presided over by upazila Awami League president Tahmina Siddique. The grand reception was held to mark Hossain's visit to the area 13 months after he won the national elections. A number of newspapers reported that the expenditure for this reception amounted to almost Tk 10 million on lighting, decoration, food, posters and other paraphernelia. It was also reported that the minister had in fact expressed his desire that he be given such a reception. bdnews
