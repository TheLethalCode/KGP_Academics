 Panchagarh, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Panchgarh, formed to try the accused rebel border guards, has set April 4 for framing charges against them. The special court, set up at the 25 Rifles Battalion headquarters, began at 9:10am and continued for an hour and twenty minutes. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam headed the three-judge panel. The 29 border guards accused of rebellion were produced from Panchagarh jail. Prosecutor and 25 Rifles Battalion commanding officer, Lt Col Serazul Haque presented charges against the 29 BDR personnel, accused of siding with the BDR mutineers during the bloody events at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka last February. Trial of the border guards of Panchagarh region started on Wednesday. Panchagarh sadar police chief Md Jamiruddin filed the case against 22 BDR members including deputy assistant director Nazmul Huda Chowdhury. Chowdhury was made accused in the case for his inaction during the mutiny. At Wednesday's proceeding, he was dropped from the list following an appeal of the complainant. Eight more BDR personnel were arrested and sent to jail on Wednesday. The Peelkhana mutineers killed more than 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, during the Feb 25-26 mutiny. Rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country in those two days. The accused border guards of Panchagarh reportedly fired shots and took position of the Dhaka-Panchagarh highway. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty verdict, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, loot and arson. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. BDR trials are also ongoing in Feni, Satkhira, Thakurgaon and Rangmati. bd
