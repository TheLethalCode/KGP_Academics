 Jahangirnagar University, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  The president, backed by the chief justice of the country, has lent credence to widespread criticism that quality of education in Bangladesh has gone down alarmingly. "Are we not being able to maintain the previous standard of education? Or is it that we are unable to keep pace with the advancement of knowledge, science and technology in the world?" Md Zillur Rahman said, speaking at the convocation of Jahangirnagar University Saturday. "Questions are being raised from all quarters," he said, "Our universities are lagging behind in international rankings." Justice Md Tafazzul Islam, the head of the judiciary, also gave vent to his frustration. "It's just not the buildings that make up a university. Both prisons and classrooms have concrete walls around them, but one keeps you captive and the other sets you free," the chief justice said. The justice reminded the students of the expectations of them, saying "so much is invested by the nation" to provide for the few getting "the highest institutional education". Thousands of students assembled at the pavilion at the university's central field at around 10:30am, in their ceremonial garb. Vice-chancellor Sharif Enamul Kabir led the procession that started at 11:30am. The university professors were in the first part of the procession while the president brought up the rear. Zillur Rahman handed over certificates and medals and presided over the programme. Sixteen students received gold medals. Of them, four got Mofassil Uddin Ahmed Trust Fund medals, four Dr Surat Ali Khan medals, two Sharfuddin Ahmed medals and six received Asadul Kabir medals. Four received Mofassil Uddin Ahmed Trust fund, for postgraduate philosophy students. They are Muhammad Bashir Uddin (2003), Nasrin Sultana (2004), Md Shahidul Islam (2005) and Mahmuda Akhand (2006). Surat Ali Khan gold medalists are Tapati Basak (Statistics 2000), Mohammad Al-Amin (Chemistry 2001), Monirul Hasan Masum (Business Administration 2002) and Arafat Rahman (Business Administration 2003). Monirul Hasan Masum (2002) and Arafat Rahman (2003) from Business Administration got the Sharfuddin Ahmed gold medal after getting the highest mark in all subjects (not less than 75 percent).
