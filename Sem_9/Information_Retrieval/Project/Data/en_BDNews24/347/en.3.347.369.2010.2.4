<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 4 (bdnews24.com)  Fourth session of the ninth parliament resumed at 3:20pm on Thursday with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. Main opposition BNP is expected to join Thursday's session depending on its decision at a meeting scheduled later in the day. The BNP parliamentary party is expected to hold a meeting later in the afternoon to decide on their participation. The main opposition attended the first session of the ninth parliament but has been boycotting since the second session due to a row over seating arrangment. The party has remained absent for 61 days. Absence in 90 consecutive working days of the parliament automatically results in cancellation of membership in the house.
