 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Fire fighters took a bout two hours to douse a fire that broke out at the underground level of the Palli Bhaban tower in the capital's Karwan Bazar on Sunday afternoon, a senior fire service official said. The basement of the 11-storey building of the Bangladesh Rural Development Board caught fire at around 2:30pm with great clouds of smoke billowing from the site. Seven fire units rushed to the scene at the city centre. No major casualties were reported. Brig Gen Abu Naeem Md Shahidullah, director general of the fire service, said an explosion was heard just before the fire broke out. He also said there was an electric transmitter in the basement of the building. "But it is too early to tell if the blast of the electric transmitter had anything to do with the fire." The blaze came under control at around 4:30pm, Maj Sheikh Mohamad Shahjalal, director (operations) of fire service headquarters, told reporters. "The fire did not spread to other floors, but people became panicked seeing plumes of smoke," BRDB managing director Humayun Khalid said. Fire fighters evacuated six people from the rooftop. Other people, who remained stranded on other floors, were also evacuated by external ladder. State minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak went to the scene on hearing news of the blaze. He told reporters that a five-member probe committee had been formed with LGRD joint secretary (development) Abdul Mannan as head. Meanwhile, in a separate fire incident, Motijheel police sub-inspector Nazmul Hassan said a fire broke out at the head office of National Credit and Commerce Bank almost at the same time. Government spokesperson Anwar Hossain said the fire at the headquarters of the state-run commercial bank had not been serious and staff had put it out before firefighters arrived. bd
