<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)A young Bangladeshi cabbie has made headlines in the United States for his exemplary honesty, in a tale of the Big Apple that recalls a near-legendary feat of integrity by another Bangladeshi three years ago. Asadauzzaman Mukul, a cab driver in New York City, found $10,000 in his taxi outside Penn Station in downtown Manhattan left behind by an elderly passenger on Christmas Eve. After discovering the bounty Mukul, 28, went the extra mile searching for the forgetful passenger Felicia Letteri, an Italian grandma, who was visiting relatives in New York City. Mukul spent hours driving back and forth to Long Island from downtown Manhattan. He made nearly two round trips that night, and waited outside an empty house in between, before he finally found Mrs Littieri. "It was so beautiful, so kind," a grateful Lettieri, 72, told the New York Post this week when she finally got back her lost loot. Mukul, a Bangladesh native and pre-med student from Queens, said that he didn't mind spending three hours searching for her. What was most remarkable about Mukul, who drives a cab to pay for his tuition and living expenses, was that he refused to accept any reward money. "When I was 5 years old, my mother told me, 'Be honest, work hard and you will raise your station,' " the cabbie told the Post. The news of Mukul's honesty, broadcast on television, has traveled across the US, rightfully allowing Bangladeshi Americans to feel pride in the storyand not for the first time. In a similar tale three years agobut with rather a larger amount at stakeanother Bangladeshi cab driver in the Big Apple returned a lost bag containing $500,000 worth of diamond rings to their rightful owner. Osman Chowdhury's now-legendary honesty hit the headlines around the world in February 2007, and made the 41-one year-old cabbie an instant celebrity.
