<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Mahela Jayawardene compiled a match-winning innings to help Sri Lanka clinch the Idea Cup tri-series final against India at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. He remained undefeated on 71 off 81 balls as the islanders overhauled India's 245 all out with nine balls to spare (249-6). With wickets tumbling around him, the Lankan mainstay stood tall hitting only five boundaries. Fittingly, he brought up the winning runs with two successive boundaries off Sreesanth. and The job completed, he exulted by pumping his fists. It was a sweet revenge after losing to the same opponents in their backyard. Though the dew didn't play factor in the chase, the result maintained the sequence of the team chasing a target to come out on top in the tournament. Kumar Sangakkara (55 off 51 balls) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (49) were the other main scorers. Harbhajan Singh grabbed two wickets for India. Earlier, Suresh Raina's brilliant century rescued India before they were dismissed for 245 in 48.2 overs. Raina scored 106 off 115 balls with 10 fours and a six. He was involved in a 106-run sixth-wicket stand with Ravindra Jadeja (38) after the side slumped to 60-5 after being sent into bat. The right-handed Raina eventually fell when attempting to slog Chanaka Welegedara. He joined an elite group of highest Indian scorers at No 6 when he nudged the ball for two runs to achieve the three-figure mark. Tillakaratne Dilshan ended the century-stand when he trapped Jadeja lbw. Nuwan Kulasekara bagged 4-48 while Welegedara took three for 53. MS Dhoni's men made the worst possible start when they lost Gautam Gambhir in the first over after the ball hit the protruding thigh pad and ricocheted on to the leg stump. In the next over Virat Kohli went after a widish delivery and was caught behind. Then an out-of-form Yuvraj Singh was caught at first slip chasing a rising ball to leave India 16-3 in four overs. After 10 overs, the Indians were 58-4. The skipper was caught behind while going for the drive. Much was expected of Virender Sehwag , who was rested for the last two games, and for a while he was looking good on 42 of just 27 balls with seven fours. But Sehwag fell trying to run the ball through third man and only managed to be caught behind. India were back to full strength with the inclusion of Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh, but there was no space for Sudeep Tyagi who, despite his good displays, was pushed aside by the experience of Zaheer Khan. Dinesh Karthik and Amit Mishra were expectedly benched for their more illustrious counterparts. Sri Lanka made one change, which Sangakkara emphasised was not a reflection of the rookie's performances, but out went Suranga Lakmal for Nuwan Kulasekara. This final was the 121st ODI between India and Sri Lanka, a record for most matches played between two teams. It was also the 22nd game between the teams in less than 19 mo
