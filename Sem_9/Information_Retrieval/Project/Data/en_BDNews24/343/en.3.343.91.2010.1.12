 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)India's National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will develop one of the two proposed 1320 MW coal-fired power projects at Khulna and Chittagong as a joint venture with Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB). The NTPC and BPDB will cooperate on preparation of feasibility report for both the projects. The first meeting of the Joint Steering Committee for cooperation in Power Sector between India and Bangladesh was held on Tuesday and it decided that the NTPC would be offered to carry out technical assessment for BPDB's old thermal power stations for efficiency improvement, renovation and modernization. To immediately start cooperation between the two companies, the NTPC offered to take up the operation and maintenance of power stations in Bangladesh on nomination and on cost plus basis. The meeting was jointly chaired by Indian Power Secretary H S Brahma and his Bangladeshi counterpart Mohamed Abul Kalam Azad. It was the first meeting after Brahma and Azad signed a Memorandum of Understanding for bilateral cooperation between India and Bangladesh at the end of delegation-level talks between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Monday. The grid inter-connection between the two countries topped the agenda of the meet on Tuesday; as India agreed to supply 250 MW of power from its central grid to Bangladesh. The Joint Technical Team of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and BPDB and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) have already worked out a tentative cost estimate for grid inter-connection and it stands at approximately Indian Rupees 869.21 crore, including INR 708.88 crore for the Bangladesh portion and INR 160.33 crore for the Indian portion. The PGCIL will finance for the work to be done on the Indian side. Bangladesh has requested PGCIL to act as a consultant on a nomination basis to assist in project execution since the work related to HVDC is being done for the first time in Bangladesh. The cost of consultancy will be borne by Government of Bangladesh. It was decided that PGCIL should associate the engineers of PGCB in execution of the project so that the Bangladeshi officials could gain experience. According to a press-release issued by the Ministry of Power of the Indian Government, the NTPC would provide training to power professionals of the BPDB. To start with, it was decided, the BPDB could consider using the existing training modules of NTPC and depute some of their professional for development. Simultaneously, a long term plan should be prepared by the NTPC for BPDB to utilize training facilities of the Indian companies through tailor-made programmes to be organized in India and Bangladesh. It was agreed that a Joint Technical Team shall be constituted with equal representation from NTPC and BPDP within a week to firm up the detailed modalities and framework for cooperation. Brahma told journalists that India would supply about 250 MW power supply from its national grid through the proposed inter-connector between the two countries. He said that government of Bangladesh and BPDB could explore possibilities of sourcing the power from IPPs/ Merchant plants subject to the prevailing policies of both the governments. It was decided that second Joint Steering Committee would be held tentatively in Bangladesh in February, 2010.
