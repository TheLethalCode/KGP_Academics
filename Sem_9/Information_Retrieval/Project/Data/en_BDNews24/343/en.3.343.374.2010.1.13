<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, on the last day of her visit to India, said Dhaka and Delhi were entering a new era of friendship. Hasina started for home from Jaipur Wednesday afternoon after completing the four-day trip, her first state visit to India since coming to power a year ago. She boarded a special Biman Bangladesh aircraft at around 3:25pm local time. Rajasthan's chief minister Ashok Gehlot saw her off at the airport. Hasina had flown to Jaipur in the morning to offer prayers at the shrine of Sufi Mainuddin Chishti in Ajmeer. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, before flying to Ajmeer, Hasina said her visit to India marked the beginning of a new era of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. She also stressed Dhaka and Delhi should continue to enhance cooperation for combating the menace of terrorism. Expressing her apprehension that many Bangladeshi outlaws were hiding in India, the visiting prime minister said that the two countries were in engaged in discussions on signing a formal extradition treaty to tackle terrorism. Hasina also reiterated that her government would not let the territory of Bangladesh be used for any activities against India. Asked about the tardy progress in talks on river water sharing, she said that the two countries had no discussion on this issue since 2002 until her government came to power last year. She pointed out that her Awami League government had resumed the long-stalled talks with New Delhi on the complex issue of sharing river water between the two countries. Hasina said that Bangladesh and India would also explore the areas of cooperation in the field of agriculture. She said that her visit marked the beginning of cooperation too on railways, adding that the rail sector had long been neglected. Hasina's party, the Awami League, has prepared a massive reception in the capital to welcome her home. BNP, the main opposition in Bangladesh, however, have criticised the various deals, MoUs and plans that Hasina made with India, saying they brought no gains for the country.
