 Savar, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Dhamrai Government Degree College withdrew their blockade from the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Dhamrai on Wednesday after Roads and Highways Department started building speed breakers on the road. Dhamrai police chief Alamgir Hossain said the agitating students lifted their blockade as soon as R&H workers started their work. Students had blocked the highway since morning demanding for raising speed breakers at Dhamrai Bus Stand after the death of a fellow student in a road crash three days ago. Hundreds of vehicles had been stranded on both sides of the highway since morning due to the blockade, witnesses said. Last Sunday, Murad Hossain, an HSC student, was killed on the highway when a speeding bus knocked him down. The agitating students said the authorities had earlier assured them of building speed breakers on the highway but were yet to put them in place. bdn
