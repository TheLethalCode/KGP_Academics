<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Sunday is the 38th homecoming anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after Bangladesh gained its independence. His daughter, prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid wreaths at the Bangabandhu portrait at Dhanmondi's Road 32 in the morning. She paid tribute again as Awami League president along with other party leaders. President Zillur Rahman and the prime minister issued separate messages marking Homecoming Day. The president in his speech expressed deep respect to the late leader, and said, "On this day, the architect of independent Bangladesh and father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led our war of liberation and struggled for independence, returned to a sovereign homeland after being freed from Pakistani prison." He expressed his strong belief that the country's independence and sovereignty would remain constant if the ideals of Sheikh Mujib are followed and ended his message with the urge for all to unite to build a happy and prosperous Bangladesh. The prime minister, in her message, urged united effort to building a prosperous and developed country for the people, and said, "After the (1975) assassination of Bangabandhu, the usurpers of power had killed democracy, and stopped progress and development." "The path to trial of Bangabandhu's assassination was thwarted through promulgating an ordinance," said Hasina, one of Sheikh Mujib's two surviving daughters. "Breaking all shackles of conspiracies, the journey to democracay has begun again. The Awami League government formed through the people's massive mandate has been working relentlessly to materialise its election pledges  the Charter for Change." Her message ended with a call for everyone to vow to "build a non-communal, democratic and welfare country" on Homecoming Day. Various programmes have been organised by Awami League, Sheikh Mujib's party, and its associate organisations to mark the day at the central office of the party, Tungipara and party offices around the country. A programme will be held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre at 3pm, which will be attended by Hasina. On this day in 1972, Sheikh Mujib made a triumphal return to the new-born state from jail in Pakistan, where he was held during the war that brought Bangladesh into existence in Dec. 1971. The Pakistan army arrested Mujib on the night of March 25 1971 just after his declaration of the independence of Bangladesh. Bangabandhu or 'friend of Bangladesh', as he is fondly called, returned home from the Pakistani jail via London and New Delhi, hence the day is known as Homecoming Day. bd
