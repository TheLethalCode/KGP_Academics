 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)The government will table in parliament the vested property return bill and the Criminal Procedure Code amendment bill when it reconvenes on Monday after six-day recess. As per parliamentary tradition, the House was adjourned on Jan 4 after president Zillur Rahman's New Year speech in line with constitutional guidelines. Land minister Rezaul Karim Hira will introduce the The Vested Property Return (Amendment) Bill 2010 aimed at returning confiscated property of the Hindus who left then East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during the Indo-Pak war in 1965. The bill will pave the way for the government to return the property to the rightful owners and Bangladeshi citizens. Hindus have been demanding return of the properties as influential people, whatever their political ideologies, have grabbed them since 1965. The Pakistan government in 1965 promulgated an ordinance declaring the minority Hindus' wealth as "enemy property" and confiscated the same. The will reactivate a previous law to the same effect, which was passed by the Awami League on April 11, 2001. The previous Awami League administration, just before its exit from power in 2001, tabled the new law, fixing a 180-day time limit to prepare a list of properly documented vested properties in order to take steps to restore falsely seized lands. The subsequent BNP government, however, by the end of 2001, amended the bill replacing the 180-day deadline with an 'indefinite period'. The list was never completed. Law minister Shafique Ahmed will initiate proposed amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to guarantee greater press freedom, by curtailing arrest warrants against journalists in defamation cases. As per section 500 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1898, the government can issue warrant order on journalists including editors for publishing "defamatory" pieces. The amendment bill will replace the word "warrant" with "summons" which will stop harassment of journalists either by the government or influential people.
