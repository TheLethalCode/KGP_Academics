 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)The law ministry has given its opinion on the presidential clemency petitions, it had received from the home ministry, of three of the five former army officers, convicted and sentenced to death for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "We have received the three petitions from the home ministry and sent them back to the ministry giving our opinions," law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat on Monday. The summary of the petitions will go to the prime minister, who will forward them to the president. Asked about the opinions of the his ministry, Ahmed said: "Since it is very confidential it will not be wise to reveal. "The death convicts usually do not get clemency. The people involved with the heinous act of killing Bangabandhu and his family members cannot be forgiven." Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin have submitted clemency petitions while two other convicted killers, Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had not sought clemency yet but would file review petitions with the Supreme Court. On whether the two would be allowed to seek clemency after the ruling of review petitions, the law minister said: "The decision will be taken after the court ruling." The minister refuted allegations that the three convicted killers were forced to put their signatures in the clemency petitions. "There is no truth in such information. We did not press anybody for anything. A certain quarter is spreading them," he added. Family and legal counsel of Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin said on Sunday they knew nothing about the clemency pleas. Lawyer for the two, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, that day filed review petitions for his clients. He questioned the process of submission of the petitions. "It is mandatory that lawyers and relatives should be present while mercy petitions are submitted. But we do not know anything of them." The Supreme Court, in a long-pending judgment, rejected appeals of the five convicted killers on Nov 19 last year, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3 this year, Dhaka district and sessions judge sent signed death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. The condemned men had seven days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. b
