 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina leaves Sunday for a greatly anticipated trip to India, her first state visit to the neighbouring country since coming to power for a second time last year. New Delhi has said it is "eagerly looking forward" to the tour. The two sides are expected to step up bilateral cooperation in a number of key areas with security high on the agenda. Hasina and Indian premier Manmohan Singh are due to sign three deals, on trans-border crimes, and an MOU on power during the official three-day tour. But their talks will also prominently focus on cooperation in areas of trade, communications and infrastructure. Another issue of mutual interest to hit the headlines recently, with secretary-level water talks just concluded, is sharing of the Teesta waters. Some accord on this may be reached but a final deal is unlikely. Indications are there that the visit might not make any breakthrough on trickier issues like Asian Highway routes, India's proposed Tipaimukh Dam on the Barak river in Manipur, or the maritime boundary dispute, though New Delhi sources say India may push for an 'early resolution' on the latter. EYES ON SECURITY Three bilateral agreements on security, all ready for inking, are an Agreement for Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, Agreement of Transfer of Sentenced Persons and an Agreement on Combating International Terrorism, Organized Crime and Illegal Drug Trafficking, made ready by home secretaries of the two neighbours. Dhaka has said that the agreements will formalise prisoner exchanges between the two countries among other anti-crime measures. Dhaka and Delhi, however, already agreed to redouble efforts to locate criminals under Interpol Red Corner Notices in either country at the 10th home secretary level talks between India and Bangladesh in December. Identifying the growing menace of extremism and terrorism in South Asia as an "area of concern" for both India and Bangladesh, the two sides also agreed to take immediate action "based on real time and actionable information", which has already led to enhanced cooperation against terrorism and cross-border crime, in the lead up to Hasina's visit. TRADE, POWER, INFRA Bangladesh is seeking all-important duty-free market access for 232 products to India. A highly-placed official said that India had already removed from its negative list 47 items for the benefit of Bangladesh. To help Bangladesh improve the quality of the products to be exported to India, New Delhi has offered training to the officials of the Bangladesh Standard and Training Institute (BSTI). Hasina is also likely to hold a re-evaluating discussion the already approved power importation deal with India. The two sides are expected to sign an MOU on power, which looks at comprehensive power cooperation and will open up the sector for mutual benefits. The two sides will be looking into power grid interconnectivity and exchange of power. Sources close to the Indian foreign ministry said that New Delhi is also set to offer Dhaka credit line for several infrastructure and development projects in Bangladesh during Hasina's visit. The credit extended by New Delhi will be used in railway projects and for supply of locomotives, coaches and buses and some other infrastructure projects in Bangladesh. In addition, India might also want a railway-link between Akhaura and Agartala  the capital in northeastern Indian State of Tripura. The details of the bilateral cooperation in the railway sector are likely to be finalised when Indian Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee calls on Hasina on January 12. Banerjee is also expected to be present when the prime minister will hold delegation-level talks with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on the previous day. CORRIDORS Bangladesh signed transit agreements with Nepal and Bhutan in 1976 and 1980 respectively, which could not be activated due to lack of complementary deals with India to let its territories be used by the neighbours. Hasina, during her visit, will negotiate with India to allow Nepal and Bhutan access to use Bangladesh's Mongla port for greater trade ties, on which New Delhi appears willing, having made corridor offers last year. Government officials said Bangladesh and Nepal are ready to sign a deal to activate their transit agreement, which will also allow goods-laden trucks and trains to enter each other's territory. The proposed Asian Highway through Bangladesh, which the opposition parties are seeing as a threat to Bangladesh's sovereignty, however, might get less importance during the bilateral discussion. RIVERS AND WATER SHARE DEALS Though Dhaka had been pressing Delhi for an agreement on sharing of the Teesta water during the prime minister's visit, it is unlikely to be signed during Sheikh Hasina's visit. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said on Jan 7 that the Teesta deal would not be signed during the India visit as the JRC's ministerial meeting, the only authorised forum for finalising deals on common rivers, was yet to take place. However, she hoped the ministerial meeting would be held soon. Bangladesh's largest irrigation project is sited on the Teesta to water 750,000 hectares of cultivable land in the rice-producing greater Rangpur region that is solely dependent on the river. According to the foreign ministry officials, Hasina will also raise Bangladesh's concern over the construction of the Tipaimukh dam with her Indian counterpart. Despite immense demands from several political parties and social organisations of Bangladesh, discussions on the Ganges water-sharing treaty are unlikely to be held in Delhi. The treaty was signed in 1996, during the present ruling party Awami League's previous tenure. Since then, Bangladesh has complained that it is being deprived of its fair share of the Ganges, that turns into the Padma in Bangladesh, which was assured in the deal. Kabibur Rahman, executive engineer of the Water Development Board's Pabna hydrology department, also the head of Joint River Commission's Bangladesh delegation, however, has reportedly regretted saying that Bangladesh has never got a fair share since signing of the Ganges water sharing treaty. JRC secretary level talks in early January did reach consensus on some common efforts that includes commencing pending river bank protection works along common border rivers from early February 2010 and dredging the Ichhamati riverbed. bdnews24.com/
