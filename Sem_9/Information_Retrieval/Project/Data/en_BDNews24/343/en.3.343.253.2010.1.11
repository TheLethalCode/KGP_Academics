<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Indian finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has said his government is keen to increase duty-free imports from Bangladesh. "We want many Bangladeshi goods to enter duty free to India," he said on Monday after a half hour meeting with visiting prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the ITC Maurya Hotel, where she is staying during her four-day tour of India. Bangladesh, during Hasina's visit, is seeking all-important duty free access for 232 products, including ready-made garments, that are currently on India's negative list. A highly-placed Indian official told bdnews24.com that Delhi had decided to remove 47 items from its negative list for the benefit of Bangladesh. Mukherjee also congratulated Hasina for restoring democracy in Bangladesh. He suggested that Hasina's visit marked a high point of relations between the countries. "This is a historic visit; it marks a new era in Indo-Bangladesh relations." "For the first time Dhaka understands our concerns and we understand theirs." He indicated that India and Bangladesh were on good terms and were cooperating with each other. "All we sought was mutual cooperation. And it has been that way over the last year." Mukherjee, the unofficial 'second-in-command' in India's current Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government, has long had a personal family connection with Hasina. A prominent leader of the Congress party from the Indian state of West Bengal, Mukherjee was a deputy minister in India's the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Government when Hasina came to Delhi after her father's assassination. Hasina may on Tuesday meet up with Mukherjee's wife Suvra Mukherjee, one of her close friends since her Delhi days. bdnews24.c
