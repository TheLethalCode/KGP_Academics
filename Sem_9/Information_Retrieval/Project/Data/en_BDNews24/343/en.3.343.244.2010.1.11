<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  India warmed up for the final of the Idea Cup tri-series with an easy six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the final league-phase match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. Table-toppers India will play Sri Lanka on Wednesday at the same venue. They finished with 13 points, one more than their opponents. The hosts failed to win any of their four games. Virat Kohli controlled the innings with a second ODI century he was undefeated on 102 off 95 deliveries with 11 boundaries as India reached 249-4 in 43 overs responding to Bangladesh's 247-6 in 50 overs. He put on 68 runs with MS Dhoni for the fourth wicket. Besides, Gautam Gambhir (41), Dinesh Karthik (34) were the other notable run-getters. Dhoni made 32 off 35 balls before he was caught while trying to hit Shakib Al Hasan over the top. The Indians got off to another useful half-century start before Shafiul Islam ended the opening stand on 64 runs after 12 overs when he had Karthik caught behind. Gambhir (46-ball 41) was heading towards another half-century before Naeem bowled him after deceiving the left-hander in flight. Naeem also struck a vital blow when he got rid of Yuvraj Singh for 13. Having been struck for a four off his previous ball, the spinner hit back when Yuvraj played down the wrong line and was adjudged lbw. Earlier, a century stand for the sixth wicket between Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah carried Bangladesh to a respectable total. Shakib top-scored with 85 off 97 balls with eight fours after a combination of seam and seam had Bangladesh in all sorts of trouble. Mahmudullah remained not out 64 off 80 balls. At one stage the home side were 95-5 after 24 overs but the Bangladesh captain first played himself in before cutting loose. The dashing left-hander reached his 13 ODI fifty in style with a huge six --- the first of the innings. Shakib put on 106 runs with Mahmudullah before being caught behind while trying to scoop Ashish Nehra. With India and Sri Lanka having already booked their places in the Jan 13 final, there was nothing at stake but pride for Bangladesh. They lost wickets regularly after India won the toss and elected to field. Imrul Kayes (9) and Mohammad Ashraful (4) fell cheaply in the first 10 overs. Ashraful was guilty of playing a loose shot having previously struck a boundary off Sreesanth. Then the hosts lost Tamim Iqbal just as it appeared they were making a recovery. Tamim threw his wicket away in the 14th over after putting on 45 runs with Raqibul Hasan. He tried to hit Nehra but only succeeded in getting caught. A smart piece of fielding off his own bowling by Yuvraj Singh cost Bangladesh another wicket when Raqibul (28 off 46 balls) was run out after Yuvraj fielded between his legs and then smartly flicked the ball between them onto the base of the stumps with the batsman well short of the crease. It pushed the hosts further back as they were 75-4 after 20 o
