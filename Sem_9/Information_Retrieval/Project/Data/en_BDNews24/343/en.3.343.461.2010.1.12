<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Shrimp export to Europe resumed on Tuesday after a self-imposed ban of over seven months. The government on Monday issued a 'health certificate' as a green signal to resume export of fresh-water shrimps (galda, also known as green tiger prawn) to Europe, Md Musa Meah, president of Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh in May last year decided to halt galda export to the European Union, after it had faced 54 rejections between late 2008 and early 2009 due to a 'rapid alert' notice, which circulates information on food safety problems among European nations. The alert came for contamination of frozen shrimps by nitrofuran, an antibiotic believed to be cancerous that is an ingredient of a widely used agricultural input called Furadin, in Bangladesh. Bangladesh lifted the self-imposed ban after initiatives to eliminate nitrofuan contamination began to take hold. Bangladesh also raised some questions against the examination protocol adopted by a laboratory in Brussels, which was later changed. Observations found that some contamination occurs naturally. Meah told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, "We received the health certificates Monday afternoon (for resuming exports)." "But exporters have been loading containers at the Chittagong and Mongla ports for the last few days." "Shipments begin formally from today (Tuesday)," he added. The government, along with the exporters, formed a National Working Committee following the ban to ensure the production of contamination-free shrimps. At a meeting in November, the committee decided to lift the ban from December 7. However, the date was later rescheduled to January 10. An EU delegation will visit Bangladesh from January 18-28 to inspect production and processing of shrimps in Cox's Bazar and Khulna. They will also submit their findings to the Bangladesh government. Bangladesh earned some $534.07 million from frozen food which was five per cent of its export earning in 2007-08 fiscal. But it shrank to $454.53 million in 2008-09, accounting for about three per cent export earnings. During the ban, the country lost its substantial market in Europe, which was taken over mostly by Thailand, India and Vietnam. Bangladesh, however, continued exporting galda to the US market without any objection, Meah said. Besides, export of salt-water shrimp, mainly bagda (commonly known as black tiger prawn) has continued smoothly. From now, shrimp will be approved for export only after pre-examinations to ensure that nitrofuran is not present, he added. bd
