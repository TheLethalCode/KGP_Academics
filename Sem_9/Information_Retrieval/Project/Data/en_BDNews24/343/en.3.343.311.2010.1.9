 Prakash Biswas bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The body of college teacher Chandan Kumar Chakrabarti has been lying in a Dhaka morgue for 15 days as two women, from two different religions, claiming to be his wife have taken their battle to court for the right to carry out the last rites. Since there are two wives demanding the body police have been unable to hand it over to either. Lawyers hope Dhaka magistrate's court may deliver an order regarding the matter on Sunday. Chandan, a 45 year old teacher of Khilgaon Ideal City College and resident of nearby Chowdhurypara, was stabbed to death on Dec 25 in the locality. When Tithi Chakrabarti, known to be Chandan's wife, tried to claim his body another woman named Aklima Aktar Polly claimed that Chandan had converted to Islam and married her. Tithi, who says they got married on July 12, 1986, is studying for an MPhil at the Visva Bharati University in West Bengal. She returned to Dhaka to claim the body on hearing the news of Chandan's death. She has told bdnews24.com that she received the news of Chandan's death from Polly herself. "On Dec 26, at around 3:30 am, Polly called me and identified herself as Chandan's student. She told me 'Chandan sir has been killed in an accident'," Tithi said. Polly, however, has told the media: "Chandan was my teacher. He fell in love with me and married me converting to Islam and taking the name Sajjad Hossain following Islamic law." "So, the right to do the last rites is mine." Tithi's lawyer Shyamal Chakrabarti told bdnews24.com: "Polly claims that she married Chandan in 2005. But still in 2007 he was registered as a voter with the name Chandan Kumar Chakrabarti, not with the name Sajjad." Tithi went to the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court on Dec 27 to claim the dead body of her husband. After several hearings, magistrate AKM Enamul Haque fixed Sunday Jan 10 to hear the statement of the registrar of the second marriage and the notary public who signed the affidavit of the marriage. Police have filed a murder case at Khilgaon Police Station in connection with Chandan's death. Tithi also filed a case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate AM Zulfikar Hayat has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department of police to investigate the case. bdnew
