 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and India agreed to comprehensively address all outstanding land boundary issues in the spirit of the 1974 Land Boundary Agreement. According to a joint statement issued at the end of the second day of Hasina's visit to India; both prime ministers also agreed on the need to amicably demarcate the maritime boundary between the two countries. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh agreed to convene the Joint Boundary Working Group to take forward the process of resolving the land boundary dispute. The joint statement indicated that Dhaka was open to turning the one-time transit facility it had agreed to offer Delhi for transportation of heavy machineries for a power plant in northeastern Indian state of Tripura into long-term one in future. Hasina and Singh had held discussions over a draft of the joint statement during the delegation-level talks on Monday, but it was released on Tuesday. It addressed the several contentious issues. Bangladesh has a 4096-kilometre-long border with India. The two countries signed the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) in 1974, but demarcation of the border in three sectors is still pending. Besides, Dhaka and Delhi are yet to resolve the disputes over exchange of adverse possessions and enclaves. There are altogether 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India. The two countries also have differences over sea boundary. Dhaka in October last year sought arbitration on maritime boundary under the Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The two Prime Ministers noted the initiation of proceedings under UNCLOS and, in this context, welcomed the visit of a delegation from Bangladesh to India. Hasina thanked Singh for facilitating the provision of electricity in Dahagram-Angarpota. She invited India to construct a flyover across Tin Bigha Corridor for exclusive Indian use. The two countries agreed that Ashuganj in Bangladesh and Silghat in India would be declared ports of call in the Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (IWTT), which would be amended through exchange of letters. "A joint team would assess the improvement of infrastructure and the cost for one-time or longer-term transportation of Over Dimensional Cargo from Ashuganj," said the statement. New Delhi has since long been requesting Dhaka for transit facility for both passengers and cargo to link the seven northeastern States with mainland India through Bangladesh. Though the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) Government had turned down the proposal, the current Awami League regime in Dhaka seems amenable to it. India's External Affairs Minister S M Krishna had told his Bangladeshi counterpart Dipu Moni during the latter's visit to Delhi in September 2009 that Dhaka could make a beginning by allowing transportation of heavy machineries for the proposed 750 MW power plant of the India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) at Palatana in Tripura. The ONGC wants to use the Bangladeshi waterways and the Ashuganj Port on Meghna for transporting the heavy equipments needed for the power plant. Ashuganj port is around 40 kms from the site of power-plant, but is not yet listed as a port-of-call in the Indo-Bangladesh IWTT Protocol. The existing bilateral agreements do not provide for a multi-modal transportation of goods between India and Bangladesh. The joint statement said that India would make the necessary investment for the transit facility through Ashuganj. Both governments agreed to expedite implementation and contractors from both countries would be eligible for the work. Both the prime ministers agreed on a vision for the future in the pursuit of the common good - bilaterally, regionally and globally. They reiterated their commitment to work together to solve all issues through cooperation and mutual understanding. They also shared their outlook on the strengthening and reform of multilateral institutions in which developing countries have an effective voice and participation. Singh and Hasina recognised that peace and stability in the region is necessary for development and well-being of the people of their respective countries. They emphasised the importance of close cooperation between India and Bangladesh and the need to effectively harness their respective resources for the good of the peoples of the two countries. The two prime ministers agreed to put in place a comprehensive framework of cooperation for development between the two countries, encapsulating their mutually shared vision for the future, which would include cooperation in water resources, power, transportation and connectivity, tourism and education. They agreed on the need to operationalize the various areas of cooperation at the earliest. Singh on Monday announced a credit line worth US $ one billion for Bangladesh for a range of projects, including railway infrastructure, supply of Broad Gauge locomotives and passenger coaches, rehabilitation of Saidpur Workshop, procurement of buses including articulate buses and dredging projects. Bangladesh, according to the joint statement, requested for assistance to construct road infrastructure in Dhaka, including flyovers. India agreed to consider this request. The prime ministers also expressed the desire that line of credit and the comprehensive framework of cooperation for development be operationalized at the earliest. They agreed to consider strengthening diplomatic and consular presence in each other's countries. They reiterated their commitment to democracy, pluralism and rule of law. "They expressed satisfaction that the people of both countries have rejected violence, extremism and terrorism and reaffirmed their faith in democracy and development. In this quest, the two leaders resolved to work together to strengthen the forces of democracy and moderation," the joint statement stated. Singh and Hasina condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. They noted that security remained a priority for both countries, as terrorists, insurgents and criminals respect no boundaries. They underscored the need for both countries to actively cooperate on security issues. Both leaders reiterated the assurance that the territory of either would not be allowed for activities inimical to the other and resolved not to allow their respective territory to be used for training, sanctuary and other operations by domestic or foreign terrorist/militant and insurgent organizations and their operatives. The delegation-level talks between Hasina and Singh at Hyderabad House here was followed by signing of three agreements for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, transfer of sentenced persons and combating international terrorism, organized crime and illegal drug trafficking as well as two Memorandums of Understanding for power cooperation and a cultural exchange programme during 2010-12.. Bangladesh had taken up with India the issue of frequent incidents in which the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) personnel open fire  resulting in the injuries and often death of Bangladeshi citizens living near the border. "While recognizing the need to check cross border crimes, both Prime Ministers agreed that the respective border guarding forces exercise restraint and underscored the importance of regular meetings between the border guarding forces to curtail illegal cross border activities and prevent loss of lives," the joint statement said. It was agreed that Bangladesh would allow use of Mongla and Chittagong sea ports for movement of goods to and from India through road and rail. Bangladesh also conveyed their intention to give Nepal and Bhutan access to Mongla and Chittagong ports. It was agreed that the construction of the proposed Akhaura  Agartala railway link be financed by grant from India. A joint team of the railway authorities of the two countries will identify the alignment for connectivity. Hasina and Singh welcomed the starting of "Maitree Express" between Kolkata and Dhaka and called for resumption of road and rail links between the two countries. The Prime Ministers agreed that RohanpurSingabad broad gauge railway link would be available for transit to Nepal. Bangladesh informed of their intention to convert Radhikapur  Birol railway line into broad gauge and requested for railway transit link to Bhutan as well. They agreed that the discussions on the sharing of the Teesta River waters between India and Bangladesh should be concluded expeditiously. The two Prime Ministers directed their respective Water Resources Ministers to convene the Ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission in this quarter of 2010. The Joint Rivers Commission will also discuss issues relating to Feni, Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar. They also agreed for dredging of Ichhamati and river protection at Mahananda, Karatoa, Nagar, Kulik, Atrai, Dharla, and Feni. The Prime Minister of India agreed to support implementation of strategy of Government of Bangladesh to dredge rivers for flood control, navigation and access to ports. India agreed to provide nine dredgers to Bangladesh on an urgent basis. Singh reiterated the assurance that India would not take steps on the Tipaimukh project that would adversely impact Bangladesh. India agreed to supply to Bangladesh 250 MW electricity from its grid. Both Prime Ministers emphasized the need to expedite inter-grid connectivity. They also agreed that the two countries should cooperate in development and exchange of electricity, including generation from renewable sources, and may set up joint projects or corporate entities for that purpose. With a view to encouraging imports from Bangladesh, both countries agreed to address removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and port restrictions and facilitate movement of containerized cargo by rail and water. In this context, Bangladesh welcomed India's initiative to provide duty-free access to SAARC Least Developed Countries to the Indian market. Bangladesh also welcomed the reduction of the number of items from India's negative list that were of direct interest to Bangladesh and requested for further reduction in the list. India agreed to support upgrading of Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute with a view to building capacity on certification. The Prime Ministers agreed that investments, including joint investment and joint ventures, should be encouraged by both countries. They agreed that the participation of the private sector in both countries would give an added fillip to economic engagement between the two countries. The Prime Ministers agreed to operationalize land customs stations at Sabroom-Ramgarh and Demagiri-Thegamukh, including putting in place necessary infrastructure and issue necessary notifications. Further, with respect to existing land custom stations, it was agreed to take measures for strengthening infrastructure. It was agreed that border haats shall be established on a pilot basis at selected areas, including on the Meghalaya border, to allow trade in specified produces and products and in accordance with the regulations agreed and notified by both Governments. It was agreed that trucks for movement from Bhutan and Nepal be allowed to enter about 200 meters into Zero Point at Banglabandh at Banglabandh-Phulbari land customs station. Necessary arrangements shall be mutually agreed and put in place by both countries. Bangladesh requested for assistance to construct road infrastructure in Dhaka, including flyovers. India agreed to consider this request. Recalling the shared legacy of the great poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore, the Prime Ministers agreed to oversee the joint celebrations of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore in 2011 in a manner befitting his vision and spirit. Government of India would offer Bangladesh 300 scholarships annually for a period of five years for study and training in Universities and training institutions in India, covering a wide range of disciplines as may be required by scholars and persons in government employment. The number may be increased through mutual consultation. Both Prime Ministers agreed to work together in making SAARC a purposeful organization oriented towards implementation, which can revitalize the region through positive measures, concerted action and mutually reinforcing cooperation. Both leaders welcomed the various steps taken to strengthen regional cooperation under BIMSTEC. In this context, Bangladesh requested India to support its aspiration to host the BIMSTEC Secretariat in Dhaka. India agreed to give the request due consideration. The two Prime Ministers welcomed the initiatives taken at the Climate Change Summit at Copenhagen in December 2009. They underlined that climate change was one of the most important global challenges. They reaffirmed the provisions and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including that of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and underscored the importance of its full, effective and sustained implementation, giving due consideration to the needs of those which are most vulnerable, especially Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Africa. Both leaders recognized that the eradication of poverty and ensuring food security were great challenges of the century. They agreed that the international community should initiate a fully coordinated response and address these issues in a comprehensive manner, from short to medium and long term. They also recognized the need to give added focus on rural development policies, transfer and diffusion of technology and development, in particular to enhance agricultural productivity. The prime ministers underscored the importance of an effective multilateral system, centered on a strong United Nations, as a key factor in tackling global challenges. In this context, they stressed the urgent need to pursue the reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, to make it more representative, credible and effective, particularly with regard to its working method. They also advocated involvement of smaller countries in the reform process. Responding to Singh, Hasina conveyed Dhaka's support in principle for India's candidature for the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council as and when the reform of the UN Security Council is achieved. Bangladesh conveyed its support to the Indian Candidature for a non-permanent seat in the UNSC for the term 2011-2012. India also conveyed its support to the Bangladesh's candidature for a non-permanent seat in UNSC for the term 2016-2017. She also extended an invitation to her Indian counterpart to visit Bangladesh at a mutually convenient time.
