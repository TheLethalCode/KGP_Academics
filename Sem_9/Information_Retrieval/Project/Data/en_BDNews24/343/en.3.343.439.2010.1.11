<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has demanded punishment of the perpetrators of the January 11, 2007 "takeover", when the country entered into a two-year long state of emergency. Secretary general of the main opposition BNP, Khandakar Delwar Hossain, at a discussion on Monday marking what the party termed a 'Black Day' for the nation, said: "Not just the main players, we also demand punishment of those who have been identified as the collaborators of that regime." The Bangladesh Nationalist Party organised the meeting to observe the third anniversary of the '1/11 changeover'. The main opposition has planned two-day programmes to observe the 'Black Day', which began with the hoisting of a black flag at the party's offices in the morning followed by the discussion in the afternoon. A demonstration has been scheduled on Tuesday in protest against the suspension of political rights three years ago when Iajuddin Ahmed, then president, proclaimed the state of emergency, as political unrest spread with elections due. Elected president by the BNP-led four-party alliance, Iajuddin had also assumed office as head of the caretaker government on January 2007, amid the row over selection of the chief adviser. The caretaker government was later formed anew with former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed as its head. It is widely believed the then army chief, general Moeen U Ahmed, allegedly backed by 'foreign quarters', played the key role in installing the new caretaker government that ruled the country for two years. Elaborating the context of the take-over of a military-controlled regime, Delwar said it was the result of "a conspiracy that derailed a democratic process in a bid to destroy the BNP and install a puppet government". During that time BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman were detained and tortured, said the BNP leader. "We are going through a critical juncture now and we must unite our forces." Delwar said he hoped that Tarique would would recover soon and return to Bangladesh. "We genuinely hope that he returns home soon and takes over the helm of the party." Among others, the discussion was attended by Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, M K Anwar, Mirza Abbas, Rafiqul Islam Miah, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, vice president Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, former speaker Jamir Uddin Sircar, Abdul Moyeen Khan, Abdul Awal Mintoo and Selima Rahman. b
