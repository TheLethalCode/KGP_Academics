<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Employees of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-governmental organisations, were once more in a stand-off against sacked chairman Kazi Faruque on Sunday. They locked the main entrance of the NGO's Dhaka headquarters on Sunday morning to obstruct his access. Huge numbers police have been deployed around the building at Mirpur 2. Pallabi police chief Iqbal Hossain said they had deployed forces fearing unrest. Huge clashes occurred in a similar situation on Aug 1 last year as hundreds of supporters led by Kazi Faruque Ahmed marched on the building trying to force entry. Proshika's governing body replaced Faruque as chairman in May last year in the face of ongoing employees' agitation against him for alleged corruption and nepotism. On Sunday, staff took up position inside the building and kept the main entrance locked from early morning on information that Faruque might turn up at the building. He was not seen on the scene until 10am. Sirajul Islam, one of the directors of Proshika, told bdnews24.com: "Since a case is ongoing regarding Proshika management, Kazi Faruque should not come to the office until it is resolved." bd
