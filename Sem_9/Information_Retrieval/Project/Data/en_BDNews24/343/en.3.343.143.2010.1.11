 By Sumon Mahbub and bdnews24.com's New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh would continue efforts with neighbours to build a stable South Asia, speaking at her ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Monday. Hasina also stressed bilateral cooperation for the fight against poverty in both countries. "I have brought a message of friendship from the Bangladeshi people," she said. "Bangladesh will continue its effort to build a stable and prosperous South Asia." She hoped her tour of India, the first since she assumed office a year ago, would help strengthen friendship of the two close neighbours. India and Bangladesh are expected to sign five agreements during Hasina's visit, for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, transfer of sentenced persons, combating international terrorism, organized crime and illegal drug trafficking, power cooperation and a cultural exchange programme. The ceremonial reception officially launched the state visit in the city that had also been her home between 1976 and 1981. The media in India, as well as old acquaintances, remembered her days in New Delhi, where she lived with her nuclear scientist husband MA Wajed, who died last year, and children Sajeeb and Saima Putul  first at 56 Ring Road in Lajpat Nagar and later at a modest flat at the C Block of Pandara Park here. As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh formally welcomed her at the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in the heart of the Lutyens' Delhi, Hasina, herself, too might have remembered her stay in the capital of India during the tumultuous period that followed her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib's assassination in Dhaka on the fateful night of August 15, 1975. It is still not clear whether Hasina will take some time off from her busy schedule in New Delhi to pay a visit to her old homes at Lajpat Nagar and Pandara Park. She has a series of official engagements on Monday. Soon after her reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the prime minister headed for Rajghat, the place of cremation of Mahatma Gandhi, to pay homage to the Indian leader of independence. India's Minister of External Affairs SM Krishna was due to call on her at the ITC Maurya Hotel. Hasina was also scheduled to call on Indian President Patil at Rashtrapati Bhavan at noon. India's Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will then call on her at Hotel ITC Maurya. Mukherjee, the unofficial "second-in-command" in India's current Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government, has long had a family friendship with Hasina. A prominent leader of the Congress party from the Indian state of West Bengal, Mukherjee was a deputy minister in India's the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Government when Hasina came to Delhi after her father's assassination. President of the India's Congress party and chairperson of the ruling coalition UPA Sonia Gandhi and Leader of Opposition in Indian Parliament's lower house Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj are also likely to meet her on Monday. Hasina will then meet her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh at 1730 hours (Indian Standard Time) on Monday for delegation-level talks. Singh will also host a banquet in the evening in honour of Hasina. On Tuesday, she will meet former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, with whom she had developed a good rapport during her first term at the helm of the Bangladesh Government in later 1990s. Gujral, as the chancellor of the Vishwabharti University in Shantiniketan in West Bengal, had in 1999 bestowed on her the varsity's top honour  Deshikottam. 'DELHI DAYS' Hasina may on Tuesday also meet Mukherjee's wife Suvra Mukherjee, one of her close friends since her Delhi days. DK Bose, a familiar face in football circles of Delhi, was among the ones who still recall meeting Hasina during her stay in Delhi. "I had met her in her Pandara Park residence, possibly in 1980. I had gone with an academician from Dhaka University," said Bose. Bose recalled discussing a range of topics with Hasina  from political situation in Bangladesh, Bengali literature in Bangladesh and India and off course football. When Hasina was in Delhi, she was always surrounded by the security guards provided by Indian Government. She was sometimes seen having a quiet lunch or dinner at the Indian International Centre in Lodi Road. A man  A L Khatib  worked as her assistant and he later wrote a book on Sheikh Mujib. Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana were on a goodwill tour of West Germany when Bangbandhu was assassinated by the killers, some of whom are now in death row in Bangladesh. Hasina then sought refuge in United Kingdom and later, in India. She lived in New Delhi till May 17, 1981, when she was returned to Bangladesh. She was elected the president of Bangladesh Awami League during her stay in New Delhi itself. When she was in New Delhi, India too was in turmoil  in a state of emergency from 1975 till 1977. Hasina first lived at 56 Ring Road in Lajpat Nagar and moved to Pandara Park in December 1975. The 56 Ring Road later became the address of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and it was there for quite some time before moving to the more spacious location at the diplomatic area in Chanakyapuri. "Pandara Park will definitely remain in her mind during her stay in Delhi," journalist Vivek Shukla wrote in an article in Indian newspaper The Pioneer. bdnews24.c
