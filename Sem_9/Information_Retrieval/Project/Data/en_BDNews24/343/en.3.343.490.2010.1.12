 by Sumon Mahbub, political correspondent, and bdnews24.com's New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)--India on Monday offered Bangladesh a $1 billion line of credit for infrastructure projects, in what is its largest ever one-time assistance to any country, and also said no steps would be taken on the proposed Tipaimukh Dam that would harm its neighbour. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, during one-and-a-half hour talks at Hyderabad House, also agreed upon a comprehensive framework for developmental cooperation. They agreed on joint efforts to make the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) a more meaningful organisation. "India seeks to build a new future with Bangladesh. The time has come to chart a new path," said Singh at a banquet he hosted in honour of Hasina. Hasina said her visit aimed to strengthen ties for a more stable and prosperous South Asia. At the banquet that followed their talks, she said success in poverty alleviation and economic development is only possible through sincere cooperation among all in the South Asian region. "The eventual gain would be peace and stability all around." CONNECTIVITY Terming connectivity an important factor of economic development, she said a better connectivity in the region would open a new era of economic activities, benefiting all countries in South Asia. India has offered to provide Bangladesh with connectivity to Nepal and Bhutan through its territory, New Delhi officials said. India also agreed to lay a railway link between Akhaura and Agartalathe capital of northeastern Indian state of Tripura. It was agreed that Ashuganj in Bangladesh and Silghat in India would be included as Ports of Call in the bilateral Inland Water Transit Protocol for transportation of over-dimensional cargo for a power-plant coming up in Tripura. The substantial credit line offered by India, meanwhile, will be used in railway projects and for supply of locomotives, coaches and buses as well as other infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, said Indian officials. WATER, POWER Hasina also sought India's cooperation in sharing of Teesta water and duty-free access of Bangladesh products. Singh, meanwhile, assured Hasina that India would never take any step on the proposed controversial Tipaimukh Dam that would adversely affect Bangladesh, Hasina's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told journalists at Hyderabad House. India also promised to provide Bangladesh with 250 MW of power from its central grid and agreed to extend scholarships to 300 Bangladeshi students every year. Hasina told Singh that all that is good for the citizens of two countries will be done, according to Azad who added that the two countries would work together to fight terrorism. Azad said that a joint statement of the two leaders would come on Tuesday. "We are ready to pursue a bold vision for our relations, based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. Our two peoples want peace, security and prosperity. We should move forward to achieve these common goals for ourselves and for all the people of South Asia," Singh said. The two leaders also agreed to oversee the joint celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore. "India and Bangladesh are fortunate to have produced some of the finest writers, scholars and artists. The works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam have inspired generations of people. This is a unique asset which binds our people, and which we must preserve," Singh said. DEALS ON COMBATING CRIME The delegation-level talks between Hasina and Singh at Hyderabad House was followed by signing of three agreements for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, transfer of sentenced persons and combating international terrorism, organised crime and illegal drug trafficking as well as two Memorandums of Understanding for power cooperation and a cultural exchange programme during 2010-12. The two sides also agreed to operationalise the Sabroom-Ramgarh and Demagiri-Thegamukh Land Custom Stations and to open border-haats along the Indo-Bangla border in the northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya. bdnews24
