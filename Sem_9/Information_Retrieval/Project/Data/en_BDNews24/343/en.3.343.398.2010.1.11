 New Delhi, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina sought on Monday India's cooperation in fighting terrorism, guaranteed water of Teesta water and duty-free access of Bangladesh products. "To ensure also our sustained commitment to peace, serious collaboration is essential in countering terrorism," she said, while addressing a banquet hosted by Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Monday evening. Hasina, who is on her four-day maiden visit to India after forming the government just a year back, said cooperation in the field would lead to socio-economic development of the two countries to alleviate poverty that undermines peace. She reiterated Bangladesh's commitment to eliminating all forms of terrorism. Bangladesh will not allow its territory to be used for launching terrorist activities against any country in the neighbourhood, or around the world, she added. TRADE PROMOTION The prime minister said a laudable start has already been made by Manmohan's assurance for India's decision for duty-free access to more Bangladeshi items to the Indian market, removal of non-tariff barriers, and improvement of trade infrastructure on Indian side of the borders. Bangladesh on this trip sought all-important duty free access for 232 products, including ready-made garments, that are currently on India's negative list. A highly-placed Indian official told bdnews24.com that Delhi would remove 47 items from its negative list for the benefit of Bangladesh. Hasina, in her speech, also said activation of institutional mechanisms is required to promote two-way trade, remove avoidable hindrances, initiate long-pending trade facilitation measures, facilitate easy travel of businessmen, and create mechanisms to settle trade related disputes. She said: "Progress and prosperity of our nations, and of all others in our regional organisation, SAARC, depend on our success in poverty alleviation and economic development." Hasina said success in poverty alleviation and economic development is possible through sincere cooperation among all in the South Asian region. "The eventual gain would be peace and stability all around." Terming connectivity an important factor of economic development, she said a better connectivity in the region would open a new era of economic activities, benefiting all countries in South Asia. The prime minister said her discussions with Indian side on the economic development, power, tourism and culture were successful. "commendable progress was made on long pending issues, particularly on land boundary. They would surely have favorable impacts on the lives of our peoples." She said she hoped her visit has served the purpose in boosting bilateral cooperation and overall relations to a new, enviable level. TEESTA WATER SHARING Prime minister Sheikh Hasina sought help of her Indian counterpart in reaching agreements on water sharing of Teesta and other common rivers. "We need to conclude treaties on water sharing of the river Teesta, and other common rivers. On this very important issue, I request for your support in arriving at mutual agreements," she said. . She said as an agrarian country, Bangladesh needed throughout the year a guaranteed flow of water, vital for its economic development. She mentioned that the two neighbours concluded the historic 30-year Ganges Water Treaty in 1996 to ensure a regular flow of water from the common river terming the accord "a symbol of true spirit of what our two countries can do." The prime minister invited her Indian counterpart to visit Bangladesh in the soonest possible time to consolidate the mutual gains and facilitate attainment of the remaining targets. Earlier in the day, Hasina called on Indian president Pratibha Patil and ruling Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, and placed wreaths at the grave of Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. Indian external affairs minister SM Krishna, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and leader of the opposition in parliament Shushma Swaraj also called on her at her hotel suite. bdnew
