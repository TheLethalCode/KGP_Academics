 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Tension was running high at the headquarters of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-governmental organisations, after men of ousted chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed took control of the building in the early hours of Tuesday. Md Ilias Sharif, additional deputy police commissioner of Mirpur Zone, said police had gone to Proshika Bhaban on information that "criminals" had taken control of the building. "Coming to the spot we came to know that they are supporters of Kazi Faruque. They locked the main entrance from inside. We could not enter since we were not given any instruction from higher authorities." Supporters of incumbent Proshika chairman Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan have also taken position in front of Proshika Bhaban, located at Mirpur-6, marching and chanting there from morning. Pallabi police chief Iqbal Hossain said extra police were deployed in the area to maintain calm. Police had been surrounding the building from Monday midnight after Faruque's men had earlier threatened to enter. Nobody was allowed to come near the main entrance of the building. But officials and witnesses said Faruque's men forced their way in just after midnight Monday, beat the staff patrolling the building and took up occupation there. Senior accountant Md Alauddin, a witness, said some 15 to 20 people along with pistols and clubs attacked the people who were in guard of the Proshika headquarters and forced them out. Mizanur Rahman Khan, central coordinator of the present governing body, told bdnews24.com a group of people backed by Kazi Faruque entered the building at gun point after 12:30am. "They beat our people, who were keeping guard inside the building and kept them hostage. "We don't know yet their condition," Khan said. He said: "The governing body had relieved Faruque of his position. The issue is now pending in court." Police chief Iqbal Hossain said two groups of staff had long been locked in conflicts over "occupation of Proshika". Shahidul Islam, CEO of the human resources development centre, and a supporter of Kazi Faruque, said: "Legally we are directors of Proshika ... We took control of the building last night." Proshika's governing body replaced Faruque as chairman in May last year in the face of ongoing employees' agitation against him for alleged corruption and nepotism. Huge clashes erupted on Aug 1 last year as hundreds of supporters led by Faruque marched on Proshika Bhaban trying to force entry. Following those clashes, the High Court last year, on a petition by Faruque challenging his ouster, ordered him to stay away from the Proshika premises. bd
