<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Business leaders of Old Dhaka's trade bodies have asked for more congenial environment at the tax offices to make tax payment easier. They also asked that tax officers not be too strict slapping on fines and giving rise to panic when someone goes to the tax offices for corrections. People have been panicky since the special drive against tax evaders during the tenure of the caretaker government, they said. They also demanded amendment of centuries' old laws. The comments came out at a meeting with potential tax payers by the National Board of Revenue of Zone-2 of Dhakaincluding wards 66, 67, 71, 72, 73, 78 and 79held at the Fire Service and Civil Defence Office. Abdur Rouf Mollah, a veteran businessman of old Dhaka and a very new taxpayer, said, "The taxpayers should be honoured for their contribution to the country's economy and overall development instead of being intimidated about their 'income tax' matter." "It is important that there are enough provisions to make the required corrections easily and not just high fines," he said. Rouf said, "This is a major reason behind such a small number of taxpayers compared to the number of TIN holders." Currently, there are 2,200,000 TIN holders in the country while only 700,000 of them paid income taxes in 2009. Golam Mawla, leader of a business group of old Dhaka, said taxes should be ascertained based on the nature of business. He said the government should look for people evading taxes rather than harassing those who are already paying taxes. Another trade body leader Osman Gani said the provision of charging 35 per cent tax on profit was absurd. "Is it possible that a businessman is making such high profits that he can afford to pay more a third of that in taxes?" he asked. Belayet Hossain, an FBCCI director, said since some 2.2 million people lived in zone 2, which largely falls in Old Dhaka, it should be declared special. He said more taxpayers would be netted if the government attempted to identify potential taxpayers in not just the main cities for across the country. The number of taxpayers could easily rise above the target if the mentioned difficulties could be addressed. The NBR has targeted to add 400,000 more taxpayers by June 2010. Shambhunath Das, member of the National Board of Revenue, in his speech, said the audit has also been launched in Sylhet and Chittagong after the declaration of the finance minister regarding the taxpayer target. He also said the officials could not impose higher taxes if people provided necessary documents of income and expenses properly without concealing them. NBR chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed, in his speech as chief guest, pledged to address the problems raised by the trade body leaders saying, "We've been changing the procedures and also the manner." "We don't want to file cases but want to motivate people for paying taxes." He agreed with the need of revising existing laws, and said, "In fact, we need a new law." He said the available manpower need for tax collection, promotion and audit was not sufficient. Ahmed, also secretary of internal resources division, said the country could not advance without mobilizing its internal resources.
