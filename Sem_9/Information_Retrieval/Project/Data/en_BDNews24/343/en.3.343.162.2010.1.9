<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Democratic Left Alliance has urged prime minister Sheikh Hasina not to sign any deal on anti-terrorism or prisoner exchange during her India visit this week. The alliance leaders said there were fences across the border, so no Indian terrorist should be able to enter Bangladesh. The deals would serve no interest to Bangladesh, rather they might hamper the sovereignty of the country, said alliance leaders. They said India showed interest in signing this deal, as Delhi wants to arrest what the Left Alliance termed "the liberal-minded valiant leaders of its seven provinces", referring to the separatists of north-east India. "But we (alliance leaders) support the battles of the liberal-minded people as they supported us in our Liberation War in 1971. We will also become a target if India goes against them," Moshrefa Misu, co-ordinator of the alliance, said at a press briefing in the capital. The left leaders also claimed that the Farakka water sharing agreement signed in 1996 was an incomplete one and Bangladesh is not getting its fair share of water. They said that India's Farakka Dam has turned into an entrapment for Bangladesh. The leaders said the issue of re-evaluation and removal of this dam also should be discussed during the prime minister's India visit. The alliance leaders held the briefing at the Revolutionary Democratic Party's Segunbagicha headquarters. Left-leaning leaders Tipu Bishwas, Abdus Salam, Saiful Haque, Bazlur Rashid Firoz, Badrul Alam and Mainuddin Chowdhury Liton also spoke and responded to queries from the reporters. bdn
