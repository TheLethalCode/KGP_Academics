<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Family and legal counsel of Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin have said they know nothing about clemency pleas by the two men condemned to death for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, even though the inspector general of prisons the day before spoke of their mercy petitions to the president. Lawyer for the two, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, was talking to reporters on Sunday as he filed petitions for review of the Supreme Court judgment that last November upheld death sentences of five ex-army men. Mohiuddin's wife Hosne Ara Mohiuddin and Huda's sister Mahfuza Pasha were also present at the Supreme Court. Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Ashraful Islam Khan had said on Saturday that three of the five condemned killers, Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin, had submitted mercy petitions to the president. Khan had also said that the two other convicted killers, Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had not sought clemency yet but would file review petitions with the Supreme Court. But Mamun, Moihuddin's wife and Huda's sister said on Sunday they "knew nothing" about any reported mercy petitions. Mamun also questioned the process of submission of any such petitions. "It is mandatory that lawyers and relatives should be present while submitting mercy petitions. But we do not know anything of them." "We only heard yesterday (Saturday) that they had submitted mercy petitions. This is illegal." The Supreme Court, in a long-awaited judgment on Nov 19 last year, rejected appeals of the five convicted killers, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3, Dhaka district and sessions judge sent signed death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. The condemned men had 7 days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. b
