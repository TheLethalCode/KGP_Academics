 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina left for New Delhi Sunday evening for her maiden state visit to neighbouring India after her party formed government one year back. A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines took off from Zia International Airport at 6.22pm, said airport officials. The prime minister will be received at Palam Air Force Base outside Delhi. She will go on to the Hotel Maurya situated in the Indian capital's Diplomatic Enclave, the usual place of stay for visiting heads of state and government. Her schedule for Sunday night is 'quiet time'. During her visit over the following three days, Hasina will meet Indian president Pratibha Patil, ruling Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi and leader of the opposition Sushma Swaraj, alongside the crucial summit with prime minister Manmohan Singh. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, water resources minister Romesh Chandra Sen, prime minister's advisers HT Imam, Moshiur Rahman and Gowhor Rizvi, her principal secretary Abdul Karim and foreign secretary Mizarul Quayes are among the Bangladesh delegation. Hasina's family are also accompanying her. Three treaties on crime control and a memorandum of understanding on electricity are supposed to be signed during Hasina's visit, as well as talks on other key areas including trade, infrastructure projects and shared rivers. The official talks with Singh and signing of the agreements and MOU will take place on Monday at Hyderabad House. Hasina will attend a banquet hosted by Singh later the same evening. A large business delegation from Bangladesh is also accompanying the prime minister, who will address functions organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Association of Chambers during the stay. Hasina will offer prayers at the grave of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer and pay homage at the mausoleum of Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat during her stay. Hasina will also be conferred the prestigious Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development in New Delhi. An international jury, chaired by Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, chose Hasina for her "outstanding contribution to the promotion of democracy and pluralism," the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust said announcing her as the 2009 recipient of the prize. Introduced in 1986, the award in past years has been given to, among others, Kofi Annan, Bill Gates, Mikhail Gorbachev, Mohammad Al Baradei, Dr Muhammad Younus, Wangari Maathai and Hamid Karzai. bd
