 MANILA, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the Asian Development Bank warned it was too early for Asian countries to end stimulus policies started during the financial crisis and said he saw no big risk of price bubbles in China. Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday that policymakers still needed to restore demand and stabilise financial systems to support the economic recovery.

Asian countries must boost internal demand to return to high growth rates and reduce poverty, with external demand likely to remain sluggish as advanced economies tread carefully back to pre-crisis growth levels, he said. The ADB estimates developing Asia will grow 6.6 percent this year after a 4.5 percent expansion in 2009, with China charging ahead with 8.9 percent growth this year. China rocked world financial markets with an increase in the amount that banks must set aside as reserves that was earlier than markets had expected. The move was likely prompted by concerns over a surge in inflation surge. "Inflationary pressures have not been so much prominent in the Chinese economy at this moment. But in some cities, the real estate prices have risen sharply over the last several months and so the move by the Chinese central bank appeared to be quite appropriate," Kuroda said, adding the move was not expected to undermine the V-shaped recovery. "The monetary authorities have already adjusted slightly to a less expansionary monetary stance quite appropriately, and also the bank credit has been well supervise
