 HONOLULU, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States urged Japan on Tuesday to keep its commitment to move a US military base on Okinawa island but the two vowed not to let the row derail their security alliance in the face of rising Chinese power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she had asked Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada to adhere to an agreement to relocate the Futenma Air Station, home to about 4,000 US Marines in crowded Ginowan City. "We look to our Japanese friends and allies to follow through on their commitments, including on Futenma," Clinton told a news briefing after the meeting at which both sides affirmed their commitment to the 50-year-old security pact. "This is an issue that we view as very important," she said. "But we are also working on so many other aspects of the global challenges that we face and we are going to continue to do that." A senior administration official later said the US side was moderately encouraged by the meeting, although he noted that no new Japanese proposals were put on the table. "We recognise that this is not going to play out over a couple of days but rather a couple of months," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The talks came at the start of Clinton's nine-day visit to the region, part of a drive to boost Washington's engagement with its Pacific partners as China's influence grows. In a later speech in Hawaii, Clinton described the Obama administration as eager to participate in regional institutions like the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), saying that after sometimes lukewarm US interest under former President George W. Bush, "the United States is back". Okada repeated Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's pledge to resolve the Futenma issue by May and said Tokyo remained committed to the broader U.S.-Japan security pact, telling Japanese reporters he wanted to avoid a loss of trust. THORNY PROBLEM But the Futenma issue is a major irritant, with Hatoyama's new Democratic Party (DPJ) government striking a more independent line and stalling on an agreement by a previous administration to move the base to a less crowded part of Okinawa. Hatoyama is under domestic pressure to get US ties back on track, with media polls showing many voters are concerned about his handling of the relationship, ahead of an upper house election many expect in July. He underlined Japan's reliance on the United States in a speech to Defence Ministry officials in Tokyo on Wednesday. "As a non-nuclear power, can Japan defend itself on its own in a world which has countries that remain nuclear states and nations that have ambitions to go nuclear?" Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying. "We should be grateful for the presence of the Japan-US security treaty to protect our country," Hatoyama said. Residents of Okinawa, 1,600 km (1,000 miles) south of Tokyo, are reluctant host to about half the 47,000 US military personnel in Japan. They have long resented what they see as an unfair burden in maintaining the US-Japan security alliance. The dispute over where to put a replacement facility for Futenma comes amid deepening questions about how China's rising military and economic clout will reshape the alliance. The senior US official said leaders of the DPJ, who vowed to build a more equal relationship with the United States in the run-up to their election victory last year, were still "finding their sea legs" on the U.S. alliance. A Tokyo-based political scientist said the meeting appeared to reduce U.S. public pressure on Hatoyama at a difficult political moment. "The US side was initially shocked and angry. But I think they have now realised that getting angry will not produce results," Takashi Inoguchi told Reuters. US officials are nevertheless still pushing for a quick resolution as a sign of Tokyo's commitment to a 2006 "road map" to overhaul the alliance and make US forces more flexible in the face of concerns over China, North Korea and other issues. Clinton said the 2006 plan, which includes shifting about 8,000 Marines to the US territory of Guam from Okinawa by 2014, remained the best strategy. "Our position remains that, in terms of both the security arrangements needed to protect Japan and to limit the impact of bases on local communities, particularly in Okinawa, that the realignment road map presents the best way forward," she sa
