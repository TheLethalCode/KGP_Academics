<TEXT>
 REFILED - CORRECTS INTRO Chittagong, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to "strike a balance" between the principles of equity and equidistance to resolve sea border disputes, as two-day talks ended in the port city on Saturday. The two sides decided to sit again in April, in Myanmar, Md Khurshid Alam, additional foreign secretary heading the Bangladesh delegation, told reporters at Agrabad Hotel in Chittagong. Myanmar deputy foreign minister U Maung Myint headed the Myanmar side in the two-nation talks. Alam said the talks were "fruitful". He had told reporters after the first day of talks on Friday that Bangladesh was emphasising demarcation on the principle of equity while Myanmar was pressing for demarcation on principle of equidistance. This is the first such meeting since Bangladesh turned to the United Nations arbitration court in October last year for resolving long-standing disputes over maritime demarcation in the Bay of Bengal with Myanmar and India. At the same time, Bangladesh made it known that options for bilateral discussions and settlement would remain open. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have been unable to exploit oil and gas reserves in the Bay due to claims and counter-claims for the offshore blocks. Myanmar and India have made overlapping claims on several of Bangladesh's 28 sea blocks. Foreign minister Dipu Moni has termed Indian and Myanmar sea border claims as "aggressive" for blocking Bangladesh's sea zone. Dipu Moni has said the disputes could be resolved through UN arbitration in a maximum of four years if Bangladesh could not bury the disputes through bilateral talks. Bangladesh and Myanmar resumed talks on maritime boundary demarcation in 2008 after a break of 22 years. The two countries have had at least three rounds of talks on the issue since then but they yielded no tangible result. They have been unable to agree so far on determining the starting point or process for the boundary demarcation. bd
