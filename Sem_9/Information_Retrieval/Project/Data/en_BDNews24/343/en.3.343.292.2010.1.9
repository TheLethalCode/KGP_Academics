 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) - Three of the five former army officers convicted and condemned to death for the 1975 killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman have sought clemency from the president. Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Ashraful Islam Khan told a press briefing on Saturday that Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin had submitted mercy petitions. He said the two other convicted killers, Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had not sought clemency yet, but they had informed jail authorities that their lawyers would submit petitions for review of the Supreme Court judgement that had upheld their death sentences. The Supreme Court, in a long-awaited judgment on Nov 19 last year, rejected appeals of the five convicted killers, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case.

The condemned men had 7 days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law.

The inspector general of prisons said on Saturday, however, that the preparations for the execution will be halted until the clemency and review petitions are resolved.
