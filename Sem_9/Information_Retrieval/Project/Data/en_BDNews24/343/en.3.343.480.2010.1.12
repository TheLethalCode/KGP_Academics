This, however, is a continuous process increasing with the passage of time. I believe the present time is an auspicious one, for boosting this cooperation to a higher level," she said. She recalled the visit of Mukherjee to Dhaka in February 2009, when the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement was concluded and the Trade Agreement was renewed. "Both (the agreements) have significant potentials to influence more ambitious economic and investment related initiatives for the future," she noted.

"Decision has also been taken, at the request of India, to open new trade routes through Tegamukh-Demagiri and Sabroom-Ramgarh border points. As for connectivity, several possibilities are being examined taking into account their bilateral and regional dimensions," she added. Hasina said that Bangladesh had officially agreed to be part of the Asian Highway Network. "For regional trade, and people to people connectivity, we have proposed movement of passenger and cargo vehicle to Nepal and Bhutan, from and to Bangladesh.

Greater people to people contacts, particularly between businessmen, are important for expansion of trade and commerce, as well as to widen and deepen overall ties, she said, adding that such efforts would supplement government to government contact. She invited the Indian business tycoons to invest in Bangladesh. "I assure you of all possible assistance and cooperation n such ventures. I also call upon Bangladeshi business community to take advantage of the new opportunities, to increase their business activities with India.
