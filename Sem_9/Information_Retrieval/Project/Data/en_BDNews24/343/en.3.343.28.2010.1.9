 Netrokona, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)---The local administration clamped a 48-hour Section 144 ban on public gatherings at Durgapur in Netrokona on Saturday as Awami League and BNP called meetings at the same venue. The order will be in force from 1pm on Friday until the same time Sunday, upazila nirbahi officer Mir Khairul Islam told bdnews24.com. Khairul said local BNP convened a conference on municipal premises while Awami League called a meeting at the same venue simultaneously. The district magistrate imposed the Section 144 to diffuse "tension and commotion" spreading among supporters of the two parties, he said Opposition BNP called a press conference on Saturday afternoon at Netrokona Press Club to protest the ban. BNP executive committee member Kaysar Kamal alleged that ruling Awami League called the meeting at the same venue in a bid to foil BNP's conference. bdnews
