 BEIJING, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China told companies to cooperate with state control of the Internet on Thursday, showing no sign of giving ground on censorship after US Internet giant Google threatened to quit the country. The case could exacerbate tensions between China and the United States, already at odds over the value of the yuan currency, trade disputes and climate change negotiations. It threw a spotlight on hacking and the Internet controls which have frustrated Google's business in China.

He Ye, a woman at the vigil, said finding alternative news would become more difficult if Google pulled out of China. "If I cannot search for it through Google, I feel I lose a part of my life. So if Google pulls out, it will affect a part of my life," she said. SECURE COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke urged China on Wednesday to ensure a "secure" commercial environment for US companies. "The recent cyber intrusion that Google attributes to China is troubling to the US government and American companies doing business in China," Locke said in a statement. "This incident should be equally troubling to the Chinese government.
