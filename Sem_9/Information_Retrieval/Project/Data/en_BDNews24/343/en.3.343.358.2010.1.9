 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has wished her long-term political rival prime minister Sheikh Hasina success on her tour to India, and urged her to secure commitments from New Delhi for the best interests of Bangladesh. Khaleda made the statement at a press conference on Saturday on the eve of Hasina's departure for crucial bilateral talks with her counterpart Manmohan Singh in her first visit to India since becoming prime minister for a second time last year. The opposition leader urged the prime minister not to sign any treaty for suppression of Indian separatists and to be cautious on other issues. In a long statement, Khaleda suggested the prime minister maintain the best interests of the country about rightful share of water, demarcation of sea limits, life and environment saving policies, enclaves issue and border disputes, the 'corridor' issue, and trade deficit, among the issues. Regarding proposed security deals with India, she said, "Indian security forces are entering Bangladesh and taking away leaders of 'rebel' groups without bar." "I hope that the prime minister will raise the question of our security in light of developing friendly relations. If she signs a treaty between the two countries regarding this, then ... security of our own citizens will also be hampered." Khaleda opined that this sort of treaty is not positive for the security of any of the countries involved. The BNP chairperson was speaking a day after Awami League general secretary and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam brought an allegation against Khaleda's former government for assisting Pakistan in supporting banned Indian separatist outfit ULFA. BNP termed the allegation "irresponsible" and urged the minister to prove it. b
