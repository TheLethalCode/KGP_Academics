 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)--Finance minister A M A Muhith has said Bangladesh needs more foreign aid. Replying to a question in parliament, the minister said Bangladesh deserves more foreign aid as the country was under colonial rule for about two centuries. "We invest 24 percent of our national income in our development projects. Two to three percent of our development programmes (funding) comes in foreign aid," Muhith told parliament replying to a question from Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal MP Moinuddin Khan Badal. "I think foreign aid should continue and increase," Muhith said and added the overseas development assistance should at least be five percent of the national income. "We have to increase the expenditure for development programmes to 30 percent for more development," he said.
