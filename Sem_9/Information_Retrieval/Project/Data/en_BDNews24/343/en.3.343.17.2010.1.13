 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Netherlands will continue its support to Bangladesh, especially in water management, sharing its own experience of being at the heart of a European delta, the Dutch ambassador said. The Dutch ambassador, AJAJMG (Alphons) Hennekens, told a seminar on Wednesday that his country, being a low-lying country, faces situations similar to Bangladesh and has attained considerable technical experience in fighting the sea. He pointed out that the major rivers of Bangladesh carry over one billion tonnes of sediment every year which were gradually silting up the riverbeds and coastal areas of the country. The Netherlands has been supporting Bangladesh since 1975 in different water development projects, including river management, Hennekens said. "In future, we want to continue support Bangladesh in its water sector and help develop its climate change adaptation programme," the Dutch envoy told the seminar on river dredging held at a city hotel. Bangladesh will soon initiate a massive programme of dredging its major rivers to extract around 3,276 lakh cubic metres of silts at an estimated cost of Tk 11,470 crore. Prime minster Sheikh Hasina has recently given necessary instructions to the Public Works Department (PWD) in this regard, officials said. Abdur Razzaq, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources, said the country needs to dredge its major rivers which are gradually dying, and causing recurrent floods and disrupting water transports. But the country lacks necessary technology and adequate dredging capacity to take care of some 230 rivers, 57 of which are trans-boundary rivers, he pointed out. Razzak has asked the Dutch government and other developed countries to help Bangladesh in facing the challenge of climate change and different adverse effects of natural disasters. Abdur Rahim, a former BUET teacher, currently working for IHC Merwede, a Dutch company dealing in dredging equipment, observed that the dredging contractors in Bangladesh are not equipped with modern tools for major river works. The seminar, organised by IHC Merwede, also discussed dredging developments around the world, cost effective and sustainable dredging technology, shipping and finance of equipment, and training in this connection
