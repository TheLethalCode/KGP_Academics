 Savar, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Roads and Highways Department started building long-demanded speed breakers on the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Dhamrai on Wednesday, after college students blockaded the main route for several hours in protest at a fatal road accident earlier in the week. Dhamrai police chief Alamgir Hossain said the agitating students of Dhamrai Government Degree College lifted their blockade as soon as the R&H workers started their work. The students had blocked the highway since morning demanding speed breakers be built at Dhamrai Bus Stand following the death of a fellow student in the road accident three days ago. Hundreds of vehicles had been stranded on both sides of the highway since morning due to the blockade. Last Sunday, HSC student Murad Hossain was killed near the bus stand when a speeding bus knocked him down. The protesting students said authorities had repeatedly assured them of building speed breakers on the highway, in the vicinity of the college, but had failed to put them in place till Wednesday. bdnews2
