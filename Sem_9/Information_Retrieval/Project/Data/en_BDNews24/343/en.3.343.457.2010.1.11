 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton heads to the South Pacific this week, working to boost key US alliances while pressing Japan to resolve a damaging dispute over a critical US military base. Clinton's nine-day trip will start in Hawaii -- where she will meet Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on Tuesday -- and proceed to Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, all of which have warm links with the Obama administration. China is not on the itinerary, but will nevertheless be on the agenda as President Barack Obama's top diplomat seeks to assess how old US allies are grappling with Beijing's growing economic and military might in the region. "Any major power in the western Asia Pacific region is wrestling with the rise of China: what that means for its own politics, its own foreign policy, its own economy," said Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at Washington's Brookings Institution.

Hatoyama's new Democratic Party government has sought to strike a more independent foreign policy and is stalling on plans to relocate the Futenma base on Okinawa island, frustrating Washington. US officials say Clinton will press Okada to pledge to uphold a 2006 plan to move the base to a less crowded part of Okinawa -- rather than off the island entirely as many Okinawans demand -- although few are expecting any immediate breakthroughs. "We just hope that they can come to some resolution on this as quickly as possible so that we can get back on track," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters. ENVIRONMENT, TRADE -- AND AFGHANISTAN Clinton will also give a speech on US Asia-Pacific policy before going to Papua New Guinea, where she will highlight environmental issues as the Obama administration keeps a focus on climate change after last month's rocky Copenhagen summit. Clinton's next two stops in New Zealand and Australia should be easier, although the US-led war in Afghanistan, nuclear and trade issues will all be on the table along with frank discussions about China and the dea
