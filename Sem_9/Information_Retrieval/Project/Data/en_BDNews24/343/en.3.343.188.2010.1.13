 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has set Jan 24 for a hearing on review petitions of Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, two of the five former officers who face impending death sentences for the 1975 murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Mozammel Hossain set the date on Wednesday on a plea filed by the prosecution for quick hearing of the petitions. Huda and Mohiuddin filed petitions earlier in the week for review of the Supreme Court judgment that upheld death sentence of the five. Another convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan filed review petition Tuesday, his counsel Abdur Rezzak Khan told reporters on Wednesday. Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and another convict Mohiuddin Ahmed have also submitted clemency pleas to the presidentwhile Shahriar Rashid Syed and the fifth death row convict in the case Faruque Rahman have not sought clemency yet. Faruque has not yet filed a review petition either, nor has Mohiuddin Ahmed. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque told reporters in the court that the deadline for submission of review petitions is Jan 19, according to the law. If the remaining two convicts file review petitions by this period, hearing on all of them will be held on Jan 24, he said. Haque said the lawyers for the three convicts would also have to give explanation why they had submitted clemency petitions prior to filing review petitions. Haque earlier in the week, however, said that there is no problem in running both mercy petitions and review petitions concurrently. Meanwhile, Abdullah Al Mamun, lawyer for Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, denied on Wednesday that his clients had sought clemency. Their family members also said they had no knowledge of the pleas. Mamun said his clients could not submit mercy pleas without knowledge of counsel or family. "I don't know how they filed mercy petitions being in custody, without our knowledge or involvement. It seems they must have been forced to do so," he said. The Supreme Court, in a long-pending judgment, rejected appeals of the five jailed killers on Nov 19 last year, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3 this year, Dhaka district and sessions judge signed and sent death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. b
