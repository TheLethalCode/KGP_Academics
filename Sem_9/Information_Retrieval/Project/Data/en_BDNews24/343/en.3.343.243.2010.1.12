<TEXT>
 January 12, (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now on a state visit to India, hoped that entrepreneurs of the two countries would exploit the seamless opportunities to promote bilateral economic cooperation. She said that time has come to boost bilateral cooperation to a higher level where entrepreneurs should come forward to invest for their mutual benefits. Hasina was addressing a luncheon organised by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the apex body of Indian business lobbies, at Hotel Maurya Sheraton in New Delhi on Tuesday. The prime minister was optimistic that her current mission to New Delhi would help motivate business communities of India and Bangladesh to forge greater cooperation. On the second day of her much-hyped four-day tour of India, Hasina assured Indian businessmen of 'all possible assistance and cooperation'. "I also call upon Bangladeshi business community to take advantage of the new opportunities to increase their business activities with India." Hasina said Bangladesh and India were friends and neighbours bound together by geographic proximity, shared history, common values, and ways of life that helped to foster the best of relations between the two nations. "An inevitable aspect of this relationship has been mutually benefiting economic cooperation. This, however, is a continuous process that increases with the passage of time." Hasina said she believed that the present time has been an auspicious one for boosting this cooperation to a higher pitch. She noted that the initiatives taken by India, resulting in the conclusion of the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement, and the renewal of the Trade Agreement between the two countries, had significant potentials for more ambitious economic and investment related initiatives. "It is now urgent to further promote trade and investment between our two countries." Alluding at different tariff and non-tariff barriers that hindered Bangladeshi exports to India, Hasina said that neighbours should remove "avoidable hindrances; initiate long pending trade facilitation measures; ease movement of businessmen and professionals; and put in place settlement mechanisms to avoid snags, which may arise due to differences on specific trade related matters." She said, "Bangladesh would certainly appreciate India's favourable response to further duty free access to Bangladeshi commodities to the Indian market, removal of non-tariff barriers, and improvement of trade infrastructures on the Indian side of the borders." She said both the countries had agreed to open border markets 'for the benefit of our peoples, living in remote areas on either side along the border'. Among others, Indian trade and commerce minister Anand Sharma, former FICCI president Shekhar Datta, ASSOCHAM chairman Harinder Sikka and Bharti Enterprises managing director Rajan Bharti Mittal were present. b
