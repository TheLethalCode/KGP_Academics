 New Delhi, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)--As prime minister Sheikh Hasina landed in New Delhi, India on Sunday said that it was committed to help Bangladesh become a major partner of its own growth story. "India remains committed to provide substantial assistance to Bangladesh to become a major partner in its economic development," India's foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said in a statement just before Hasina's arrival. Hasina flew in to New Delhi by a special aircraft of Biman Bangladesh Airlines. She landed at the Indian Air Force Station Palam near the Indira Gandhi International Airport. She was accorded a warm welcome at the airport by India's minister of state for external affairs Preeneet Kaur and other senior officials of the Indian government. She was later driven to the Maurya Sheraton Hotels. Indian president Pratibha Patil, prime minister Manmohan Singh and other dignitaries would ceremonially welcome her on the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan early on Monday. The Indian foreign secretary expressed hope that Hasina's visit would be a "path-breaking one" and give both the countries a historic opportunity "to build a new and forward looking relationship". "India is committed to working with the Government of Bangladesh to build on our historical and traditionally close links and open new vistas in our bilateral relations," said Rao. "We are addressing an entire range of developmental issues of direct interest to Bangladesh including railway infrastructure, transportation, dredging, power grid interconnectivity, human resource development and investment and trade," she said. Rao said that Bangladesh had welcomed India's decision to provide it transit facilities to Nepal and Bhutan. "We seek to revive those physical and emotional links which remain disrupted since independence," she added. She also said that New Delhi would seek Dhaka's "understanding and cooperation" on India's "security and connectivity needs". New Delhi is confident that prime minister Hasina's visit would serve to underline that strong relation between India and Bangladesh are vital, not just for both the countries, but also for the entire region and the international community, she added. Rao said India and Bangladesh would sign five agreements for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, transfer of sentenced persons, combating international terrorism, organized crime and illegal drug trafficking, power cooperation and a cultural exchange programme during Hasina's visit. The prime minister will meet Singh at 5:30pm (Indian Standard Time) on Monday for delegation-level talks. The agreements will be signed after the meeting. Singh will also host a banquet in honour of Hasina. Hasina will be awarded the prestigious Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development for 2009 by the Indian president on Tuesday.
