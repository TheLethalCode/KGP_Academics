 WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai denied on Tuesday the United States had ever given his country a "blank check" but said he was grateful for the "little money" sent by Washington to Afghanistan. In an interview with ABC News, Karzai was asked how he felt when he heard US President Barack Obama criticize his government last month for being corrupt and vow there would no longer be a "blank check" for US assistance. "We really never had a blank check," Karzai said. "But we're grateful even for the little money that's come to Afghanistan, even for the little help that's come to Afghanistan." "We have no right over the American people to pay for us or to help us. This is our country. We must protect it ourselves and provide for it ourselves," Karzai said. "So help from America is welcome.

"In a sense ... that exit date is good for us," he said. "It pushes us to harder work, to strengthen our forces, to train our forces, to be realistic about life in Afghanistan and to think many times over of how better we can use our own resources and live with our own means and protect our own country." Karzai said he knew "America will not be completely out in another 18 months or 15 months." "We know the U.S. and our other allies will be with us for many more years to come," he said. "But even then, Afghanistan needs to be a self-sustaining country in all aspects of the needs of ... this countr
