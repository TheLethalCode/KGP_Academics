 Dhaka, Jan11 (bdnews24.com)--A newborn was reportedly stolen on Monday from Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Father of the boy child, Noman Khan, a motor workshop owner said, he admitted his wife Salma Begum(28) to ward No 17 of DMCH around 2pm on Sunday after she felt labour pain. Noman said his wife 'Salma' gave birth to the baby at around 3pm and the mother and the child were were given an extra bed in the verandah near the ward. On Sunday night, an unknown woman developed intimacy and shared the bed with her, he said. On waking up at 8am, Salma discovered the baby was missing and so was the woman. Noman informed the DMCH police camp of the incident and then made a written complaint to hospital authorities. But hospital director brigadier general Bazle Kader told bdnews24.com that he did not know of the incident. In-charge of police camp, sub-inspector Abdul Kuddus, said, "On receiving complaint, we visited the spot and informed Shahbagh police of it." Investigation is underway after a general diary was lodged with Shahbagh police, he said.
