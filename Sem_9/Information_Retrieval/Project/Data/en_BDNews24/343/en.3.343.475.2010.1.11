 Your Excellency Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you and your distinguished delegation to India. We are delighted that the first State visit of the new year is by a valued friend and close neighbour of India's. Excellency, You are no stranger to India. Your life and struggles are a source of inspiration not only to the people of Bangladesh but to many around the world who cherish democracy, freedom and independence. We admire your courage and conviction, and your unwavering belief in the principles you uphold, for which you have personally sacrificed so much. Your Excellency, you lead a country with strong democratic and cultural traditions. Bangladesh has led the way in South Asia in important areas of human development. We meet today as two vibrant and equal democracies that share common values and common goals. The bonds between us are rich and suffused with history. There is very little that divides us. There is much that unites us. The links between us extend to every aspect of human life, be it social, economic, cultural, intellectual or political. Excellency, Relations with Bangladesh are of the highest priority for India. India stands ready to be a full and equal partner in the realisation of your vision of social change and economic development for Bangladesh. India seeks to build a new future with Bangladesh. The time has come to chart a new path. We are ready to pursue a bold vision for our relations, based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. Our two peoples want peace, security and prosperity. We should move forward to achieve these common goals for ourselves and for all the people of South Asia. Your visit will open a new chapter in our relations. We have finalised several initiatives to build a true partnership of friendship and cooperation. We have agreed on the importance of showing sensitivity to each other's concerns. We have agreed to cooperate in meeting the common challenges of climate change, and assuring food, water and energy security to our peoples. Excellency, India and Bangladesh are fortunate to have produced some of the finest writers, scholars and artists. The works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam have inspired generations of people. This is a unique asset which binds our people, and which we must preserve. Before I conclude, allow me to extend my heartiest felicitations to you on the conferment of the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development for 2009, which you richly deserve. I wish you, your family and the distinguished members of your delegation a very pleasan
