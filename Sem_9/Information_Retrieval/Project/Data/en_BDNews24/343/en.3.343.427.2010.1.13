 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The National Garments Worker Federation has demanded annulment of labour law amendments, which they say serve only the interests of factory owners, many of whom are serving members of parliament. "The labourers will not be the beneficiaries. Rather, those amendments will promote the owners to break laws," federation president Amirul Haq Amin said in a press briefing at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium on Wednesday. Amin also said the government is yet to execute its election pledges of fair wages and proper benefits. The labour federation says passing amendments to two sections of the Labour Act 2006 has drastically reduced punishment for industry owners who violate the law. Section 306 reduces maximum prison term from six to three months for those willingly hampering investigation into workplace violations. Section 307 reduces maximum penalty from three months imprisonment to Tk 5,000 for defying any part of the labour law. Federation leaders claimed that amending the 2006 labour law in such a way, the government has served the interests of at least 30 MPs who are also garments industry owners. They said 7,849 cases were filed with seven labour courts up to 2009. Among those, only 41 cases involved complaints by owners; the other 7,808 cases were filed by workers. Labour leaders Shafia Pervin, Faruk Khan, Nurun Nahar, Sultana Akhter, Arjuara Begum, Arifa Akhter were also present at the briefing, among the others. bdn
