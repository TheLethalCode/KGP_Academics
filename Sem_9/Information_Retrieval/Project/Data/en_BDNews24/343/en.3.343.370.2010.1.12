 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Tuesday criticised the signing of extradition treaty and a MoU on importing power from India during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's ongoing tour. Bangladesh will not benefit from either, rather it will become a market for India, secretary- general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said. He was speaking at a rally before a procession was brought out to mark Jan 11, 2007 changeover which BNP marked 'Black Day'. Tuesday was the last day of the main opposition party's two-day observance programmes. "We don't see any gain from the prime minister's visit to India," Delwar said. Pointing to the extradition treaty, he said, "Indian insurgents were handed to them without such a treaty being in place." On the Memorandum of Understanding on importing power, the secretary-general said: "Importing power from India rather than producing it in the country will only benefit the neighbouring country." He also alleged that the government is extending all facilities to India to satisfy them and was critical of the prime minister's 'failure' to do anything on fair share of waters of the Ganges and Teesta rivers during her visit. Delwar called on the people to unite under the leadership of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and said, "BNP will not allow compromise with the country's independence and sovereignty." He also threatened to wage a street agitation against the government, which he claimed has made things in the country worse. b
