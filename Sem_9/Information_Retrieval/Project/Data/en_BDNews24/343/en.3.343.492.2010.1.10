 Chittagong, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Cherie Blair, internationally renowned lawyer and wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair, handed out fellowships at Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong on Saturday, saying society's best investment is educating women. She said women would play a crucial role in development around the world in the 21st century, in her address at the ceremony to distribute the fellowships under the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women to ten AUW students of the Asian University for Women. Blair also praised the Bangladeshi education system that encouraged girl students from primary level. In Europe and America, most students in universities are females, she said. In Britain, nearly half the workforce in the law sector is female, she added. But in many Asian countries, Blair said, the full educational potential of women was not fulfilled. She hoped that AUW would play a crucial role in reaching that target. Vice chancellor Hoon Eng Khoo and members of the university's executive committee were present among others. bdnew
