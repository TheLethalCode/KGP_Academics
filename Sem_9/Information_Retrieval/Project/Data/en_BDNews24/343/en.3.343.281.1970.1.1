<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court has rejected a motion filed by former army chief Moeen U Ahmed for dismissal of a Tk 100 crore defamation suit, a lawyer said on Sunday. Former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku filed the defamation suit against Moeen in July, last year. The order clears the way for case proceedings to continue, Sanjit Kumar Saha, lawyer for Moeen, told reporters after the rejection. Third joint district judge S M Saiful Islam gave the order and set Jan 31 to hear a petition by Tuku for impounding the ex-army chief's property. On Mar 27, 2007, Gen Moeen at a gathering was reported to have made allegations of "massive corruption" in the power ministry when Tuku was state minister there. Moeen had reportedly said "at least Tk 20,000 crore" was siphoned out of the country from the power sector alone during the BNP government. Tuku is claiming Tk 100 crore in damages, for the reportedly defamatory statements made against him by the then army chief at what was a reception for freedom fighters in March 2007. Moeen was appointed army chief in 2005, during the term of the BNP-led government; the subsequent caretaker administration extended his tenure by a year. b
