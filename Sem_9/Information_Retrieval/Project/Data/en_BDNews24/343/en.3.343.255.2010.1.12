 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)----Dhaka Metropolitan Police are preparing a list of young criminals in the wake of rising juvenile crimes. Commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque said on Tuesday officers in charge of police stations have been given one month to complete the area-based list of criminals. At a media briefing after a monthly meeting on crime at Police Telecom Auditorium at Rajarbagh in Dhaka, he said juveniles are increasingly getting involved in different crimes like teasing female students and paddling drugs. Senior police officials including chief of different police stations attended the programme. Some criminal groups are using them to carry weapons and collect ransom, the commissioner said, adding that often they are perpetrating the crimes without their guardians knowing about them. On completion of the lists, the juveniles will be given opportunity to amend themselves in consultation with their guardians, he said and added that community police will work to bring them back on the right track through counseling. If all efforts go in vain, legal action will be taken against them, the capital's police chief said. Asked how many criminals have fled abroad, he said 18 enlisted criminals are staying outside the country. b
