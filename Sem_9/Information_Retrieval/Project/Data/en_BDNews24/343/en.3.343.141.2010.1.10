 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka were all out for 213 in 46.1 overs against India in their tri-series one-day match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka Sunday. Opting to bat, they lost six wickets for 84 runs inside 20 overs. Skipper Kumar Sangakkara and Suraj Randiv made the only notable scores (68 and 56) to give the total some respectability. The opening pair of Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan didn't last long as Tharanga edged to first slip for a four-ball duck. Dilshan, who moved to a breezy 33 off only 17 balls with eight fours, was out in the sixth over to leave the score 42-2.

He also put on 59 runs for the next wicket with Thilan Thushara (28). Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra shared six wickets for India.

And because Sri Lanka were expecting to field in the dew, they brought in an extra pace bowler, Chanaka Welegedara, in place of Malinga Bandara. India, on the other hand, rang in the changes: Dinesh Karthik for Virender Sehwag, Sudeep Tyagi for Ashish Nehra, and Amit Mishra for Harbhajan Singh. Sri Lanka already qualified for the Jan 13 final having won three mat
