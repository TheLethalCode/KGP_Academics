 Islamabad, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani security force spokesman said Indian forces fired across the border on Friday believing Pakistani troops had fired rockets into their territory, but an Indian official denied the charge. No one was hurt in the firing at Wagah, on the border between Amritsar and the Pakistani city of Lahore, the Pakistan spokesman said, but Pakistan's border force is to lodge a protest. An official of India's Border Security Force (BSF) said four rockets were fired from the Pakistan side just after midnight on Friday. "We have taken this up strongly with Pakistan," K. Srinivasan, Deputy Inspector General of BSF told Reuters. "We don't know whether they are Pakistan army, but in all probability it looks like they were fired by militants as the rockets do not seem to be regular army weapons." The BSF denied firing into Pakistan. Armies of the two nuclear-armed rivals used to frequently exchange fire across the Line of Control demarcating the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, but firing across their mutually recognised border has been rare. Both countries agreed on a ceasefire at the Line of Control in Kashmir in 2003 and that has largely held. India suspended a five-year-old peace process with Pakistan after an assault on Mumbai by Pakistan-based militants in November 2008
