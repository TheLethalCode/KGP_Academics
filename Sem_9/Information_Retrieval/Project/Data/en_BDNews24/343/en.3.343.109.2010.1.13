 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith has given 26 state-owned enterprises (SoEs) six months to be get ready to offload their shares in the capital market. "I've asked the enterprises to be securitised, meaning their readiness to offload shares, in six months," he told reporters after a meeting at his ministry on Wednesday. The minister said shares of some enterprises would be offloaded to the market during the time. The enterprises include Bangladesh Telecommunications Ltd (BTCL), Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, Bangabandhu Bridge, Bakhrabad Gas Systems Ltd, Sylhet Gas Fields Ltd, Gas Transmission Co Ltd, Bangladesh Services Ltd (holding company of Dhaka Sheraton Hotel) and Essential Drugs Co Ltd. Muhith said preparation is also going on to offload the government stakes in multinational Unilever Bangladesh Ltd in six months. As per the contract, the government has to approach Unilever first to sell its stakes. "We would prefer to offload the shares in the capital market rather than sell back to Unilever," he added. The government's stake in Unilever Bangladesh is 39.2 percent. He said the capital market expanded substantially in last one year with capitalisation rising to 30 percent of national income. "We need to ensure the best utilisation of the money. New listings are necessary for that." Muhith commented shares of many companies have now been overvalued. To a question, he said valuation of assets of some of the SoEs has been completed. Bangladesh Shipping Corporation is now in a position to offload shares, he added. The minister criticised the SoEs' attitude to not go public as 'stupidity'. "They seek 40 crore (400 million) taka from the government in capital even though they can easily raise 200 crore taka from the capital market. The government in 2005 took initiatives to offload 62 nationalised enterprises' shares, but the number was later reduced to 38. Cases are pending over offloading shares of six other SoEs including Hotal Sonargaon while 17 SoEs have so far been listed on the stock market. b
