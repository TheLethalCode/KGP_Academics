 LONDON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Labour Party rallied round Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Monday after a failed leadership coup, applauding his pledge to use economic recovery as the basis of a looming election campaign. Days after surviving a plot to depose him less than five months before an election, Brown re-asserted his control over his restive party at a meeting of Labour MPs. But a new opinion poll brought bad news for Brown. The Populus poll for The Times newspaper showed the opposition Conservatives stretching their lead over Labour to 13 points. The poll of 1,509 people, taken over the weekend, showed Brown's Labour Party on 28 percent, down two points from last month, with the Conservatives on 41 percent, up three points. Nevertheless, Brown voiced confidence Labour could achieve a fourth consecutive election victory. "We can win, we must win and we will win," an aide quoted Brown as telling legislators at a packed, closed-door meeting interrupted several times by applause and banging of tables as a sign of approval. Participants said there were no dissenting voices as Labour politicians backed Brown. Brown sketched out Labour's election campaign, stressing he planned to base it on his efforts to lead Britain through the worst recession in more than 50 years. "This hard-won economic recovery will be our platform for victory," the aide quoted Brown as saying. WEAKENED AUTHORITY Britain has lagged most other major economies in emerging from recession, but analysts expect growth to have resumed in the fourth quarter of 2009 after a 6 percent drop in output. Two former cabinet ministers called for a secret ballot of Labour lawmakers last week to decide if Brown should lead the party into the election, due by June. The plot quickly failed. But several cabinet ministers' initial lukewarm support for Brown has undermined his authority, already weakened by previous bouts of dissent. The aide quoted Brown as telling the meeting Labour had a better plan than the centre-right Conservatives for reducing the ballooning public sector deficit, forecast to reach 178 billion pounds this year. Brown said Labour promised fair taxes, cuts in non-priority areas and to protect front-line services such as health and education. He accused the Conservatives of putting the recovery and public services at risk by wanting to go further and faster on deficit-cutting, according to the aide. Brown's pledge of spending cuts -- a word he usually avoids -- lends credence to speculation that one result of the failed coup was to force him to bow to Chancellor Alistair Darling and accept a tougher deficit-cutting line. Brown addressed criticism that he does not work well with other people by stressing he was a team player. He was flanked by three senior cabinet ministers who will play leading campaign roles -- Harriet Harman, Peter Mandelson and Douglas Alexander. "I am not a team of one. I am one of a team," Brown said. The two former cabinet ministers who called for the ballot, Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt, did not attend the meeting. Labour politician Stephen Pound said one or two people associated with the rebels were present but did not speak. "There is no appetite whatsoever for any more of this self-indulgent treachery," he told the
