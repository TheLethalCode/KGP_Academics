 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Both India and Sri Lanka are aiming for a good show and are playing down the toss factor in the final of the Idea Cup tri-series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. During a pre-match briefing at the stadium on Tuesday, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said he hoped his side would find form after losing their last league-phase match against India. "We don't want to dwell on what happened in our previous meeting. We are ready to play the final match and want to put in our level best. If we can achieve that then the right result will come. "The key to performing in a final is putting runs on the board then bowl and field effectively. Obviously, individual performances add to the team's success on the day. But even if a player can give 100 per cent, the team can still lose the game. So, it is important that we all perform as a unit," he said. Going into the final Sri Lanka won three matches when Sangakkara won the toss and decided to bat second. The only exception was the last league-phase match when they experimented by batting first and paid for it. But the Lankan captain still believed that it was not impossible to win even if a side batted first. "If we can make a decent score like 270 or 280 then bowl a good line and length, it is very possible to win the final." He commended the performances of the younger members of the side and was confident they would shine in the final. India vice-captain Virender Sehwag was equally happy with his side's performance in the tournament. "We played good cricket against Sri Lanka in the last two series. So, obviously will be hoping to win the final. We want to deliver our best cricket. "No-one can win all their matches. We lost our first one then won the second match. We are on the right track and will do well." Sehwag who missed the last match said he was expected to play in the final. "The team management allowed me to rest for the last few days. Now I am refreshed and ready to play in the final," he added
