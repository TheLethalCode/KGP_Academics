 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has dismissed an allegation of a meeting between former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf and ULFA leader Anup Chetia during the previous four-party government, terming the statement made by Awami League leader Syed Ashraful Islam "irresponsible". BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said: "A leader of his (Ashraf's) stature should not have made such an irresponsible statement." "He shouldn't make such a light comment," Delwar told reporters at a BNP programme at Zia Rahman's graveside on Saturday. He demanded that Ashraf make public any documents supporting his claim. Ashraf, Awami League general secretary and local government minister, said on Friday that the previous BNP-led coalition government had arranged a meeting between Musharraf and Chetia in Dhaka in 2002. He made the claim at a roundtable on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's forthcoming India visit and Bangladesh-India bilateral relations. "Pervez Musharraf had a one and a half hours meeting with detained UFLA leader Anup Chetia at his hotel room during a visit when BNP and [Jamaat-e-Islami] were in power," he told the roundtable held at the National Press Club. "You can guess what was discussed in such long meeting." Pakistan military ruler Musharraf visited Bangladesh in July 2002. Secretary general of the secessionist organisation, Chetia has been detained in a Bangladesh jail since his arrest in 1998. bd
