 New Delhi, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bharti Airtel announced on Tuesday it had agreed to buy a 70 percent stake of Bangladesh's Warid Telecom, in a deal that could total $1 billion. The deal was announced as Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was addressing a luncheon organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the apex body of Indian business lobbies, at Hotel Maurya Sheraton in New Delhi on Tuesday. "This landmark deal underlines our intent to further expand our operations to international markets where we can implant our unique business model and offer quality and affordable telecom services," said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of the Bharti Airtel. Mittal said that the deal was also a symbol of the growing economic cooperation between the South Asian countries. He thanked the governments of India and Bangladesh for their support and encouragement. Warid Telecom, Bangladesh's fourth largest telecom company, is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dhabi Group, offering mobile services across all the 64 districts of Bangladesh and has a total customer base of over 2.9 million. Under the agreement announced on Tuesday, Bharti Airtel said it will make a fresh investment of US $300 million to rapidly expand the operations of Warid Telecom and will have management and board control of the company. This is the largest investment in Bangladesh by an Indian company. Bharti Airtel also termed Bangladesh "one of the few remaining large growth markets". "Bangladesh, with a population of over 160 million and teledensity of 32% is a very promising market for telecom services. Bharti is keen to work in Bangladesh and contribute to achieving the vision of Digital Bangladesh even sooner than 2021," said the Bharti Airtel chief. Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Authority approved Bharti Airtel's investment in Warid Telecom earlier this month. Dhabi Group will continue as a strategic partner retaining 30% shareholding and have their nominees on the board of the Warid Telecom. Mittal said that the acquisition by Bharti Airtel would be partly funded by purchase of existing shares held in Warid Telecom International Limited by Dhabi Group for a nominal consideration and balance by way of issue of fresh shares at par. "The new funding will be utilised for expansion of the network, both for coverage and capacity, and introduction of innovative products and services. As a result of this additional investment, the overall investment in the company will be in the region of USD 1 billion," he said. In a statemnt issued by Bharti Airtel, HH Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, the chairman of the Dhabi Group, said: "We are pleased to partner Bharti Airtel and believe this partnership will bring benefits to all stakeholders, most importantly the customers of Warid Telecom." "The telecom market in Bangladesh has immense growth potential and Bharti Airtel's rich experience and product portfolio promise to redefine this market." "We are confident that this partnership will help establish the company as a leading player in the Bangladesh telecom industry," said Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan. The deal will pave the way for Bharti Airtel to launch its second operation outside India. The company had launched its mobile services in Sri Lanka in January 2009 on a state-of-the-art 3.5 G network. The company crossed the 1 million customers mark in Sri Lanka within six months of launch on the back of innovative offerings as well as rapid expansion of network coverage and distribution. bdne
