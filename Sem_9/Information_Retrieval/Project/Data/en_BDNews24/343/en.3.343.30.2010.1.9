 KABUL, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai submitted a list of cabinet nominees to parliament on Saturday, omitting all the 17 candidates rejected by the house last week in an apparent concession to lawmakers. By excluding all of the candidates thrown out by parliament, Karzai could smooth the way for agreement with parliamentarians, who stunned him last week by vetoing more than two-thirds of his initial list of 24 names.

The palace had earlier said it could resubmit some of the rejected candidates in new portfolios. The new list contained 16 names, including Karzai's security advisor Zalmay Rasul nominated to the previously unfilled post of foreign minister.

"Your vote of confidence or rejection is highly respected." Lawmakers will question candidates before voting can take place, a process that took more than a week for the original 24. Parliament's rejection of most of Karzai's first slate was a major political blow to a man who has been Afghanistan's leader since U.S.-backed Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in late 2001.
