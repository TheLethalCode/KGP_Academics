 ATHENS, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French striker Djibril Cisse has rediscovered his "scoring instinct" at Greek side Panathinaikos but said he was not feeling any pressure to win an international recall. With 15 goals in 17 league matches this season as he spearheads the club's bid for a first Super League title in five years, the 28-year-old former Liverpool striker is showing form which could win him a place in the French World Cup squad. Cisse has not played for France since the Euro 2008 qualifiers. "I am very happy," Cisse told French TV channel Canal Plus. "Panathinaikos is a big club and already I have managed to score 15 goals in 17 games. The Greek championship has allowed me to find my scoring instinct again. "I don't feel any pressure," Cisse added. "I have not had any contact with the national team coach or anyone else involved in the set-up for the last 18 months. "There is a reason for that of course as I was not playing well enough and was having problems. This is no longer the case though." Cisse spent last season on loan at English Premier League club Sunderland where he netted 11 goals in 38 appearances. Thierry Henry, Nicolas Anelka, Karim Benzema, Sidney Govou and Andre-Pierre Gignac were selected ahead of him during France's World Cup qualifying camp
