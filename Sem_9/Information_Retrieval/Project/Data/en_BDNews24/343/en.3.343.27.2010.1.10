 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for housing Abdul Mannan Khan on Sunday asked real-estate developers not to apply for approval of development projects before they had ownership of the project land. "First ensure ownership and then approach me. I will give project approval within 15 days," he told officials of Bangladesh Land Developers Association (BLDA) who met him at his office. Khan came down hard on land developers who published advertisements to sell plots just after booking the land, without waiting for any official approval of the projects or even completing the ownership process. The state minister urged the real-estate businesses to give up their "land-grabbing behaviour". He said: "Even a single bigha of cultivable land will be rare in the capital within a few years if the present rate of housing sector development continues. So we have to construct high-rise buildings in a planned way to accommodate the increasing number people on less land." "We have finalised the new building code that is now under process to be placed in parliament as a bill," Khan said. BLDA president, also chairman of the Basundhara Group, Ahmed Akber Sobhan, vice-president Enamul Haque and secretary general Mostafa Mahiuddin, and REHAB president Tanvirul Haque Probal also spoke at the meeting. bdnews
