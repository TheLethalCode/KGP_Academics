 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a committee to move on special deployment of police for greater security and to curb unrest in the country's four industrial zones. "We are moving to deploy industrial police as soon as possible to reduce restlessness in the sector, particularly in garment factories," home minister Sahara Khatun said on Wednesday. A seven-member committee, headed by an additional home secretary, has been asked to submit full report by Feb 28 on deployment of the special police, the Sahara told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat. Sahara said authorities would decide next steps after getting the report. "Before deploying a dedicated industrial police force, we will initially provide more ordinary police at Ashulia, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Chittagong industrial zones," she said. There has long been a demand for industrial police among factories and businesses of industrial zones. The prime minister pledged rapid deployment of special police last year following several serious incidents of labour unrest among garment workers. POLICE RECRUITMENT State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku, who also attended the meeting, said the government was targeting recruitment of 35,000 new police personnel, including industrial police, over four years. He said 17,000 new recruits would be added by the end of the current year. "After the passage of the Industrial Police Act we will recruit 3,000 industrial police and 32,000 ordinary police personnel within four years" he said. The present government coming to power in January last year announced a plan to swell police ranks by at least 30,000 new members within three years. However, the first recruitment phase fell short of the target for 2009. The targets and the time frame have been extended since. Among others, additional home secretary Golam Hossain and inspector general of police Noor Mohammad were present. bd
