<TEXT>
 MADRID, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Barcelona are in danger of being knocked out of a competition for the first time since April 2008 when they travel to Sevilla for Wednesday's King's Cup last-16 second-leg. Pep Guardiola's side, who won an unprecedented six titles in 2009, must reverse a 2-1 deficit from last week's first leg and failure would see them eliminated from a competition for the first since Manchester United knocked them out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage at the end of April 2008. Guardiola and the players were predictably upbeat about their chances of getting past the Andalusians after Barca's 5-0 thrashing of promoted Tenerife in La Liga on Sunday, their first win in three matches this year.

Goalkeeper and captain Andres Palop is hoping Barca's open, attacking style of play will give his side a better chance of expressing themselves than against defensive teams who look to cause damage on the counter attack. "Barca is a team that wants the ball and creates space and there is a lot of fluidity, as opposed to teams that close play down and have a more destructive style," he said at a news conference on Sunday.
