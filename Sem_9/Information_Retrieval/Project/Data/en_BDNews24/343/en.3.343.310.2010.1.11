 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)The government is thinking of making use of jute mandatory for packaging purposes by enacting law, Jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui told parliament Monday. He said none of the state-owned jute mills will incur loss in the next two years. The minister also said the government should keep the provision of raw jute export until we make full use of jute produced in Bangladesh. "We are considering use of jute mandatory for packaging of food grains, sugar, fertiliser, cement and others," said Siddiqui. Replying to a written question from Awami League MP Nosrul Hamid, the minister informed parliament that process was on to enact a law with the name "Mandatory Packaging Act", which will spur domestic demand for jute and replace harmful polythene. He said the government's food directorate, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation and other bodies have been using jute for packaging. The minister said the government has taken measures to revive the jute mills, closed during the military-backed interim government, in the southwestern region of the country. "All the jute mills in southwestern region will start functioning in the next six months," said the minister. "Unlike previous years, the jute mills will no longer incur loss. "I can say none of the state-owned jute mills will incur loss in the next two years," said Siddiqui. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation has 24 jute mills, most of which cause losses to the public exchequer mainly due to poor management and corruption. The interim administration during 2007-2008 closed down some of the jute mills in the country's southwestern region as per the suggestion from the World Bank sparking movement there. Siddiqui said the government should allow raw jute export too. "We should continue raw jute export until we can make full use of jute produced here," said the minister. The government on December 7 last year banned raw jute export with a view to ensuring smooth supply of raw materials to the jute mills. But on Jan 3, the government lifted the ban in the face of pressure from the jute traders and international buyers. The export prices of raw jute shoot up to US$600 per tonne in 2009 against $525-550 in 2008, according to jute ministry sources. The domestic prices rose to Tk 1,700 to Tk 1,800 per maund (40 kgs). India, Pakistan and Germany are three major buyers of Bangladesh's raw jute.
