 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's shrimp exports still have potential to capture a major part of the European market and enter Japan by ensuring food safety, solving the problem of contamination, an expert from Thailand has said. Bangladesh must also maintain foods standards within the country besides paying attention to exports, Paiboon Ponsuwanna, chairman of Food Industry Club in Thailand, told a workshop in the capital on Saturday. Ponsuwanna said the private sector must come forward faster than the government to ensure quality of shrimps for export. Citing Thailand as the top Asian country in frozen foods export to the EU, ASEAN, USA and Japan, Paiboon said Bangladesh can also enter the Japanese market, a huge and profitable one, if it follows the example of Thailand. Thailand in the last 15 years has made a significant development in food exports as it has been strictly maintaining global standards in production and processing, providing traceability, ensuring worker safety and undertaking corporate social responsibilities, said Paiboon, also the chairman of Thai National Shippers Council. Bangladesh, meanwhile, has been under a self-imposed ban on export of shrimps to the EU, a decision taken on May 2009, after 54 rejections were made from late 2008 to early 2009 due to a 'Rapid Alert' notice, which circulates information on food safety problems among European nations. The alert came for contamination of frozen shrimps by nitrofuran, a toxic antibiotic. Bangladesh was set to ease the ban after initiatives to eliminate contamination of the toxic element began to take hold. Bangladesh also raised doubts against the examination protocol which was later changed. Officials said observations find that the contamination sometimes occurs naturally too. The resumption of shrimp exports is still in limbo due to technicalities, however, though a meeting of the National Working Committee decided to lift the ban from Dec 7. Md Musa Meah, president of Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association, said, "We're ready for shipments now and for securing contracts." Bangladesh earned some $534.07 million, five percent of the total exports, during 2007-08, which shrunk significantly in the last fiscal year due to the ban. An EU delegation will visit Bangladesh next week to see the progress in ensuring contamination-free shrimp export. Mohammed Samsul Kibria, joint secretary of the ministry of fisheries and livestock, in his keynote paper said the farms involved in shrimp processing should be brought under licensing system while the certification system must still be further strengthened. Fisheries secretary Md Sharful Alam said the current problems could only be resolved in cooperation with the active participation of the stakeholders, not by the government alone. Chalermpol Thanchitt, ambassador of Thailand, also attended the workshop and reiterated his government's assistance to boost trade between the two countries. The discussants at the workshop, titled 'Compliance with International Food Security Requirements', stressed on following the footsteps of Thailand regarding shrimp processing and exports. Development partners, shrimp farmers and the stakeholders also joined the workshop jointly organised by directorate of fisheries, BSFF and BFFEA.
