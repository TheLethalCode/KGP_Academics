 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  India ensured their place in the Idea Cup tri-series one-day final with a convincing eight-wicket win over other finalists Sri Lanka at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Sunday. Responding to the Lankans' meagre total of 213, MS Dhoni's side wrapped the game up scoring 214-2 with 104 balls remaining. Both sides will meet in Wednesday's battle-royale. India rode on twin half-centuries from Virat Kohli (71 not out off 68 balls) and Gautam Gambhir (86-ball 71) after opener Dinesh Karthik (48 off 40 balls) gave the side a perfect launch pad putting on 89 runs in 12 overs before being caught behind. Kohli, who scored nine fours, and Yuvraj Singh then added an unbroken 54 runs in quick time to end the islanders' three-game winning streak and also confirm the winners picked up the bonus point. Earlier, Sri Lanka were all out for 213 in 46.1 overs after opting to bat. They lost six wickets for 84 runs inside 20 overs. Only skipper Kumar Sangakkara and Suraj Randiv made notable scores (68 and 56) to give the total some respectability. The opening pair of Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan didn't last long as Tharanga edged to first slip for a four-ball duck. Dilshan, who moved to a breezy 33 off only 17 balls with eight fours, was out in the sixth over to leave the score 42-2. Mahela Jayawardene was caught at short cover for five to make it 60-3 after 10 overs. And shortly afterwards they lost another dependable batsman Thilan Samaraweera lbw for a duck while Thilina Kandamby was run out in the 14th over. Thissara Perera played a reckless big shot and was brilliantly caught in the deep. Kumar Sangakkara made a 78-ball 68 that featured nine fours before top-edging a long hop from Yuvraj Singh. He also featured in a 59-run seventh-wicket stand with Randiv. Randiv, who completed his maiden ODI fifty, was bowled for a 76-ball 56. It contained five fours. He also put on 59 runs for the next wicket with Thilan Thushara (28). Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra shared six wickets for India. Sri Lanka resisted experimenting with the team combination though, and opted for the strongest possible side, with Tillakaratne Dilshan coming back from a groin injury. They brought in an extra pace bowler, Chanaka Welegedara, in place of Malinga Bandara. India, on the other hand, rang in the changes: Dinesh Karthik for Virender Sehwag, Sudeep Tyagi for Ashish Nehra, and Amit Mishra for Harbhajan S
