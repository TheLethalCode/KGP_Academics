<TITLE> Manchester City tell Adebayor to play when he's ready </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor can have as much time off as he needs following the attack on his team in Angola and will not be asked to play for Manchester City until he is ready, his club manager Roberto Mancini said. Adebayor is spending time in Lome, the capital of Togo, for three days of official mourning following last Friday's attack in Angola which left two Togo delegation members dead and prompted the team to withdraw from the African Nations Cup. Adebayor is expected back in England after that but is unlikely to play for City against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Mancini, speaking after City's 4-1 win over Blackburn Rovers Monday, told reporters: "We will speak to him when he returns. "Then we will decide. Whenever he wants to play, whenever he feels ready, that is OK. At the moment, we are just very sorry for him. The situation is incredible." Adebayor has yet to feature for City since Mancini took over as manager from Mark Hughes in mid-December since when City have won all four games they have played. Monday's win over a poor Blackburn side took them to fourth spot in the Premier League table.
