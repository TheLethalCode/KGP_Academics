 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government is increasing power supply to villages during Boro irrigation season, with rolling blackouts to rise in urban areas. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury says the government will go ahead with the intentionally engineered power outage to keep up with the demand even if the townspeople are unhappy. . An inter-ministerial meeting on uninterrupted power supply to irrigation on Wednesday decided to keep nighttime power supply to irrigation pumps uninterrupted during February-May period to ensure bumper Boro production this season. "Power supply to irrigation pumps will be ensured from 11pm to 5am every day, if necessary at the cost of increased load-shedding in the urban areas," she told journalists after presiding over the meeting at her ministry. Boro production target has been fixed at 18.7 million tonnes for this season. The meeting heard that this year Boro production target is 1.87 crore metric tons, which will involve some 2.60 lakh power pumps and some 14.26 lakh diesel pump. As much as 1067 MW electricity will be needed daily for this purpose. On average, the country generates a little more than 4000 MW electricity a day. The minister said use of lights in CNG stations and roadside shops, and air-conditioners would be reduced to meet irrigation sector's increased demand for electricity. "Less power in urban areas to increase supply to rural areas for irrigation may make people angry. But we will do that at the instruction of the prime minister. But we will stick to our decision even if people are mad at us," she said. Prime minister's energy and power adviser Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury, state minister for power Mohammed Enamul Huq, agriculture secretary CQK Mostak Ali, Power Division secretary Abul Kalam Azad, Energy Division secretary Mohammad Mohsin and Seed Wing director general Anwarul Faruque attended the meeting. Matia said the government would subsidise diesel for irrigation facilities this time too, but not in the form of price cut. "Price cut may create opportunity for diesel being smuggling out. So the subsidy would be given to farmers directly through distribution of agriculture cards." Tawfik-e-Elahi said increased power supply to irrigation facilities would cause some problem for urban people. "But it will contribute to increase boro production and thereby help control commodity prices." Enamul said irrigation pumps would require around 1,600 megawatts power this season, but the requirement will come down if there is enough rainfall, he added. He announced that new transformers would be installed in seven days in places those have been stolen. b
