Kafrul police said the dead man, a local gang member, faced a raft of cases including murder. RAB official Major Md Sarwar said a patrol team of the force's fourth battalion saw a group of 7/8 youths gathering near the Noor Mosque at around 3.00 am. "As the RAB personnel approached towards them for an enquiry, they opened fire on the law enforcers and tried to flee. The RAB members retaliated at the instruction of their commander." Sarwar said personnel from the local police station reached the scene after hearing of the incident and took one injured man to DMCH for his treatment.
