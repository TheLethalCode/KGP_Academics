Just prior to the signing ceremony, Hasina had a one-on-one meeting with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House. Hasina also sought India's cooperation in fighting terrorism and poverty alleviation. "To ensure also our sustained commitment to peace, serious collaboration is essential in countering terrorism," she said, while addressing a banquet hosted by the Indian prime minister after their talks and the deal signing ceremony on Monday evening. She reiterated Bangladesh's commitment to eliminating all forms of terrorism. Bangladesh will not allow its territory to be used for launching terrorist activities against any country in the neighbourhood, or around the world, she added. Hasina, who is on a her maiden visit to India after forming the government just a year back, said cooperation in the field would lead to socio-economic development of the two countries to alleviate poverty that undermines peace. Hasina, in her speech, also said: "Progress and prosperity of our nations, and of all others in our regional organisation, SAARC, depend on our success in poverty alleviation and economic development." Hasina said success in poverty alleviation and economic development is possible through sincere cooperation among all in the South Asian region. "The eventual gain would be peace and stability all around." Hasina seeks fair share of water, trade Hasina also sought duty-free access of Bangladesh products and guaranteed water of Teesta water. The prime minister said a laudable start has already been made by Manmohan's assurance for India's decision for duty-free access to more Bangladeshi items to the Indian market, removal of non-tariff barriers, and improvement of trade infrastructure on Indian side of the borders. Bangladesh on this trip sought all-important duty free access for 232 products, including ready-made garments, that are currently on India's negative list. A highly-placed Indian official told bdnews24.com that Delhi would remove 47 items from its negative list for the benefit of Bangladesh. TEESTA WATER SHARING Hasina also sought help of her Indian counterpart in reaching agreements on water sharing of Teesta and other common rivers. "We need to conclude treaties on water sharing of the river Teesta, and other common rivers. On this very important issue, I request for your support in arriving at mutual agreements," she said. . She said as an agrarian country, Bangladesh needed throughout the year a guaranteed flow of water, vital for its economic development. She mentioned that the two neighbours concluded the historic 30-year Ganges Water Treaty in 1996 to ensure a regular flow of water from the common river terming the accord "a symbol of true spirit of what our two countries can do." The prime minister said her discussions with Indian side on the economic development, power, tourism and culture were successful. "commendable progress was made on long pending issues, particularly on land boundary. They would surely have favorable impacts on the lives of our peoples." She said she hoped her visit has served the purpose in boosting bilateral cooperation and overall relations to a new, enviable level. The prime minister invited her Indian counterpart to visit Bangladesh in the soonest possible time to consolidate the mutual gains and facilitate attainment of the remaining targets. Earlier in the day, Hasina called on Indian president Pratibha Patil and ruling Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, and placed wreaths at the grave of Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. Indian external affairs minister SM Krishna, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and leader of the opposition in parliament Shushma Swaraj also called on her at her hotel suite. bdnew
