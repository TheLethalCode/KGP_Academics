 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Police were trying to confirm the safety of six officers in Haiti on Wednesday, after a devastating earthquake razed hundreds of buildings to the ground, including the presidential palace, burying thousands of people. Assistant inspector general of police Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com six Bangladesh police officers were sent to the Caribbean nation as part of the UN peacekeeping mission there. "We have sent a message to the UN officials there to confirm their whereabouts." He said two sergeants were posted in the capital Port-au-Prince and another four officers were working outside the main city. Islam stressed that none of the six had duties at the five-storey UN building in the Haitian capital that was brought down by the powerful quake on Tuesday. The 7.0 magnitude quake was the most intense to hit Haiti in more than 200 years, according to the US Geological Survey Its epicentre was only 16 km from Port-au-Prince, which has a population of about 1 million, and aftershocks as powerful as 5.9 rattled the city throughout the night and into Wednesday. As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is ill-equipped to respond to such a disaster and is appealing for international help. Reports on casualties and damage were slow to get out due to communication problems. Television footage showed scenes of chaos on the streets of Port-au-Prince with buildings levelled and traumatized citizens dazed, injured and sobbing amid the rubble and scattered bodies
