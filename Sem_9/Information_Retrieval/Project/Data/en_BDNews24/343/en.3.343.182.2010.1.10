 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)Locals and students on Sunday protested violently after a bus ran over and killed a college student on the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Savar. Police said Murad Hossain, 25, an HSC student of Dhamrai Government College, died on the spot as the Salma Paribahan bus ran him over at around 11am in the C&B area of Savar. Two more passers-by including a child were also injured. Locals recovered Murad's body and sent the injured to the nearby hospital. Hearing the news, students of the college went on the rampage at around 1:30pm, vandalised at least 25 buses on the road, and blocked highway, setting fire to tyres. They demanded a foot over-bridge at C&B, arrest of the bus driver and compensation for the family of the deceased. Assistant police superintendent (Savar circle) Monwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that they seized the bus that ran over Murad, but the driver managed to get away. Traffic resumed on the highway at around 3pm as the blockaders withdrew the obstruction on Dhamrai College principal Md Ekhlas Khan's assurance of proper actions, Monwar said. Officer in charge of Savar Police Station Nasir Ullah said a case has been filed and the police are looking for the driver. bdnews24
