 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP on Sunday demanded ruling Awami League "make public" evidence it claims exists of an alleged meeting between former Pakistani president Parvez Musharraf and ULFA leader Anup Chetia held in Dhaka during the last BNP-led government. AL general secretary and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Sunday that "evidence existed" of the meeting after BNP had dismissed the allegation as untrue and "irresponsible". Ashraf had initially made the allegation at a programme at the National Press Club on Friday, that the previous BNP-led coalition government had arranged the meeting between Musharraf and Chetia in Dhaka in 2002. Just hours after Ashraf's statement on Sunday, BNP secretary general Delwar said: "Only saying 'we have evidence' is not enough. If any evidence really exists, its should be made public." "The statement of the Awami League general secretary is totally politically motivated. Being a responsible government post holder, he should not have made such remarks." On the prime minister's India visit, Delwar said, "The whole nation is looking forward to this visit. If she (Hasina) fails, the nation will be in immense crisis." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina leaves Dhaka on Sunday for a four-day visit to India. bdnews
