 KABUL, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Taliban have condemned plans to transfer control of the US military's Bagram prison to the Afghan government, saying it will lead to worse conditions for those held there, most of them suspected militants. Afghan officials at the weekend agreed to take over responsibility for the Bagram prison, located at the major US airbase north of Kabul, a move that could close a chapter in the troubled history of US detentions since 2001.
