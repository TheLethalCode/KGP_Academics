 Brahmanbaria, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  A train slammed into a stone-laden truck at the Mogra level crossing in Akhaura early on Wednesday, halting traffic movement on the Dhaka-Agartala highway for at least 12 hours. The truck, coming from Sylhet and bound for Agartala land port, had broken down at the level crossing, when the Sylhet-bound Udayan train from Chittagong collided with the truck, "tossing" the vehicle aside, said witnesses. The right side of the train engine was also damaged in the accident, said senior deputy engineer of Akhaura rail junction, TA Chowdhury. No injuries were reported, but hundreds of heavy vehicles, carrying imports and goods for export overland, were held up on both sides of the highway up to Wednesday afternoon. bdn
