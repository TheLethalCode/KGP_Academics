 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told parliament on Tuesday that the government targeted 8 percent GDP growth by 2013. Replying to a question of Lakshimpur-1 MP Nazimuddin Ahmed, he said the government wants to raise GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate to 8 percent by 2013. "Investment rate will be increased to 30.32 percent of GDP to attain the target." Referring to estimates that the country attained 5.9 percent GDP growth in the first half of 2009-10 fiscal year, he said: "Such growth has been achieved offsetting the negatives of the global economic meltdown. The minister said sustainable growth in agriculture sector, increase in investment by both private and public sectors, and recovery of the world economy have prompted the government to project 6 percent growth for the current fiscal year. Mentioning that national savings rose to 32.4 percent of the GDP in 2008-09 fiscal year, he hoped GDP growth would be expedited with the transformation of savings into investment. Muhith said emphasis is being given to ensuring smooth supply of power and gas, development of infrastructure, full implementation of annual development programme (ADP), and fastening private sector investment for raising the GDP growth rate. To another question by Sheikh Afiluddin (Jessore-1), the minister said per capita burden of foreign loan of Bangladeshi people has stood at around 150 US dollars. He said the population of the country was 142.4 million in 2007-08 fiscal year, when the per capita loan burden was 149.54 dollars.
