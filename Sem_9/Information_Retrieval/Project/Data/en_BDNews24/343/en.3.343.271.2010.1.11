 DHAKA, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Shahriar Nafees has been recalled to a 14-member Bangladesh squad for a two-test series against India this month after prematurely retiring last year to play in the renegade Indian Cricket League. Shahriar, 23, played the last of his 15 test matches against South Africa in February-March 2008. He was included in the Bangladesh side for a tri-series this month but has not played a game. Bangladesh will play two test matches against India from Jan. 17-21 and Jan 24-28 in Chittagong and Dhaka respectively.
