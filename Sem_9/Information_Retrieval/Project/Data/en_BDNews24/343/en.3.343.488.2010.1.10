 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Clemency petitions of three of the five former army officers, convicted and sentenced to death for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, have been received by the home ministry and forwarded to the law ministry for opinion, a top government official said Sunday. "We have received the three petitions from the inspector general of prisons," home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder told bdnews24.com just prior to his departure for India as part of the prime minister's tour. "They were sent to the law ministry today (Sunday). After the opinion of the ministry is given, the summary of the petitions will go to the prime minister. They will reach the president through the prime minister." Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Ashraful Islam Khan told a press briefing on Saturday that Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin had submitted clemency petitions. Khan had also said that the two other convicted killers, Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had not sought clemency yet but would file review petitions with the Supreme Court. LAWYER, FAMILY 'KNOW NOTHING' OF MERCY PLEAS However, family and legal counsel of Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin said Sunday they knew nothing about the clemency pleas. Lawyer for the two, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, was talking to reporters on Sunday as he filed review petitions for his clients. Mohiuddin's wife Hosne Ara Mohiuddin and Huda's sister Mahfuza Pasha were also present at the Supreme Court. They also said they knew nothing about the mercy petitions. Mamun questioned the process of submission of the petitions. "It is mandatory that lawyers and relatives should be present while submitting mercy petitions. But we do not know anything of them." "We only heard yesterday (Saturday) that they had submitted mercy petitions. This is illegal." The Supreme Court, in a long-pending judgment rejected appeals of the five convicted killers on Nov 19 last year, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3, Dhaka district and sessions judge sent signed death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. The condemned men had 7 days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. bd
