 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division chamber judge is expected to set a date on Wednesday for hearing the review petitions of Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin, convicted and sentenced to death for the 1975 killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Chief state counsel Ansiul Haque told reporters that the response came following a plea made to the Supreme Court for quick hearing of the review petitions. Huda and Mohiuddin on Sunday filed petitions for review of the Supreme Court judgment that upheld death sentence of the five convicts. Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and another convict Mohiuddin Ahmed have also submitted clemency petitionswhile Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan have not sought clemency yet but will file review petitions with the Supreme Court. Haque said there is no problem in running both mercy petitions and review petitions concurrently. The Supreme Court, in a long-pending judgment, rejected appeals of the five convicted killers on Nov 19 last year, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3 this year, Dhaka district and sessions judge signed and sent death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. The condemned men had seven days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. bd
