 LONDON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An English Premier League club could collapse this year because of the parlous state of soccer finances, former Birmingham City co-owner David Sullivan warned on Tuesday. Sullivan, who sold his stake in Birmingham to Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung last year, said many clubs had put their future in jeopardy by borrowing against future income and that the state of football finances was "frightening. "We've looked at 20 clubs since we left Birmingham. The state of the finance of football is frightening, and I think there's a possibility one Premier League club could go," Sullivan told the BBC.

They've borrowed against everything. "There are several Championship sides absolutely on the line at the moment. It's a question of whether they can sell players for sufficient money to stay alive. "But there's not a lot of money out there to buy players at the moment. Even some of the clubs who you think have got money really haven't got much money to spend on players." Portsmouth, who are bottom of the Premier League, are in deep financial trouble and have paid their players salaries late three times this season. The club also face a winding-up order from the government and go to the High Court on Wednesday to argue the Value Added Tax portion of their tax debt is too high at 7.5 million po
