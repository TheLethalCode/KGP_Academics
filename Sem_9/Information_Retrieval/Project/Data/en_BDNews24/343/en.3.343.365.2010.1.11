<TEXT>
 HAMBURG, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh's state grains buyer has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of wheat, European traders said on Monday. Any origin worldwide will be accepted from the 2009 crop year. The tender deadline is Feb. 9 and bids must remain valid up to Mar. 2. Shipment must take place within 60 days of contract signing. Bangladesh has in past months issued a series of wheat tenders in the international market but some were later cancelled including those issued in September and October. The country has a long process of purchase approval which goes up to cabinet level. It also has issued a tender for 100,000 tonnes of wheat closing on Jan. 18. A further tender for 70,000 tonnes closes on Feb 4. Another previous tender for 60,000 tonnes which closed on Jan. 4 was believed to have been cancelled after the latest inquiry for 100,000 tonnes was issued, traders said. Bangladesh plans to buy 750,000 tonnes of wheat in the year to June 2010 to replenish stocks, food ministry officials have said. Traders say Bangladesh is buying more wheat this year because of lower global prices while domestic production is stagnating at around 1 million tonnes
