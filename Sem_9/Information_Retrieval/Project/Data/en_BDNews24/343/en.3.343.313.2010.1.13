<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Suresh Raina completed his third ODI century as India recovered from a shaky start against Sri Lanka in the final of the Idea Cup tri-series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Raina was batting on 101 from 111 balls as India reached 225-7 in 44 overs. He was involved in a 106-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja (38) after the side slumped to 60-5 after being sent into bat. Raina joined an elite group of highest Indian scorers at No 6 when he nudged the ball for two runs to achieve three-figures. Tillakaratne Dilshan made the breakthrough when he trapped Jadeja lbw. MS Dhoni's men made the worst possible start after being put into bat when they lost Gautam Gambhir in the first over after the ball hit the protruding thigh pad and ricocheted on to the leg stump. In the next over Virat Kohli went after a widish delivery and was caught behind. Then an out-of-form Yuvraj Singh was caught at first slip chasing a rising ball to leave India 16-3 in four overs. After 10 overs, the Indians were 58-4. The skipper was caught behind while going for the drive. Much was expected of Virender Sehwag , who was rested for the last two games, and for a while he was looking good on 42 of just 27 balls with seven fours. But Sehwag fell trying to run the ball through third man. He only managed to be caught behind. India were back to full strength with the inclusion of Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh, but there was no space for Sudeep Tyagi who, despite his good displays, was pushed aside by the experience of Zaheer Khan. Dinesh Karthik and Amit Mishra were expectedly benched for their more illustrious counterparts. Sri Lanka made one change, which Sangakkara emphasised was not a reflection of the rookie's performances, but out went Suranga Lakmal for Nuwan Kulasekara. This final is the 121st ODI between India and Sri Lanka, a record for most matches played between two teams. It was also the 22nd game between the teams in less than 19 mo
