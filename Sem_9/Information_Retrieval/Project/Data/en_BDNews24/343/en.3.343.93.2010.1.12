<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Tuesday suggested 'exit facility' for the sick industries that took loans from the Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha. The two state-owned financial institutions, meant to facilitate industrialisation, were abolished and turned into Bangladesh Development Bank from this year. The parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry recommended that the newly created bank should be run the way the private banks are managed. Sources at the finance ministry said the two defunct banks have about 12,000 clients. "We have suggested that the ministry give us three lists of the clients of the Bangladesh Development Bank mentioning the number of the sick and closed industrial units, near sick and good industries," A H M Mustafa Kamal told reporters after the committee meeting at parliament building. "We have also suggested that the sick industries should be given exit facilities by realising maximum amount of money as repayment against the bad loans," said Kamal, a businessmen turned MP. He said the bank should negotiate with the owners of the sick industries for repayment. "The Bangladesh Development Bank must not follow the policies that led to the failure of Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and the Bangladesh Shilpa Bank," said the chairman. Fluctuation of exchange rate of dollars and policy of not providing working capital to the clients were the two main causes of failure of the two banks, banking experts say.
