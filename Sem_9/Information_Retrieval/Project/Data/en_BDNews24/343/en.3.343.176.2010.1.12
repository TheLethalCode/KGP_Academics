<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's young players have performed well enough in the tri-series in Bangladesh to convince skipper Kumar Sangakkara that they are ready to challenge the senior players for full-time places in the squad. Several experienced players were rested for the one-day series in which Sri Lanka face India in Wednesday's final but Suraj Randiv, Suranga Lakmal, Thishara Perera and Thilan Tushara all impressed in the side's run of three wins from four games. "In the year going forward from here, we hope that many of these guys will push a permanent place and give everyone a run for their money," Sangakkara told reporters on Tuesday. Sangakkara admitted, however, that world record wicket taker Mutriah Muralitharan's place in the one-day side was still safe despite his poor run of recent form and the emergence of off-spinner Randiv. "I think he is pushing for a permanent place in the one-day side without a doubt," Sangakkara added, "(But) Murali is Murali, you know, no one can be compared with him, so we are just waiting for him to come back in the side as well. "It will be exciting to have these two guys playing together if we can manage that, but Suraj Randiv's performance has been outstanding in the last two series." Randiv made his ODI debut in Muralitharan's absence against India last month and has since claimed nine wickets in eight matches. He showed his all-round ability with a half-century amid a batting collapse against India on Saturday. "We just want him to grow from strength to strength and make sure he understands what he is doing, how he can get better and the pressures of international cricket," Sangakkara said.
