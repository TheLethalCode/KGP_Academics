Iran plans to try five detainees seized in connection with the Ashura day riots who it says are members of the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), an exile group opposed to Iran's Islamic system of government. They are accused of 'moharebeh', an Islamic term meaning warring against God that carries the death penalty.
