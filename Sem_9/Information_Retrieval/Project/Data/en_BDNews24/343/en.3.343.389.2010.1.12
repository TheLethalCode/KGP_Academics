 Sumon Mahbub, bdnews24.com political correspondent, and bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, January 12 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina received the prestigious Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Tuesday. Hasina quoted Indira Gandhi's words in her acceptance speech: "Peace we want because there is another war to fight  poverty, disease and ignorance." Indian President Pratibha Patil, conferring the prize, committed her country's unstinting support for Hasina's struggle against "divisive forces". Hasina said she was deeply honoured and thanked the Indian president, prime minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, chairperson of the ruling United Progressive Alliance, who spoke at the award ceremony. "This most prestigious prize also greatly honours my country and people," Hasina said. She said the people and governments should strive to achieve freedom, peace and prosperity for the common good of the peoples of both the countries because these were indivisible. "If we are to achieve these goals, in the words of Mahatma Gandhi 'we must be the change we wish to see'." "Truly, we need to leave for our children a world of equal opportunities and potentials; a world better and greener than we inherited," said Hasina. An international jury, chaired by Manmohan Singh, chose Hasina as the 2009 recipient of the prize for her "outstanding contribution to the promotion of democracy and pluralism". President Patil said in her speech that Hasina's crusade against terrorism and violence was well known. "She has met them with invincible courage, even at great risk to her own life." "We would like to assure you, Madam Prime Minister, that India, which is itself a target of terrorism, is supportive of your struggle to fight these divisive forces. We cannot and will not let them succeed." Patil praised Hasina's struggle against injustice and for democracy. She said that Hasina, throughout life, had personified the heroic struggle against autocracy and dictatorship, the struggle for establishing democracy and pluralism. "Whether as a university student, or as a youth participating in the mass movement of 1969, as the daughter of the Father of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and later as the prime minister of her country, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has left an indelible imprint on her country's growth and development." Introduced in 1986, the award has been given to, among others, former UN chief Kofi Annan, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, IAEA chief Mohammad Al Baradei, Nobel laureates Dr Muhammad Younus and Wangari Maathai and Afghan president Hamid Karzai. The prime minister remembered Indira Gandhi's conviction that the world economic order 'based on domination and inequality' was unsustainable. "Her unfaltering stand for the deprived and downtrodden was well known, and was not confined only within the borders of India." Hasina recalled that when the people of Bangladesh in 1971, were in the throes of pain, subjugation, and bloodshed by the ruling occupation forces, Indira gathered support for the victims, within India, and around the world. She said that Indira Gandhi's unflinching support for the struggle for freedom of the people of Bangladesh, and the unprecedented welcome extended to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on his arrival in New Delhi, on way to Dhaka would remain deeply enshrined in the mind of the people. bdnews2
