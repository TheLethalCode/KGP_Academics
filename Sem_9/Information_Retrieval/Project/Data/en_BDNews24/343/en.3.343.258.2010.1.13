 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Police drove two rival groups, battling over control of Proshika Bhaban in the capital, out of the NGO's headquarters on Wednesday and locked the main entrance. Akbar Ali, assistant police commissioner of Mirpur zone, told reporters that the headquarters would remain under police lockdown until further notice or until a pending High Court case was resolved. "Those, who receive a court verdict in their favour will be allowed in," he said. Tension was running high at the headquarters of Proshika, one of the country's largest non-governmental organisations, after supporters of ousted chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed took control of the building in the early hours of Tuesday. Supporters of Faruque and those loyal to the present governing body were gathered around Proshika Bahban since Tuesday morning, forcing police to deploy extra forces to calm a tense situation. Proshika's governing body replaced Faruque as chairman in May last year in the face of ongoing employees' agitation against him for alleged corruption and nepotism. Huge clashes erupted on Aug 1 last year as hundreds of supporters led by Faruque marched on Proshika Bhaban trying to force entry. Following those clashes, the High Court last year, on a petition by Faruque challenging his ouster, ordered him to stay away from the Proshika premises. bdnew
