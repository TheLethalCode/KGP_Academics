 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government is taking initiatives to bring Bangladesh under the optical fibre network aiming to build a 'Digital Bangladesh', Telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu said Tuesday. In reply to a supplementary question in parliament from Jhenaidah MP Md Shafiqul Alam Khan, the minister hoped to provide laptops to the people at a price less than Tk 10,000. E-Centre at the rural post offices The minister said the government has a plan to turn the rural post offices into e-centres and provide them with modern technological facilities so that information can be exchanged digitally. "The telecommunication ministry submitted its plan for the Post E-Centre for Rural Community project. Immediately after its approval, the rural population will be provided with internet facilities," Razu said replying to a query from Khulna-1 MP Nani Gopal. 50,550,000 Mobile Phone Subscribers Answering to another question from MP Apu Ukil, the minister said that until Nov 2009, the total number of mobile phone users throughout the country stood at around 50,550,000 while the government land phone company Bangladesh Tele Communications Limited has 952,779 subscribers. "To increase the number of BTCL subscribers the government has taken up some exclusive projects that comprises expanding and modernising telephone exchanges, laying of new cables and optical fibre network, setting up international telephone and internet exchanges," the minister said. Answering a question from woman MP Nur Afroz Ali, the minister said that at present the Economic ISD System is used for making international calls to 55 countries of the world. BTCL recorded a revenue income of Tk 2680,900,000 in only the last six months of the last year (2009), the minister said. Unethical use of mobile phones The telecommunications minister urged the students to be careful about the excessive and unethical use of mobile phones. Replying to a question from MP Md Tazul Islam, he said as the most popular media of contemporary communication methods, mobile phones have both positive and negative sides. Legally, the mobile phone subscribers have to be at least 18 years of age. But, underaged children get mobile phones from their parents. If the parents keep a watchful eye on their children some problems can be solved, said the minister. Students should be made conscious at the school and family levels so that they never become negligent in their studies, the minister said. bdne
