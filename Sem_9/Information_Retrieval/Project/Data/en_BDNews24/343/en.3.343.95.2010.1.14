 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Corruption is the main reason for the time-consuming, poor land-related services in the country, a high official of the land survey department said on Wednesday. "Automation or digitisation will not be able to change the scenario," director general Aslam Alam said at a roundtable on the prospect of information technology-based land services under public-private partnership (PPP). Alam said if automation takes off under PPP, people who will replace the public servants will take bribes and things will stay the same. "We have to examine the previous cases of foot-dragging and irregularities," he added. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute organised the discussion to bring together stakeholders from the government, domestic and international financial institutions and software companies to discuss opportunities for PPP in providing land-related citizen services using ICT. . Mohammad Moslehuddin, a former secretary, said the land department is not well-equipped with its manpower. Moreover, involvement of land, establishment and law ministries has made things worse since there is no coordination among them, he added. The automation of the land management system will be successful if it is handed over to the private sector at the end of project period, said Abu Reza Khan, additional secretary and executive member of the Board of Investment. TerraTech Ltda conglomerate of nine leading software and IT-based services companies of Bangladesh--made a presentation on the prospects of digitised land management. They said Bangladesh can ease hassles in land-related services such as land recording, revenue collection and surveys through initiating information technology under PPP projects. The government can have all its land records at its fingertips while the revenue income will rise, too, due to faster services from the land offices around the country. TerraTech is optimistic about the success of the proposed project which will be launched in March to check the feasibility. Farooq Sobhan, president of BEI and a former secretary, said a large number of court cases are generated by land disputes. He observed that the land sector would greatly contribute towards building a 'Digital Bangladesh' through the use of information technology with the participation of public and private sectors. Abul Barakat, chairman of Janata Bank and a land expert, chaired the discussion. Barakat said the land department has been suffering for decades and it takes between three and 45 years to resolve land disputes in court . The land owned by the government are still to be identified due to lack of technical supports and corrupt officials. The government should finance the TerraTech project to ensure better services, he said.
