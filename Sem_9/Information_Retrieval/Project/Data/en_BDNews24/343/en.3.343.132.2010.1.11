 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)Senior MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim on Monday said the speaker breached the Rules of Procedure in running parliament. Selim, an Awami League presidium member, said the speaker Abdul Hamid did not follow the procedure to table ministers' replies to the notices of public importance served by the MPs in previous session. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali defended Hamid, saying there was no violation of the procedure. As per the rules of procedure, the parliament secretariat presents a set of answers from the ministers in reply to the rejected notices on public importance raised by the MPs in the previous session. According to rule 71 of the procedure of parliament, on every working day the speaker accepts three to five selected notices on public important issues for ministers to answer verbally in the floor. Every MP, whose notices are not accepted by speaker for ministers' response in day's business, get the chance to read the notice in two minutes. The ministers need not reply to the rejected notices orally. But the ministers must give written answers to the rejected notices in three working days of the next session. Speaker Hamid, after the scheduled question-answer hour, on Monday presented the ministers' replies on the table as per the rules. "The Rules of Procedure has been violated in presenting the replies of the ministers," Selim said, taking floor on a point of order. "None of the ministers came and presented the notices," said Selim. Senior MP Tofail Ahmed agreed with Selim, saying: "We have not got the report though the speaker has announced that it has been put on table." "We have not seen presentation of such replies before. So, he (Selim) is right," said Tofail. Saber Hossain Chowdhury, another MP, read out the rule 71 of the Rules of Procedure and said the speaker's move was right. "Presenting replies on table means that there will no discussion on it. "We have been making such presentation for the last three sessions," said Ali, who chaired the session after Hamid. "So, I think there has been no violation of the rules of procedure," he added.
