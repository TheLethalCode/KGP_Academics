<TITLE> Laws must support needs of senior citizens: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 09 (bdnews24.com)  Senior citizens should not be seen as a burden, rather attitudes must change and laws should support their needs, the law minister said on Saturday. "Their experiences can fuel the smooth running of society. Therefore, not only the attitude of the government needs changing but also the mentality of individuals," minister Shafique Ahmed said at a discussion regarding senior citizens and their contribution to society. Afsana Karim gave a keynote speech on behalf of Boyoshi Kalyan Samiti (Senior Citizens Welfare Society) at the talks held by Health and Hope at the National Press Club. She suggested several steps to be taken regarding senior citizens that include formation of a central cell by the government to develop positive social attitudes and regular publicity campaigns, such as celebrating a Senior Citizens Day, through government and mass media initiatives. Other proposals were special discounts and separate wards at government and private health centres, special cards for the poor and excluded senior citizens allowing them to get free treatment at government hospitals and establishing care homes for the aged through government and private initiatives. They also included reserving 10% seats on public transports, travel on government owned public transports at half fare and special monthly pensions. The law minister, addressing the event as chief guest, said that these suggestions should not remain in round-table discussions but written applications should be made to associated ministries. "If any new law is needed to fulfil these suggestions, the law ministry will form them. But in many cases these benefits could be arranged without law through executive orders." General secretary of the Asiatic Society, Mahfuza Khanom, said, "Instead of putting the pressure of senior citizen related issues on the government only, private organisations will also have to step up." "These matters must be integrated in their works. All organisations will have to come forward in creating social awareness." Adviser of 'Boyoshi Kalyan Shamiti', AK Siddique appealed to the government to allocate land to the organisation to conduct their activities smoothly. Former president of Bangladesh Medical Association Rashedi Mahbub also spoke among others. b
