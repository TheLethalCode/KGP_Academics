 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said her India trip has been '100 percent successful' and it consolidated efforts for regional development and elimination of poverty. Speaking at a news conference at Zia International Airport on her return on Wednesday, Hasina said the four-day visit was aimed at establishing peace in South Asia and strengthening relationship between neighbours. The trip had opened up new horizons for Dhaka-Delhi ties, the prime minister said. She also said agreements signed by Bangladesh and India during the visit would benefit the people of the two neighbours, as well as Bhutan, Nepal and the rest of the region. She also spoke about combating terrorism, transit and Tipaimukh dam issues at the news conference. On combating terrorism, she said, "It is not only a problem for Bangladesh and India, also for South Asia and other parts of the world. So, it should be faced nationally and internationally." She said that her government will do everything possible to this end. On Chittagong and Mongla ports, she said, "The two ports will be opened not only to India, but also as regional seaports." The prime minister said India has confirmed that they will not do anything with the proposed Tipaimukh Dam that may harm Bangladesh. Foreign minister Dipu Moni on Thursday will brief the parliament on the prime minister's visit. Hasina, on her last day in New Delhi, was very positive about progress made in Bangla-Indo relations. Addressing a press conference in the Indian capital in the morning, before flying to Ajmeer, Hasina had said her visit marked the beginning of "a new era of friendship and cooperation" between the two countries. The prime minister started for home Wednesday afternoon, after completing her first state visit to India since coming to power a year ago. Hasina had flown to Jaipur from Delhi to offer prayers at the shrine of Sufi Mainuddin Chishti in Ajmeer just before before her return. She boarded a special Biman Bangladesh aircraft at Jaipur around 3:25pm local time, landing in Dhaka at 5.40pm (BdST) Thousands of people lined the streets of Dhaka, chanting 'Joy Bangla', waving banners and throwing flowers, to greet Hasina along her route from airport to her official Jamuna residence. Police and Rapid Action Battalion had to grapple with crowd control on the roads in a bid to keep traffic movements normal. Despite this, several hours of gridlock ensued on the Dhaka's main routes. The prime minister went to India on Jan 10 for bilateral talks with Manmohan Singh. The two sides signed three deals on combating crime, and MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange. Strides were also made on connectivity, including cooridrs for Bangladesh to Bhutan and Nepal, use of Mongla and Chittagoing ports for India and joint rail and other infra projects with major Indian assistance. Hasina also received the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize in Delhi. Hasina, on her arrival back, said the prize conferred upon her is not her lone achievement. She dedicated the prize to all the people of Bangladesh. She also said that she would donate the prize money of Rs 2,500,000 to the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust. bdnews24.com/
