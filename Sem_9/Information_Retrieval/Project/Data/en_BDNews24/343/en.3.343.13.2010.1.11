<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Monday tabled an amendment bill in parliament aimed at curtailing court's power to order arrests of journalists for "defamatory" news. The new bill will amend Schedule 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code-1898 by replacing the "warrant" with "summons". The amendment bill, if passed, will exempt journalists, editors and publishers from being arrested in defamation cases. "Any journalists, editors, writers and publishers can be harassed by utilising the present provision of the law," Ahmed told parliament while tabling the bill. "This bill will stop harassment of journalists, editors, writers and publishers," he said. Parliament then sent the bill to the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry for further scrutiny. The watchdog will refer the bill after examination back to parliament in two weeks for its passage. Cabinet in December approved the amendment as a move to ensure greater freedom of press
