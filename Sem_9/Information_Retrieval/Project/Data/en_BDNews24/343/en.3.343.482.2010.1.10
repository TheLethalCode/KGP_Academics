 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League general secretary and local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam has claimed that the government has evidence of a meeting between former Pakistani president Parvez Musharraf and ULFA leader Anup Chetia held in Dhaka during the previous BNP-led government. "We've the evidence. We've not made any statement without evidence," he told journalists at Bangabandhu Bhaban on Sunday in reaction to BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain's dismissal of the allegation. Ashraf had told a roundtable held at the National Press Club on Friday that the previous BNP-led coalition government had arranged a meeting between Musharraf and Chetia in Dhaka in 2002. The following day Delwar termed Ashraf's statement "irresponsible" and said: "A leader of his stature should not have made such an irresponsible statement He shouldn't have made such a light comment." Talking to reporters at a BNP programme at late president Ziaur Rahman's graveside, he demanded that Ashraf should make public any documents supporting his claim. Ashraf, while speaking at the roundtable on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's India visit and Bangladesh-India bilateral relations, said: "Pervez Musharraf had a one-and-a-half hour meeting with detained ULFA leader Anup Chetia at his hotel room during a visit when BNP and [Jamaat-e-Islami] were in power You can guess what was discussed in such a long meeting." Pakistan military ruler Musharraf visited Bangladesh in July 2002. Secretary general of the India's secessionist organisation, Chetia has been detained in a Bangladesh jail since his arrest in 1998. Ashraf and other Awami League leaders placed wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Bhaban on Sunday marking his 38th homecoming anniversary. On the trial of Bangabandhu murder case, he said: "Many a people still don't want the verdict to be executed." He said he expected a statement from BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on the execution of the verdict.
