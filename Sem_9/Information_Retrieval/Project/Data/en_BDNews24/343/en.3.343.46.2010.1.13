 ISTANBU, Jan 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The man who tried to kill Pope John Paul II called for a "new American Empire" championing peace and democracy in a rambling statement issued by his lawyers on Wednesday before his release from prison next week. Former far-right gangster Mehmet Ali Agca served 19 years in an Italian prison for the 1981 assassination attempt before being pardoned at the pope's behest in 2000 and extradited to serve time for other crimes in his native Turkey.
