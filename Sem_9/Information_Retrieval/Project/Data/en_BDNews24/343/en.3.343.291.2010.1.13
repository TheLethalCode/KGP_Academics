 Savar, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Dhamrai Government Degree College blocked the Dhaka-Aricha highway at Dhamrai on Wednesday demanding speed breakers to be put in place after the death of a fellow student in a road crash three days ago. They said the blockade would continue until the authorities raised the speed breakers at Dhamrai Bus Stand within the day. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded on both sides of the highway since morning due to the blockade, witnesses said. Last Sunday, Murad Hossain, an HSC student, was killed on the highway when a speeding bus knocked him down. The agitating students said the authorities had earlier assured them of building speed breakers on the highway but were yet to put them in place. bdn
