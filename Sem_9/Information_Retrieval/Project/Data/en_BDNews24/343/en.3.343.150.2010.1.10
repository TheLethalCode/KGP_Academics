 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)--Pro-opposition lawyers have sought a review of a decision on restructuring 39 High Court Division benches of the Supreme Court. The delegation of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers led by T H Khan raised the demand with chief justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam at his office on Sunday. Khan, after the meeting, told reporters, "We placed our demand for a rethink of the decision on restructuring the 39 High Court benches." "He said he would consider the issue," Khan said. "The right to issue both criminal and writ motions have been given to junior lawyers, which were traditionally done by senior lawyers." "Many say that the chief justice had done this under pressure from the attorney general which has created mixed reactions among the people," Khan added. Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Mahbubuddin Ahmad, Abdur Razzaque, Khondokar Mahbubuddin and Mahbubuddin Khokon were also present during the meeting. bdnew
