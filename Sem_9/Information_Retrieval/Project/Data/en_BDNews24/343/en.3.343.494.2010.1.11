<TEXT>
 By Sumon Mahbub and bdnews24.com's New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has offered India to forge 'serious collaboration' with Bangladesh in fighting terrorism to ensure peace in the region. "To ensure also our sustained commitment to peace, serious collaboration is essential in countering terrorism," she said while addressing a banquet hosted by Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Monday evening. Hasina, who is on her four-day maiden visit to India after forming the government just a year back, said cooperation in the field would lead to socio-economic development of the two countries to alleviate poverty that undermines peace. She reiterated Bangladesh's committed to eliminating all forms of terrorism. Bangladesh will not allow its territory to be used for launching terrorist activities against any country in the neighbourhood, or around the world, she added.. TRADE PROMOTION The prime minister said activation of institutional mechanisms is required to promote two-way trade, remove avoidable hindrances, initiate long-pending trade facilitation measures, facilitate easy travel of businessmen, and create mechanisms to settle trade related disputes. She said: "Progress and prosperity of our nations, and of all others in our regional organisation, SAARC, depend on our success in poverty alleviation and economic development." Hasina said success in poverty alleviation and economic development is possible through sincere cooperation among all in the South Asian region. "The eventual gain would be peace and stability all around." Terming connectivity an important factor of economic development, she said a better connectivity in the region would open a new era of economic activities, benefiting all countries in South Asia. The prime minister said her discussions with Indian side on the economic development, power, tourism and culture were successful. "commendable progress was made on long pending issues, particularly on land boundary. They would surely have favorable impacts on the lives of our peoples." She said a laudable start has already been made by Manmohan's assurance for India's decision for duty-free access to more Bangladeshi items to the Indian market, removal of non-tariff barriers, and improvement of trade infrastructure on Indian side of the borders. She hoped her visit has served the purpose in boosting bilateral cooperation and overall relations to a new, enviable level. The prime minister invited her Indian counterpart to visit Bangladesh in a soonest possible time to consolidate the mutual gains and facilitate attainment of the remaining targets. bdn
