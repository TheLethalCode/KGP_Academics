 SRINAGAR, Jan 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian soldier was killed on Monday in cross-border firing in Kashmir, the latest in a spurt of violence in the disputed region that has raised tensions with Pakistan, officials said. The incident comes two days after the nuclear-armed rivals exchanged accusation of cross-border firing to the south of Kashmir.

India said last month that it is gradually withdrawing about 30,000 troops in Kashmir and handing over law and order to police as incidents of violence have gone down.
