<TITLE> Murray out of Japan Open with sore wrist </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number three Andy Murray has withdrawn from next week's Japan Open due to a wrist injury, the Briton said on his website. Murray suffered the injury at last month's US Open and aggravated the problem in Britain's Davis Cup tie against Poland on September 18. He will sit out the October 5-11 Tokyo event on the advice of doctors, a statement on his website (www.andymurray.com) said. His withdrawal will come as a further blow to tournament organisers following world number one Roger Federer's cancellation due to fatigue. US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro will assume top seed status at the $1.3 million (815,000 pound) event.
