<TITLE> NZ's Styris to cover for Elliott at Champions Trophy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand have called up all-rounder Scott Styris to cover for the injured Grant Elliott ahead of their ICC Champions Trophy semi-final against Pakistan on Saturday. Elliott chipped a bone in his right thumb during the side's final group match against England on Tuesday, New Zealand Cricket said in a statement on Friday. Styris would arrive in Johannesburg on Friday after travelling from India, where he had been preparing for the Indian Champions League tournament with the Deccan Chargers. Elliott had trained since the England match in which he took four wickets, but remained in doubt for the semi-final, NZC said. A decision on his availability would be made closer to the game. Styris's inclusion would still need approval from tournament officials. A veteran of 157 ODI matches, Styris is the only current player to have played in the New Zealand side that won the Champions Trophy in 2000. His last ODI was against India in March.
