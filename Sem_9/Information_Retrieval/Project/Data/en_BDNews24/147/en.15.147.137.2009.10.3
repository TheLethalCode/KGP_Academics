 Chittagong, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com) Former home secretary Omar Faruque was asked if "higher-ups within the government" were involved in the 2004 bid to smuggle 10 truckloads of arms into Bangladesh as he was questioned by the criminal investigators Saturday, an official said. The Criminal Investigation Department of police quizzed him almost all day, from 11am to evening at the Damparha office in Chittagong. Mohammad Muslim, special superintendent of Chittagong division of CID, told bdnews24.com Faruque will be called again for questioning. Faruque was summoned to the CID office where a team headed by investigation officer Moniruzzaman Chowdhury interrogated him. Muslim said that Faruque was being interrogated to expedite the investigation as he was the home secretary at that time and also led the official team to probe the incident. Faruque had led a five-member official investigation team to probe the arms haul after police seized 10 trucks of weapons and ammunition on April 1, 2004 when the consignment was being offloaded at the jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd. "Faruque was questioned to know about the key points of their investigation and if they were influenced by any group. The other members of the team might also be quizzed," Muslim added. But he declined to divulge what Faruque disclosed. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the CID team told bdnews24.com that Faruque evaded most questions. Faruque faced reporters after the questioning and said he has told everything to the IO. "Nothing to say to the media." Being asked about his role in the 2004 investigation, Faruque said, "I didn't do any wrong." The former home secretary appeared exhausted. IO Moniruzzaman said his statements were recorded under section 161. Allegations have it that the BNP-Jamaat coalition government tried to divert the case to a different direction, but later other investigations linked former state minister for home Lutfazzaman Babar and several senior government and intelligence officials to the haul. After the new IO, Moniruzzaman, took charge, those who have faced CID questioning included officials of CUFL and Coast Guard, truck owners, officers of police and the National Security Intelligence. So far seven people have been arrestedfive officers of NSI including two of its former chiefsand former managing director and general manager (administration) of CUFL. The IO is now interrogating some 23 people who have been on bail in this case. Two cases had been filed on illegal arms trafficking and smuggling a day after the seizure by the officer-in-charge of Karnaphuli Police Station, Ahadur Rahman. CID submitted two charge sheets, accusing 87 persons in all.
