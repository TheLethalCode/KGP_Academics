 TOKYO, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Maria Sharapova won the Pan Pacific Open after Jelena Jankovic retired with a wrist injury in Saturday's final. The Russian was leading 5-2 when seventh seed Jankovic called for the trainer to tape up her wrist and the Serb managed just two more points after a medical timeout before throwing in the towel. It was Sharapova's first title since shoulder surgery last October and the 20th of her career. Her last tournament win came at Amelia Island in April 2008. "It was my second final of the year so I was a little bit nervous," Sharapova said in a courtside interview. "But I knew I was playing good enough tennis to give her a go. "It's great to have that adrenaline again," added the three-times grand slam winner, who came into the $2 million Tokyo event ranked 25th in the world. "I've put in so much work. It's funny to win trophies after thinking maybe I might never be able to hit a tennis ball again." Sharapova, who has now beaten the 2008 year-end number one Jankovic in five of their six meetings, also won the Pan Pacific Open crown in 2005.
