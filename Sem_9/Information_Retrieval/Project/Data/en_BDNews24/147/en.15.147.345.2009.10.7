 LONDON Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold hit another record high on Wednesday as the dollar slipped and global stocks rose for the third day running, erasing their losses in October. Investors continued their scramble for yield, lifting the Australian dollar to 14-month highs on the prospects for higher interest rates after Tuesday's tightening. Gold trimmed some gains early but then rose as high as $1,048.20 an ounce, easily eclipsing Tuesday's $1,043.45 record. The metal has been driven higher in part by concerns that the dollar is losing favor, including potentially as the currency for settling oil trades. Despite the headline figure, however, gold remains far below its inflation-adjust record from the 1980s. Investor Jim Rogers, one of the biggest bulls during this decade's commodities rally, said he would stay clear of buying gold for now, although he predicted prices will continue to go up over the long term. "Gold has hit a new high and I don't like to buy something at record prices unless there are extremely strong fundamental reasons," he said. World equities as measured by MSCI, in the meantime, added another 0.4 percent and have now wiped out sharp losses sustained in the first two days of October. They stand 26 percent higher for the year. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent after the index gained more than 2 percent on Tuesday. Earlier on Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei average closed 1.1 percent higher. DOLLAR DIPS The dollar slightly weaker against a basket of major currencies while higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar were in favor. "With the view that the low interest rate policy in the US will likely be around for a while, an abundant supply of dollars is flowing into higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and emerging market currencies," said Kazuyuki Kato, treasury department manager at Mizuho Trust & Banking. The greenback came under pressure on Tuesday after a report of forex diversification by oil-producing countries. Some of the countries later denied such a move. The euro was flat at $1.4722. Yields on euro zone government bonds were slightly lower with the 10-year yield at 3.152 perc
