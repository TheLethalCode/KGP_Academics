 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP in its election manifesto had proposed that the party MPs would lose their parliament membership if they remained absent from the House sessions without parliament's approval. But contrary to that promise, BNP is likely to stay away from parliament for 33 consecutive sittings without the approval of the House which resumes session on Sunday afternoon. Joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan by-passed the stance of his party while asked over phone on Saturday. BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hosssain on Friday told journalists that his party is yet to find a "suitable environment" for joining the parliament. The party started boycotting parliament since June 4 the first day of the budget session of the ninth parliamentalleging break of a promise by speaker Abdul Hamid who had assured them of giving "respectable" number of front bench seats in the House. They remained absent from all 25 working days of the budget session and seven sittings of the third session of the House which started on Sep 7. Speaker Hamid on Sep 15 adjourned parliament until Sunday. The BNP joined parliament's first sitting on Jan 25 and started boycotting the House on Jan 28the second working day of the first sessioncentring a row over seating arrangements in the House. The speaker on Jan 28 reduced the number of front-row seats of BNP to four from nine given by outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircarnow a BNP MP elected from a Bogra constituency vacated by opposition chief Khaleda Zia. Hamid, amid pressure from the ruling Awami League, reduced the number of front-row seats for BNP in the opposition bench. The Awami League said the outgoing speaker gave BNP nine out of ten front-row seats without discussing with the ruling AL-led coalition. In the second (budget) session, Hamid increased the number of front-row seats for BNP to five. The treasury bench says as per parliamentary practices, the BNP should get 10 percent of the total 29 front-row seats against its 30 seats in the 300-strong (directly elected MPs) parliament. House leader Sheikh Hasina during prime minister's question session told parliament that the main opposition had been given more front seats than they were supposed to get in proportion. On the other hand, Sircar justified his decision saying the column in the left hand side of the Speaker was the opposition bench and the ruling MPs should not sit there. As per Rules of Procedure of Parliament, the MPs will sit as per the sitting arrangements made by the speaker who can also change seats of MPs for his convenience. Speaker Hamid had persuaded the opposition to join parliament in the first session pledging "respectable" number of front row seats for them in the budget session. Hamid, in consultation with the ruling party, gave five front row seats, a proposal rejected by the BNP which demanded seven seats. bd
