<TITLE> Putin marks birthday with writers, church praise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Oct 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's most powerful politician Vladimir Putin marked his 57th birthday on Wednesday in the company of literary luminaries, lauded by the Orthodox Church for his wisdom, viewed askance by critics sensing a nascent personality cult. The "Nezavisimaya Gazeta" daily published an "Ode to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin" written in a style typical of poems devoted to former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. "The country is again at a crossroads wondering whether it might perish or not," the ditty reads. "We congratulate you comrade Putin and ask God to give you another 120 years." As prime minister and leader of the ruling party, Putin enjoys lavish, uncritical publicity on state television, something which critics say helps explain his high ratings. As allies and supporters like Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko rushed to congratulate Putin on his birthday, some writers said they were boycotting a meeting with the premier on Wednesday in a Moscow literary museum. "I do not see myself in the role of 'congratulator' or the one who delivers flower and gifts." said writer Dmitry Bykov. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting with writers was not linked to the premier's birthday. "The meeting will proceed in a format of a free conversation touching upon issues like the role of literature in life, and the publishing business," Peskov said. "A broad range of philosophical and practical problems will also be discussed." Leading Russian classic writers like Valentin Rasputin and Andrei Bitov, as well as best-selling novelists like Alexander Kabakov will attend. Foreign news media were not invited. Bykov told Russian News Service radio he was not staying away for ideological reasons but because "when (a meeting) happens on the premier's birthday there is a great chance that instead of a reasonable conversation it will be a formal event." Putin handed over the presidency in May 2008 to handpicked successor Dmitry Medvedev. He took the more junior post of prime minister but he is widely believed to make all key decisions. The former KGB spy has become a devout believer since the collapse of communism and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill was among the first to congratulate Putin on his birthday. "Wisdom based on rich political experience, typical for you, is a guarantee of stability in our state," Kirill wrote in a congratulatory message carried by Russian news agencies. THE RUSSIAN GENES Writers in Soviet times could be equally ascerbic, but hid their mockery in articles 'coded' to slip past censors. One magazine famously carried a story about a pompous and vainglorious writer long overdue for retirement. The item, published ahead of bemedalled leader Leonid Brezhnev's 75th birthday, appeared on page 75. Putin stepped down from the top Kremlin job after serving the maximum two consecutive terms allowed by the constitution. But after taking a break from the presidency, speculation is increasing that Putin may run again in 2012, this time for a six-year term, with the possibility of a second to follow it. Putin himself fanned this speculation by saying he would decide with Medvedev nearer the time which of them would run. Medvedev later said he could run in 2012, but was equally ready for another job "as long as it is useful for the nation." Igor Yurgens, who heads a think-tank working for Medvedev, told Reuters recently that "the cult of personality is in our genes," citing busts and portraits that appeared after Putin's first term -- though he said Putin himself had resisted it. "I believe this is the nature of Russian power," Yurgens added. "There is huge inertia living in this secret Kremlin, looking out on those 1,500-year-old towers and churches. Something happens inside you, I gue
