 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Three suspected criminals were killed in separate armed encounters with RAB and police in the capital's Sutrapur, Jatrabari and Mirpur areas early on Monday. The dead were 26 year-old Jane Alam Sohel, 30 year-old Mohammed Saijuddin, aka Saju, and 32 year-old 'Pichchi' Abul. Sutrapur police chief Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com they had detained Sohel on Monday night. "We took along Sohel to Dholaikhal Truck Terminal to recover arms at around 5:15am. As we reached there, his associates fired with guns on us," he said. "We retaliated and Sohel died during gun battle," the police official said. Sohel was an associate of 'Dakat' ('Robber') Shahid, he added. Police recovered one firearm and two rounds of bullets from the scene. RAB-10 operation officer ABM Enamul Kabir said, being tipped off that a group of criminals were gathering in a field near Namapara slum adjacent to Regal CNG Station in Jatrabari, they went to the spot at around 3am. Sensing their presence the criminals opened fire, forcing the elite force to shoot back, he said. At one stage of the gunfight, Saju died. He was facing some 13 criminal cases, Kabir said. RAB also recovered two forearms and 10 rounds of ammunition. Legal and media wing director, commander Abul Kalam Azad, of RAB headquarters said two teams of RAB-4 and RAB HQ's detective wing launched a drive at Mirpur's Paikpara to detain criminals at around 6am. 'Pichchi' Abul, a member of the Shahdat gang, died when shooting broke out, said Azad. RAB recovered one revolver and five rounds of ammunition from the spot, he said. The three bodies were being kept at Dhaka Medical College Hospital morgue, said authorities. A total of 97 people have been killed in "crossfire/encounters/shootouts" or in custody of law-enforcing agencies from Jan 1 up to Sep 30 this year, said human rights group Odhikar last week amid growing concern over extra-judicial killings. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounters will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past years have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion be disbanded. bdnews24.
