 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar is meeting with Andrew Flintoff's surgeon on Tuesday afternoon in London, hoping a minor operation on his left knee the following day will allow him to reignite his career, reports Cricinfo. Shoaib is to see Dr Andrew Williams at the Wellington Hospital in London even though he has been told that the Pakistan Cricket Board will not pick up the cheque for the treatment. Williams performed extensive surgery on Flintoff in August to try and extend his career. Shoaib, 34, has been dogged by injury and disciplinary issues and last played a Test match almost two years ago in Bangalore, while his most recent one-day international was against Australia in May. He is hopeful, though, that surgery will allow him an opportunity to make the Australia tour in December and prove that he is far from retirement. "I am just so excited and optimistic that a world-leading knee surgeon like Andy Williams is going to take care of my knee," Shoaib told Cricinfo. "I hear that he is like an artist with knees and that his expertise is second to none. It is a great comfort that Andy is taking on my treatment. "I have spoken to him on the phone already after he took an initial look at my scans and he assured me that I still have a lot of bowling left in me, at least as far as my knees are concerned. That was very nice to hear and I can't wait to have the operation and get into my rehab." Shoaib is already looking beyond the surgery and rehab and believes the bigger picture is an encouraging one as far as his career is concerned. Despite the negatives associated with his maverick character, his 90mph pace and strike rate still offers Pakistan a potential world-class performer if he can regain full fitness. Shoaib made his international debut 12 years ago but has only played 46 Tests (taking 178 wickets at an average if 25.69) and 144 ODIs (with 223 victims at 23.86). His statistics are impressive, but he realises his lack of match action and recent disciplinary issues threaten his legacy and career. "It's obvious that I haven't played enough for my country because of the injuries and other issues but nobody should ever doubt my commitment to my country," Shoaib said. "It is playing for Pakistan that has always kept me going through the low and difficult times and it's no different now. It is frustrating to have had the run of injuries I have had but I am confident once my knee has been fixed I can get back to my best. "Although I may not have played as much as I should have, the good part is that I am still very fresh and have a great deal more to offer Pakistan. The thought of playing cricket in Australia again for my country is very exciting and will be my motivation after my surgery. "There are some good young fast bowlers coming through our system and I want to be part of the team with them and help educate them about international cricket and fast bowling. I think the future can still be very exciting for me. "I am looking to play at least as far as the 2011 World Cup and hopefully even furt
