 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division on Tuesday overturned a stay order on bail granted to former telecommunication minister Aminul Haque in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case, clearing the way for his release from behind bars, said his lawyer. Haque secured bail in the case, and five other cases, from the High Court on Aug 27, which was stayed on a government petition on Sep 3. A regular Appellate Division bench of four justices, headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin, overturned the stay order on Tuesday. "It clears all obstacles to his release now," barrister Rafiq Ul Huq, Haque's lawyer, told bdnews24.com after the verdict. The Anticorruption Commission filed the Barapukuria Coalmine case in February, 2007. The anti-graft body filed the case against 16 people, including former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, accusing them of causing state losses totalling Tk 158.71 crore through mismanagement of the coalmine during the previous BNP administtration. Other cases against Haque include a case on charges of corruption in the installation of two bridges in Rajshahi filed with Tanor police in the district in October, 2007. Four other cases were filed for abetting the chief of the banned militant Islamist outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, Siddiqul Islam, better known as 'Bangla Bhai', who was later sentenced to death and executed on terror charges. Three of the latter cases were filed with Atrai Police Station in Rajshahi in 2006 and the fourth in 2007. bdnew
