 WASHINGTON, Oct 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States believes it would be a mistake to lift sanctions against Myanmar at the beginning of a dialogue with that country's military junta, the top US diplomat for Asia said on Wednesday. Following a US policy review on Myanmar, the Obama administration said this week it would pursue deeper engagement with Myanmar's military rulers to try to spur democratic reform but would not ease sanctions for now. "Lifting or easing sanctions at the outset of a dialogue without meaningful progress on our concerns would be a mistake," Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told a US Senate panel. Campbell met U Thaung, Myanmar's minister of science, technology and labor, in New York on Tuesday for what he described as "substantive talks for several hours." His meeting was the highest-level contact with Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in nine years. "We laid out very clearly our views and I stressed to U Thaung that this is an opportunity for Burma, if it is ready to move forward," he told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing. No schedule or venue was set for future bilateral meetings, Campbell added. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Myanmar officials "have shown interest in improving relations with us, reaching out to us." Washington has gradually tightened sanctions on the generals who rule the country to try to force them to hold talks with ethnic minorities and with Nobel laureate and opposition party leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Democratic Senator Jim Webb, who visited Myanmar last month and met junta leader Than Shwe as well as Suu Kyi, said the cutting of all commercial ties had eroded U.S. influence and placed the country under China's sphere of influence. "We limit the opportunities to push for positive change because we do not talk directly to the generals in charge," said Webb, chairman of the subcommittee. NORTH KOREA TIES WORRISOME Several academic experts echoed Webb and urged Washington to boost contacts and aid to Myanmar. The sanctions were "hugely counter-productive in reducing Western influence, reinforcing isolationist tendencies, constraining moves towards market reforms and decimating the position of the Burmese professional, managerial and entrepreneurial classes," said Thant Myint-U of Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. Human rights activists and democracy campaigners from Myanmar have called for stepped-up pressure on the military leadership. "Without having benchmarks and specific guidelines to improve human rights, we fear that the current engagement will end up promoting business interests rather than human rights," T. Kumar, Amnesty International advocacy director for international issues, told reporters. Myanmar plans next year to hold its first election in two decades, which the junta says will bring an end to almost five decades of unbroken military rule. Many analysts say the generals have rigged the process in order to keep power. The United States had discussed its Myanmar policy shift with Japan and planned to expand dialogue with China and India, neighbors of Myanmar with significant trading relations with the Southeast Asian country, he said. Campbell would visit China, one of the junta's main supporters, to discuss Myanmar, in about two weeks, he said. One key concern of the United States was Myanmar's suspected military relationship with North Korea, which is under a battery of UN sanctions that ban nations from trading weapons and nuclear and other sensitive technologies with Pyongyang. "We have seen some steps between North Korea and Burma that concern us, both the provision of small arms and other military equipment, and there are some signs that that cooperation has extended into areas that would be prohibited," Campbell told the hear
