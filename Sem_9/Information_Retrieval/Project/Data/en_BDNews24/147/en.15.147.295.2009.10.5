 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)Political parties must dispel the "crisis of confidence in the caretaker government system", the head of citizen's group Sujon said on Sunday. Sujon president Prof Muzaffer Ahmed was speaking at a roundtable titled 'New Debate on Caretaker Government and Citizen's Concern' hosted by the citizen's group in the capital. Terming people's experience of the last caretaker government a "bitter one", Muzaffer said, "Constitutional bodies will have to be made independent and effective to hold free and fair elections." He said political parties should develop consensus over the issues. He also posed a question as to why political leaders could not sit together in parliament though they work together in parliamentary standing committees. A fresh debate kicked off over the caretaker government system when AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam recently spoke against it terming it "a fiasco" and a failure. The Sujon chief said, "Transparency must be ensured in appointments to constitutional bodies." "The culture of bidding farewell to the previous government's recruits will have to be altered," he said. Also advocating change in the presidential election system, Muzaffer said, the president can be elected through the franchise of Union Parishad and Upazila chairmen as well as mayors of municipalities and city corporations. Speaking in favour of dissolving the caretaker government system altogether, Sujon secretary Badiul Alam Majumdar said, "It is not consistent with democratic system but the Election Commission will have to be strengthened before dissolving it." Moderated by Sujon executive council member ASM Shahajahan, the roundtable was addressed by former caretaker government adviser M Hafiz Uddin Khan, barrister Amir-Ul Islam, journalist Syed Abul Moksud and a number of ruling party lawmakers. Barrister Amir-Ul Islam said, "Decisions should be made regarding appointments to constitutional posts as a crisis of trust is building over the caretaker government system." But, M Hafiz Uddin said, "It would not be proper to dissolve the system before we address the problems which led to its introdcution in the first place." More than one speaker opposed the move to abolish the caretaker system without proper preparation, saying it could bring about "serious political disaster" if done without a proper roadmap. bd
