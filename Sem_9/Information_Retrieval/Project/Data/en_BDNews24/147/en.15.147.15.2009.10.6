 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)The BDR mutiny and BGMEA's demand for government money to pay garment workers were parts of an ongoing conspiracy against the government, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury has said. "The BDR incident on February 25 and BGMEA's demand for money from the government to pay the salaries of the garment workers are parts of the conspiracy to push the country and the government into instability," she said at her office on Tuesday. "These conspiracies against the government are being investigated. Action will be taken against those responsible after spotting them," teh ruling Awami League Presidium member said. Earlier, she had a meeting with Robert L Floyd, World Bank's acting representative in Bangladesh. About the meeting, she said they discussed WB-assisted 'National agriculture technology program' and the development of agriculture in Bangladesh. The WB has shown interest in working to development the agricultural sector of Bangladesh, she said. Asked what measures the government is taking to stop extortion and tender terrorism by ruling Awami League men, she said, during the last AL government there was a rule to submit bids quoting a price five percent more and less of the estimated price. There were few chances of anomalies because if there were more persons the government used to resolve that through lottery. But in 2004, the BNP-led government changed public procurement regulation creating these anomalies. The current government has decided to return to the previous rule, she said. At the same time the cabinet has decided to allow submission of tender at different places across the country, said the minister. About the recent comments of AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil she said, "A decision has been taken by the party. I cannot talk about it here and there." About the hearing of the appeals by convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case, she said the government is running the trial following the common laws though it could be done in the special court. But the prime minister wants to resolve it through common laws and courts
