 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)Parliament resumed business of the third session on Sunday after a 18-day recess with the opposition pressing on with its boycott of the proceedings. The House re-convened at around 4.10 pm with Speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. The order of the day, Sunday's agendas includes a question-answer session, passage of the mobile court bill and tabling of an amendment bill on the Representation of the People Order. Parliament will also see discussion on issues of public importance under article 71 of the Rules of Procedure. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid was answering questions first on his ministry. The session, which began on Sep 7, was adjourned on Sep 15 ahead of the long Eid-ul-Fitr and the Durga Puja holidays. The House is likely to pass a few crucial bills, mostly related to local government, such as the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act and City Corporation Act, during the remainder of the current session, parliament secretariat officials said. Including Sunday, the BNP-led opposition has been abstaining from parliament for 33 consecutive sittings without the approval of the House. BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hosssain said on Friday, two days before the scheduled resumption, that "a suitable environment" for his party's return to parliament had yet to be created. Awami League joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan declined comments on the stance of his party on the issue when asked by phone on Saturday. The opposition joined the ninth parliament's first session on Jan 25 and walked out of the House on Jan 28the second working dayalleging unfairness in allocating House seats for its MPs, then just 27. A total of 38 parliamentarians are in the opposition35 of the main opposition party BNP including five in reserved seats, while their allies Jamaat-e-Islam have two and Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) has one representative in the House. The opposition started its unofficial boycott on June 4 the first day of the budget session of the ninth parliamentalleging break of a promise by speaker Abdul Hamid who had assured them of a "respectable" number of front bench seats in the House. They remained absent during all 25 working days of the budget session and seven sittings of the third session of the House which started on Sep 7. The speaker on Jan 28 reduced the number of front-row seats of BNP to four from the nine given by outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircarnow a BNP MP elected from a Bogra constituency vacated by opposition chief Khaleda Zia. The Awami League said the outgoing speaker gave BNP a disproportionate nine out of ten front-row seats without discussing it with the ruling AL-led coalition. Hamid, amid pressure from the ruling Awami League, reduced the number of front-row seats for the opposition to four. In the second (budget) session, Hamid increased the number to five after negotiations with the BNP. He had persuaded the opposition to join parliament in the first session pledging a "respectable" number of front row seats for them in the budget session. After consultation with the ruling party, Hamid gave them five front row seats, a proposal rejected by the BNP which demanded seven The treasury bench says as per parliamentary practices, the BNP should get just 10 percent of the total 29 front-row seats against its 30 seats in the 300-strong (directly elected MPs) parliament. Leader of the House Sheikh Hasina, during a prime minister's question session, told parliament that the main opposition had been given more front seats than they should get in proportion to their total representation. On the other hand, Sircar justified his decision saying the row to the left side of the Speaker was the opposition bench and ruling MPs should not sit there. As per Rules of Procedure of Parliament, the MPs will sit as per the arrangements made by the speaker who can change seating arrangements at his discretion. bdnews24.
