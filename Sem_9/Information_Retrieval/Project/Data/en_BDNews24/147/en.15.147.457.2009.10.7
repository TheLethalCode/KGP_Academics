<TITLE> PM vows to explore Bay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament on Wednesday that her government was determined to extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal though some groups are opposed to the move. The prime minister's statement followed the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee on energy ministry which on Tuesday urged the government to sign deals with foreign companies over gas exploration in the three of Bangladesh's Bay blocks. "We will definitely extract gas whatever the difficulties," she said during the weekly question-answer session. "We will do whatever is required for the development of the country," she said. Replying to a supplementary query by MP Enamul Haque, Hasina said: "We are making arrangements to extract gas again from the blocks. Many are opposing the move. "They don't want the country to develop. They don't want that electricity production goes up," she said in an indirect dig at the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources and Power and Porta pressure group of left-leaning professionals and politicians. "We will explore new gas fields through seismic survey." Replying to another query, the prime minister said: "We want to solve problems with neighbouring countries without any quarrel. Problems can be solved through discussions. The foreign secretary said last Thursday that Bangladsh has run into disagreement with India and Myanmar over maritime boundary of the three blocks. "We sealed the 30-year Ganges water-sharing treaty through discussions, not through objections. "Nothing can be gained through quarrel," she said. Hasina stressed the need for discussions to solve problems with the neighbouring country. "The government will be careful so that Bangladesh is not affected for the Tipaimukh dam." The government decided to form an expert committee, she said. The government in August approved the proposal to award ConocoPhilips and Tullow Oil plc contracts to explore oil and gas in three blocks in the Bay. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. State-owned exploration authority Petrobangla chairman Moktadir Ali said last week that Conoco is expected to sign deal in the first week and Tullow in the second week of the current month. India and Myanmar have started gas exploration at their maritime boundaries and Bangladesh must start too. Otherwise, they can draw Bangladesh's gas by using advanced technology, chairman of the standing committee, Subid Ali Bhuiyan, told reporters on Tuesday. The National Committee is protesting against the deals which it claims would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee is confusing the public on the issue with such false information. The citizen's group enforced a half-day hartal in capital Dhaka, the first in nearly three years, on Sept 14 in protest at the deals and gave the government until Oct 15 to meet their five-point charter of demands. A group of public university teachers on Friday also invited the government to an open public dialogue on the gas and coal export policies that have touched off debates and protests in recent times. Tipaimukh Dam Replying to a query by MP Nazim Uddin, Hasina said: "Many ministries including water resources ministry and foreign ministry have discussed with India on the erection of the Tipaimukh Hydroelectric Project. "The issue has also been discussed in many meetings of the Joint River Commission. Besides the Indian prime minister on a sidelines meeting during the NAM conference also assured me that Bangladesh would not face any harm." A delegation led by the parliamentary standing committee on water resources ministry went to India to visit the site, she added. "There was a professor of water resources strategy department of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in the delegation. "The delegation had meetings with India's foreign and power ministers. The ministers also assured the delegation that the proposed project would only be implemented as generation of hydroelectricity and it would also help reduce the tendency of inundation. "There is no irrigation component under the project. So no water would be withdrawn from the Barak river," the prime minister said. Dhaka-Ctg highway Answering to a query by MP Md Fazlul Azim, she said: "The invitation of bids to promote the Dhaka-Chittagong highway into four lanes is complete. "The tender evaluation of ten packages of road construction is ongoing. We hope to start the implementation of the project by December. The work will be complete by December 2012." Dhaka gridlock In a reply to another query by Fazlul Azim about the governmental steps to ease traffic snarls in the capital, the prime minister said: "Traffic snarls are normal in cities. The roads and offices should have been built in a planned way. But they were not. "We had taken some steps during our first stint in 1996 to reduce jam. But the following government did not take any step. She said vehicles were increasing in Dhaka but the old vehicles were not being removed. The government is taking steps such as removing the old vehicles and introducing dual-carriage roads, she said. "The government is also planning to improve the traffic system. We are taking a full-fledged plan to improve the system along with the districts around the capital," she said. "We are moving to set different schedules for the schools, banks and offices to reduce traffic jam so that all vehicles do not move at the same time. "I request all schools in the capital to arrange their own buses for the students. If it is done the guardians will not get their vehicles out." The prime minister asked the drivers to obey traffic rule. "We have scarcity of traffic police. We already have introduced community policing," she said. Asian Highway In reply to MP Rafiqul Islam, Hasina said: "There will be three highways AH-1, AH-2 and AH-4 in Asian highway. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway is included in AH-4. "The highway is now being promoted to four-lane highway. If it is connected with Asian highway it will have six lanes or more than that according to the demand of the countries concerned." bdnews24.com/
