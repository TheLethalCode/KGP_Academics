<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Tuesday passed the Union Parishad bill, proposed by local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, which will allow candidates to reschedule loans until the filing of nomination papers. The bill has not kept the controversial provision of appointing bureaucrats as administrators to existing Union Parishads in absence of timely elections to the lowest tier of the local government. But it does have a provision to appoint bureaucrats as administrators to newly-created Union Parishads for at best six months before holding polls. The bill was passed in line with the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee on local government . The parliamentary body changed some sections of the draft bill and finalised its recommendations after holding its meeting on September 30. The draft bill, which Ashraful placed on Sept 13, had initially said no loan defaulters would be able to contest the Union Parishad polls. The enacted bill said, "Candidates will fail to contest the polls (UP) if they leave any loans in banks or financial institutes expired until filing of the nomination papers". It means the candidates will get the chance to reschedule the loans until filing of nomination papers, committee chairman Rahmat Ali told reporters earlier. Section 18 of the bill says the government will be able to appoint bureaucrats as administrators to newly-created Union Parishads. "But the appointed administrators will not hold office for more than 120 days (4 months). If they fail to hold polls within 120 days for any disastrous situation, they will get 6o more days to hold the polls." The bill has a provision authorising the government to suspend an elected Union Parishad if it considered any action of the Parishad is against the interest of the council from "an administrative point of view". The bill also made ways for the utility bill defaulters to contest the polls. "Loans for constructing their houses and small agricultural loans will not fall under the purview of the section", says the section 26 of the bill. Section 26 of the draft bill said that any contestant would disqualify if they did not pay utility bills such as land development tax, telephone, water, gas, electricity and other bills for one year. The enacted bill says the contestants must not provide affidavit on their personal lives along with the nomination papers. Section 20 (of the original bill) made attaching affidavit containing personal information on the candidates mandatory. The Election Commission earlier asked the government not to make attaching affidavit to the nomination paper mandatory for the polls aspirants. A forum of the Union Parishad leaders last Saturday warned that they would take to street if the government passed the Union Parishad bill having provision for appointment of bureaucrats as administrators. bdnews24.c
