 Savar, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission must be further strengthened in the interests of transparent and credible elections, the chief election commissioner said on Sunday. "The Election Commission is not in a good state as it has had to depend on different departments of the government, which should not be so for an independent body like the commission," said ATM Shamsul Huda. He also said, "There is no link between abolishing the caretaker government system and strengthening the Election Commission." "The commission must be empowered for its own sake." Huda was speaking to reporters after launching a first-of-its-kind foundation course for Upazila election officials at the Bangladeh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) in Savar on Sunday. A total of 35 officials from different Upazilas were attending the two-month special course. Regarding the much debated submission of eight pieces of personal data by UP election candidates, Huda said, "We ourselves have sent a proposal for not giving the eight pieces of information as it would then be a tough job to scrutinise the total data supplied by some 2.5 lakh candidates for 5,000 Upazila posts." The event chaired by BPATC rector Delwar Hossain was also attended by election commissioners M Shakhawat Hossain, Sohul Hussain and secretary Humayun Kabir bdnews24.c
