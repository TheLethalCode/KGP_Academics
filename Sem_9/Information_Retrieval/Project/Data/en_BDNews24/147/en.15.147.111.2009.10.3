 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)--Bilonia Land Port in Feni is set for launch on Sunday and businessmen believe the 17th land port of the country will help augment export to Tripura and six other northeastern states in India. It will help reduce the yawning trade deficit with India, said chairman of India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (IBCCI) Abdul Matlub Ahmad at a news conference at its auditorium in Motijheel on Saturday. Shipping and inland water transport minister Shahjahan Khan is scheduled to inaugurate the port in Muhurighat in Parshuram Upazila. Ahmed said port will also help cut down on transportation costs. "The exporters and importers from Chittagong, Noakhali and Feni areas wll be able to transport their goods at very low costs. "We have estimated that the cost of transporting goods using the other land ports is around 20,000 taka. Transporting goods using the Bilonia-Feni port lowers it to around 5,000 taka," the IBCCI chief told the media. Tripura's minister of finance, public works and revenue Badal Chowdhury, minister of forest, rural development, industries and commerce Jitendra Chowdhury, Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty and the business leaders of both countries will be present at the inauguration. The inauguration ceremony will be organised by the IBCCI with the help of the Feni Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Tripura Chamber of Commerce. Ahmad said: "We (IBCCI) are taking various initiatives to close the trade gap with India. The inauguration of this port is part of those initiatives. We are hoping that Bangladesh will export goods worth 1 billion dollar to India by 2011." According to the Export Promotion Bureau and Bangladesh Bank, the trade deficit with India stood at a staggering $ 2.59 billion in 2008-09 fiscal year. Bangladesh has imported $ 2.86 billion worth of goods from India in the current fiscal year and exported goods worth only $ 3.58 million. The deficit exceeded $ 3 billion in the FY 2007-08. But the bumper production of rice for more than one year had brought the rice imports to near zero. As a result the trade deficit had gone down in 2008-09 fiscal year. bd
