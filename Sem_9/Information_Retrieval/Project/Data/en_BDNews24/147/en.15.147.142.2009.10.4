 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested two RAB members and another early on Sunday on charges of kidnapping two businessmen and robbing them of gold and money worth around Tk 27 lakh. The accused are sub-inspector of police Azizul Haque, BDR habildar Rafiqul Islam and sacked police constable Abdul Hakim. Motijheel police arrested Haque and Islam, while Hakim was detained in Chittagong. Deputy commissioner of Motijheel zone Khandaker Muhid Uddin told bdnews24.com the RAB men were arrested after their involvement was proved in two cases filed with Motijheel Police Station. They were summoned to the police station on Friday night for questioning and were arrested early on Sunday after confirmation. Hakim was also arrested at night, he added. Police said some people, who identified themselves as members of the Detective Branch of police, abducted a gold trader, Milon Miah, from Kamalapur bus stand on Sep 6. They left Milon at Nikunja of Khilgaon and took gold bars, cash, mobile phones and other articles worth around Tk 14 lakh. Six days into the incident, a money exchange trader, Azim Uddin, was kidnapped from Motijheel at midday. The captors took Tk 13 lakh from his possession and left him in Nikunja. Two separate cases were filed. After the investigation had started, two men who bought the mugged mobile phones were detained from Jamalpur. They gave statement about the involvement of RAB personnel. RAB-3 chief Mamun Mahmud Firoz Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "RAB would not assist those who will be found involved in such occurrences.
