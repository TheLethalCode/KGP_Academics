<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)--Former deputy police commissioner Kohinoor Miah has petitioned the High Court Sunday for anticipatory bail in the case that accuses him of torture of Shahina Sultana Shanta. His counsel Gazi Qamrul Islam submitted the bail petition for the bench of justices Abdul Wahab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaq. A Dhaka court on Tuesday had ordered Dhanmondi police to consider the quashed torture case as statement against three, including Kohinoor. Judge Emdadul Haq of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court gave the order on Tuesday morning. Md Atiur Rahman, husband of Shahina Sultana Shanta, had later told bdnews24.comt the case did not require judicial investigation. The judge ordered to recognise the case directly as a statement. Dhaka's Fourth Metropolitan Sessions' additional judge Ismail Hossain last Sunday ordered for departmental investigation. The case details said Shanta was badly been beaten by police in front of Rapa Plaza at Dhanmondi on Mar 12, 2006 on the orders of Kohinoor. Police also kicked in her abdomen that had subsequently caused the woman to suffer a miscarriage. She was returning home with her son from school when the alleged incident took place. Shanta filed the torture case with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Mar 14, two days after the incident, against Kohinoor, then deputy commissioner of Dhaka (South) Majharul Haque and constable Ruhul Amin. The Criminal Investigation Department of police were asked to investigate the case. CID officer Ali Haidari had submitted a report saying there was no proof of the incident. Shanta filed a petition against the report on Sep 27 the same year. She sought a judicial inquiry into the case saying the police cannot be just and unbiased in an investigation against the police. Later, then Dhaka Metropolitan magistrate Shafique Anwar after carrying out a departmental investigation submitted another report claiming that the incident was not true. The court rejected another petition submitted by Shanta. On Oct 30, 2006, Shanta requested for a revision at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions' Judge Court against the denial order. bdne
