<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary standing committee on local government has submitted its final recommendations on the Union Parishad bill keeping a controversial provision to appoint bureaucrats as administrators to the lowest tier of local government in absence of timely elections. The committee in its recommendations also allows Union Parishad election contenders to reschedule loans until filing of nomination papers. It also made way for utility bill defaulters to contest the polls. Monowar Hossain Chowdhury, a member of the standing committee, tabled the final recommendations on the bill in parliament Sunday on behalf of committee chairman Rahmat Ali who was in the US. The parliamentary body finalised the recommendations after holding a meeting on September 30. Ali had said the committee would drop the disputed provision on bureaucrat administrators. But Section 18 of the recommended bill says the government will be able to appoint bureaucrats as administrators to old Union Parishads in absence of timely elections and to any newly created Union Parishads until elections are held, though for no longer than six months. "The appointed administrators will not hold office for more than 120 days (4 months). If they fail to hold polls within 120 days for any disastrous situation, they will get 60 more days to hold polls," the provision says. A forum of the Union Parishad leaders Saturday warned that they would take to streets if the government passed the bill with the provision of bureaucrat administrators. The standing committee did not change the proposed provisions authorising the government to suspend an elected Union Parishad if it considered any action of the Parishad against the interest of the council from "an administrative point of view". Loan defaulters may contest The original bill was placed in parliament by local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Sept 13. It said no loan defaulters would be able to contest in the Union Parishad polls. But the standing committee in its recommendation said, "Candidates will not be able to contest the (UP) polls if they leave any loans in banks or financial institutions expired until filing of the nomination papers". This means the candidates will get the chance to reschedule the loans until filing of nomination papers, committee chairman Rahmat Ali told reporters on September 30. "Loans for constructing their houses and small agricultural loans will not fall under the purview of the section", says Section 26 of the bill. Section 26 of the original bill also says that any contestant would disqualify if they did not pay utility bills such as land development tax, telephone, water, gas, electricity and other bills for one year. This has also been overturned by the standing committee. Other changes include Section 20 of the original bill, making attachment of an affidavit containing personal information of the candidates mandatory. The Election Commission earlier asked the government to delete the provision from the draft bill. The standing committee cut the provision in line with the commission's recommendations. Parliament secretariat sources say the bill is likely to be passed in the current session. bdnews24.c
