 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina returned home on Thursday morning, ending a hectic but "successful" trip to the United States and said on arrival she was "fine". She spent 10 days in the US when, on Sep 26, she addressed the 64th session of the United Nations' General Assembly. "I'm fine," the prime minister told Awami League activists who gathered just outside the VVIP terminal. A regular flight of Qatar Airways carrying Hasina landed at the airport at 8:30am. Cabinet members, chief whip, several MPs, chiefs of armed forces, senior government officials were present there to say 'welcome back' to the prime minister. Thousands of leaders and workers of her party and its associate organisations came carrying banners and festoons. They thanked her for delivering speech in Bangla at the UNGA session. The prime ministerial convoy had to stop amid welcoming slogans outside the VVIP terminal. She made a short speech there with a hand-mike. Hasina, who left at 11pm local time on Tuesday, told reporters at the Washington airport that her visit to the UN had been successful. On Sep 26, in her UNGA speech in Bangla, she called for proportional representation of Bangladesh in planning and strategising the UN peacekeeping operations and sought support of member countries to make Bangla an official language of the world body. She urged the world leaders to be united to face the challenges of climate change, economic downturn and international terrorism. During her visit, Hasina had a meeting with US president Barak Obama and invited him to visit Bangladesh. She also met and dined with US secretary of state Hilary Clinton and UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon. Speaking at a number of meetings in New York, she urged the non-resident Bangladeshis and US companies to invest in Bangladesh. The prime minister travelled to Washington and celebrated her birthday at the Marriott Hotel in Baltimore where she cut a cake and spent time with her family members, including sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajib Wajed Joy and daughter Saima Wajed Putul and grandchildren. She turned 62 on Sep 28. Hasina also consulted a doctor in Washington for treatment of her partly damaged ear as a result of a deadly grenade attack on Aug 21, 2004. Her doctors said that her eyes and ears were now in a better condition than before and regular treatment would improve her hearing ability, according to Khalid Hasan, the US unit chief of AL. It was Hasina's first trip to US after assuming the office of prime minister for the second time. Sister Sheikh Rehana, foreign minister Dipu Moni, environment minister Hasan Mahmud, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, foreign secretary Mohamed Mizarul Kayes, retired ambassador Mohammad Ziauddin, Nasrul Hamid Bipu MP, columnist Mustafa Noor-ul-Islam, prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad and were in the entourage of the prime minister. bdnews
