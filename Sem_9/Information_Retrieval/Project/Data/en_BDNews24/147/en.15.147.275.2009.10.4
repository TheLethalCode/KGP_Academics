 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)Parliament passed the Mobile Court Bill 2009 on Sunday, to enact an earlier ordinance allowing metropolitan and district magistrates to resume operations of mobile courts. The new legislation authorises the executive magistrates to punish offenders on the spot, awarding maximum sentences of two years for offences under 85 different laws. The House passed the bill, proposed by home minister Sahara Khatun, by voice vote in absence of the main opposition BNP who continued their unofficial boycott as parliament resumed its third session on Sunday. Sahara had tabled the bill on Sept 13, just before the third session broke for Eid-ul-Fitr and Durga Puja holidays. President Zillur Rahman had earlier promulgated an emergency ordinance in July, during a parliamentary recess, to allow mobile courts to continue functioning until passage of the bill. The president's ordinance followed an earlier Mobile Court Ordinance 2007 passed under the immediate past caretaker government, which stated that "there was a vacuum in the operation of mobile courts by executive magistrates, who lost judicial powers, since the separation of the judiciary from the executive on Nov 1, 2007." "It caused problems in controlling law and order and crime at field levels." The caretaker government's ordinance became ineffective in February after the new parliament led by the Awami League convened at the start of the year. The incumbent government formulated the Mobile Court Bill 2009 on June 4 this year. bdnews24.c
