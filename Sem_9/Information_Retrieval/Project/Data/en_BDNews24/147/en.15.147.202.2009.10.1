 MILAN, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan's owners insist the club is not up for sale and coach Leonardo's job looks secure for now, but another defeat at joint-bottom Atalanta on Sunday (1300) would crank up the pressure. Wednesday's shock 1-0 home loss to FC Zurich in the Champions League has taken the club to new depths after an already shaky start to the campaign under the rookie Brazilian.

That means the former Italy coach just has Sunday's trip to AS Roma (1300) to shine. Injury-prone Diego limped out of Juventus's 0-0 draw at Bayern Munich on Wednesday and could miss Sunday's game at Palermo (1845) while striker Diego Milito is a doubt for Inter Milan's home match with Udinese on Saturday (1845).
