 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Home ministry officials have said that the government will be able to introduce machine-readable passport (MRP) by the international deadline of April 2010. The assurance came at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on home ministry on Thursday. Bangladeshi nationals would not be able to travel abroad if the government failed introducing the new form of passport by the deadline that the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) set for all countries. "Officials at the Department of Immigration and Passport department officials have assured us that they will be able to introduce machine-readable passport by April 2010," Abdus Salam, the committee chairman, told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. The chairman, quoting the ministry officials, said the government already floated tender for the passport project. Twenty-three companies having experience in such work have taken part in the bidding which was set to close on Oct 27, he said. The standing committee discussed introduction of the passport as some media reported that the government would fail to meet the ICAO deadline and Bangladeshis would be denied entry to over 150 countries. As per the ICAO guidelines, the government must stop issuing paper-made passports, which Bangladeshis hold, from April 2010. However, the paper-made passports would also remain valid after April 2010, the chairman said. "But no new paper-made passport will remain valid after the stipulated timeframe," said Salam. The Department of Immigration and Passport currently issues paper-made passports that can be forged as photos and signatures are pasted after facts are hand-written. In addition, People can get away with having more than one passport due to a lack of database on personal accounts. These factors combined to reduce the acceptability of Bangladeshi passports across the world. The process of modernising passports in Bangladesh started in 1997. The home ministry began to introduce machine-readable passports, visas and national identity cards in 2004. But the move stalled later. Bangladeshis have 1.20 crore manual passports. Home minister Sahara Khatun and committee's members Sanjida Khatun, Nurul Islam Sujon and Mujibul Haq Chunnu also attended the meeting.
