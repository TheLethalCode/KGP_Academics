 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has graduated to the league of medium developed nations regarding human development issues, according to a report released on Monday by the UNDP. The study titled 'Overcoming barriers: Human mobility and development' says Bangladesh's Human Development Index (HDI) has risen 1.86 percent on steady improvement in life expectancy, education and the standard of living. The recent HDI for Bangladesh, based on 2007 data, ranks it 146th among the 182 countries, two steps up from last year. At the launch of the report at Hotel Sheraton, UNDP country director Stefan Priesner said Bangladesh has significantly improved over the last three decades when it comes to human development. The 2009 Human Development Report places migration as a key component for human development. Migration can enhance human development for the people who move, for destination communities and those who remain home, reads the study. Bangladesh has an emigration rate of 4.5 percent with over 90 percent of them living in developed countries of Asia. Noting government initiatives to activate Bangladeshi missions abroad to ensure rights of migrants, Priesner said they hoped for further progress on the matter. "This is a crucial precondition to ensure best out of migration and human movement," he added. Touching on remittance matters, the study finds that average remittances per person for Bangladesh in 2009 was at $41, higher than the South Asian average of $33 The report shows that migration, especially the internal one, can have a significant impact on poverty reduction. "Evidence from Bangladesh and India shows that poverty rates fall for households with at least one member who has moved elsewhere in the country," the report quotes. The UNDP official stressed a comprehensive strategy to manage internal migration as urban extreme poverty in Bangladesh has not seen any progress against the backdrop of considerable improvement in rural poverty reduction. "Instead of viewing internal migration as a problem, the report encourages South Asian countries to view it as a possible solution to development needs that can be managed." The report suggested opening existing entry channels for more workers, lowering cost of migration, ensuring migrants' human rights and easing internal migration.
