 DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portsmouth soccer club's new owner Sulaiman al-Fahim said on Sunday he is in talks to sell a stake to Saudi Arabian investors to help inject more cash into the troubled English Premier League strugglers. Speaking to Reuters, Fahim said he would be flying to London on Monday to finalise the deal this week. "I decided to have two owners for the club for its sustainability," Fahim said.

"I am there for the long term and it is good to have a few partners so if one decides to leave the other can buy more shares and the club is always safe. Therefore, I will be ready to invest more."
