 KATHMANDU, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Torrential rains triggered floods and landslides in Nepal on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people in the west of the Himalayan nation, officials said. "The victims were buried when landslides swept away two houses," said district administrator Rajendra Ghimire from Dadeldhura, 480 km (300 miles) west of Kathmandu. Rescue work has been hampered by the heavy rains, he said. More than 50 people have died in Nepal in the monsoon rains since June this year.
