 WASHINGTON, Oct 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday blamed the past US failure to deploy enough troops to Afghanistan for the Taliban's revival and said the United States could not afford to become the second superpower defeated there. While declining to comment on the direction of US President Barack Obama's sweeping review of US strategy toward Afghanistan, Gates made clear the United States was not pondering a withdrawal despite the war's growing unpopularity. "We are not leaving Afghanistan. This discussion is about next steps forward and the president has some momentous decisions to make," Gates said in a TV program taped at George Washington University that will be aired by CNN on Tuesday. Seeking to shore up support, Obama invited senior Democratic and Republican lawmakers to the White House on Tuesday to discuss the future course of the war. He is due to meet his national security team on Wednesday and Friday to discuss how to deal with the deteriorating security situation. "I don't think we have the option to leave," said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. "That's quite clear." The debate within the Obama administration is now over whether to send up to 40,000 more troops, or scale back the U.S. mission and focus on striking al Qaeda cells, an idea backed by Vice President Joe Biden. The top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, has given a dire assessment of the eight-year war, saying that more troops and a new strategy to win over the Afghan people are needed to avert failure. Over the weekend, U.S. forces in Afghanistan suffered their worst losses in more than a year when fighters stormed remote outposts near the Pakistan border. Gates urged U.S. military advisers to speak "candidly but privately" but defended McChrystal, who has been criticized for appearing to lobby in public for sending more troops, "as exactly the right person to be the commander in Afghanistan." 'EPICENTER OF JIHAD' Gates suggested the failure of the United States and its allies to put more troops into Afghanistan in earlier years -- when former US President George W. Bush shifted resources to invade Iraq -- had given the Taliban an edge. "The reality is that because of our inability, and the inability, frankly, of our allies, (for putting) enough troops into Afghanistan, the Taliban do have the momentum right now, it seems," Gates said. However, he said the United States could not afford to give al Qaeda and the Taliban the propaganda victory of a US retreat in Afghanistan, where mujahideen forced the Soviet Union to withdraw in 1989 after a decade of bloody warfare. Describing the Afghanistan-Pakistan border as "the modern epicenter of jihad," Gates said the militants sensed a chance "to defeat a second superpower," which he said would help al Qaeda to recruit, fundraise and plan operations. "What's more important than that in my view is the message that it sends that empowers al Qaeda ... The notion that they have come back from this defeat, come back from 2002, to challenge not only the United States but NATO, 42 nations, is a hugely empowering message should they be successful." he said. As the strategy debate in Washington gathered steam, Afghan election authorities began a recount on Monday in the disputed presidential election held in August. Allegations of fraud in the what Gates called the "flawed" election are one of the reasons US officials have cited for reviewing policy toward Afghanistan. With US casualties on the rise, American public opinion has turned increasingly against what Obama's aides once hailed as the "good war," in contrast to the unpopular war in Iraq led by his predecessor, George W. Bush. There also have been increasing calls from the anti-war left and foreign policy critics for a US pullout. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the White House on Monday, and a few were arrested when they chained themselves to the gates. The Obama administration already has almost doubled the number of US troops in Afghanistan this year to 62,000 to contend with the worst violence since US-led forces ousted the Taliban rulers in 2001. The US invasion was launched in the weeks after the September 11 attacks carried out by al Qaeda, which had been given a haven in Afghanistan by the Taliban. Approving the 30,000 to 40,000 more troops McChrystal is said to want would be politically risky for Obama because of unease within his Democratic Party and fatigue in the public after eight years of war in Afghanistan and six in I
