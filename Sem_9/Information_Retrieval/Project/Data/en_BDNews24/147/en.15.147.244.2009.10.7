 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Wednesday morning began hearing the Bangabandhu murder appeals for the third day amid tightened security around the court premises. The hearing started at 9:50am in the third trial room. A security archway was set up at the entrance of the trial room. Abdullah Al Mamun, lawyer for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and lancer AKM Mohiuddin, started reading out from page 773 of the appeal petition. On the second day, the apex court asked all including the media and lawyers to be careful in delivering briefings on the hearing. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after Tuesday's hearing that statements were being delivered in talk shows on the merit of the case. "This should not take place during an ongoing trial." The freshly formed bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing on Monday. Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench on Sunday with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding.
