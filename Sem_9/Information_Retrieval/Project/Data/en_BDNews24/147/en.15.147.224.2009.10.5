Manufacturers have also donated about 150 million doses of vaccine. More is needed, said David Nabarro, the UN coordinator for fighting new emerging flu varieties. "The challenge during the next few weeks is to build up the solidarity between wealthy nations and poor nations to ensure that adequate vaccine is made available," he said.
