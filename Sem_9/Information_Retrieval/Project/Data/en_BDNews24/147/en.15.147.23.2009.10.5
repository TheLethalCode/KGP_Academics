 WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has mobilized enough forces and equipment to launch a long awaited ground offensive against Taliban militants in their South Waziristan stronghold near the Afghan border, US defense officials said on Sunday. Washington sees a concerted push by Pakistan to eliminate Taliban and al Qaeda "sanctuaries" on its territory as the key to turning around a faltering US-led war in Afghanistan. Pakistan has cited in recent months shortages of helicopters, armored vehicles and precision weapons in putting off a Waziristan assault, but US officials said they believed the army was sufficiently equipped to act. "We would assess that they have plenty of force to do the job right now," said one of the officials, who has been closely monitoring Pakistani preparations for the offensive. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing Pakistani military planning. Pakistan has amassed troops around Waziristan, imposing a blockade to try to choke off Taliban supplies. Ahead of an anticipated ground assault, the army has increased artillery fire and the CIA has stepped up attacks using drone aircraft armed with missiles. Pakistani military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said two divisions, or up to 28,000 soldiers, were in place, enough to take on an estimated 10,000 hard-core Taliban. While declining to discuss force levels, a US defense official described the Waziristan deployment as "significant" and said he did not expect any additional reinforcements. "You might see some troops moving but they would probably be rotating. I think they're going to maintain about the same strength that they have there now," the official said. Washington believes the Pakistanis will have to "clear and hold" the rugged, mountainous territory to crush militants loyal to the late Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud. Baitullah was killed in a US missile strike in August. US intelligence agencies believe his successor, Hakimullah Mehsud, may have been killed soon thereafter in a firefight with rivals, leaving the Taliban in disarray. Allied with al Qaeda, Mehsud's group has mostly been fighting against Pakistani forces but also sends militants to join the battle against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. AL QAEDA SANCTUARY Appearing on CNN, White House National Security Adviser James Jones pointed to al Qaeda "sanctuaries" in Pakistan as "the problem, the next step" in the fight against the group, but said Pakistani government and army "has done much better than anybody thought" at dealing with the threat. US officials see the Pakistani army's offensive against the former Taliban bastion in Swat, 80 miles (120 km) northwest of Islamabad, as a sign that the country's political and military leaders have learned from past missteps. "I think they're determined to not make the mistake of withdrawing (from Swat) before the government forces are able to come in and backfill, and do the hold and build functions of counter-insurgency," the official said. Jones said Washington was working closely with the Pakistani army "to try to help them get rid of the insurgency problem on their side of the border. If that happens, that's a strategic shift in the region." US officials acknowledge Pakistani troops need more armored vehicles and night-vision devises to protect themselves against improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the most lethal weapon used by the Taliban against US forces in Afghanistan. "But the lack of that equipment does not mean they cannot conduct successful military operations. It might mean that it would be a little more difficult, that the logistics would be a little trickier. But it doesn't mean they can't pull the trigger if they want," one of the defense officials said. A US military official said an assault by ground forces in Waziristan "can still be effective" despite some shortages, adding that the Pentagon was trying to free up helicopters and other equipment for Pakistan "as soon as possible". The Pentagon has sought permission from Congress to transfer used US military hardware from Iraq to the Pakistani army but US lawmakers have so far balked at the request, citing concerns Islamabad could use the equipment against India. Washington is also securing some equipment through third governments but the effort is moving slowly, officials s
