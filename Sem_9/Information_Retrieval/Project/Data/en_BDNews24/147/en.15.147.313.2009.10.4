 CAMP DELHI, Afghanistan, Oct 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On the frontline of Washington's counter-insurgency in Afghanistan, intelligence officer Hajji Mir Hamzai stands before a map and tells a young Marine where the Taliban are next likely to strike. "I know here and here, I have heard they want to place bombs," Hamzai, an Afghan who works for the National Directorate of Security points to a wall and tells Captain Trevor Hunt through a translator. Hunt wants to know if any of the Taliban in Garmsir district can be turned into allies. "All Taliban are the same," said Hamzai, whose three brothers were killed in two separate suicide attacks by the Taliban. "There is another type which is also called Taliban. They are simple. They are not politicians, they are just locals ... But the ones that fight, the only way is to kill them," said Hamzai, who uses a network of undercover agents to gather information. In the villages, some clerics preach against the insurgents and al Qaeda, others pledge support for them, but do not want to fight. Hamzai believes the latter are the only kind of Taliban who can be persuaded to work with the Americans. There are some 10,000 US Marines in Helmand province, most of whom arrived in May this year to finally wrest control of districts such as Garmsir from insurgents. In his assessment of the war in Afghanistan, the commander of US and NATO forces in the country, General Stanley McChrystal, has said there needs to be more emphasis on alienating the Taliban from ordinary Afghans and persuading non-ideological insurgents to lay down arms. At Camp Delhi, the Marines took over from British troops who, with a far smaller force, were locked in a stalemate against the Taliban for years. "The British were here, they were getting ambushed all the time. When the Marines came they started fighting and kicked everybody"s butt," Hamzai said. Taliban control over Garmsir dropped from 60 percent to 30 percent since the Marines arrived, he added. Clutching his satellite phone and using a pencil from the pocket of his traditional Afghan dress of long shirt and loose trousers, Hamza tries to illustrate how the Taliban are operating in this part of Garmsir district on the back of a playing card. His territory covers all of Garmsir district. Today, he is discussing Taliban movements on the crown of what is referred to by foreign troops as 'the snake's head': a bulge of decades-old US-built canals, surrounded by fertile land and residential compounds, which tapers into the Helmand River. "People are looking for a way to get away from the Taliban ... They understand that fighting is not the right way," Hamzai said. Hamzai has been visiting the small, dust-covered base at Camp Delhi for the past four years. The Taliban have tried many times to kill him. "Before now, I was surrounded by Taliban, but now I can easily come to Delhi. Now I'm just scared of suicide attackers ... Whenever the Taliban have a shura (meeting) they say 'Mr Hamzai is the son of an American'. Only God has kept me ali
