 LOS ANGELES Oct 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA plans on Monday to start offering a wireless service for office workers, hoping to increase its presence in the corporate market as it chases larger rivals like AT&T and Verizon.

The fee, which depends on the number of users signed up, can include unlimited Wi-Fi calls. T-Mobile also promised uninterrupted service: if a user moves out of a Wi-Fi zone during a conversation, the call will automatically switch to T-Mobile USA's cellular netw
