 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Chief information commissioner M Azizur Rahman said that the information commission will play an important role in preventing corruption in the country, but will not be able to make changes overnight. "It will be able to dispel corruption bit by bit by opening up information," said Rahman at a book launching of 'Amader toththo amader odhikar (Our information, our right)'. "Three people alone cannot change anything," he said, referring to the three-member commission. "Citizens from all walks of life will have to come forward to make the right to information law and commission a success." The book launch was jointly arranged by Nagorik Udyog and Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, who jointly translated the book in Bangla from the original English published by CHRI. Rahman termed the right to information "the cornerstone of the constitution". "The present government has opened up a great opportunity by passing the law. But time is needed to implement this basic right of the citizens," he said. He said that till now the commission had received only two complaints though those were not related to information rights. Khan Sarwar Murshid, chairperson of Nagorik Udyog, said, "The present political culture does not assure us." He put emphasis on using information as a tool to organise society. "This law will not be meaningful if the commission is not active," he added. Bangladesh has joined the list of "civilised nations" through the information rights law, said journalist Manjurul Ahsan Bulbul. "This law should change the culture of secrecy and fear." But, he qualified, it was not a total reflection of the expectation of citizens and media. Around four hundred information officers were appointed across the country, said information commissioner Sadeka Halim. The marginal communities, in particular, will have to be made aware of their rights regarding the new law, stressed "Only then will democracy be meaningful." bd
