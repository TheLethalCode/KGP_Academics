<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has granted bail to Dhaka City Corporation's superintending engineer Faruq Aziz in a case filed by the DCC chief engineer on charge of pulling out a pistol on and threatening to murder him. Metropolitan magistrate SK Tofael Hasan gave the order at 11am Thursday on his petition. Earlier in the day, the case recording officer and the investigating officer explained 'why a case involving serious charges kept provision for bail for the accused'. While explaining, both officials upheld the case statement and reiterated that the merit of the case allowed 'the accused to get bail'. The court on Wednesday cancelled Faruq's bail petition and ordered him back to jail. It also had ordered the case investigating officer to explain by Thursday why the case statement had not mentioned that the charges were not bailable. Brig Gen Abdul Kadir, the DCC chief engineer, lodged a complaint on Sept 27 that DCC circle-1 superintending engineer Faruq Aziz threatened to kill him on that day showing a pistol over filling up the vacant post of additional engineer, for which Aziz is an aspirant. Kadir also submitted a written complaint to the DCC mayor. Mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka formed a probe body into the incident after suspending Faruk Aziz temporarily. Md Saidur Rahman, assistant engineer of the DCC chief engineer's office, filed a case with Shahbagh Police Station. RAB arrested Faruq on Sept 29 night from his Shekher Tek residence and seized his pistol with 25 rounds of ammo. b
