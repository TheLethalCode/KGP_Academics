A freshly formed five-strong bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, which chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted on Sunday. Barrister Mamun told reporters after the hearing that he had finished 608-691 pages out of 1,530 pages of the paperbook in the Monday's hearing. He said: "Of the ruling given by three High Court judges I have presented most parts of the ruling by Justice Md Ruhul Amin at [Monday's] hearing. "Justice Ruhul Amin said in his ruling that confessional statements by convicts Syed Faruk Rahman, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan were not given voluntarily. "The magistrate did not fill up three columns of the form during the confessional statement though it was mandatory. The lawyer said: "Justice Ruhul Amin in the ruling also said the magistrate during the statement told the convicts that they would not handed over to police again. "The magistrate did not submit any paper regarding the three statements. According to Ruhul Amin the three statements could not be considered as statements in the eyes of law, barrister Mamun added. He said Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for Syed Faruk Rahman, informed the court that the appeal filed for the delay of the government appeal over sending the summary of the appeals was not included on the cause list. The court said the appeal would be included on Tuesday's business agenda. The hearing should be presented on the five arguments granted by the Appellate Division, the court said. Mamun told the court that other related arguments should also be presented along with the five. Of the rulings given by three HC judges, two judges of one bench delivered split verdict, he told the reporters. "The ruling of the three judges should be presented before the court. The Appellate Division judges should be informed of the ruling. Huge numbers of lawyers and law officers were present during the hearing. The other members of the bench hearing the appeals are justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha. The hearings mark the start of the final legs of the longest and most debated trial for the killing of the most famous person in Bangladesh. The special prosecutor of the case, Anisul Haque, told reporters on Sunday, "With the formation of the new bench, waiting hours have come to an end, paving the way of beginning of the hearing from [Monday]." Asked if the hearing of the appeal of the case or the new appeal will begin first, Haque said it depends on what the court wants. He claimed the concise statement has been submitted according to rule and said the state would reply on the issue in the court. Convicted accused Sultan Shahriar Rashid's lawyer Abdur Rezzaq Khan told bdnews24.com, "We want the concern of the accused soothed by the appeal hearing through a just judicial process." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said, "I've been waiting for many days for the hearing of this case. The nation will heave a sigh of relief once the hearing starts and ends." According to the Appellate Division's business agenda for Monday, the Bangabandhu murder case appeal was included under serial one in court number three at 9:30am. The total number of judges in the Appellate Division stands at 11. President Zillur Rahman appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division on July 14 this year, raising the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage. The government then initiated process of ending the murder case trial. The regular appeals filed by the six defendants sentenced to death have been waiting for over a year now due to shortage of Supreme Court judges. As per rules, an Appellate division bench comprising three judges can hear a hearing. But as per Supreme Court's rules of business, the judge who heard a case in High Court cannot hear that case again in the Appellate Division even when appointed as an Appellate Division judge. The hearing of the appeals will start even though the lawyer for the defendants has opposed such move, Mahbubey Alam has said. He said a team of at least 10 law officers will be working at his office assisting the case. Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for the defendants, applied to the court for no hearing on the grounds that "the government had not submitted the concise statement from its side within the stipulated time". "It is not mandatory to submit the concise statement (on the case) to the court in 30 days. This is a directive. "Let the court decide whether it would hold the hearing," Alam told bdnews24.com last Wednesday. According to legal practices, both sides should submit concise statements on the case in 30 days before the hearing date. The attorney general said request was made to the United States for information about lancer A K M Mohiuddin. Brief description is being submitted as no information was received from the US in time. He said the complete file is with the government and will be submitted to the court. Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975. The case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. No-one was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then the president, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam on October 2, 1996 filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused persons. Four jailed accused major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (sacked) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the trial court verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentence of 10 accused but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentence of 15 accused. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentence of 12 accused and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four jailed accused submitted leave to appeal in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Col Majed are absconding. Absconding accused Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. bdnews24
