 Dhaka, 5 (bdnews24.com)Three government agencies have launched a long-term project to reduce massive air pollution and ensure sustainability of the environment in the Dhaka metropolitan area. The Department of Environment, Dhaka City Corporation and Dhaka Transport Coordination Board (DTCB), under communication ministry, are implementing the project aided by the World Bank. The project 'Clean Air & Sustainable Environment (CASE)' was formally launched at a programme at Sonargaon Hotel on Monday. The Tk 487 crore project is expected to end by June 2014. Of the amount, Tk 425.11 crore will come from World Bank and the rest from public funds. Road and Railway Division secretary Mozammel Haque Khan said the three agencies joined in the 'CASE' project to make Dhaka City more habitable by developing more dynamic transportation facilities to clear the roads of chronic gridlock. The capital's transport network would be more integrated and the environment would be much improved on completion of the project, he said Project director, under the DoE, Nasir Uddin said different plans would be undertaken to ensure more environmentally sustainable road use and tackle other sources of emissions such as brickfields in a bid to cut air pollution in the city. He also said the plans include raising awareness about air pollution, improving sidewalks for the pedestrians, providing technological assistance to minimise pollution by brickfields and other emitters. He said the project would extend technical assistance to the forest and environment ministry for monitoring air quality. DCC engineer Sehab Ullah said the project included construction of an 80km one-way road network circling Mohammadpur and old parts of Dhaka, 70km of new footpath at Mohammadpur and Khilgaon and footbridges at 25 points in the capital. Project director, under DTCB, Anisur Rahman said a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system would also be introduced in the capital. A specific lane would be fixed for buses to ply rapidly which would reduce traffic jams as well as air pollution, he said. The speakers at the launching ceremony stressed the coordinated efforts of DCC, DTCB and metropolitan police in making the project successful. The event chaired by DoE chief Shahjahan Khan was addressed by World Bank adviser Mohamamad A Tore and deputy secretary at the environment ministry Rabindranath Ray. bd
