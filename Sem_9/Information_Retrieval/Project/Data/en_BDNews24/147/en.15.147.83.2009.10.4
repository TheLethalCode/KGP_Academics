 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)Controversial police officer Kohinoor Miah has been suspended on charges of professional misconduct, according to a home ministry statement. Kohinoor, former deputy commissioner (west) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police and an influential police officer in the 2001-06 BNP-Jamaat coalition government, currently stands accused in a case of police brutality against a pregnant woman. Additional deputy inspector general of police Mazharul Haque faced the same disciplinary action on similar charges of misconduct, said a home ministry circular issued on Saturday. Kohinoor is superintendent of police (OSD ), Rajshahi range, while Mazharul is vice-principal (additional DIG), Police Academy, Sarda . Another circular said decisions have been made to file departmental cases against them. Deputy secretary at the home ministry Alamgir Mohammad Mansur ul Alam told bdnews24.com, "The step was taken under the Government Service Rule (discipline and appeal) 3/B of 1985. "They are alleged to have tortured and misbehaved with women during the BNP-government period." Both were attached with the office of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner. Kohinoor petitioned the High Court on Sunday for anticipatory bail in a case of police brutality against a pregnant woman, Shahina Sultana Shanta, in 2006. The case details said Shanta was badly beaten by police in front of Rapa Plaza at Dhanmondi on Mar 12, 2006, on the orders of Kohinoor. Police also kicked her in the abdomen which subsequently caused her to suffer a miscarriage, the case alleges. Kohinoor Miah hit headlines after the police had assaulted agitating female students at the Kuwait Moitri Hall of Dhaka University on July 24, 2002. Police entered the female dormitory by breaking the main gate. It is said that Kohinoor had been behind the plan. Then vice chancellor Anwarullah Chowdhury resigned following a massive movement, but the alliance government did not take any measure against Kohinoor although the students accused him of the ordering atrocities. His name again surfaces over the killing of two people--Sujon and Taher--residents of Achargaon at Nandail-- who were shot by the police during Nandail municipality elections on May 9, 2004. He was the superintendent of police at Mymensingh then. He was accused of torturing general secretary of Awami Jubo Ainjibi League Noor-e-Alam on Oct 11, 2006. Former state minister for home Lutfazzaman Babar and 112 others were accused in that case. The complaints said the police had hit him in the head on the orders of Kohinoor and Babar. He is also alleged to have assaulted Awami League leaders Motia Chowdhury, Tofail Ahmed, Mohammad Nasim and Saber Hossain Chowdhury during street agitation. bdnews24.com/si
