 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)City developer RAJUK and Dhaka City Corporation have been told to renovate buildings vulnerable to earthquakes, the disaster management minister said on Sunday. Minister Abdur Razzaque spoke to reporters after a meeting with earthquake experts at Secretariat on Sunday. The meeting chaired by Razzaque was also attended by housing and public works minister Abdul Mannan Khan, disaster management secretary Mokleshur Rahman, housing and public works secretary Mahbubur Rahman, environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumdar and earthquake experts from different institutions. Some 70,000 buildings in Dhaka metropolitan area are vulnerable to a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, experts have predicted Some 5,000 government buildings were constructed without taking earthquake risks into account, they observed. Public works minister Abdul Mannan Khan said a new "earthquake resistant" building code had been made mandatory in the wake of recent quakes. "Those who defy the code will be brought to book," he said. Referring to the recent massive quakes and Tsunami that ravaged Indonesia, leaving a death toll of over 1,000 in their wake, Abdur Razzaque said, "Experts predict that Bangladesh is vulnerable to similar earthquakes." The government has taken all out preparation to protect the country from possible loss of life and property, he said. Razzaque said, "A previous Standing Order on Disasters did not properly cover earthquake issue and we discussed a new draft proposal." The draft would be incorporated into the SOD after being endorsed by the cabinet, he said Razzaque also said the meeting discussed bringing all gas lines under a centrally regulated system to prevent the lines from catching fire in the event of major earthquakes. b
