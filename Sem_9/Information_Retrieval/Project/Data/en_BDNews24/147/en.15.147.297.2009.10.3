 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League's new Central Working Committee, announced on July 30, convened for the first time on Saturday without Abdur Razzak, Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Abdul Jalil, the bigwigs who dominated the political landscape for decades. The stalwarts were removed from the policymaking Presidium and sidelined to the advisory committee, a body without much say in the organisational matters. Party chief prime minister Sheikh Hasina was presiding over the meeting that started shortly after 10:30am at her political office in Dhanmondi. Newly elected general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam was sitting next to her. Presidium member Matia Chowdhury last week said the party will decide at this meeting what is to be done about the controversies former general secretary Abdul Jalil stirred through his statements in London recently. But Syed Ashraf has hinted that the party may not not take any step against Jalil in the meeting. Before the meeting, a group of people distributed two leaflets saying Jalil has been involved with conspiracy against the party after meeting with Tarique Rahman, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who is also in London. The activists in the leaflets asked for measures against Jalil and also criticised Amu, Razzak, Tofail and Suranjit. One of the leaflets read: "Give exemplary punishment to Jalil and others for their betrayal." Hasina was re-elected for a sixth term and Syed Ashraf general secretary for the first time in the July 24 national council. Joint secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif, organising secretaries Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Ahmed Hossain, Mesbahuddin Siraj, AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Abu Sayeed Al Mahmud, who are newcomers in the committee, made their debut in the meeting. The meeting is scheduled to discuss, among others, deaths of leaders, social and economic issues, organisational issues. Disgruntled Jalil had said in interviews with bdnews24.com and London-based ethnic Bangla TV that he had made a mistake by not going against Hasina on his return to the country to protect his post during the 2007-08 caretaker government regime. He said Hasina had done injustice by putting "sycophants" members of the party in the Presidium and excluding veterans. Jalil had said that his party reached a 'compromise deal' with the military-installed caretaker government before the Dec 29 general elections. He was assaulted by Jubo League activists in Birmingham, UK after the interview. Later, in another interview with bdnews24.com last Tuesday, he made a dramatic flip-flop on his ranting and raving against Hasina, her picks in the cabinet and party, and the general elections, and said 'sorry' for shooting his mouth off. Another presidium member, Obaidul Quader, also called for disciplinary action against Jalil. But Suranjit Sengupta, now a member of the ceremonial 20-strong advisory council, said there was little to do if someone apologises. Hasina said last week in New York Jalil should resign from parliament before he questions the credibility of the Dec 29 elections. "Has he been elected that way? He should resign first before making such allegation," Hasina snapped. On whether the party would take any action against Jalil, Hasina said: "I don't have any headache about it." She said Jalil has been saying many things, and "let him speak." The ruling party dissolved the old committee at the national council and announced new Presidium members and secretaries six days later. On Aug 10, the party announced the remaining 26 members of the Central Working Committee, the highest executive forum that includes a 15-member policymaking Presidium and 32 secretaries, within 18 days of its dissolving the old one. Many frontline leaders were axed from the committee altogether and Hasina said on July 31 they were dropped in line with the views of the councillors. "It was made for the sake of the party," she said, a day after the AL sprang surprises when it announced the full-fledged committee. Behemoths Amu, Razzak, Tofail, Suranjit and Jalil were reduced to mere advisers apparently for pursuing 'reforms' to curb Hasina's power. Sahara Khatun, Abdul Latif Siddique, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Satish Chandra Roy, Obaidul Qader and Yousuf Mohammad Humayun were included in the new-look presidium. Amu and Tofail had been the key players in the party since the period of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hasina had made Jalil, currently a parliament member who heads the parliamentary standing committee on commerce ministry, commerce minister on the technocrat quota during the 1996-2001 term. Jalil, who had been general secretary since its 19th council on Dec 26, 2002, resigned the position on July 21. Amu was a former food minister in the previous AL government and is now an MP. Razzak, who was elected general secretary in the 15th council of the party in Feb 1981 and held the post until 1983, served as water resources minister in the previous Hasina cabinet. Currently he heads the standing committee on the same ministry. Tofail, former industries minister, was also excluded from the presidium. He is also a member of the parliament and chief of the parliamentary watchdog on industry ministry. Suranjit Sengupta, who grew in stature since joining the party in the 1990s, was the prime minister's advisor on parliamentary affairs from 1996-2001. He currently heads the standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry. Hasina in a recent interview with the Voice of America in the US said, "I have not left anyone, put them into the standing committees, which will ensure accountability of the government." Former organising secretaries Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Abdul Mannan and Sultan Mohammed Monsur Ahmed, former joint secretary Mukul Bose, executive member Abu Sayeed and AKM Jahangir were also left out. None of the seven organising secretaries made the cut when the partial committee was declared on July 30, but Abdur Rahman, Akhteruzzaman and Bir Bahadur were later included. bdnews
