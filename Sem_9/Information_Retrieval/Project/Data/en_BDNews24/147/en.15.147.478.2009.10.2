<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Maria Sharapova ground out a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win over Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska to reach the Pan Pacific Open final on Friday. The Russian will play Serbia's Jelena Jankovic in the final after the seventh seed overpowered China's Li Na 6-4, 6-3 in the day's first semi-final at the $2 million Tokyo event.

Jankovic, who finished 2008 at the top of the world rankings, had too much firepower for Li but was given a good workout by the 15th seed in preparation for Saturday's final. "My tennis is coming back," said the world number eight, who has won just one of five meetings with Sharapova. "It's been a very tough year but I believe in myself.
