 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Three suspected criminals were killed in gunfights with RAB and police in Dhaka, Kushtia and Pabna early on Wednesday. 28-year old Hedayetullah Julhas aka Julu was killed in the capital's Hajaribagh area, 35-year old Sunnat Ali died in Kushtia sadar upazila and 30-year old Mokhter Hossain was killed in Pabna sadar upazila. RAB-2 operation officer Talebur Rahman told bdnews24.com that being tipped off that a group of criminals had gathered beside Ali CNG Filling Station near Hajaribagh dam, a team of the elite force went to the scene. Sensing their arrival, the criminals fired shots forcing the elite force to fire back, Rahman said. At one stage, the criminals fled the scene leaving Julu with bullet wounds, he said. Julu was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the duty doctors declared him dead. RAB recovered one pistol from the scene. Julu, a close associate of top criminal Emon, faced seven cases, the RAB official said. Kushtia assistant police super sadar circle CA Ali said on a tip-off that a group of extremists was holding a secret meeting near Steel Bridge of Ujan village, a police team raided the spot at around 6am. Sensing their arrival the criminals fired shots forcing police to fire back. During the 20-minute shootout Sunnat Ali received bullet wounds and died afterwards. His associates fled the spot. Police recovered one light gun and five rounds bullet from the scene, Ali said. There were six cases against Sunnat Ali, the second in command of JSD Gano Bahini, the police super said. Meanwhile, RAB-12 Pabna camp deputy commander flight lieutenant Ahmed Faisal said they had gone to Kachhipara of Chartara union at around 1:15am on a tip-off that the some operatives of extremist Sarbahara Party were holding a secret meeting there. As the criminals sensed the presence of law enforcers they opened fire which the elite force retaliated, he said. During the 30-minuite shootout Mokhter died on the spot, the official said. RAB recovered one local-made pistol, three rounds of ammunition and one big dagger from the scene. Mokhter, a regional leader of Sarbahara Party, faced at least eight cases including three murder cases, Faisal said. The human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. A total of 97 people died in "shootouts" and in custody of law-enforcing agencies until Sept 30 from Jan 1 this year, said independent human-rights watchdog Odhikar last week. Home minister Sahara Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Huq Tuku, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. They said RAB and police only fire in self-defence when they come under attack. State minister for home has trashed the human-rights organisations' allegations. "There is no such thing as 'crossfire'. What actually happens is while conducting a raid to apprehend terrorists, the law-enforcers at times have to open fire in self-defence, when one or two odd deaths occur unavoidably." The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killings without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. A controversy sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh, and Odhikar, over the past years have repeatedly expressed concern over the rising number of extra-judicial killings in the country. In May, HRW in a report suggested 'elite' security forces the likes of Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) should be disbanded. bdne
