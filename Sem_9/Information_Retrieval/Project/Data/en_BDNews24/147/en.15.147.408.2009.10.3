 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The Union Parishad chairmen on Saturday threatened the government with movement if parliament passes a proposed law that provides for appointing bureaucrats as administrators to the lowest tier of the local government in absence of elected councils. Mahbubur Rahman Tulu, chairman of Gaibandha Union Parishad and president of the Bangladesh Union Parishad forum, also threatened to to take the government to court at a national workshop at Sonargaon Hotel in the capital. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Sept 13 tabled the Local Government (Union Parishad) Bill-2009, the draft of which was referred to the standing committee for further scrutiny. Section 18 of the draft bill authorised the government to appoint administrators, a provision considered as an instrument for the government to directly control the Parishad. The parliamentary standing committee on local government ministry has finalised recommendations, dropping the provision of appointing bureaucrats as administrators. Tulu said, "We'll wage agitation if any law is passed that harms the interest of the Parishad and seek justice, if needed." He hoped that the government would not do so. Government officials have been given more authority by curbing that of the chairmen, which means the opinions of the elected representatives will not be reflected in the functioning of the councils, he added. The workshop began at 9:30am, where six representatives from six divisions spoke on the current state and problems of the councils. Tulu,who presided the second session, said, "Opinion of the elected representatives should be given priority to make the Union Parishad more effective and significant. "Bureaucrats are trying to replace public representatives. It must be stopped," He also asked the government to reach the government allocation straight to the Union Parishad. Former advisor to the caretaker government M Hafizuddin Ahmed, former chief justice Golam Rabbani, Awami League MP Tarana Halim also spoke among others. MPs Nani Gopal Mondol, Nazrul Islam Manju,, Mahfuza Mondol, Farida Akhter Hira, president of Bangladesh Pourasabha Association and Tongi municipal mayor Nazmul Ullah Khan, among others, attended the workshop. Hafizuddin said the government not to pass the law in the current session without further discussion and review. The government should allow more time to discuss and review the opinions and demands from all sides, he opined. All parties say local government needs to be strengthened to make democracy stronger in their election manifestos, but they later forget it, he observed. "Conflicts will continue will local government as long as MPs have penchant for and meddling with the issue." Former chief justice Golam Rabbani asked the government to follow two sections regarding local government system laid down in the constitution. "Local government system and not local governance has to be introduced in line with section 59 in the constitution, and local activities, police stations, tax collection and budget-making to be vested under local government in line with section 60 in the constitution." Rural society has been ruined in absence of effective local government, he said and added it is not difficult to implement it. There is no alternative to this to make a true 'Bengal of Gold', he observed. Monowar Hossain, a member of the parliamentary standing committee, said Union Parisad bill would be tabled in the current session on Sunday. Rahmat Ali, the chairman of the standing, told bdnews24.com last Wednesday: "We have had experiences that the government appointed administrators to the Union Parishad and the bureaucrats held the posts for up to 8 years. "No election took place," said Ali, a senior Awami League MP. He said the proposed bill had a provision of electing a three-member panel of chairmen from the elected members of the council. "The provision of the panel of chairmen renders the appointment of administrators irrelevant." bdnews
