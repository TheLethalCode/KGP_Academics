 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)--Parliament on Monday unanimously passed The Local Government (City Corporation) Bill 2009 barring MPs to become advisers to city corporations like townships. The amended bill also dropped the provision for creating posts of two deputy mayors. As a result, the MPs can remain advisers only to Upazila Parishad. The two amendments were proposed by Awami League MP A K M Mozammel Haque and Jatiya Party MP Salma Islam. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam tabled the bill at the beginning of the day's lawmaking activities which was presided over by speaker Abdul Hamid. The city corporations of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet will be run according to the law as soon as it comes into force. On Sep 14, The Local Government (Township) Bill 2009 was passed in parliament preventing the MPs to be advisers. The new law allows one to run city corporation elections by repaying the instalment of the defaulted loan on the day of submission of candidature. The law says the affidavit of the land and other properties of mayor, councillors and their family members will have to be submitted to an official selected by the state during oath taking or declaration of wealth statement. If any false information is included in the affidavit, that will be counted as a dishonest act and action can will taken against the offender. bdnews24.com/
