 ATHENS Oct 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece's opposition Socialists were on course to win Sunday's election with enough seats to form a government and oust conservatives who angered voters for failing to tackle graft and the economy, exit polls showed. If the vote confirms exit polls, the socialist PASOK will win an absolute majority in parliament at a time when the Mediterranean country, seen as the euro zone's weakest link, needs a strong government to deal with an economy on the verge of recession. An exit poll by Kapa Research for Reuters and other media showed PASOK gaining 42.5 percent of the vote and 155 out of 300 seats in parliament, and conservatives New Democracy trailing with 36.4 percent and 99 seats. A second exit poll for Greek television channels produced a similar result, showing PASOK winning with 41 to 44 percent of the votes, gaining 151 to 159 seats. "We have convinced Greek voters with the strength of our programme," senior PASOK party member Theodoros Pangalos told Greek TV. PASOK leader George Papandreou promised a 3 billion euro ($4.36 billion) stimulus package on a platform of taxing the rich and helping the poor, while the outgoing Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis called for two years of austerity. Markets were likely to be pleased with the result. "Not because they have a preference between the two parties but because a new government with a parliamentary majority will have a fresh mandate to pursue its programme over a four-year term," said Alexander Moraitakis, president of the Greek brokers association SMEHA. New Democracy officials said the result was far from official. If the small Ecologists party manages to make it into parliament with three percent as required -- exit polls showed although they were close they would not make it -- the seat tally of all parties would be reduced. "We must wait for the real results to see if PASOK can have an absolute majority," said New Democracy general secretary Lefteris Zagoritis. Official vote counting started after polls closed at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT). It was the third face-off for Papandreou, 57, a U.S-born soft-spoken politician, and Karamanlis, 53, a powerful speaker who appeals to the average Greek, both the heirs to two of Greece's most powerful political dynasties. Opinion polls had showed most Greeks appeared ready to end five years of conservative rule that started amid high hopes of ending endemic corruption but soon sunk amid its own scandals. Weakened by the scandals and a fragile parliamentary majority, Karamanlis called the snap poll, gambling he had a better chance of winning now than later in his four-year term. Papandreou will face a budget deficit topping 6 percent of GDP, rising unemployment and deep unhappiness with the education system, social security and immigration. "The main challenge for the new government is to submit a credible budget and a realistic timetable for reducing fiscal imbalances," said Nikos Magginas, an economist at National Bank. After years of robust growth, Greece's output, about 2.5 percent of the euro zone's total economy, is set to slow to zero growth or even enter negative territory this year, with key drivers and job providers like tourism particularly hard-hit. Economists question the wisdom of Papandreou's spending plan, saying it may lead to more borrowing in a country which already has the euro zone's second biggest debt after Italy as a percentage of
