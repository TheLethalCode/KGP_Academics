<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Militant activities in the country have collapsed because of successive arrests of suspected Indian militants, Detective Branch of Police have claimed. With Wednesday's arrest of 28-year-old Emdadullah alias Mahbub, a suspected member of the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, detectives claimed that the group's network has been broken down. The detectives arrested Mahbub late on Wednesday from Gabtoli area in the capital. Deputy commissioner of metropolitan DB (south) Monirul Islam said militant network in Bangladesh has collapsed after the arrest of Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah and Maulana Mohammad Monsur Ali in last July. Militants stopped contacting each other due to fearing arrests after their capture, he claimed. Islam said a Detective Branch team, led by assistant commissioner of detective police Sanowar Hossain, arrested Mahbub from Gabtoli area. He said Mahbub is a suspected member of Harkatul Jihadia Islamia Azadia, a Pakistan-based militant group. He is also the Bangladesh chief of Asif Reza Commando force and member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the official said. Lashkar-e-Taiba was accused of 'Mumbai attack' in November last year. Indian intelligence agencies found Ajmal Amir Kasab's involvement with Laskar-e-Taiba. Kasab is the only attacker who was captured alive during November attack. The militant group is also accused of attacking rail track in Mumbai in 2006. It is also blamed for bomb attack at Dewali festival in New Delhi in 2005. At least 500 people died in three attacks. Mahbub is a resident of Padmapukur village under Bagda in north Chabbish Pargana in India. He is the son of Ansar ali, alias Abu Ansar. Mahbub had been into hiding at different places in Bangladesh, India and Pakitan to avoid arrest. He also took a fake name at that time. He also had contact with Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah, a suspected Indian militant who was arrested in July. Maulana Mohammad Monsur Ali, another suspected militant arrested in last July, is the uncle of Obaidullah. Mansur Ali introduced Mahbub with Obaidullah. The DB official said that Mahbub got monthly allowance from Obaidullah to support his activities. Mahbub received a month-long arms training at a secret base in Beluchistan. He was also trained to use advanced weapons and explosives. One militant leader Abdullah gave him the chance to be trained. Later he joined various operations as a member of Asif Reza Commando force. Mahbub used to arrange tresspassing for militants through border points and carried bomb-making elements. Indian police arrested him in 2006. Capitalising the weakness of Indian police, he fled India and joined the Dhaka Tobacco Factory at Tongi. He lived at Ashulia with his wife. Police seized a Bangladeshi passport from him. He had another passport issued with the name of Ripon. Militant leader Abdullah took it away from him. Mahbub told reporters he is not involved in any militancy activity. He got monthly allowance through Western Union Money Transfer from India from his uncle Mansur Ali. However, it was halted for several months. Earlier in July, police arrested three Indian citizens, including Muhaddis Maulana Obaidullah and Mansur Ali, as suspected militants. Detective police said they were operating for LET and ARCF in Bangladesh. They were also connected with Harkatul Zihad Al Islami. Police arrested Abdul Rauf Daud Merchant, a suspected associate of mafia don Daud Ibrahim, with three other Indian militants in May. Rauf Daud is also the suspected killer of Gulshan Kumar, a famous Indian musician. The arrested men used remain in touch with each other. They have helped each other many times. bdnews
