 THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from a boat accident in a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala has climbed to 41 and could rise, officials said on Thursday. A double-decker tourist boat carrying 76 people capsized on Wednesday in a lake in the hilly district of Idukki. "The death toll is likely to rise, as some more people are yet to be traced. The search for them is still continuing," Idukki District Collector Ashok Kumar Singh said. Some reports said the vessel tilted when some tourists went to one side to look at wild buffaloes or elephants on the banks of the lake. A local lawmaker said five of the passengers were foreign tourists, four of whom were in hospital. The lake is in Thekkady wildlife sanctuary, a popular tourist attraction for tiger and elephant spotting.
