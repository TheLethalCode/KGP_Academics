 ASADABAD, Afghanistan, Oct 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign and Afghan forces launched an assault on Monday against a group of Taliban in an area of eastern Afghanistan where the militants killed eight American soldiers at the weekend, an official said. Saturday's attacks in remote Nuristan province near the Pakistani border were the deadliest on US forces in more than a year.
