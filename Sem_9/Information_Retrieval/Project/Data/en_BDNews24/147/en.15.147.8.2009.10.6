<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has set Oct 18 for the next hearing on a petition to re-open investigations into a case of attempted murder of the late writer Humayun Azad. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Ehsanul Haque set the date Tuesday after Azad's brother Manjur Kabir filed the petition. The petitioner said the investigation officer had not properly identified the accused in the case. "The real culprits have not been uncovered," it said. Humayun Azad, while alive, had said that after the publication of his book titled 'Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad' he had received many threats. The late professor of Dhaka University's Bangla department came under attack in front of Bangla Academy while he was on his way back from 'Ekushey Boi Mela' at Bangla Academy on Feb 27, 2004. After he recovered, Azad was sent to Germany where he died on the night of Aug 11, 2004, the day he reached Germany, the petitioner added. Kabir had filed two cases against unknown people with Ramna Police Station the day after he was attacked by criminals. On Nov 14, 2007, Criminal Investigation Department's inspector Kazi Abdul Malek pressed charges accusing Jamatul Mujahedin Bangladesh kingpin Shaikh Abdur Rahman, top leaders Ataur Rahman Sunny, Noor Mohammad Sabu aka Shamim, Minhaj aka Shafiq aka Shaon aka Hamim and Anwar Alam aka Khoka aka Bhagne Shahid. The IO later appealed for dropping Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Sunny off the chargesheet as they were already executed on a court verdict in another case. Of the remaining three, police only arrested Minhaj. The case is currently in the process of cross-examining the witnesses. bdnews24
