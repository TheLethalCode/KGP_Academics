 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The food minister has blamed the sudden price spiral of rice on some rogue traders, saying they had hiked the price taking the scope of Eid vacation. Abdur Razzaque, however, asked people not to panic and added the government holds adequate stock of rice that should enable it to launch Open-Market Sales (OMS) in the event of any shortfall in supply. "People should not get worried as the government is closely monitoring the market," the minister said on Saturday at a seminar co-organised by Power and Participatory Research Centre (PPRC) and BRAC Development Institute (BDI) at the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) auditorium. He said the price increased suddenly after the Eid festival, but the situation is under control of the government. Razzaque said the government could not raise the price of rice after trying for long, which was good for the farmers. About relieving the sufferings of people in the draught-hit and coastal areas, Razzaque said the government already took special programmes and projects for them and the donors were also interested to support those schemes. Asked if the initiative would be sufficient, he said, "These programmes can't be sufficient since 40 percent people of the country live below the poverty line." "But the government is trying hard, like it will distribute 26 lakh metric tonnes of food in the current fiscal yearwhich is the largest social safety programme in the world. Last year, it was 21 lakh metric tonnes," the minister said. He said the government would not like to continue the programmes as it would encourage people to become idle and dependent. "More economic activities would be introduced to create employment for the poor people to promote self-dependence," Razzaque added. Former advisor of the caretaker government Hossain Zillur Rahman in his keynote paper said the government invested 240 percent higher than the target for the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) programme on a temporary basis in the 'Monga'-affected areas. Monga is a famine-like situation when there is no job. "But it invested only 45 percent in the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme, which is a discrimination," he added. Hossain portrayed the overall scenario of the four 'Monga' affected areasKurigram, Gaibandha, Rangpur and Nilphamariand said some 334,265 families in the four districts faced unemployment, while 188,181 families suffered from scarcity of food. Moreover, some 357,075 families were living in a risky state and 8,093 families were affected by river erosion. Hossain said the government must take appropriate rehabilitation programmes for those distressed families. The seminar was presided over by Syed M Hashemi, director of BDI, while professor David Helme from Manchester University participated in the discussion. bdnews24.co
