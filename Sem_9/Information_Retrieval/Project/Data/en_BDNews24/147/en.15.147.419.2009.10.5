 JERUSALEM, Oct 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police barred access to Islam's third holiest site on Sunday and fired tear gas towards Palestinian protesters hurling rocks and bottles near the Jerusalem compound, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. Nine people were treated for minor injuries including tear gas inhalation in the violence that erupted in Jerusalem's Old City, Palestinian medical officials said.

Qader was released hours later following a court hearing. Israeli police said the court ordered him to stay away from Jerusalem's Old City for 15 days. "The situation is very tense in the Old City," Husseini said.
