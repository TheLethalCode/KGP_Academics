<TITLE> Another giraffe death adds to mounting toll at Dhaka Zoo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 05 (bdnews24.com)--Another of the remaining three giraffes at Dhaka Zoo died on Sunday night, just three days after the last giraffe death, adding to a mounting toll in recent months at the zoo. The latest giraffe to die was only three and half years old, only a quarter-way into its natural lifespan of 12-15 years. Before this death, two giraffes had died on Sep 7 and 30. Now, only two giraffes remain at the zoo. Mosaddek Hossain, the newly assigned curator of the zoo, told bdnews24.com "The giraffe was sick for the last few days. It died around 11.30pm on Sunday." "Giraffes cannot properly adapt to the weather of Bangladesh," he added. He also said the zoo lacked facilities that are required to provide proper care and treatment to the animals. Hossain said specimens were being sent to Thailand for tests to find the exact reasons for the series of deaths that have been taking place in the zoo. On Sep 30, the acting curator Vivekananda Choudhury said the zoo's giraffes were brought from South Africa in June 2008. With this death, the total death toll of animals reached 22 in the last one year at Dhaka Zoo. The deaths include Garjan, a tiger, on Sep 12, and Ringo, a lion, on Sep 10. The last curator and his deputy were suspended after the death of the female giraffe on Sep 7. bd
