 Chittagong, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) A Chittagong court on Monday extended for a fifth time further probe into sensational 10-truck arms hauls case by another three months, a public prosecutor said. Metropolitan sessions judge for Chittagong Bhabani Prasad Singh made the extension through to Jan 4. Criminal Investigation Department's senior assistant police superintendent Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, also investigation officer (IO) in the case, appealed for time extension on Sept 27. Metropolitan public prosecutor Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com the time for further probe was extended by three more months as the investigation could not be wrapped up. "(In reality) We have got only two months since the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court goes into one-month vacation in December." The 75-day extension for further probe ended on Monday. The time was earlier extended on July 22. Then metropolitan PP Ahsanul Haque Hena on Nov 19, 2007 appealed for further probe in the case considering four issues. CID assistant police superintendent Ismail Hossain was appointed new IO following a court order. He failed to make any headway even after taking time in two phases. The prosecution on Jan 18, 2008 appealed for changing the IO. Incumbent IO Moniruzzaman quizzed Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited officials related to offloading arms in the jetty, coastguard employees, police and National Security Intelligence officials. Four people were arrested and seven gave confessional statement in the court. The arrestees include former NSI directors-general retired brigadier general Abdur Rahim and retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury. Police seized 10 truckloads of arms from a trawler on April 1, 2004 in CUFL jetty on the bank of river Karnaphuli. Karnaphuli police chief Ahadur Rahman filed two cases under arms and smuggling acts the next day. CID pressed charges against 43 in arms case and 44 in smuggling case after investigation. bdne
