 ISLAMABAD, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief of Pakistani Taliban militants who US and Pakistani officials said might be dead has surfaced to meet journalists in his stronghold of South Waziristan. Hakimullah Mehsud, who became Pakistani Taliban chief after his predecessor Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. missile strike in August, looked healthy in pictures broadcast by Pakistan's Dawn Television on Monday. Sailab Mehsud, one of the journalists who met the militant chief on Sunday, said Hakimullah had vowed revenge for Baitullah's killing.
