 LONDON, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England midfielder David Beckham is close to clinching a return to AC Milan for a second loan spell, he was quoted as saying in an interview on Sunday. "There are other options available but none that will stop me going to Milan," the LA Galaxy player told The Mail on Sunday. "It is close to being finalised." England manager Fabio Capello has already said Beckham must return to a top European side to have any hope making his squad for next year's World Cup finals in South Africa. Originally overlooked by the Italian coach, the 34-year-old former England captain won back his international place during a successful loan period at Milan in the second half of last term. Beckham, who aims to move to the San Siro in January, added: "When I left (Milan), they said they wanted me to come straight back. I had such a marvellous time there. They're a great club."
