 Dhaka, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com)Eighteen-year-old son of Bangladesh's prisons chief, Brig Gen M Ashraful Islam Khan, stabbed and injured his father, mother and two siblings on Saturday in an incident that prompted an official inquiry and a visit from the home minister and her deputy. A prisons official, superintendent Touhidul Islam, said the incident occurred at around 4:30pm at the inspector general's official residence adjacent to the Central Jail in the capital. The official described the teenager, Safiul Islam Khan, as a deranged person. "As he woke up from sleep in the afternoon, he started behaving like a deranged person, went to kitchen and attacked older sister Afrina Ashraf (25), younger sister Afifa (12), mother Sufia Akhter and father with a kitchen knife," the superintendent told bdnews24.com. Others in the house rushed to their rescue and managed to stop him. The injured received treatment at the prisons hospital initially, but three of them needed better attention at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Afrina, a Dhaka Medical College student, Afifa, a seventh grader, and their father were taken to DMCH. Doctors at DMCH said all of them were now out of danger. But minister Sahara Khatun and state minister Shamsul Huq Tuku, while visiting the family, ordered that they all be sent to the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka. They also instructed that a three-strong investigation team file its report in three days. Ashraful and Afrina were hit in the chest and back, and Suifia and Afifa had injuries in hands. bdnews24
