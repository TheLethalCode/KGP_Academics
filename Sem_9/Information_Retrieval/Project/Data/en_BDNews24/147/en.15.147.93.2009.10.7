 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary probe has found that the former shipping adviser to the caretaker government, M A Matin, violated a law in increasing the service age of 'pilots' of Chittagong port and misused his office. The probe report, made by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping, recommended the ministry refer the Anticorruption Commission to investigate the 'power abuse' by Matin and four other public servants involved in the process. "General Matin abused his authority as shipping adviser and violated constitution and the public servants' retirement act 1974 by increasing the age limit of pilots at Chittagong port," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, chairman of the standing committee, told bdnews24.com after the committee meeting on Wednesday. Former shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain, chairman of the Chittagong Port Commodore R U Ahmed, former joint secretary Abdul Matin and Sharif Md Masud are the other officials found guilty by the inquiry committee. "We have also asked the ministry to file departmental actions against the officials," said ruling Awami League MP Shah Alam, head of the four-member probe body. He submitted the findings at the committee meeting. This is the second time Matin, a retired major general who headed the corruption-busting body formed by military-installed caretaker government after the state of emergency was clamped on Jan 11, 2007, has been charged. Earlier, the parliamentary probe body accused Matin of violating government rule in awarding container handling work at Chittagong port to a "novice" firm. The ACC on Sept 30 quizzed him over the charges. Matin claimed himself innocent at the hearing and said his move saved public funds. "Only parliament can change the service age of all public servants including the pilots," Chowdhury, the committee chief, said at his office. Matin in 2007 increased the service age of the pilots to 60 from the existing 57. "We have got the report and we will discuss the same at our next meeting to make final recommendations," said Chowdhury. "The probe body has recommended cancellation of the age limit increase and refer the corruption case to the Anti-corruption Commission," said Shah Alam. More to follow
