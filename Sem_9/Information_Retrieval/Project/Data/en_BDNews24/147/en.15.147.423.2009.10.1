<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Tuku on Thursday challenged the 'vaqalatnama' (power of attorney) submitted by the ex-army chief Moeen U Ahmed for contesting the Tk 100 crore defamation suit. Tuku's counsels submitted a petition in Dhaka Third Joint District Judge's Court calling Moeen's 'vaqalatnama' 'ineffective and unacceptable'. The power secretary was also an accused in the case. As Moeen's lawyers petitioned for time to submit written objection to the opponent's comments, judge SM Saiful Islam set Oct 20 for the submission. Challenging the former army chief's comment made on Mar 27, 2007 that a whopping Tk 20,000 crore was smuggled out of the country from the power sector alone during the 2001-06 BNP-led alliance rule, Tuku filed a Tk 100 crore defamation suit on July 12. He mentioned in the case statement that the present state minister power minister had said in parliament on Feb 5 that the BNP-led alliance government's total power sector allocation was Tk 13, 500 crore, which automatically trashes the ex-army chief's allegation. Tuku's lawyers Moudud Ahmed and Mahbubuddin Khokan had filed the case on his behalf claiming Tk 100 crore in damages for defamation and requesting authorities to impound the Baridhara house of Moeen. The lawyers on Thursday alleged that Moeen's signature on the authorisation document had also been manipulated as the former army chief was away in the US. The court summons also was not received by Moeen himself, they said. The court received an appeal on Sep 8 from Moeen to dismiss the prayer for the defamation case against him. Moeen's lawyer Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan filed the appeal in the afternoon. The appeal said that Ahmed expressed his feeling as a citizen of Bangladesh at the reception ceremony of freedom fighters on March 27, 2007. That day he regretted the failure to recognise the architect of the nation and in doing so drew the rage of the anti-liberation forces. Tuku has filed the case as a part of expressing that rage, it maintained. Gen Moeen retired on June 15 and, according to newspaper reports, left for the US last week with wife Nazneen Moeen. He was appointed as army chief in 2005 and promoted to the rank of general on May 24, 2007, under the past caretaker government. The caretaker government extended his tenure by one year. It is widely speculated that the armed forces led by Moeen U Ahmed played a major role during the clampdown of emergency on January 11, 2007, and the subsequent two-year caretaker government regime. Tuku, wife Rumana Mahmud and their two children were sent to jail on graft charges during that period. Convicted in a corruption case and facing a 10-year sentence, Tuku has since secured bail from the High Court, but could not run in the general election last year because of his conviction. Instead, Rumana won the Sirajganj-2 seat in the December polls and is now a BNP MP. b
