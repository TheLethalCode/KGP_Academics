<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday ordered the government and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University to explain in four weeks why the sacking of seven professors was not illegal. The bench of justices Mohammed Tarique Ul Hakim and Mohammed Mainul Islam also ordered status quo on the writ petitions that challenged their job termination. Tanjib-ul-Alam, lawyer for the BSMMU, told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the High Court had given stay order. The seven sacked professors had not been attending office since Oct 1, he said. Barrister Rafique Ul Haque stood for the petitioners while attorney general Mahbubey Alam represented the state. BSMMU authorities sacked 10 professors and one associate professor on Sept 29 in an apparent purge of political appointees during the last BNP-Jamaat coalition government. The seven professors filed the petitions on Sunday. The petitioners are professors Md Jahangir Kabir, Nasim Ahmed Chowdhury, Sayeba Aktar, Motiur Rahman Mollah, Shahidul Alam Khan, Abul Kashem Chowdhury and associate professor Sharif Hasan. University registrar Abdul Gafur told bdnews24.com on Sept 29 that ten professors and one associate professor had been "relieved" of their jobs because their appointments "flouted rules and were unlawful". All of them got appointed to BSMMU on retirement from their government service during BNP-Jamaat alliance government. bdne
