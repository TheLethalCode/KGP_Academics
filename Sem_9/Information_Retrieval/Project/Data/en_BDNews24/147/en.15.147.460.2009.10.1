<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)The capital market regulator has opened enquiry into the abnormal price hike of the newest market entrant, Marico Bangladesh Ltd, and clamped restrictions on margin loans in a bid to control abnormal price hike and market manipulation. A three-member committee has been formed to look into the staggering price of Marico, well known for its flagship brand Parachute Coconut Oil, and submit a report within 15 working days. Shares of the company with a face value of Tk 10, went up as high as Tk 368 on Sep 16, when it debuted on the country's prime bourse. On Thursday, it closed at Tk 450. "SEC does not find the price justified," Securities and Exchange Commission executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan said at a news briefing on Thursday. The SEC has also decided to add the 48 companies whose trading was suspended onto the OTC (over-the-counter) market. The spokesperson said that from now, margin loans cannot be issued to trade newly listed companies for the first 30 trading days. Margin loans are given by merchant banks and brokerage firms for trading purposes to the stock market traders against the value of shares they hold. "We have also agreed the same for Z category shares and for those who would fail to submit updated financial reports timely," SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan said to reporters. The SEC is also in the process of formulating a new rule regarding margin loans for merchant banks, he added. The prevailing rule, Margin Loan Rule 1992 is only applicable for brokerage firms. The regulator, however, has set a ceiling of merchant banks' margin loan ratio at 1:1.5. In an attempt to start the OTC market trading after its launching early last month, the SEC has decided to include the suspended 48 companies to the alternative market. "We are set to send a directive to the bourse authorities to start the process of enlisting those companies for the OTC market," said the SEC official. The regulator has also made it mandatory for companies to credit the IPO refunds directly to the aspirants' bank accounts in a bid to facilitate the retail investors. "The move came to simplify the IPO process; we hope it would start with the upcoming IPO of Grameenphone," said the SEC official.
