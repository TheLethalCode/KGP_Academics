 WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama's top security adviser on Sunday dismissed a report that Iran was closer to making an atomic bomb and said Iranian cooperation in the last few weeks was good for nuclear non-proliferation. The New York Times reported on Saturday that a confidential analysis by staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran has acquired "sufficient information to be able to design and produce" a bomb. "Whether they know how to do it or not is a matter of some conjecture, but what we are watching is what is their intent and we have been worried about that intent," National Security adviser Jim Jones said. "We now have an Iran that is willing to come to the table," Jones said on CBS's "Face the Nation" program. Asked whether Iran was closer to having a bomb, Jones said on CNN: "No, we stand by the reports that we have put out." "What has happened with regard to Iran in the last couple of weeks has been very significant," he told CNN's "State of the Union" program, pointing to Iran's decision to open a new uranium enrichment site near the holy Shi'ite city of Qom for inspection. IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei announced on Sunday in Tehran that the U.N. nuclear watchdog will inspect the site on October 25, and he praised a shift "from conspiracy to cooperation" in Iran's dealing with the West. Iran, which rejects Western charges that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, held talks with six world powers in Geneva on Thursday. Western officials said that in the talks, Iran had agreed "in principle" to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in Russia and France. Jones said the next meeting with Iran on October 19 will discuss the methodology for the transfer of about 1,200 kilos of low-enriched uranium to Russia. Both developments "move the dial in our direction favorably" and were positive steps for Western efforts to contain nuclear weapon capability in the world, Jones said. "Clearly, on non-proliferation, whether it is North Korea or Iran, the world is sending its own message to both countries and fortunately we are seeing some positive reaction to that," Jones told CNN. "For now things are moving in the right direction." US ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said she was "not in a position to characterize (the New York Times) report or our intelligence. "There are various assessments and they don't all align," Rice said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "What happened last week was a constructive beginning but it was only a beginning. The onus is now squarely on Iran to adhere to the commitments it has ma
