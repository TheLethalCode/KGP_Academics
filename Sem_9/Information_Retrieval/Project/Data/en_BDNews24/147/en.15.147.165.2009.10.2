 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)The government has been urged to revise the minimum labour wage as the day labourers are grappling with continuous price hike of basic necessities, fuel and primary services. "In a democratic society and state, the work force involved in the various production sectors would lead a decent life in exchange for providing labour," said Ratan Sarkar, an executive director of Integrated Community and Industrial Development Initiative in Bangladesh (INCIDIN Bangladesh). INCIDIN, a research-based development organisation and partner of World Wide Views on Global Warming (WWViews), organised a news conference at National Press Club auditorium on Friday to highlight the issues of day labourers. Bangladesh being one of the countries that ratified ILO Convention, which provides the ethical base of the workers' rights in global perspective, is committed to ensuring the wage for workers to survive, Sarker said in a written statement. He said the price of food should be determined by the cost of food allocated per person in jail and hospital. The wage inequality between public and private sector should be removed. Sarker stressed the introduction of an acceptable mechanism to determine the wage. "A large number of workers are also compelled to lead a malnourished, unhealthy and unhygienic life with their existing poor wage," he added. It is a pressing duty of the stakeholders to ensure a living wage for the workers so that the prevailing poverty of the workers is reduced and their basic necessities fulfilled. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, in 2005-2006 national consumer price index, or consumer inflation, was 164.21, which rose to 204.99 in April 2009 and inflation rate was 8.10 percent in Feb 2009. Average price of food in the first four months of 2008 was 53 percent higher than the same period of previous year, according to UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. The statistics show to what extent the real income of the workers has reduced in the last two years, while the workers' organisations did not have the opportunity to mount a combined bargaining due to emergency during the caretaker government regime, Sarker added. A K M Mustaque Ali, another INCIDIN executive director, said ensuring living wage will contribute in poverty reduction in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The conference was held ahead of a national consultation on living wage scheduled for Sunday at CIRDAP Auditorium.
