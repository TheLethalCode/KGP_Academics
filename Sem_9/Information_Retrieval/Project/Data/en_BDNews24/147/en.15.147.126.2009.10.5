<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court is moving fast to quickly dispose of a petition from two of the convicts that now suddenly stands in the way of the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing. The five-judge bench set hearing on the latest petition, filed Sep 29, for Tuesday. The two in their petition had asked the top judges to ban the state counsels from the appeals hearing for failing to meet a deadline to submit the so-called "concise statement", a summary of their arguments against the appeal. The court made the decision known after Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for Syed Faruk Rahman, one of the convicts, informed it that the appeal was not included on the cause list. If the judges agree with the petitioner, the defence counsels will have no one to counter their arguments during the long-delayed hearing that began Monday. The petition was filed on behalf of Syed Faruk Rahman, the dismissed lieutenant colonel of Bangladesh army, and retired lieutenant colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). The state counsels are hoping that the judges will throw away the petition, arguing that the Appellate Division Rule that the petitioners were referring to was not mandatory. Mahbubey Alam, the attorney general, asserted that the prosecution had been right in handling the summary of the appeals. "It is not mandatory to submit the concise statement (on the case) to the court in 30 days. This is a directive. "Let the court decide," Alam said, speaking to bdnews24.com last Wednesday. "It is just a rule not a law," an aide to the attorney general told bdnews24.com. The aide cited several previous instances when judges had not taken such objections into account. The special prosecutor of the case, Anisul Haque, told reporters on Sunday the concise statement had been submitted according to rule and said the state would reply on the issue in the court. First day of hearing Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, who argued for one of the convicts retired major Bazlul Huda, briefed the media on the proceedings after the first day of the hearing on Monday. The hearing must focus on the five points, based on which the Appellate Division had granted the appeal petition, Mamun quoted the judges to have said. Mamun told the court that other related arguments should also be presented along with the five. He will continue with his arguments on Tuesday. A freshly formed five-strong bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing at 9:45am. Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench on Sunday with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. Mamun told reporters after the hearing that he had finished 608-691 pages out of 1,530 pages of the paperbook in the Monday's hearing. He said: "Of the ruling given by three High Court judges I have presented most parts of the ruling by Justice Md Ruhul Amin at [Monday's] hearing. "Justice Ruhul Amin said in his ruling that confessional statements by convicts Syed Faruk Rahman, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan were not given voluntarily. "The magistrate did not fill up three columns of the form during the confessional statement though it was mandatory. The lawyer said: "Justice Ruhul Amin in the ruling also said the magistrate during the statement told the convicts that they would not be handed over to police again. "The magistrate did not submit any paper regarding the three statements. According to Justice Amin the three statements could not be considered as statements in the eyes of law, Mamun added. Of the rulings given by three HC judges, two judges of one bench delivered split verdict, he told the reporters. "The ruling of the three judges should be presented before the court. The Appellate Division judges should be informed of the ruling," he quoted the court as saying. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters the long wait of the nation came to an end with the start of the hearing. "The reading of paper book has begun. The rulings of three judges are being presented. The defence will present their arguments after it (the reading out) is over," he said. The attorney general said the killing of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is a grisly chapter in history. "The trial of the murder was stopped by the indemnity law. The killers were awarded with jobs in foreign countries," Alam said. Security tightened Security measures around the court premises have been heightened for the hearing, Alam said. "There might be murder attempts to thwart the trial process. The security will be tightened more if needed," he said. Huge numbers of lawyers and law officers were present during the hearing. The hearings mark the start of the final legs of the longest and most debated trial for the killing of the most famous person in Bangladesh. New Appellate judges The regular appeals filed by the six defendants sentenced to death had been waiting for over a year due to shortage of Supreme Court judges. President Zillur Rahman appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division on July 14 this year, raising the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage. The government then initiated process of ending the murder case trial. As per rules, an Appellate division bench comprising at least three judges can hear an appeal. But as per Supreme Court's rules of business, the judge who heard a case in High Court cannot hear that case again in the Appellate Division even when appointed as an Appellate Division judge. The attorney general said a team of at least 10 law officers will be working at his office assisting the state counsels. The attorney general said request was made to the United States for information about lancer A K M Mohiuddin. Brief description is being submitted as no information was received from the US in time. He said the complete file is with the government and will be submitted to the court. Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975. The case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. Indemnity law No-one was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. bdnews24.com
