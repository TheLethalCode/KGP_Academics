 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet on Monday approved a temporary employment programme in 'national service' for young people having passed higher secondary or equivalent exams. A cabinet meeting, headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, approved the policy with a view to involve young adults in activities related to nation building, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the meeting. The programme will initially be launched in Kurigram and Barguna districts, where young men and women aged 18 to 35 will receive training under 13 categories for three months. Participants will also be provided Tk 100 everyday, Azad said. The ruling Awami League in its election pledges vowed to create employment for one member of every family for a minimum of 100 days a year, and enlist the youth in work programmes to include national services. The finance ministry has already allocated Tk 20 crore in this pilot project, which will be expanded around the country if successful. Then the participants will eventually be given Tk 200 a day. The cabinet meeting on Monday also approved proposed amendments to the Dhaka Transport Coordination Board (DTCB) Act-2001 and Public Procurement Act-2006. Azad said, "The amended DTCB Act has provisions to form a 22-strong committee, with the city mayor, MPs, representatives of RAJUK, WASA and other organisations, headed by the communications minister." According to the Public Procurement Act, 'inexperienced' contractors will be allowed the opportunity to secure public work orders worth up to Tk 2 crore. The prime minister also issued directives to Dhaka city development body RAJUK not to approve any housing project without adequate water reservoirs and children's playgrounds. "She also asked concerned officials to send a relief team with medicine in aid of the earthquake affected people in Indonesia," Azad added. The cabinet further approved a proposal to increase the number of government Hajj administrative teams to better manage the annual pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Azad said the number of members in the teams was increased to 35 from 20 as pilgrims increased by 10,000 over the last year. b
