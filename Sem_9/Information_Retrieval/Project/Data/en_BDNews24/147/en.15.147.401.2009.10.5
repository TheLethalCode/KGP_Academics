 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The healthcare system is not running smoothly, health minister AFM Ruhul Haque admitted on Monday, in face of critical media reports in recent days. "I won't say that the healthcare system is running smoothly. There are anomalies," he said during the question-answer session in parliament. "There are no doctors in many places. We won't be able to provide doctors at all places unless more are appointed," he said. The government has already launched an initiative to have 9,700 community health clinics across the country, many will be new ones, he said. "The last Awami League government planned to build 13,500 community clinic and around 10,000 were built under that plan. The BNP-Jamaat alliance government stopped the program after assuming power," said the minister. "The government has started this project again. The appointment of doctors for the clinics will be completed in coming months," he said. The government also plans to establish state-run health services at the village level for easy access to healthcare for the rural population, he said replying to a question of Jafrul Aslam Chowdhury. bdnews24.
