 LONDON, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England manager Fabio Capello has brought goalkeeper Joe Hart and defender Gary Cahill into his squad to replace the injured Paul Robinson and Joleon Lescott for this month's final two Group Six World Cup qualifiers. Blackburn Rovers's Robinson (hip) and Manchester City's Lescott (calf) returned to their clubs on Tuesday meaning a call for Birmingham City's Hart, with one cap, and Bolton Wanderers' Cahill, who has yet to make his full international debut. England have booked a place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa but Ukraine, who they face on Saturday in Dnepropetrovsk (5:15 p.m. British time), are battling for the runners-up spot with Croatia. England's final match is at home to already-eliminated Belarus on October 14. Revised squad: Goalkeepers: Robert Green (West Ham United), David James (Portsmouth), Joe Hart (Birmingham City). Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Manchester City), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United), Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Gary Cahill (Bolton Wanderers), John Terry (Chelsea), Matthew Upson (West Ham United). Midfielders: Gareth Barry (Manchester City), David Beckham (LA Galaxy), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Aaron Lennon (Tottenham Hotspur), James Milner (Aston Villa), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City). Forwards: Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa), Carlton Cole (West Ham United), Peter Crouch (Tottenham Hotspur), Emile Heskey (Aston Villa), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United).
