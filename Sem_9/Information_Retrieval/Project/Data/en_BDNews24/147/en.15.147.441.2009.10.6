 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)The continuing economic downturn and slump in ad revenue have claimed a major food magazine, which has been a household name in America for nearly 70 years. The announcement made Monday by Conde Nast, publisher of Gourmet magazine, came as a shock to foodies all across the country. The magazine amassed a devoted following among food lovers since the publication hit news stand in 1940. "I feel like Linus and somebody has yanked away my security blanket," Stuart Clifford, 55, who has been a subscriber for 32 years, told CNN money.com. For Clifford, the November issue, which may also be its last, holds particular sentimental value. "My brother and I would always grab the November issue and find the featured meal and make a big deal about cooking it. That was our Thanksgiving (meal) year after year after year," he said. Conde Nast is also shutting down three other publications: Cookie, Modern Bride and Elegant Bride largely because of declining ad revenue. Although there were speculations that Cond Nast would close one of its food titles  Gourmet or Bon Apptit  but most bets were on the latter. Gourmet has a richer history than Bon Apptit, and its editor, Ruth Reichl, is powerful in the food world. Cookie is a relatively new introduction, started in 2005, while the bridal magazines were seen as offshoots of the bigger Brides magazine, which Cond Nast also owns. "The magazine industry is in a difficult position generally speaking, it's losing revenue to online advertising and it's a tough business right now," said Richard Dorfman, managing director of Richard Alan Inc., a financial advisory and investment company focusing on the media industry. Even though many fans enjoyed flipping through the glossy pages of Gourmet, popular food shows on television and online sites eroded the magazine's advertising revenue. Gourmet, which has nearly 1 million subscribers, fell victim to a decline in ad sales and followed a companywide review of magazines. "The review has led us to a number of decisions designed to navigate the company through the economic downturn and to position us to take advantage of coming opportunities," Conde Nast CEO Chuck Townsend said. Roughly 180 people were affected by the news of the four titles closing, according to Conde Nast spokeswoman Maurie Perl. According to Townsend, Conde Nast will continue to use the Gourmet brand in book publishing and television programming, and Gourmet recipes will still appear on Epicurious.com. The publisher's other epicurean title, Bon Appetit, will remain intact. Conde Nast is also bumping up the frequency of its Brides magazine to monthly to fill some of the void left by the closing of Modern Bride and Elegant Bride. "These changes, combined with cost and workforce reductions now underway throughout the company, will speed the recovery of our current businesses and enable us to pursue new ventures," Townsend said. Other magazines have also been hit hard during the downturn. Titles including Blender, Vibe, Domino and Portfolio were all lost in the last year.
