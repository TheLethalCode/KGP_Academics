<TITLE> India made mistakes in Champions Trophy - Dhoni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted his team made mistakes during the Champions Trophy in which they failed to reach the semi-finals. They beat West Indies by seven wickets in their final match on Wednesday but finished only third in Group A after starting the tournament as one of the favourites. India made a poor start when they lost to Pakistan by 54 runs and their second game against Australia was abandoned because of rain. "We have made mistakes during this tournament. Our bowlers gave batsmen too much width and we can definitely put in more of an effort in the field," Dhoni told a news conference. "We need to work on a few things and hopefully we will have time to fix those things before we play again," he added. Dhoni also rued the fact that his team lack an all-rounder who can bowl quickly. "One reason Australia is so strong is that their bowlers, like Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee, can all bat a bit. "We should be able to find a seamer who can bat. At times, if you are playing with just the six specialist batsmen, you can get into trouble especially if you are chasing a target and you lose early wickets," he said. "During this tournament we were forced to play five specialist bowlers and none of them are particularly good batsmen," Dhoni added.
