 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka WASA has moved to supply additional two-and-a-half-crore-litre of water daily using an indigenous technology invented by Bogra Rural Development Academy (RDA), officials said Thursday. Acting managing director of Dhaka WASA Mahbubur Rahman and director general of RDA Md Nazrul Islam signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect. RDA technology will be installed at the Water Development Board's water tank in Chatbari, Goran in Mirpur. Under the scheme, rain water will be reserved and it would be supplied after purification. RDA will not take any money from WASA for the first two years. State minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak along with top ministry officials attended the deal signing occasion in the capital. Nanak said: "This initiative will play an important role for meeting water crisis in Dhaka city. This will reduce water shortages for the people of Mirpur and newly developed Uttara." The initiative will be spread beyond the capital if it is successful in Mirpur. Mahbubur Rahman said RDA will implement the project with its own fund, but added that they will start charging after two years into project implementation. bd
