 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court will hear the writ petitions filed by seven sacked professors of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University challenging their job termination on Tuesday instead of Monday. Deputy attorney general Mostafa Zaman told bdnews24.com that the hearing would take place on Tuesday. BSMMU authorities sacked 10 professors and one associate professor on Sept 29 in an apparent purge of political appointees during the last BNP-Jamaat coalition government. The seven professors on Sunday filed the writ petitions with the bench of justices Mohammed Tarique Ul Hakim and Mohammed Moinul Islam. The petitioners are professors Md Jahangir Kabir, Nasim Ahmed Chowdhury, Sayeba Aktar, Motiur Rahman Mollah, Shahidul Alam Khan, Abul Kashem Chowdhury and associate professor Sharif Hasan. University registrar Abdul Gafur told bdnews24.com on Sept 29 that the 11 had been "relieved" of their jobs because their appointments "flouted rules and were unlawful". All of them got appointed to BSMMU on retirement from their government service during BNP-Jamaat alliance government. bdne
