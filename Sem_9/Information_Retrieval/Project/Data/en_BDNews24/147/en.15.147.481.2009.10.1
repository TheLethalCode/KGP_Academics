 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)US Congressman Patrich Kennedy, son of late senator Edward M Kennedy, has announced joining the Bangladesh Congressional Caucus that lobbies for Bangladesh's interests in the US Congress. He pledged his total support for measures to ease tariff and debt burden on Bangladesh at a meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni in Washington on Wednesday, according to a foreign ministry press statement. Patrich's father extended invaluable support to Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 despite then US President Richard Nixon's anti-Bangladesh policy and sweeping supports to the occupation Pakistan forces. Edward Kennedy's vigorous campaign prompted the US to recognise Bangladesh on April 24, 1972. The Kennedy junior also agreed to help Bangladesh gain access to latest US satellite technology and imagery to make better use of marine resources, said the statement issued on Thursday. His joining raised Bangladesh Caucus's strength to 27, according to US-Bangladesh Advisory Council. Joseph Crowley and Gary Ackerman are the co-chair of the Caucus. "Congressman Kennedy assured his total support for the promotion of Bangladesh in the Capitol Hill and announced that he began this mission today (Wednesday)," added the statement.
