<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government will fix the price of sugar at a meeting on Wednesday, in an attempt to stabilise the cost of the essential that remains artificially high following hikes during Ramadan, while mill owners, wholesalers and retailers trade blame. The meeting will decide the price of sugar at mill gates, retail and wholesale, reviewing the prices of sugar in international markets, said a government handout on Tuesday. The announcement came after a meeting chaired by commerce minister Faruq Khan along with owners of sugar mills, sugar traders and the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries, among others. During Ramadan, the government fixed the mill gate price of sugar at Tk 39 per kg after a meeting with mill owners and retailers. Contrary to the decision, sugar prices jumped up to Tk 60 per kg on retail markets. It continues to sell dear. According to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, sugar is selling at Tk 55-58 per kg in the capital's kitchen markets. Recently, the commerce minister told the reporters that intelligence sources attributed the artificially high sugar prices to "syndicates" created by some mill owners and wholesalers. He said, the perpetrators would be brought to book. Quoting intelligence sources, some newspapers published names of the accused mill owners and wholesalers. Most of the accused mill owners and traders attended Tuesday's meeting. FBCCI president Annisul Haque told reporters, after the meeting, "The price of sugar is being hiked at the mill gate in line with higher prices in the international market." He also said Tuesday's meeting made some important decisions on stabilising the price of sugar. Neither the commerce minister nor any official of the ministry spoke to media after the meeting. Haque said, "During Ramadan, the government fixed price of sugar at Tk 39 per kg when its price on the international market was $500 per metric tonne." "Now it has exceeded $600 on the international market," he said. In light of higher global prices, Haque said, the price hike of sugar at the mill gate is "rational." The meeting due on Wednesday is supposed to take a final decision on the issue, he added. Tuesday's meeting ran from 1.30-4.30 pm at the commerce ministry's conference room. Managing director of Abdul Monem Sugar Mill,, SM Mohiuddin told the reporters afterwards, "It is not possible to sell sugar at previous prices as it is soaring on the international market." President of Moulivibazar traders association, Hazi Enayet Ullah, said, "We have no hand in raising price of sugar. We sell it to the retailers one taka higher than our purchase price." bdnew
