<TITLE> Mujib family security law 'unprecedented': Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain was critical Tuesday of the bill tabled in parliament the day before to ensure special lifetime security for 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's surviving daughters and their children, calling it "unprecedented". "There is no country in the world that has such a rule stipulating such security for someone's family on hereditary grounds," Delwar told reporters. "It is unprecedented," said the senior opposition figure, of the proposed law that would allow Sheikh Hasina, her sister and their children to enjoy lifelong security in line with the Special Security Forces (SSF) Ordinance 1986 which is earmarked for security for VIPs. "Nowhere is there such an act in the world. A new precedent has been created by tabling such a bill in Bangladesh's parliament," said Delwar. "There are many countries in the world where former presidents, prime ministers or immediate outgoing heads of the government and state enjoy security up to a specific time." "Our leader Khaleda Zia was also the prime minister. [But] the government has not properly secured her," said the BNP chairperson's number two in the party. Home minister Sahara Khatun placed the 'Father of the Nation Family Members Security Bill 2009' before the house on Monday at the start of proceedings chaired by Speaker Abdul Hamid. The Speaker referred the bill to the standing committee on home affairs for scrutiny asking it to return its recommendation within two weeks. The previous Awami League administration originally passed a Bangabandhu Family Security Act on June 2001, before leaving power. The BNP-led government subsequently revoked the law on Dec 2 that year after coming to power. The new bill has provision for the government to provide state-level security, well protected residence and other facilities to each surviving member of Bangabandhu's immediate family, which includes prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A statement citing the objective and background of the bill said "defeated forces in the liberation war aided by their associates at home and abroad created a scandalous dark chapter in human history by assassinating the Father of the Nation along with most of his family members on Aug 15, 1975." It said "several attempts were made on the lives of the surviving members of the family and such conspiracy is still on." The law was therefore formulated to secure safety of the surviving members of the family by adopting state measures. Sheikh Hasina's cabinet endorsed the proposal on formulation of the law earlier this year. b
