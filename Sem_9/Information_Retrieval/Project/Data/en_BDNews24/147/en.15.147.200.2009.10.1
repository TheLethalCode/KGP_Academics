 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka magistrate gave the CID police three days on Thursday to question former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and Hafez Abu Taher in the killing case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. Taher is a relative of Pintu by his brother Maulana Tajuddin's marriage. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Shahdat Hossain gave the order, a day after senior assistant CID superintendent Abdul Kahar Akhand petitioned the Dhaka Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. He had sought 10 days for Pintu and five days for Taher. The court sent the remand application to Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Magistrate Hossain had heard the applications in presence of Pintu and Taher. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the killing and explosives cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
