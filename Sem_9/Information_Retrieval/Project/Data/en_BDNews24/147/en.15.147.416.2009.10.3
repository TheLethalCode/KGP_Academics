 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League is not planning, for now, to discipline sidelined leader Abdul Jalil for his recent remarks that touched off raging debates across the political divide. The ruling party's new-look Central Working Committee at its first meeting on Saturday did not make any decision on the former general secretary. "No measures can be taken against an unbalanced man," general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said to reporters after the meeting in the afternoon in the party chief prime minister Sheikh Hasina's political office in Dhanmondi. Several leaders at the meeting discussed the issue but no decision was made, he added. Ashraf said, "We are getting to know about the statements of Mr Jalil from the media. We will collect evidence if needed. We will decide when the evidence is on hand." Jubo League activists shouted slogans seeking punishment of Jalil when Hasina came to the meeting. Before the meeting, a group of people distributed two leaflets saying Jalil has been involved with conspiracy against the party after meeting with Tarique Rahman, son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who is also in London. The activists in the leaflets asked for measures against Jalil and also criticised Amu, Razzak, Tofail and Suranjit. One of the leaflets read: "Give exemplary punishment to Jalil and others for their betrayal." Disgruntled Jalil had said in interviews with bdnews24.com and London-based ethnic Bangla TV that he had made a mistake by not going against Hasina on his return to the country to protect his post during the 2007-08 caretaker government regime. He said Hasina had done injustice by putting "sycophants" members of the party in the Presidium and excluding veterans. Jalil had said that his party reached a 'compromise deal' with the military-installed caretaker government before the Dec 29 general elections. He also alleged that most of the party leaders who are now in the cabinet have links with the military's intelligence. He was assaulted by Jubo League activists in Birmingham, UK after the interview. Later, in another interview with bdnews24.com last Tuesday, he made a dramatic flip-flop on his ranting and raving against Hasina, her picks in the cabinet and party, and the general elections, and said 'sorry' for shooting his mouth off. He said he still suffers from the trauma caused by torture by the military intelligence DGFI during detention and blamed the mental state for the testy remarks he made. However, Mohammad Nasim, organising secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Abu Sayeed Swapan, committee member Tipu Munsi made speeches against Jalil. Nasim, home and telecommunications minister in 1996-2001 Hasina cabinet, demanded measures against Jalil and said, "Jalil should not go unchallenged." Hasina made those who would hang around her in the guise of good men general secretary, Nasim said. He also mentioned the second marriage of Jalil in his speech. He said, "Those who gave written statements to the DGFI must be identified." Presidium member Obaidul Qader quipped, "DGFI did not take you (Nasim)." During his detention and while being treated abroad, Jalil was reported on a number of occasions criticising Hasina's rule of the party, saying there was no democracy within Awami League. He denied the statements after his release on bail ahead of the Dec 2008 general elections. He said he was tortured and forced to make such statements during his detention. Organising secretary Jahangir Kabir Nanak and committee member Mirza Azam wanted to speak after the speeches of several leaders about Jalil, but the party chief did not allow them. Nasim pointed out that Hasina, in her speech, did not say anything about Jalil. Hasina snapped, "He (Jalil) said all these in public, while many others spoke more aggressively in their living room. "My skin is thick, I've to tolerate everything. "Time is not running away," Hasina said. Jalil was elected general secretary in the 19th council of the party in December, 2002. He served as commerce minister in the 1996-2001 Awami League government. In a television interview, on Apr 20 this year, Jalil said he wanted to carry on with his duties as secretary general, but there were misunderstandings between him and Hasina. Jalil announced he was resuming his duties as general secretary after his release, only to find himself sidelined initially as Syed Ashraf, then joint general secretary, continued in his role as acting general secretary for some time. Though Jalil was eventually reinstated, Ashraf had been official party spokesperson since. Jalil resigned from his post as Awami League general secretary on July 21, this year. Jalil had been arrested on May 28, 2007 and he was allowed to go to Singapore for medical treatment on paroled bail. He returned home six months later. Upon his return home, the High Court on Oct 20, 2008, granted the AL leader bail in a case related to wealth statement filed by the Anticorruption Commission. bdn
