<TEXT>
 Savar, Oct 03 (bdnews24.com)  Over 50 people were reportedly injured in a clash between police and hundreds of garments workers on the outskirts of the capital on Saturday. Police said over 1,000 workers of Anlima Textile Limited, located next to the Dhaka-Aricha highway in Savar, took to the streets in anger at factory bosses. Officer in charge at Savar Police Station AKM Nasir Ullah said that the incident was sparked by an argument between workers and authorities at the apparel factory. The garment workers said they were protesting the unfair sacking of some of their co-workers. Clashes ensued as police intercepted them, Nasir said. He said police were forced to charge with batons to disperse the angry workers who were hurling brickbats. Nasir said seven policemen were injured in the clash, while workers said over 50 of their number had been hurt. Traffic on the Dhaka-Aricha highway came to a halt for half an hour from about 11am due to the demonstration. Additional police were deployed at the factory, to prevent escalation of the situation, said the local police chief. He also said the demonstrations could have spread across the industrial zone if police hadn't controlled the situation in time. The workers, meanwhile, claimed the factory authorities had failed to pay them on time, and had sacked workers on flimsy grounds. They also claimed that factory bosses beat and bullied workers who didn't get any remedy to the situation when complaints were made to higher authorities. Managing director of Anlima Textile Limited, Mahmudul Haque, refuted the allegations and said no workers were being treated unfairly. He added that a general manager and a senior vice president had been sacked previously for improper conduct with workers, but no such incidents between bosses and workers had taken place recently. The workers also vandalised the factory on Saturday, forcing owners to file a case against 28 named and 40-50 unnamed workers, including two workers whom police had arrested during the clashes, a sub-inspector at Savar Police Station, Azizur Rahman, told bdnews24.com. Rahman said senior executive officer at the factory Kohinoor Islam filed the case. bdn
