<TEXT>
 Liton Haider bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)A F M Muhitul Islam, who filed the case for the killing of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, says he wants to see the reflection of the latest judgement. The only living witness to the grisly Aug 15, 1975 incident that he is-- the alleged killers apart--Islam said in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com on Sunday: "I'm very happy that my long-waited expectation is going to be fulfilled." Then the receptionist who doubled up as resident personal secretary to the assassinated president, Islam, 60, says he will take to the street with the slain president's followers if the protracted murder trial and the process of the implementation of the judgement are further delayed. Otherwise, he said, "I'll start demonstration on the streets. But I hope it'll not be delayed again." He also explained the delay about filing the case 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. "I went to Lalbagh Police Station to file a case in the early 1976. The duty officer took my complaint to the officer-in-charge. He returned after sometime, slapped me twice and said, 'Bastard, you'll die and kill us too." Islam now thinks that the officer saved his life by refusing to take the case. "The killers would not let me live and I would have got justice." "I filed the case when found my life secure." When asked if he received threats from the defendants, Islam said, "Yes, I'm receiving threats until now from the beginning. "But I don't care." He also recalled the gory events of the fateful night. "I joined my shift at 8 at night on Aug 14. Bangabandhu did not return home until then. Later, when he came, he looked into my room and gave me the usual smile." "I was a bachelor then," Islam continued. "I got out in a car to hang around with friends after he came and returned around 2am and went to bed. After a while, the telephone mechanic told me that Bangabandhu had been looking for me. "When I called him, Bangabandhu told me that the house of (Abdur Rab) Serniabat was under attack and that I should call to inform the police of the matter. "But I could not reach any police station despite several tries. Then came in the sound of gunshots, which stopped after sometime. "Then Bangabandhu came to the telephone room wearing a lungi and was trying to speak on the phone. "A hail of bullets flew around again. At one stage bullets rained on the room we were in. "Bangabandhu suddenly lied down on the floor and asked me to do the same. My hand was cut with a piece of glass of the window splintered by bullets. Seeing this he pulled me close to him on the floor. "The shooting stopped after a few minutes. He wore his Punjabi and glasses that the servant brought him before me, went to the balcony and asked his men, 'So much firing is going on, army sentries and police sentries, what are you doing?' and went upstairs. "Then the assailants got into the house and started to kill one after another. I had reckoned that no-one could kill him. It is beyond my thoughts even now. Islam said Sheikh Mujib could go out into hiding if he had wanted: "But he was not that sort of person to escape. I think the assassins would not have killed anyone if Bangabandhu was not there. "Sheikh Russell was the last victim of the killing mission. After killing all he was brought downstairs. Russell said, holding me tight, 'They won't kill me, will they?'" "Then one of the killers hit me with the rifle butt and took him inside the police box. After a while, two people came and took him from there saying that they were taking him to his mother. Moments later, I heard gunshot. bd
