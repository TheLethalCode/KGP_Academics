 JERUSALEM, Oct 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel began releasing 19 Palestinian women from its jails on Friday in the first part of a deal with Hamas, in return for a video showing proof that a captured Israeli soldier being held by the group is alive. Officials said the 19 women, to be joined by a 20th on Sunday, will first be brought in International Red Cross vehicles to border crossings with the Gaza Strip and West Bank, but will not be freed until Israel gives the green light after viewing the videotape.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday it was "important for the entire world to know that Gilad Shalit is alive and well and that Hamas is responsible for his well-being and his fate." Shalit, now 23, is also a French citizen. He was spirited into Gaza by Islamist militants who tunneled into Israel in a raid in which two soldiers and two of the attackers were killed. Israel holds more than 10,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas is negotiating for the release of hundreds of its members in exchange for Shalit, including militants behind deadly attacks who Israel has said in the past it would not free.
