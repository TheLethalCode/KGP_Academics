Analysts say the notoriously paranoid generals see Suu Kyi as a threat because of the influence she has over the Burmese people and the international community and will likely reject her offer of help. The United States on Tuesday entered into dialogue with the Myanmar regime, but emphasised that the lifting of sanctions would be a mis
