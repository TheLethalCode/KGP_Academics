 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)Police get four days to grill Emdadullah alias Mahbub, a suspected member of the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, in custody. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mominul Hassan granted the remand on Friday after inspector Ashraf Hossain of the Detective Branch asked for seven days. Deputy commissioner of metropolitan DB (south) Monirul Islam said ateam, led by assistant commissioner Sanowar Hossain, arrested Emdadullah late on Wednesday from Gabtoli in Dhaka. Hossain said Mahbub Emdadullah is a suspected member of Harkatul Jihadia Islamia Azadia, a Pakistan-based militant group. He is also the Bangladesh chief of Asif Reza Commando force and member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the official said. Lashkar-e-Taiba was accused of 'Mumbai attack' in November last year. Indian intelligence agencies found Ajmal Amir Kasab's involvement with Laskar-e-Taiba. Kasab is the only attacker who was captured alive during November attack. The militant group is also accused of attacking rail track in Mumbai in 2006. It is also blamed for bomb attack at Diwali festival in New Delhi in 2005. At least 500 people died in three attacks. Emdadullah is a resident of Padmapukur village under Bagda in north Chabbish Pargana in India. He is the son of Ansar ali, alias Abu Ansar. He had been into hiding at different places in Bangladesh, India and Pakitan to avoid arrest. He also took a fake name at that time. Emdadullah also had contact with Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah, a suspected Indian militant who was arrested in July. The officer claimed militant network in Bangladesh has collapsed after the arrest of Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah and Maulana Mohammad Monsur Ali in last July. Militants stopped contacting each other fearing arrests after their capture. Maulana Mohammad Monsur Ali, another suspected militant arrested in last July, is the uncle of Obaidullah. bdnew
