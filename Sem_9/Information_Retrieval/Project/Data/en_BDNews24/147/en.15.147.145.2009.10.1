 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)--The government has started working on a detailed data bank for people aged over 50. Quamrunnessa Khanam, secretary for the social welfare ministry, said on Thursday the World Bank will fund the scheme, and officials have started doing the groundwork for the study. Khanam said the government would also build one house for elderly persons in each division. She said the previous Awami League government in 1996 launched the project, but it was halted later by the following BNP-Jamaat coalition government. Her revelation came as various public and private organisations on Thursday marked the International Day for Elderly Persons Such organisations brought out processions, organised discussions and cultural functions while some supplied special food to old homes. According to an official census in 2001, the number of people above 65 years was 48 lakhs _ men 27 lakhs and women 21 lakhs. In 1999, the government introduced monthly old-aged allowance of Tk 100 per head for the distressed elderly persons. It was later raised to Tk 300. An official said Tk 237 crore allocated as such allowances remained unspent over last seven years allowances because of weaknesses and inefficiency in management. This year Tk 800 crore was allocated for this scheme. The allowances are being given to 22.50 lakh elderly persons. Earlier, the number was 20 lakh, but it increased after the age ceiling of women was revised to 62 years from 65 years. Dr Afsana Karim, joint secretary of Old Men's Welfare Samity, told bdnews24.com that the government should build more old homes with adequate facilities. Afsana said special arrangements should be made for medical treatment for elderly persons at hospitals and clinics. She also demanded the government officially recognise them as senior citizens. bdnew
