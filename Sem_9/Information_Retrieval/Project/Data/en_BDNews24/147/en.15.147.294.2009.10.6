<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)The benchmark index of the country's premier bourse touched a new high Tuesday. Dhaka Stock Exchange' s general index or the DGEN ended on 3251.79 points, rising just over 28 points or 0.88 percent from the last day's closing. The previous high of the index was at 3207.89 on June 1 last year. Tuesday's high was backed by a huge rise in power and energy shares along with huge transaction in corporate giants like Beximco, ACI and British American Tobacco. Meanwhile, the turnover also reached to a relatively higher amount at Tk 9.24 billion. Experts said that the high rules out the so called 'liquidity crunch' issue of the market. "It indicates there are no shortage of money in the market," Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former DSE chief executive, told bdnews24.com. Investors' interest has grown over the capital market, he added. Meanwhile, market participators cautioned about overheating. "Usually issues are overpriced as supply of shares is much lower than the demand," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. A huge amount of idle money of institutional investors is loitering in the market, which may cause a bubble, added the CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. He recommended careful consideration on putting money on issues at the moment.
