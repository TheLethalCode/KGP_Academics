 COPENHAGEN, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) said in a statement Friday it was disappointed that Chicago was not awarded the 2016 Olympics but extended its congratulations to winners Rio de Janeiro. USOC Chairman Larry Probst and acting chief executive Stephanie Streeter also thanked President Barack Obama for flying to Copenhagen to speak in support of the bid. Chicago, considered favorites, were surprisingly eliminated in the first round of voting. Tokyo and Madrid were also eliminated later. "This was a terrific competition among four world-class cities. While we are disappointed, we thank Mayor Daley, the City of Chicago, Pat Ryan and Chicago 2016 for their tireless efforts and an outstanding bid," they said in the statement. "We are proud and appreciative of all of their efforts, along with that of thousands of athlete ambassadors, corporate backers, private donors, and our national governing bodies and multi-sport Organizations. "We are extremely grateful to President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and the entire Obama administration for their unprecedented support of the bid and the Olympic Movement. "On behalf of the U.S. Olympic family, we extend our congratulations to Rio de Janeiro on its selection as the host city for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Rio put together an excellent bid plan, and we look forward to bringing our athletes and delegation to Brazil in 2016.
