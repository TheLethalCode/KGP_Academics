 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary watchdog on shipping ministry has recommended making Bangladesh's sole Marine Academy into a university. The parliamentary panel on Wednesday also suggested the ministry set up two more marine academies in Mongla and Narayanganj. "Our Marine Academy is considered one of the best marine institutes in the world. The mariners passing out of this academy fetch huge amount of foreign currency for the country," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, chairman of the standing committee, told reporters after a meeting on Wednesday. He said more ships would come in the Bay of Bengal if Bangladesh could build a deep-sea port. "We will need more marine engineers. "Therefore, the committee has recommended converting the Marine Academy into a marine university," said Chowdhury. "If the ministry sets up two more marine academies as per the recommendations of the committee, we will be able to produce more mariners," said the chairman.
