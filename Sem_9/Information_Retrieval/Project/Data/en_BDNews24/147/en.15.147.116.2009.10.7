 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)The government has appointed its first ambassador to Iraq in more than six years. Career diplomat Muhammad Kamaluddin has been picked for the job, the foreign ministry said in a press statement issued on Wednesday. Bangladesh mission in Baghdad was shut after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Almost all the countries closed down their missions in Baghdad considering volatile security situation in Iraq, which was the first Middle Eastern country to recognise Bangladesh. The the decision to reopen the mission followed recommendations of a government team that visited Baghdad earlier this year to assess the security situation there. According to foreign ministry sources, the team said Bangladesh could send its workers to the war-torn Iraq as the country needed huge manpower for its reconstruction. It also said violence in Iraq had come down gradually. Suicide and bomb attacks are regular events in Iraq as mercenaries and al-Qaeda fighters have intensified their attacks on the US-led troops after the fall of president Saddam Hussain. Kamaluddin had his bachelor's degree in political science from Dhaka University in 1968 and did his post-graduation in public administration from the same University in 1969, said the statement.
