 Dhaka, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraf Islam has told parliament that "unimaginable" environmental disasters was waiting for the city dwellers because of housing projects illegally built on floodplain and wetlands. He said fighting powerful land grabbers was proving to be a "very difficult task". While answering questions in parliament, the minister said "powerful" developers had being been building housing estates by filling up the floodplains around Dhaka. The minister's warning came two days after prime minister Sheikh Hasina asked for caution in implementing any new housing projects. "The big developing companies had filled up low-lying areas in Dhaka's suburban areas from Baridhara to Bhulta (Narayanganj). The housing companies set up big signboards even in 20-feet water. "If all flood plains are choked up by building big housing projects, how the water of Dhaka will drain (to the rivers) and where Dhaka will get water from," the minister said, replying to a question from Golam Dastagir Gazi. "Mr Speaker, you will not believe without watching how the developers have been filling up low-lying areas. I have witnessed," said Ashraf, also ruling Awami League's general secretary. "You cannot imagine what an environmental disaster is awaiting the residents of Dhaka." Sensing probable catastrophe, he said, the prime minister had instructed that no housing projects would get government nod unless it had water bodies with it. "They (developing and housing companies) are very powerful and own thousands of crores of Taka," the minister said. He said Dhaka's floodplains should be protected at any cost, otherwise, the capital would be unlivable. Replying to another question from Kamal Ahmed Majumder, Ashraf said, "Those who grab land are very powerful. Fighting them in court is a very difficult task. "It is said that their (developing companies) hands go up to the High Court." Given the circumstances, the minister said, the prime minister had instructed him to buy the low-lying land from the owners by paying more money in compensation so that the government could own those. bdnews24.c
