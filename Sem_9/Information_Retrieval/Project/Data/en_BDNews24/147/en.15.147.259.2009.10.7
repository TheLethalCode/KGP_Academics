 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)--Awami League MP Abdul Jalil has been removed from the chair of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce as he declared himself 'mentally deranged', deputy leader in parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said on Wednesday. "He has declared himself unbalanced. So he was dropped from the standing committee," Chowdhury told reporters after attending a programme at Naya Paltan. The veteran AL leader, replaced as general secretary earlier this year and already sidelined within the party for previous public "outbursts", became embroiled in controversy again after going to London last month for medical treatment. His comments, made to media while there, created a political storm back home. One of the allegations that he voiced in London was that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam in a reaction called him "unbalanced". Others dismissed his comments as "rantings", while the opposition BNP had a field day with the allegation that echoed their own previously stated stance. Jalil also told media in London that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to retain his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. He went to Singapore last year after falling seriously ill during his detention by the caretaker government. He has alleged that he was tortured in custody. Since then, he has made various criticisms of his party and party chief Hasina, alongside allegations against the past caretaker government, culminating in the most recent controversy. Jalil later apologised, from London, for the allegation against his party saying such a comment came from his grievance against intelligence agency DGFI that tortured him during his period of incarceration. He also claimed his comments were 'misinterpreted'. The Awami League's central committee discussed Jalil's statement on Oct 3, but took no action against him. On whether the former Awami League general secretary would be stripped of his parliament membership, she said: "This is a matter of law. Nothing can be said without knowing about the legal affairs." "It requires certificate by physician concerned," said Sajeda, a member of the ruling party's policymaking Presidium. Asked if Jalil would be summoned by the party to explain his controversial comments in recent times, she said 'no'. The disgruntled AL leader has come under fire for his recent remarks about his own party's win in the Dec 29 poll. The parliament deputy leader said they were continuing with their effort to bring back the opposition to house. "We are continuing with our effort and will keep it up. People have voted them to speak in parliament for them. They should return to House. "The prime minister who is the House leader also asked them to return to parliament," she said. Chowdhury said both the government and her party are tough against tender terrorism and extortion. "There is no room for the tender terrorists and extortionists in the party. Action will be taken against them. "The prime minister also said they would not be spared," she added. bdnew
