 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)The US embassy has suggested applicants to take extra caution while applying for registration for the Diversity Visa (DV) through cyber caf agents. Instead, the mission has said the candidates should prefer their trustworthy relatives in the US or elsewhere to fill up the online E-DV form on their behalf. Sandra Ingram, chief, consular section, at a news conference on Monday said that all candidates must provide e-mail addresses with the application. "But the winning candidates will not be contacted via e-mail. They will get letters by post," said Ingram, who suggested candidates to fill out the form carefully lest they face the risk of cancellation of their applications. She said 50,000 immigrants around the globe would get residence permit under the DV-2011 lottery programme. Registration for DV lottery programme opened on Oct 2 and will run through to Nov 30. Ingram said 36,023 Bangladeshis managed to go to the US under DV programme since 1995. She said 6001 and 2626 Bangladeshis got visa under the diversity programme in 2010 and 2009 respectively. The consular head, however, could not say how many Bangladeshis would get visa under the programme for 2011. "The US attorney general under the US Immigration and Nationality Act will decide the number of visas for different nationalities," said Ingram. She suggested interested candidates to visit www.dvlottery.state.gov and www.dhaka.usembassy.gov to get the terms and conditions for the lottery in Bangla.
