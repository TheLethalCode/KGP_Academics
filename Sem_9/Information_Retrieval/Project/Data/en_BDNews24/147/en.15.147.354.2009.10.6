<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)  An overladen truck broke through a Bailey bridge at Bhumodokkhin on the Dhaka-Shingair-Manikganj highway on Tuesday. The damaged bridge made the route unfit for traffic. Ahsanuddin, deputy divisional engineer of Manikganj Roads and Highways Department, told bdnews24.com the truck laden with goods broke through the bridge while on its way to Shingair from Dhaka around noon. No casualties were reported, but lack of alternative road had halted all traffic movement on the highway. He said, "It's difficult to say how long it will take to fix the bridge. It is impossible for traffic to use this route until it is repaired." He said that the incident occurred because the truck was heavily overladen with goods. bdnews2
