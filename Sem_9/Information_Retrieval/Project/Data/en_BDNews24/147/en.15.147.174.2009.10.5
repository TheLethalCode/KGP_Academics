 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Two murders took place in two separate incidents in Sutrapur and Bangshal in the capital on Monday. Both killings occurred during heated rows over seemingly trivial matters, police said. Abdus Sattar, 40, an engineer-entrepreneur was stabbed to death in his Sutrapur home by an employee at 9am . In Bangshal, Md Ripon, 30, died after being badly beaten during a row over a pigeon. Sutrapur police said Sattar, a diploma engineer ran an emporium "Power Engineering Corporation" from his Bhajahari Saha Street residence. Sutrapur police chief Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com that Sattar and an employee and he were preparing their breakfast, when they started a row which became physical, according to 'Redwan', another of Sattar's employees who witnessed the murder. Quoting Redwan, the police chief said, at one point during the quarrel, the youth knifed his boss Sattar and then fled the scene. "Redwan claimed he didn't know the name of the killer, who was reportedly a new employee," said Hossain. Redwan took Sattar to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. Police are quizzing Redwan, said Hossain. Bangshal police chief Abdul Mannan said two brothers 'Sohel' and 'Manik' killed Md Ripon by hitting him with iron rods during a row. Ripon left his Aga Sadeque Road home at 7:30am to collect pigeons from a house in Mokimbazaar. He had an argument with the gate-keeper there, said Mannan. "Two brothers Sohel and Manik, residents of the house, then came out and hit Ripon in the head with iron rods. Ripon died on the spot," said the police chief. Aslam, Ripon's brother, said the murder occurred over a previous animosity. He said they had quarrelled with the two brothers Sohel and Manik earlier too. One of the two brothers had been detained, the local police chief said. bd
