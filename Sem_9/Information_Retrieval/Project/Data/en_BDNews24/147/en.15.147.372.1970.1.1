<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 1 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to resume shrimp export to the EU countries from Nov 15, a senior official at the fisheries ministry has said. Omar Faruque, public relations officer at the ministry, told bdnews24.com on Thursday that minister Abdul Latif Biswas will formally announce the decision sometime on Thursday. Shrimp exporters imposed a ban on exports to the European Union on May 15 after initiatives to eliminate contamination of frozen goods by nitrofuran, a toxic antibiotic, began to take hold. The ministry officials said the government had fully endorsed the exporters' decision of ceasing export of shrimp as the exacerbating presence of the toxic antibiotic was being detected more frequently. Between 2005 and June 2009, sixty consignments of frozen shrimp from Bangladesh were rejected by the EU due to nitrofuran contamination. Bangladesh government then decided to address the menace and identified the actions required as a first step. A national working committee to address the problems in the shrimp industry has been formed with relevant government and non-government organisations, international development agencies and export-related people and agencies as its members. The committee has drawn a national action plan to hold a number of meetings, seminars and workshops, the implementation of which is underway. Under the action plan, while importing feeds for animals and fish, provision for providing certificate guaranteeing the fish and animal feeds to be nitrofuran-free has been made mandatory. A list of laboratories of international standards with facilities for detecting nitrofuran in fish produces also has been drawn. b
