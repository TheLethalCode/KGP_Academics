 Barisal, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)Transport workers in Barisal have withdrawn their wildcat strike on Saturday morning, a transport leader said. "The decision was made after the workers held a meeting with the police at Barisal-Patuakhali Minibus Owner's Association Office at Rupatoli at around 11:30pm," general secretary of Barisal District Transport Worker's Union Sultan Mahmud said to bdnews24.com. Buses have started to move from 7am, he added. The transport workers went on strike on Friday, protesting at the arrests of two co-workers, snapping communication on 19 routes of Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barguna, Pirojpur and Jhalakathi districts. Kotwali police chief Nuruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Friday the strike started soon after two bus assistants were arrested from Rupatali Terminal in Barisal. He said a bus was carrying passengers, including two magistrates Mohammad Abul Bashar and Mrityunjoy Mistri, on a rough road. The passengers, including the two magistrates, asked the bus driver to drive slow and at one stage an argument ensued with the bus driver and his two assistants, he said. Mistri later informed the police of the incident in details and 'Majed' and 'Sumon', the assistants, were detained, he said. However, the bus driver managed to escape the scene, Chowdhury said and added the arrestees were in police custody. bdnews2
