<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)The power and energy-related parliamentary standing committee on Tuesday recommended finalising agreements with two foreign companies over gas exploration in the three of Bangladesh's Bay blocks. "Two neighbouring countries India and Myanmar have started gas exploration at their maritime boundaries. We must start too. Otherwise they can draw our gas by using advanced technology," chairman Subid Ali Bhuiyan told reporters at parliament's media centre after a meeting of the committee. "The committee thinks that we will lose out if we do not sign the production-sharing contract. The crisis will deepen with the delay," he said, emphasising quick gas production. The foreign secretary said last Thursday that Bangladsh has run into disagreement with India and Myanmar over maritime boundary of the three blocks. "India has claimed that two blocks, 5 and 10, have overlapped their maritime boundary while Myanmar made the same claim about block 11," secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes had told reporters. The government in August approved the proposal to award ConocoPhilips and Tullow Oil plc contracts to explore oil and gas in three blocks in the Bay. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. State-owned exploration authority Petrobangla chairman Moktadir Ali said last week that Conoco is expected to sign deal in the first week and Tullow in the second week of the current month. Bhuiyan on Tuesday also said the standing committee will sit with the National Committee on the Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, a left-leaning pressure group campaigning against the proposed deals, "at a convenient time later". Earlier on Sep 16, the standing committee said that it would sit very soon with the leaders of the pressure group to iron out misapprehensions over the deals. The National Committee is protesting against the deals which the it claims would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee is confusing the public on the issue with such false information. The citizen's group enforced a half-day hartal in capital Dhaka, the first in nearly three years, on Sept 14 in protest at the deals and gave the government until Oct 15 to meet their five-point charter of demands. A group of public university teachers on Friday also invited the government to an open public dialogue on the gas and coal export policies that have touched off debates and protests in recent times. bd
