<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)--The government has no plans to change the Daylight Saving Time at the moment, the state minister for power said on Saturday. "Power is being saved [from Daylight Saving Time]," Enamul Haque told reporters replying to a query. "[We] have been reaping benefits from it. [I] don't see anything bad here," he said and added: "There is no need to confuse people with [the changed] timetable." He said it was just a matter of getting habituated to the DST. "It will continue, as we now have been accustomed to [Daylight Saving Time], until we feel otherwise." After a Cabinet decision on June 1, the country clocked in Daylight Saving Time an hour ahead to 12 midnight at 11pm on June 19. The government had then said it would continue until further announcement. However, the government said later that DST would go away from Oct 1 ahead of winter season.
