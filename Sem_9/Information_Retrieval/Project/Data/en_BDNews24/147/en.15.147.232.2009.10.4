 Dhaka, Oct 04(bdnews24.com)An amendment to the Representation of the People Order was tabled in the House on Sunday with the provision that registration of political parties will be nullified if they fail to submit their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission by the Jan 25, 2010 deadline. According to the 1972 Representation of Public Order (Second Amendment) Bill-2009, political parties must submit their permanent ratified constitutions within 12 months of the start of parliament. An earlier deadline had allowed six months ending on July 24 this year, as the ninth parliament went into its maiden session on Jan 25, 2009. A total of 39 political parties were registered with draft constitutions ahead of the December 2008 elections. Of them, 33 parties including ruling Awami League comepleted their registration process by submitting their final constitutions to the EC by July 24. The rest, including main opposition BNP, appealed to the EC for extension of the deadline citing their inability to hold party councils and ratify their constitutions within the stipulated time. The cabinet on Sep 14 endorsed the EC's recommendation to increase the deadline from six to 12 months. An amendment was made to the RPO to extend the deadline. Law minister Shafique Ahmed placed the bill for a second amendment, regarding cancellation of party registration on failure to meet the new deadline, before the House at the beginning of proceedings on Sunday afternoon as parliament resumed its third session after an 18-day break for Eid-ul-Fitr and Durga Puja holidays. The bill amends Article 90 D of the RPO, where the fresh deadline for submission of permanent party constitutions has been extended to 12 months from 6 months with the new provision that registration will be nullified if the deadline is not met. Speaker of the House Abdul Hamid referred the bill to the standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs for review asking it to submit its recommendations within two days. bdnews24.com/
