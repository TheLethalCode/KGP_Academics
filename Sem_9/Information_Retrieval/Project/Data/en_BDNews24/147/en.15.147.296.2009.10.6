 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)-The Supreme Court has asked all including the media and lawyers to be careful in delivering briefing on the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing. The apex court ended the second day's hearing at 1:30pm on Tuesday and resume it at 9:30am on Wednesday. The five-judge bench of the Appellate Division gave the directive on the second day of hearing on Tuesday that began shortly after 10am at the more spacious second trial room of the court building. The court began hearing the appeals on Monday in the third trial room. At the start of the hearing attorney general Mahbubey Alam told the court that different lawyers were making different comments on the case which was not right. The court can give order asking all to be restraint on the matter, he said. Abdullah Al Mamun, lawyer for convicts retired major Bazlul Huda and lancer AKM Mohiuddin, said both the state and the defence should be restraint in delivering statements. The attorney general's office should be careful in delivering statements. Alam had earlier said that the case would be resolved within this year, he pointed out. The court said that not only both the parties (prosecution and defence), but all including the media should be restraint on the matter. Mamun started reading out from page No 691 of the paperbook at the order of the court. He finished 608-691 pages out of 1,530 pages of the paperbook during Monday's hearing. Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the hearing that statements are being delivered in talk shows on the merit of the case. "This should not take place during an ongoing trial." "I have said in the court to give directive so that such statements are not delivered. "The court has accepted my presentation and asked all to be careful in delivering statements," Alam said. The High Court judges have given three different explanations on the ruling, he added. Mamun told reporters he had read out from page 691 to page 773 on the second day. The judges gave the ruling in the case in the High Court. The Appellate Division will deliver final ruling after examining the verdict of the trial court and evidence and witness, he said. "Justice Ruhul Amin awarded 10 accused death sentence and acquitted five accused. I have read out the explanation on which grounds he had given the ruling," Mamun said. "I am now reading the part of Shahriar Shahid after finishing Faruk Rahman's part," he said. Asked what was said in the confessional statements by the accused, the lawyer said: "Faruk Rahman in his statement said that he was linked to the killing plan. "But he did not give those statements voluntarily." Mamun said it would take two more days to complete the part of ruling given by Justice Ruhul Amin. Khan Saifur Rahman, counsel for dismissed lieutenant colonel Syed Faruk Rahman, drew the court's attention to his appeal on submission of a 'concise statement'-- a summary by the prosecution on its arguments against the appeals. The court asked him to raise the issue while he would present his arguments. Rahman had filed the appeals for Syed Faruk Rahman, the dismissed lieutenant colonel, and retired lieutenant colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). The two in their petition had asked the top judges to ban the state counsels from the appeals hearing for failing to meet a deadline to submit the concise statement. If the judges agree with the petitioner, the defence counsels will have no one to counter their arguments during the long-delayed hearing that began Sunday. The freshly formed bench headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing on Monday. Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench on Sunday with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. No-one was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convicts major (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. bdne
