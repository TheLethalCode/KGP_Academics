<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The proposed education policy, if implemented, will increase unemployment, counter to the government's pledge to create more jobs, opposition leader Khaleda Zia has warned. "This government that promised to create employment for every household now threatens to generate greater unemployment in the country through its education policy," the BNP chairperson said on Monday. "They are harming the country and undermining values," Khaleda told a delegation of Teachers-Employees' United Front that met with her at her political office in Gulshan. She also called on teachers across the country to stand up to the proposed education policy. The two-time former prime minister also alleged that the Awami League, when in office before, damaged the country's education system and cheating in examination was rampant. "BNP developed skilled manpower by building the education system for the country's people, uprooted copying and tremendously improved the women's education," she claimed. A 100-member delegation led by chief coordinator to Teachers-Employees United Front spoke to her on the campus situation, the problems they face and the proposed education policy. The BNP chief censured the government's nine-month performance and said law and order has now taken a sharp turn for the worse. "The government party has been looting and extorting, grabbing and committing crimes." People are not secure with them running the affairs. About the proposed Asian Highway Network, she said, "We are not against Asian Highway. But, we are against giving corridor to India in the name of Asian Highway." "The country's people will never accept it." She again offered to assist the government and said: "We will assist the government if they work in the interest of the country." "But we will mount resistance with people if they go ahead with the activities against the country." BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, former education minister Osman Faruq, College Teachers' Association's secretary general principal Mugis Uddin Mahmood, Madrasa Teachers' Association's chairman Maolana MA Latif, among others, spoke at the meeting. b
