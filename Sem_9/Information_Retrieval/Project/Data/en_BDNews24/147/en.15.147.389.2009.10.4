 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)Two Dhaka courts Sunday granted further extensions for ongoing investigations into the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack cases. Two cases are proceeding simultaneously in separate courts, in connection with the attack on an Awami League rally in the capital in 2004, one filed under the explosives act and a murder case. Judge Fozila Begum of the second additional metropolitan court gave two more months for investigation in the murder case afterinvestigating officer Abdul Qahhar Akand of the CID requested three more months. At the same time, the court issued a rule nisi regarding the bail of the now freed accused Arif Hasan Sumon and Mohibullah and set Oct 14 for the hearing. Judge ANM Bashirullah of Dhaka special tribunal-1, meanwhile, gave three more months for completing investigations in the case filed under the explosives act. The eight accused in the cases were produced in both courts Sunday wearing bullet-proof vests. Former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, one of the accused, told reporters that he and co-accused Hafez Abu Taher, remanded for three days into CID custody on Thursday, were yet to be questioned. Investigators in the two cases were previously given a two-month extension on Aug 3, which ended Sunday. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases had been running concurrently in a speedy trial tribunal until their recent transfers to two separate trial courts. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to the two trial courts as the extended investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial law. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the two cases on June 11 last year. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the grenade blasts during an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. bdnew
