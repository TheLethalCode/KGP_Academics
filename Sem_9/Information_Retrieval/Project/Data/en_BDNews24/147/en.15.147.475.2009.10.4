 BANGALORE, Oct 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Floods triggered by heavy rains have killed at least 200 people in the past five days in southern India, destroyed standing crops and left tens of thousands of people homeless, officials said on Sunday. At least 167 people have been killed in Karnataka, where several rivers burst their mud embankments following heavy rains and swept away houses.
