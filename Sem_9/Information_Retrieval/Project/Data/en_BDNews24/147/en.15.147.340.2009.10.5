 GAZA, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel freed a Palestinian woman prisoner to the Gaza Strip on Sunday, the last of 20 it has swapped for a videotape that provided the first visible evidence that a soldier captured in 2006 was still alive. Rawda Saed was taken to the coastal territory in a Red Cross vehicle, then driven to the offices of Gaza's Hamas Islamist leader Ismail Haniyeh, who said the prisoner releases suggested there was progress toward a deal to free Sergeant Gilad Shalit. "We view with relief the serious movement in the prisoner swap file," Haniyeh said. "We stress that we will not abandon our responsibility toward our male and female prisoners."

Two other troops, and two Palestinian gunmen, died in the incident. The soldier is a cause celebre in a country where most men and women face military conscription at age 18. Israeli television stations reported a high volume of viewing for the video, which has been broadcast repeatedly since Friday. "Let's complete the swap," left-leaning Haaretz daily opined in the title of its main editorial. The mass-circulation Yedioth Ahronoth daily ran a banner headline quoting Shalit's own words from the video: "May I fulfill my dream of going free, at la
