 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Daniel Vettori praised Grant Elliott after he batted with a broken thumb to lead New Zealand to a five-wicket win over Pakistan in Saturday's Champions Trophy semi-final. The all-rounder needed an injection before anchoring New Zealand's run-chase with 75 not out off 103 balls.

"Hopefully the team that has played for the last three games turns up and gives us a chance of winning." Pakistan captain Younus Khan blamed his team's defeat on a poor batting display. After winning the toss and electing to bat Pakistan could only muster 233 for nine in 50 overs. "Our batsmen got a couple of good starts but were not able to cash in.
