 Thu Oct 1, 2009 9:26pm BST By Neil Maidment LONDON, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia all-rounder Mitchell Johnson was named International Cricket Council (ICC) Cricketer of the Year at an awards ceremony in Johannesburg on Thursday. The 27-year-old, who beat fellow short-list nominees Gautam Gambhir and Mahendra Singh Dhoni of India and England's Andrew Strauss to the award, played in 17 Tests during the voting period and took 80 wickets. "I'm really blown away, I am just surprised to be up here," said Johnson. "It has been a great 12 months for our side, we have lost some wonderful players in recent years and we have been rebuilding with some young guys. "I'm enjoying the game at the moment, that makes all the difference. The highlight for me was actually my first century in a Test (against South Africa in Cape Town in March)." Johnson's tally of Test wickets in 2009 was easily the highest by any bowler and he also struck 632 runs with the bat at an average of 30.09. In addition he played 16 one-day internationals in the year, snapping up 28 wickets at an average of 24.25. BATTING STYLE ICC president David Morgan said: "Mitchell has worked extremely hard over the past year to be an integral part of Australia's bowling line-up and his effective batting style has turned him into one of the top all-round cricketers. "His statistics for the last 12 months show how worthy a winner of this title he is." India captain Dhoni took the one-day international player of the year award for the second consecutive year after scoring 967 runs in 24 matches. Team mate Gambhir was named test player of the year while Australia paceman Peter Siddle took the emerging player of the year award. "It's been a dream run for me. I never thought it could be like this but life has changed for me and I am very happy," Gambhir said. Pakistan's Aleem Dar was named umpire of the year.
