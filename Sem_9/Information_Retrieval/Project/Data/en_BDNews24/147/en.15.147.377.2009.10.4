 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)--Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has said the government will expand training facilities and hike pay to have more knowledgeable and skilled teachers. At a meeting with representatives of National Teachers and Employees' Front at National Press Club on Sunday, he also said formation of the new education policy would change the current fundamentals in the education sector. "We will finalise the education policy after considering everyone's views. We will correct mistakes if we made any. However, we need education policy." Being a national priority, formulation of education policy is almost finalised, he added. Nahid said the nation would not be able to achieve anything if it failed to create capable, skilled and trained teachers. "Teachers should be evaluated at the highest respect in economy, society and in the state. Only then is it possible to establish a modern and technology-based society for future generation." Nine percent children have no access to primary education. As much as 48 percent children drop out of school in primary level and 42 percent in the secondary level, the minister informed the meeting. "We could not provide primary and secondary education facilities properly. We also failed to provide them life-oriented education. "We are also ignorant about vocational education. Only two percent students are studying vocational education. The government is taking initiatives to bring fundamental change to the education sector." He said his government has taken initiative to train teachers from all levels to create a modern and bright young generation. In the last fiscal year, 4,441 college teachers were trained in National Academy for Education Management (NAEM) and 3,830 teachers will receive training this year. Nahid also asked the government to allocate more money to train teachers. He assured the teachers of more pay and other benefits after the implementation of the National Pay Commission. He suggested that the government should raise the spending on the education sector to 8 percent of its GDP from current 2.23 percent. Chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education ministry Rashed Khan Menon, vice-chancellor of National University prof Kazi Shahidullah, vice-chancellor of World University of Bangladesh (WUB), professor Dr Abdul Mannan Choudhury were also present at the programme. bdn
