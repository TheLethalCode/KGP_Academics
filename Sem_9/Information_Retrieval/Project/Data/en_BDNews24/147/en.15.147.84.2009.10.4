<TITLE> 'Proper environment' still lacking in House: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  BNP is continuing with its abstention for the current session of parliament as the "proper environment" has still not been created for the opposition to attend, the party's chief whip Jainul Abdin Farroque said on Sunday. "We will consider returning after the proper environment is created and there is assurance for us to be heard in parliament," Farroque said at a press briefing at the media centre of the Jatiya Sangsad complex. "But we are not attending the re-adjourned session [Sunday]," he said. The third session re-convened at 4:10pm on Sunday after an interval of 18 days for Eid and Puja holidays. After sporadic attendance during the first session of the ninth parliament, BNP has abstained from two consecutive sessions over an ongoing dispute concerning seating arrangements, among other issues. Farroque said Sunday that the speaker was supposed to inform the main opposition BNP of a new seating allocation after discussion with the ruling Awami League but there had been "no development" in the matter. The opposition also demanded discussion over 29 deferred proposals but the speaker did not accept any of those, he said. "The personal aides of the opposition leader are not permitted to enter the House with the parliament proceedings ongoing. The dispute over the seats of the opposition in the first row is yet to be resolved," said Farroque. "Instead of cancelling the cases against BNP leaders, including Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman, new cases and assaults are being imposed on the party leaders and supporters," he added. "Favouritism is everywhere including the administration." "In this situation we think the government is not creating any environment for us to attend parliament. They do not want the opposition to come to parliament," said the opposition whip. "In spite of the questionable election on Dec 29, Khaleda Zia attended the first session of the parliament for the sake of democracy. She said that she wanted to assist the government. But the government has rejected the assistance." Farroque also said there was no internal dispute among BNP MPs over the seats in parliament. "The statement of the prime minister regarding this is not true," Farroque said, replying to a question from reporters. b
