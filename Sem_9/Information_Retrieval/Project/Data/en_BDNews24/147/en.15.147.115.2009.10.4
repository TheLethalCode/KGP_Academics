The court sent two other arrestees to jail after two days of remand. Deputy commissioner of Motijheel zone Khandaker Muhid Uddin told bdnews24.com the RAB members were arrested after their involvement was proved in two cases filed with Motijheel Police Station. They were summoned to the police station on Saturday night for questioning and were arrested early on Sunday after confirmation of the involvement in the incidents.
