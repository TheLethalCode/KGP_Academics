<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 01 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission's enquiry committee wrapped up on Thursday the primary investigation in the corruption case regarding the container management contract at Chittagong port. The probe committee has questioned 30 people, including former shipping adviser to the army-backed caretaker government M A Matin, in connection with the 'massive irregularities' in container handling at Chittagong Container Terminal. It took statement from five persons on Thursday, the last day of primary investigation. "Investigation in Chittagong is complete for the time being. We came hear targeting 10 to 12 persons for questioning. But finally, we took statement from 30," ACC deputy director Sheikh Fanah Fillah, the probe committee chief, on Thursday noon told bdnews24.com. He said they seized 21 files, 17 of them related to CCT tender. "Still we are at the primary level of investigation. However, we are satisfied with what we have got," Fillah said. The parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry accused Matin for irregularities in appointing director in Chittagong Container Terminal. Later, the standing committee unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found "massive irregularities" done by Matin and eight others on the last day of his office on Jan 6 when the new government was taking oath. The ACC started investigation after getting documents from shipping ministry. A three-member committee headed by Fillah launched investigation on Tuesday into 'massive irregularities' in the container management deal and 'corruption' in raising the service age of "pilots" at Chittagong port. The committee took statement from the port chairman commodore R U Ahmed on Tuesday and from Matin on Wednesday. They also questioned Matin and the port chairman after bringing them face-to-face. However, Matin refused his involvement with the irregularities in awarding container handling contract to Ishaq Brothers. The probe committee chief also said the defendants, currently staying in Chittagong, might be summoned in Dhaka, if needed. "One official of Saif Power Tech didn't appear before the committee. He was summoned in Dhaka," Fillah added. Saif Power Tech was appointed in June, 2006 to handle CCT. In the end of that contract in 2008, tender was floated to appoint new contractor in November. Tender was called again in December after cancelling the first. Ishaq Brothers had quoted the lowest price, Tk 340 per container handling. The ministry approved the work order after accepting lowest bidder. The CPA authority signed agreement with Ishaq Brothers on Feb 2, 2009. The parliamentary standing committee has found irregularities in the contract. Fillah said the shipping ministry officials who are linked with the tender would be questioned in the later part of the investigation. The probe committee will also question those organisations who took part in the tender. Asked whether Matin would be questioned again, the ACC officials said, "We don't need to ask him any more." Some persons who were questioned but could not give instant answer would be called later, Fillah added. The parliamentary committee claimed that after the election, the caretaker government had signed the contract with Ishaq Brothers in a hurry on the eve of its departure. Fillah said to bdnews24.com, "The focus of the investigation is why the contract was signed so quickly." The other members of the probe committee are Jahid Hossain, assistant director at ACC's Dhaka office and Abdul Awal, inspector at Chittagong office. bdnews24
