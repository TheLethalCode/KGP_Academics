 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com)  A committee has been formed, headed by the prime minister's political, social and education affairs adviser, to make a set of policies about enlisting for monthly pay order (MPO). Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said this replying to a question of Laxmipur-2 MP Md Abul Khayer during the question-answer period of the Sunday session of parliament. Earlier, Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta said that he is unable to go to his area because the educational institutes are yet to be enlisted for MPO. "I think it is not right that an educational institute was not enlisted for MPO for 20/25 years," said Nahid. No educational institution was enlisted for MPO during the two years of the caretaker government and three years of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government. Around 6,000 educational institutes were not enlisted, he said. "Most educational institutions can be enlisted if there is Tk 600 crore. We have been given Tk 120 crore," he said. A list is being prepared for undeserving educational institutes enlisted because of favouritism and action against them will follow soon, he said replying to a question. The government has made female education is free up to secondary level in all schools. If any institution takes money from the female students then action will be taken on specific allegations, he said replying to a question of AKM Rahmatullah. Nahid said his ministry has complete e-mail and internet connectivity. "So, there is no obstacle to send information to the ministry to improve the quality of the educational institutions." bdnews24.com/s
