 ROME, Oct 2(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict urged Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday to guarantee protection of minority Christians, who have been the target of violence in the overwhelmingly Islamic country.

The death penalty for blasphemy was introduced in the 1980s by then military ruler, General Zia-ul-Haq. Later governments tried to amend the law but had to drop their plans because of opposition from Islamic groups. The Vatican, the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Archbishop of Canterbury have urged Pakistan to review the law, which the government has promised to do.
