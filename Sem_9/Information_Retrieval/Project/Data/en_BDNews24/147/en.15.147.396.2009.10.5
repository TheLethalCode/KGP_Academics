 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Stock Exchange has delisted about 50 companies from the main board in a bid to include them in the over-the-counter (OTC) market almost a month into its launch. The premier bourse on Sunday delisted 51 'Z' category issues and asked the companies to get listed on the OTC trading floor. "The decision came in line with the regulator's (Securities and Exchange Commission) directive," Satipati Moitro, acting chief executive of DSE, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The SEC on Thursday asked the bourse authority to de-list 'Z' category companies which were suspended or halted and to house them on the OTC market. The DSE launched OTC market on Sep 6 to facilitate trading of non-performing, under-performing and delisted companies. It has been floated as a separate trading station where interested buyers and sellers can quote the prices and the numbers of shares to be traded. A total of 36 companies have been delisted by the premier in 14 years from 1994 to 2007. Of them, 33 companies will be eligible to apply for availing the bourse's OTC facilities as per the SEC directive, according to a DSE official, preferring anonymity. In 2001, the SEC came up with the idea of creating an OTC market by introducing a regulation then. In 2004, the Chittagong Stock Exchange established an OTC market, although with little success. Officials at the CSE said the initiative failed due to "non-cooperation from delisted companies". "Back then all CSE delisted companies were asked to enlist in the OTC market, but none came forward," A B Siddique, a former CEO of the bourse at the port city, told bdnews24.com earlier.
