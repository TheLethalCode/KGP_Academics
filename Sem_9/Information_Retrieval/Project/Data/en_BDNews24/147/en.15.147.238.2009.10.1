 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA) on Wednesday acknowledged the services to cricket of some of the all-time greats of the game with five new inductees to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, reports PTI. Herbert Sutcliffe, Clarrie Grimmett, Victor Trumper, Wasim Akram and Steve Waugh were inducted into the Hall of Fame, bringing the total number of players in that exclusive club to 60. Upon hearing the news, Steve Waugh said: "It is a great honour to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame and to see my name feature alongside such greats of the game, including the likes of Don Bradman. "To be named in the new five inductions this year alongside fellow Australians Victor Trumper and Clarrie Grimmett is something I wouldn't have imagined for myself when I first started playing for Australia. "I'm extremely grateful to know I was voted in by the current living members of the Hall of Fame and to see myself alongside the likes of so many other cricketing heroes is something I am very proud of." Wasim Akram said: "This honour is the perfect icing on the cake of a decent career. It is a great feeling to know your contribution and achievements in this fascinating sport are being acknowledged in such a way. "When I started playing cricket, it was my dream to play with stalwarts like Imran Khan and Javed Miandad. "And now, to be put in the same group, which also includes legends who were inspirational and role models for every cricketer, is extremely special. "Matches against India have always been the most memorable ones for me, especially our victory at Chennai in 1999 where more than 40,000 spectators gave us a standing ovation. Also the victory at Melbourne in the 1992 World Cup in front of 88,000 spectators and the reception we received upon our return is something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. "I am delighted and honoured to have represented my country for 18 years. I thank all my mentors, family members, fans and team-mates for helping me to join the galaxy of real superstars in this ICC Cricket Hall of Fame." Herbert Sutciffe's son, John, said: "My dad would have loved this award and reveled in it. He was a great player who had a Test average up there with the very best members of the Hall of Fame. There's no doubt he would have been delighted with this honour." Clarrie Grimmett's son, Vic, said: "I'm tickled pink! It was a brilliant surprise to receive this news. Dad was quite shy and reserved, but he was a lovely man who would have been delighted with this award. This is very special." Speaking about his grandfather, Victor Trumper III said: "I read everything about my grandfather in his memorabilia. He achieved some great things in his personal and cricket life.
