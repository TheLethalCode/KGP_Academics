 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)Small farmers can make large profits by farming organic shrimps, an expert said a workshop on Thursday. George Chamberlain, chairman of Global Aquaculture Alliance, said Bangladesh has huge scopes of farming shrimps in organic process because of its favourable environmental state. "This type of shrimp is costly and profit is also high," Chamberlain told reporters at the closing ceremony of the workshop titled 'Shrimp Export from Bangladesh: Potentials and Challenges' at Hotel Sheraton. Farming of organic shrimps is already being done in some places of Bangladesh, he added. "It gives many advantages, like the disease rate is low. These are sold at high price in the global market." The small farmers could easily sell those to the big traders, specially the exporters, Chamberlain added. He said organic shrimps can be produced without using any chemical ingredients and thus the shrimps are safe from harmful elements for the human body. Fisheries minister Abdul Latif Biswas said shrimp export will be resumed to the EU countries after the end of stipulated timeframe. Bangladesh imposed a ban on shrimp exports to the European Union on May 15 for six months after initiatives to eliminate contamination of frozen goods by nitrofuran, a toxic antibiotic, began to take hold. Between 2005 and June 2009, sixty consignments of frozen shrimp from Bangladesh were rejected by the EU due to nitrofuran contamination. "The government had taken necessary steps to address the menace," Biswas said. He added that nitrofuran was found in imported bone meat meal and feed meal. "We've taken strict measures against it." A national working committee to address the problems in the shrimp industry has been formed with relevant government and non-government organisations, international development agencies and export-related people and agencies as its members. The committee has drawn a national action plan to hold a number of meetings, seminars and workshops, the implementation of which is underway. Under the action plan, while importing feeds for animals and fish, provision for providing certificate guaranteeing the fish and animal feeds to be nitrofuran-free has been made mandatory. The minister said, "Exporters are ready now to resume trade once the ban is withdrawn." The country exported frozen foods worth $454.43 million in 2008-09, mostly shrimp, which was 20.83 percent less than the target and 14.89 percent less than the previous fiscal year's. The workshop was co- organised by Fishery Products Business Promotion Council, Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association and Market Development Forum. bd
