 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)--A group of public university teachers have invited the government to an open public dialogue on the gas and coal export policies that have touched off debates and protests in recent times. Professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury at a news conference at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh on Friday said that ten people, five agreeing with the government's explanation and five others who differ, can take part in the dialogue. He presented a set of recommendations from the 'Teachers of the public universities'. "Since neither the people nor the government wants to export the reserve gas and coal of the country, a transparent and reasonable solution is needed to the difference of opinion about the explanation of the agreement," he said. From their side, he announced the names of justice Golam Rabbani, professor Mohammed Nurul Islam, professor Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, professor M M Akash and professor M Shamsul Alam. The government in August approved the proposal to award US-based ConocoPhilips and Irish Tullow Oil plc contracts to explore oil and gas in three blocks in the Bay. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. A left-leaning National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources, Power and Ports has been demanding cancellation of Model PSC 2008 formulated during the immediate past caretaker government. They hold that the government has leased out the blocks on terms of 80 percent gas which will facilitate to lease out 100 percent gas. State-owned exploration authority Petrobangla chairman Moktadir Ali said on Thursday that ConcoPhilips is expected to sign deal in the first week and Tullow in the second week of the current month. "Observing the situation it seems that the role of the government is vague. How much effective is the condition for permitting the companies to export 80 percent of gas liquefied has not been analysed," he said. Dhaka University professor Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury highlighted a set of recommendations on the energy security of the country, where calls were made to make a law that bars exporting gas or coal before ensuring energy for 50 years. The teachers called for putting in place a long-term energy policy. "We need a long-term energy policy to utilise our limited resources. We cannot export coal and gas to secure the energy needs of others leaving ourselves volnueable," he said. He also urged to government to take initiatives to determine the maritime boundaries of the country. Foreign secretary Mijarul Quayes admitted on Thursday that Bangladesh was at odds with India and Myanmar over maritime boundary of the three blocks earmarked for oil and gas exploration in the deep Bay. "India has claimed that two blocks, 5 and 10, have overlapped their maritime boundary while Myanmar made the same claim about block 11," he said. Forty-six teachers from Dhaka University, Jahangirnagar University, Rajshahi University, Chittagong University, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology are involved with the initiative, said professor Akash. b
