 HANOI, Oct 7(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Vietnamese court sentenced a secondary school physics teacher on Wednesday to three years in prison followed by three years of probation for hanging a banner on a bridge calling for multi-party democracy. Vu Hung, who turns 43 on Saturday, was among nine people linked to banned pro-democracy group Bloc 8406 whose arrests last year and lengthy pre-trial detentions have been criticised by human rights groups.

The overseas opposition group Viet Tan said Tran Duc Thach, a poet based in Nghe An province and detained in connection with the others, was found guilty under Article 88 and sentenced on Tuesday to three years in prison and three years of probation. The trials were originally scheduled to take place two weeks ago but were postponed. The government did not say why. But observers have speculated that the dates were shifted to avoid coinciding with President Nguyen Minh Triet's visit to the United States for a United Nations session. Amnesty International said Hung was among 14 people arrested for demonstrating against China when the Olympic torch relay passed through Ho Chi Minh City in April 2008.
