 Dhaka, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)Awami League's Abdul Jalil, who has come under fire for his recent controversial comment about his own party's win in the Dec 29 polls, returned home from London Tuesday to find he had been ousted from the chair of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce. The former Awami League general secretary, shunning the media on his return, landed at Zia International Airport at 9pm, an airport official told bdnews24.com. Along with family members, Jalil went directly to his Gulshan home. Just hours before, in parliament, chief whip Abdus Shahid had proposed restructuring of the standing committee on commerce, which the House passed by voice vote. Awami League MP Lutful Hye replaced Jalil as the chairman. Jalil, a former commerce minister, was reduced to being a member of a different parliamentary bodythe Petition Committee headed by speaker Abdul Hamid. The veteran AL leader, replaced as general secretary earlier this year and already sidelined within the party for previous public "outbursts", became embroiled in controversy again after going to London last month for medical treatment. His comments, made to media while there, created a political storm back home. One of the allegations that he voiced in London was that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam in a reaction called him "mentally unbalanced". Others dismissed his comments as "rantings", while the opposition BNP had a field day with the allegation that echoed their own previously stated stance. Jalil also told media in London that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to retain his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. He went to Singapore last year after falling seriously ill during his detention by the caretaker government. He has alleged that he was tortured in custody. Since then, he has made various criticisms of his party and party chief Hasina, alongside allegations against the past caretaker government, culminating in the most recent controversy. Jalil later apologised, from London, for the allegation against his party saying such a comment came from his grievance against intelligence agency DGFI that tortured him during his period of incarceration. He also claimed his comments were 'misinterpreted'. The Awami League's central committee discussed Jalil's statement on Oct 3, but took no action against him. Restructured committees Three parliamentary committees were restructured on Tuesday. Among them were the Petition Committee, whose other members are: Mujibul Haq, Ruhul Amin Hawlader, M Amanullah, Mozammel Hossain, Kamal Ahmed Majumder, Shahiduzzaman Sarker, Habibur Rahman Mollah and Nazrul Rahman Manju. The other members of the newly structured commerce committee are: the commerce minister (ex-officio), Nurul Islam, Tipu Munshi, Abdul Latif, Sheikh Afil Uddin, Jainal Abedin, Abul Khashem, Rumana Mahmud and Tohura Ali. The House also restructured the parliamentary standing committee on finance, keeping the present chief A H M Mustafa Kamal as its chairman. The other members of the committee are: the finance minister (ex officio), M K Anwar, Ali Ashraf, A K M Mayeedul Islam, Matiur Rahman, Tajul Islam, Golam Dastagir Gazi, M A Mannan and Begum Farida Rahman. bdnews24.com/
