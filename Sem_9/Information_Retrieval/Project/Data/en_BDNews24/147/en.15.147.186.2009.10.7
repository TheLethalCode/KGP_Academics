 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Japanese ambassador gave his country's assurance to the food minister on Tuesday of completing construction of new silos at Mongla Port and Shantahar as soon as possible, in face of the Bangladesh government's food storage crisis. Shino Tsuka, newly appointed Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh, in ameeting with food minister Abdur Razzaque, also said his government would provide further assistance to Bangladesh in the construction of more food storage facilities. Razzaque told the ambassador that Japan is one of the most supportive countries in aiding Bangladesh's development. Currently Bangladesh is unable to procure sufficient food stocks due to the low capacity of government food storage facilities, although the country is meeting adequate food production targets. The minister said Japan was helping greatly with the construction of food storage and disaster management. Razzaque said a Japanese technical team has already selected site to construct a rice-storage silo at Shantahar. He said the government is looking to construct more new silos. Facilities for storing 110,000 tonnes are planned in the northern region of the country. Japan has also promised to help with this project. The minister also said a private Japanese firm has proposed to construct four water processing plants capable of removing salt in Aila-affected areas free of cost. "Bangladesh, like all other countries, is facing more natural calamities due to climate changes," said Razzaque. "Huge damage occurred to coastal areas due to the effects of cyclone Aila that followed Sidr." "The government has planned to secure the lives and property of the people there, by raising and strengthening coastal barriers, constructing sufficient numbers of cyclone shelters, protection for domestic animals and building the homes of the cyclone-affected on stronger foundations," said the minister. The new Japanese ambassador said, "Like Bangladesh, Japan has to face a lot of natural calamities. Especially typhoons that hit Japan with great force regularly. Japan is aware of the damages caused by cyclones." He also said his government is thinking of helping with long-term and permanent solutions for protection of Bangladesh's coastal areas. b
