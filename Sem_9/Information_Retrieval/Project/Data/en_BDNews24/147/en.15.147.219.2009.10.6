 CENTURION, South Africa, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--Shane Watson struck another commanding century to lead holders Australia to a six-wicket win over New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final on Monday. Australia restricted New Zealand to 200 for nine before reaching 206 for four in 45.2 overs. It was not all plain sailing for Australia, however, as New Zealand fast bowlers Kyle Mills and Shane Bond claimed a wicket each in the first three overs to leave the defending champions reeling on six for two.
