 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)--Two alleged extremists were killed on Saturday in separate shootouts in Khulna and Chuadanga, police said. The extremists were identified as Abdur Rashid alias Mollah Rashid, 40, a leader of Purba Banglar Communist Party [ML-Janajuddha] in Chuadanga Sadar Upazila, and Abu Sayeed Sarder alias Ranga Sayeed, 45, a leader of the banned New Biplobi Communist Party 'red flag', in Khulna. They are the latest casualties in the ongoing crackdown on outlawed extremists in the country's south and south-western districts. Rashid is the son of Faizuddin Mollah of village Alokdia in Chuadanga Sadar Upazila. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Chuadanga Sadar police chief Ahsan Habib said they raided a brick kiln of Bujruk Garari in Chudanga Sadar Upazila at 3:45am on a tip-off that a group of extremists were holding a meeting there. The extremists opened fore the police who retaliated and a 20-25-minute gunfight ensued, he said. The extremists eventually retreated and the police recovered the body of Rashid lying there along with a shutter gun and three round of bullets, Habib said. Rashid faced a dozen of cases, one for killing journalist Bazlur Rahman. Charges were pressed in court against him in three cases, the police officer also mentioned. Khulna 'shootout' The incident took place at around 1:30am at Aamvita village of Rangpur union under Dumuria upazila. Sayeed was a resident of Mothbaria and son of Abdur Rahman Sarder. Superintendent of police of Khulna Mohammad Shamsuddin told bdnews24.com, tipped-off that a gang of terrorists had assembled for a secret meeting at Aamvita High School ground, a special team of police raided the spot. "The miscreants opened fire on the police and the law-enforcers retaliated, ensuing a gun battle," Shamsuddin said. Sayeed was found shot after the gun battle, while his accomplices fled the scene after a while, the SP added. He was taken to Dumuria health complex, where the duty doctor declared him dead. Police retrieved a shotgun and three round bullets from the spot. He faced one murder, one extortion, and one explosives case while many complaints were filed against him with the police, Shamsuddin added. State minister for home Shamsul Islam Tuku said the militants have been asked to surrender or the drive against them would be intensified further. Human-rights organisations have been urging the government to stop such 'extra judicial killings'. A total of 97 people died in "shootouts" and in custody of law-enforcing agencies until Sep 30 from Jan 1 this year, said independent human-rights watchdog Odhikar said last Thursday. Home minister Sahara Khatun, however, claimed that no extra-judicial killings were being committed by the law- enforcers. bdnews2
