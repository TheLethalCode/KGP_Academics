<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court is likely to hear on Tuesday a petition to re-investigate a case on charges of the murder attempt of late writer Humayun Azad. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Ehsanul Haque set midday for hearing after Azad's brother Manjur Kabir filed the petition. Ayet Ali Patwari will argue for Azad. The petitioner said the investigation officer had not identified the real criminals accused in the case. "The real criminals have not been identified," it said. Humayun Azad had said that after the publication of his book titled 'Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad' he had received many threats. The late professor of Bangla department of Dhaka University came under attack in front of Bangla Academy while he was on his way back from 'Ekushey Boi Mela' at Bangla Academy on Feb 27, 2004. After he recovered, he was sent to Germany where the writer died on the night of Aug 11, 2004, the day he reached Germany, the petitioner added. Kabir had filed two cases against unknown people with Ramna Police Station the day after he was attacked by criminals. On Nov 14, 2007, Criminal Investigation Department's inspector Kazi Abdul Malek pressed charges accusing Jamatul Mujahedin Bangladesh kingpin Shaikh Abdur Rahman, top leaders Ataur Rahman Sunny, Noor Mohammad Sabu aka Shamim, Minhaj aka Shafiq aka Shaon aka Hamim and Anwar Alam aka Khoka aka Bhagne Shahid. The IO later appealed for dropping Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Sunny off the chargesheet as they were already executed on a court verdict in another case. Of the remaining three, police only arrested Minhaj. The case is currently in the process of cross-examining the witnesses. bdne
