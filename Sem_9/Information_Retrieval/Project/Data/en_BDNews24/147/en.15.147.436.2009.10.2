 LONDON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been fined 25,000 pounds ($39,850) and given a suspended two-match ban for his goal celebration in the 4-2 win over his former club Arsenal, the FA said on Thursday. The Togo international, who joined City from Arsenal in July for a fee of around 25 million pounds, ran the length of the pitch to celebrate in front of Arsenal fans during the Premier League last month. He later admitted a charge of improper conduct. "In reaching its decision the Commission took into account his admission of the charge, public apology and the extremely provocative nature of the abuse he received," the FA said. "However, the Commission also stated that players have a responsibility to conduct themselves in a proper manner and that such celebrations are unacceptable and have the potential to cause a serious public order incident." A steward was injured as crowd trouble broke out following Adebayor's action. Adebayor received a three-match ban for a separate incident during the same match in which he was charged with maliciously stamping on Arsenal striker Robin van Persie. His two-match ban is suspended until December 2010 and will be activated in the event of a similar breach of FA rules. He is eligible to return to action in City's Premier League match against Aston Villa on Mo
