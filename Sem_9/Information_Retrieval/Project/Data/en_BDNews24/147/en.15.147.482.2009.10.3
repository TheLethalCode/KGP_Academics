 LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one golfer Greg Norman and tennis great Chris Evert announced on Friday they had separated, just 15 months after they were married in the Bahamas. The high-profile couple, who were prominent spectators at the US Open tennis tournament in New York last month, did not say whether they were planning to divorce. "We will remain friends and supportive of one another's family," the two 54-year-olds said in a short statement. Bart Collins, Norman's long-time manager and friend, told Reuters the double British Open champion would issue no further comment. The couple have requested privacy for one another, and also for their respective families. Friday's announcement came four days before Australian Norman holds a news conference at Harding Park Golf Course in San Francisco where he will captain the International team against the US at the biennial Presidents Cup. The absence there of American Evert would have been a conspicuous one as traditionally the wives of Cup captains have played a visible role in the four-day team competition. Norman and Evert were married at the One & Only Ocean Club resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas in June 2008 in a seaside ceremony held under a veil of tight security. DAZZLING DISPLAY One month later, the 53-year-old Norman dazzled the golf world by challenging for the British Open at Royal Birkdale where he held a two-shot lead going into the final round before tying for third.

Now, really, golf is second and everything else is first as far as I'm concerned. "And it's a great feeling," added Norman, who clinched the British Open in 1986 and 1993. Evert, who won 18 Grand Slam singles titles in a glittering career, divorced her second husband Andy Mill, a World Cup and Olympic skier from Colorado, in December 2006 after 18 years of marriage. She was previously married for eight years to British tennis player John Lloyd and changed her surname to Evert-Lloyd. Norman reached a divorce settlement with his wife of 26 years, Laura Andrassy, in September
