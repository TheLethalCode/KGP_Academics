 Dhaka, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com)The parliament will resume its adjourned third session at 4pm on Sunday, with the main opposition almost sure to continue to boycott the proceedings. The House is likely to pass few crucial bills, mostly related to local government, when it returns to business, parliament secretariat officials said. The session, which began on Sep 7, was adjourned on Sep 15 ahead of the Eid-ul-Fitr and the Durga Puja. A senior BNP leader, secretary general Khandker Delwar Hosssain, commented Friday, two days before the scheduled resumption, that "a suitable environment" for his party's return to parliament had yet to be created. If the BNP MPs stay away from the session on Sunday, they would be absent for 33 consecutive sittings. The BNP joined the 9th parliament's first session on Jan 25 and walked out of the House on Jan 28the second working day of the first sessionalleging unfairness in allocating House seats for its MPs, then just 27. BNP now has a 30-strong parliamentary party, after by-election returns. Parliament officials said bills such as the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act and City Corporation Act would be up for disposal. bdnews
