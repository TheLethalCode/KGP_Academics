 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has extended the deadline for updating voter lists in the six city corporations by five days, an election commissioner said on Monday. The voter list updating began on Sept 29 and the deadline was Monday. "We have decided to extend the deadline till Oct 10," Muhammed Sohul Hussain told reporters after a meeting at the EC Secretariat. "We heard from many places that the data collectors have not been to all homes to gather required information," he said. Those having reached voting age since last year are to be newly included in the lists and voters who died to be dropped in the updating process. The EC estimates that the updating process might raise the number of voters by four to five percent this time. "Action will be taken against officials who neglect their duty in collecting new information," Hussain said, adding investigation teams headed by deputy secretary level officials will be formed in this regard. There will be at least four investigation teams in each city corporation, he said. "The teams will visit areas unannounced and monitor whether data has been properly collected. If they find any report of negligence, action will be taken against the concerned data gatherers," the commissioner said. After the information collection is over, photographing new voters will start in voter registration centres from Oct 12 that will continue through Nov 10. The formulation of voter listing in Dhaka City Corporation started on Dec 1, 2007. Over 3.5 million people were registered as voters before the national elections. As per the existing list there are 3,582,876 voters in Dhaka city, 258,659 in Rajshahi, 400,359 in Khulna, 179,324 in Barisal, 256,000 in Sylhet and 1,573,882 in Chittagong. As many as 4,749 people have been appointed to collect information and 1,016 as supervisors for the updating the lists of the six city corporations. The countrywide updating of voter lists started in June. The updating of voter lists of six corporations was the last phase of the process. A total of 8.10 crore (81 million) voters were enrolled in the countrywide voter lists, with photographs for the first time, ahead of the national elections in December 2008. bdnews
