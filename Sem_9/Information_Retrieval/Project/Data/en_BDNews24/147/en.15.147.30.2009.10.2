 LONDON, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police said on Friday a man has been charged with burglary and robbery at the Merseyside home of England and Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard. Gerrard's wife, Alex Curran, was confronted by a gang of men on December 11, 2007 at the couple's mansion in Formby, while her husband was playing in Liverpool's Champions League tie away to French club Olympique Marseille. Curran was not injured in the raid which saw the masked offenders make off with items of jewellery. Martin Wilson, 22, will appear at North Sefton Magistrates Court on October 30. The raid on the Liverpool midfielder and captain's home is one in a series of burglaries at footballers' properties while they have been in action for club or country in recent years.

"Since Shoaib has not played for a while for Pakistan we can't cover his medical treatment." Shoaib has played a handful of Tests and one-day matches in the last two and half years due to fitness and disciplinary issues. Shoaib, who has taken 178 Test and 223 one-day international wickets, was hoping to play some domestic cricket in a bid to convince the selectors he was ready for a return to the national team.
