 Dhaka, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com)--Police on Friday filed two murder cases over the deaths of two BDR members in first such cases since the Feb 25-26 mutiny by the border guards. Officer in charge of New Market Police Station Kamrul Islam said the cases had been filed with his station, accusing unnamed people of the murders. The first case involved the unnatural death of lance naik Mobarak Hossain on Mar 22 and the second of havildar Mohiuddin on May 6. Doctors declared that Hossain and Mohiuddin were brought dead at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital after they had fallen ill in the BDR Headquarters in Peelkhana, according to the cases. Hossain had been working in Cox's Bazar. He came to Peelkhana on Feb 18 on the occasion of BDR Week. Mohiuddin had been working under 28 Rifles Battalion in Halishahor in Chittagong. On the mutiny days, he was not in Peelkhana. He was arrested in Chittagong and brought to Dhaka on Mar 22. This is the first time that murder charges have been pressed although 48 people have died since the bloody rebellion. The BDR headquarters blamed the deaths on suicide, heart failure and other diseases. According to autopsy reports, they had died from tortures. A sub-inspector at New Market Police Station, Matlabur Rahman, filed the the first case at 7:30pm and the second at 8:30pm. "We, the police, have filed the cases as two BDR members' deaths were stated as killings in the autopsy reports." "So, we, the police being the complaint have filed the cases making the unidentified as accused," Islam said. Speaking to bdnews24.com at 11pm, Atikul Islam, deputy police commissioner at Ramna Police Zone, said, "I asked the officer in charge to take the cases long ago." "The places of occurrences were in Peelkhana Headquarters," he added. A Dhaka court last Thursday ordered police to submit the investigation report on BDR mutiny on Oct 16. A total of 73 people including 57 army officers died in the rebellion. Lalbagh police chief Nobojyoti Khisha filed a case on Feb 28. Later the case was transferred to New Market Police Station considering the site of the crime. Criminal Investigation Department of police remanded 25 border guards for four days on Wednesday for quizzing. The CID also took Mohammed Zakir Hossain, owner of Prince Coaching Programme, which is in front of BDR gate, to a one-day remand for grilling. Until Wednesday, 2,014 BDR members and 27 civilians have been arrested in connection with the case. Among them, 447 have given statements confessing their crimes and nearly 1,900 have been quizzed. Seven months after the massacre at Peelkhana, the government decided last month that mutinous troopers will be tried under the BDR Act. But those charged with killings and looting will be tried under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal, an inter-ministerial meeting decided. The BDR director general would run the trial process of the mutineers outside Dhaka in line with the BDR act by forming courts in those places. The government has decided to change BDR's name, uniform and insignia, among other organisational reforms. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act, 1952 even by notification. bdnew
