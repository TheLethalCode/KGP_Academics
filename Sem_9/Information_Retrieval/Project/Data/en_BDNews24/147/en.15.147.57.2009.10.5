 NAIROBI, Oct 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyans want their coalition government to take concrete action on impunity and political reforms to avoid a repeat of last year's post-election violence, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan said on Sunday. Annan chaired weeks of negotiations last year to end the ethnic violence that killed at least 1,300 people and uprooted 300,000 after opposition leader Raila Odinga disputed President Mwai Kibaki's election win. Kibaki remained president and Odinga became prime minister in the deal to form the coalition government. But they have been dogged by accusations that reforms promised to avoid a repeat of the violence have been delayed -- and those behind the blood-letting are no closer to facing trial.

He said on Sept. 30 he would pursue charges against top suspects behind the violence and make Kenya an example to the world on dealing with impunity. Moreno-Ocampo is due to hold "decisive" talks with top Kenyan officials in the coming weeks. Many Kenyans are also growing frustrated with the government's performance and the lack of progress in prosecuting the big fish. Surveys show the majority would like some suspects to face the ICC. The influential Sunday Nation newspaper said in an editorial it was right that The Hague should take over. Annan steered clear of the debate over how, or where, the suspects should face prosecution. "With a sense of urgency and a national spirit it can be done, and done in a reasonable time. Achieving reforms would also depend on the strong commitment and political will, I repeat political will, of the coalition parties and parliamentarians," he s
