 NEW DELHI, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The air force has sought permission from the government to fire at Maoist guerrillas if they came under attack from the rebels during any operation, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik said on Thursday. The campaign against the Maoists, described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the biggest internal security threat, is led by the police force and the air force helps in evacuation and intelligence sharing at the moment. But the rebels, who have access to rocket launchers and automatic weapons, regularly fire at the air force helicopters to thwart operations. "We have put up to the MOD (Ministry of Defence) to fire back in self defence," Naik said in New Delhi. He however ruled out a direct involvement of the air force in anti-Maoist operations at the moment. "We are equipping our police force and they will continue to fight the Maoists," Naik said on the sidelines of a media conference, adding the air force will play a greater role in providing surveillance and support during troop movement. The rebels have increased attacks on railways, power and telecommunication networks to halt economic development. The Maoist rebellion began four decades ago championing the cause of poor peasants in the east, but has now spread to about 20 of India's 29 states. India's campaign to subdue the rebels has been limited as police are often outnumbered and use outdated weapons against insurgents skilled in jungle warfare and well-equipped with modern weapons.
