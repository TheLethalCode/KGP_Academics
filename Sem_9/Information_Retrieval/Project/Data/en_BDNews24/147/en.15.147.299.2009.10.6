 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The authorities of Chittagong University are accused of "patronising" activists of Islami Chhatra Shibirthe pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student organisationwho continue with politics on the campus despite an ongoing ban. University authorities say they are unable to curb the activities of Shibir, who are taking advantage of "regulatory loopholes". The ban on campus politics was imposed on March 12 and has been maintained for eight months, other student organisations allege, in the interests of Chhatra Shibir. They say that as soon as the campus opened on Oct 3, after the Eid and Puja vacation, Shibir called meetings at six residential halls. The university's administration, on the same day, posted ads in newspapers and hung notices, saying that the ban on all types of political programmes would continue to be in force. Under the circumstances, other student associations on the campus have become vocal against such organisational activities of Shibir with alleged patronage from a section of the university authorities. A Shibir leader on the campus, speaking on condition of anonymity, said their organisation has arranged more than 1,000 meetings, which were "routine organisational activities". But in addition to these, Shibir has drawn up many programmes to induct new students to their organisational fold to consolidate their base in the residential halls. Shibir sources claimed that they have been conducting organisational programmes, "adhering to university regulations". Speaking to bdnews24.com, Abul Mansur Jamshed, president of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Chittagong University chapter, said, "A ban on politics on Chittagong University campus has continued since the time of the last caretaker government. It has deprived us of our democratic rights But Islami Chhatra Shibir is managing to take full advantage of this ban to organise itself." President of Bangladesh Chhatra Union's Chittagong University unit, Taslim Uddin, echoed him and alleged that the university administration was allowing Shibir to consolidate their position on the campus. "We are students of the university, but we have to arrange a press conference 22 kilometres away from the campus," he complained, condemning the university authorities "stance". Chittagong University's Bangladesh Chhatra Front president also alleged that the present university administration, like the one during the past BNP-Jamaat government, has been patronising Shibir elements to help them organise politically. He termed the gradual extension of the ban on campus politics "a reflection of Shibir's will". Speaking to bdnews24.com, Alauddin Ahmed, pro-vice chancellor at the university rejected the allegations against the university's administration, but hinted Shibir were too powerful to move against. "Chhatra Shibir has been running their activities taking advantage of regulatory loopholes and we are aware of the situation." "But they are very calculating. They are taking the advantage of the administration's good will through the loopholes, which have stood as a shelter for them." 'We cannot take any step against them without any specific allegation. But the vice chancellor has been informed of the issue." He also said, "As in past times, Shibir is still fully controlling the campus. There is no organisation here to face up to them." Asked about protecting the political rights of other student bodies, he said "We don't want to stop student politics. The organisations are always engaged in infighting. So the atmosphere for education is polluted." "We will consider lifting the ban on campus politics if they, the student bodies, promise to work in the interest of ordinary students." bdnews
