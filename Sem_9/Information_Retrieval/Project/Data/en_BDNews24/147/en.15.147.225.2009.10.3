 CENTURION, South Africa, Oct 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unbeaten centuries by captain Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson led holders Australia to a crushing nine-wicket win over England in Friday's Champions Trophy semi-final. Australia now meet the winners of Saturday's match between New Zealand and Pakistan in Monday's final at Centurion. Ponting scored 111, passing 12,000 one-day international runs in the process, and Watson made 136 as Australia hit 258 for one in 41.5 overs.

England were in desperate trouble after winning the toss and choosing to bat first, slumping to 101 for six. However, Bresnan and Wright stuck together for nearly 20 overs as they shared the best seventh-wicket stand for England against Australia. Bresnan scored his maiden ODI half-century, hitting 80 in 76 balls before being bowled by Brett Lee, while Wright was caught behind by Paine off Peter Siddle. Paine finished with five catches. Siddle took three for 55, fellow paceman Lee claimed two for 46 and man of the match Watson chipped in with two fo
