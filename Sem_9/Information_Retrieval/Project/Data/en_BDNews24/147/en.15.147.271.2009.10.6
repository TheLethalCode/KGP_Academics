 Dhaka, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)Awami League's Abdul Jalil, who came under fire for his recent controversial comment about his party's win in the Dec 29 polls, has been ousted from the chair of the parliamentary standing committee on the commerce ministry. Jalil, a former commerce minister and erstwhile Awami League general secretary, was reduced to a member of a different parliamentary bodythe Petition Committee headed by speaker Abdul Hamid. Chief whip Abdus Shahid on Tuesday proposed the restructure of the standing committee on commerce, which and the House passed by voice vote. Awami League MP Lutful Hye has replaced Jalil as the chairman. Jalil, who was branded by many Awami League leaders as "mentally unwell" for his recent "ranting", is now on his way to Bangladesh from London, where he alleged in media interviews that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. He also told media in London that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to keep his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. Jalil went to Singapore for his treatment as he fell seriously ill during his detention by the caretaker government. He alleged he had been tortured at the time. He since made various criticisms of his party and party chief Hasina, alongside allegations against the past caretaker government, culminating in the most recent controversial statement. He later said "sorry" for his statement. The Awami League's central committee discussed Jalil's statement on Oct 3, but took no action against him. Restructured committees Other members of the Petition Committee are: Mujibul Haq, Ruhul Amin Hawlader, M Amanullah, Mozammel Hossain, Kamal Ahmed Majumder, Shahiduzzaman Sarker, Habibur Rahman Mollah and Nazrul Rahman Manju.
