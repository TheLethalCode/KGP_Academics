<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday began hearing the two petitions to quash the Zia Orphanage Trust case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir and Mohammad Roisuddin will continue hearing the petitions on Thursday. Barrister Rafique Ul Haque argued for the defendants, and attorney general Mahbubey Alam for the prosecution. A High Court vacation bench rejected the petitions on Sep 24. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against BNP chairperson Khaleda, Tarique and four others on Aug 5, accusing them of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon lodged the petitions on behalf of Khaleda and Tarique on Sep 15 with the vacation bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Mohammad Rezaul Hassan. Haque told the court on Sep 16 that the Trust was a private-owned organisation and the ACC cannot interfere with its activities. He said the defendants were not guilty of any corruption and the case should be quashed. Alam had said the merit of the case was to be decided by a court and the petitions were 'worthless' in this situation. The petitions claim ACC deputy director Harun-or-Rashid had filed the cases and pressed charges without the proper approval of the commission. Moreover, the petitions pointed out, charges were submitted 392 days after the cases were filed. The ACC rules require charges pressed within 60 days of the filing of the case. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MPs Kazi Salimul Haque and Sharfuddin Ahmed, former principal secretary at the prime minister's office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui and Khaleda's nephew Mominur Rahman. Charges were later dropped against two other accused, Syed Ahmed and Giasuddin Ahmed. The court of Dhaka metropolitan special judge A N M Bashirullah on Sep 7 set Oct 25 to frame charges against five other defendants. It issued arrest warrants against defendants Mominur Rahman, nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary Kamal Uddin Siddiqui who did not appear in court. The Supreme Court on Aug 2 upheld the previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. Tarique is out on bail to receive medical treatment in the UK. bd
