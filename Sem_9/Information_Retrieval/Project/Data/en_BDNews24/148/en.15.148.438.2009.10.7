 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)The government has set the import target for fertiliser for the current fiscal year at 1.65 million tons, the industry minister said on Wednesday. Dilip Barua told a press briefing at the ministry that the agriculture ministry has put the total demand for Urea fertiliser at 2.95 million tons. "Total demand for TSP is estimated at 0.67 million ton while for DAP it is 0.26 million." He added that state-owned Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation would supply the whole amount of Urea and part of the TSP and DAP fertilisers. "The rest of non-Urea fertilsers would be imported by Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation and private importers." Barua said that the government is set to Urea that from Karnaphuli Fertliser company (KAFCO) and through state-to-state procurement and international tender. "Urea bought from KAFCO is considered to be an import according to the agreement between the government and the entity because the government has to pay in foreign currency." In case of state-to-state procurement, the government would buy Urea from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, he added. Touching on fertiliser distribution measures, Barua said an inter-ministerial committee has been formed to coordinate transportation from ports to warehouses. "We have also taken measures for strict border vigilances to prevent smuggling."
