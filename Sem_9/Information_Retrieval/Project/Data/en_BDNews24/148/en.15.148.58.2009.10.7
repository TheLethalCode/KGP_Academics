 JOHANNESBURG, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the groupings on Wednesday for the 2011 one-day World Cup to be staged on the sub-continent. Australia, seeking their fourth title in a row, are in Group A for the 14-team event, to be jointly hosted by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, an ICC statement said on Wednesday. Australia have been grouped with local rivals New Zealand, who they defeated by six wickets on Monday to retain the Champions Trophy in South Africa. Twenty20 champions Pakistan, stripped of co-hosting rights due to security concerns in the country, are also in Group A and will not face rivals India in the preliminary round. South Africa, seeking their first World Cup win, are in Group B with former winners West Indies and India besides England and Bangladesh. "We did not want more than two sub-continental teams in a group, but the rest is based on the rankings," ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat told a news conference after the groups were approved by its executive board. "The principal reason is that the tournament will be held on the sub-continent and it doesn't make sense to load one group. We wanted to get an appropriate balance." India will host 29 of the tournament's 49 matches, including a semi-final and the final. Sri Lanka will stage the other semi. According to the provisional schedule, Bangladesh is due to stage the opening ceremony on Feb 18 and the opening game the next day, as well as two quarter-finals. India will stage matches in eight venues, Sri Lanka has 12 matches at three venues and Bangladesh eight at two. South Asia previously hosted World Cups in 1987 and 1996. Groups: Group A: Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Canada, Kenya Group B: India, South Africa, England, West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland, Netherl
