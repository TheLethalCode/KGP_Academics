 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)--President Zillur Rahman on Wednesday asked people not to use religions for personal and political ends. "Bangladesh has a history of a thousand years of inter-religion harmony," he said, speaking at a three-day-dialogue on inter-religion and culture at the University of Dhaka. "So, bigotry and inter-religious enmity will have no place in this country." The president said many vested interest groups had used religions as a means to fulfil their own interests in many countries and in many ages and that has been continuing until now." "Yet every religion discourages hatred, enmity and clash, teaches people to love each other and talk about harmony." It is because most people are influenced by wrong ideas about their religions. Professor A A M S Arefin Siddique, vice chancellor of the university, presided over the opening ceremony. Prof Nurul Islam, director at Inter-Religious and Inter-Cultural Centre, said a total of 25 representatives participated in the dialogue from New Zealand, Malaysia, Australia, China, Singapore, the United States of America, India, Germany, Sweden and Japan. Two papers would be presented on Thursday and one on Friday at the dialogue, Islam said. All delegates would visit some religiously and culturally significant sites, he also said. Dr Deepali Bhanot, a professor at Delhi University, presented the first article at the second session of the dialogue on Tuesday. State minister for religion Shahjahan Miah also spoke at the dialogue. Dr Abbas Sadri, director of Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, and education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, among others, spoke. An exhibition on varied religious beliefs has also been going on at the corridor of Senate Bhaban. Prof Azizunnahar Islam, a member to the hosting committee, said a German institution organisation supplied the exhibits. bdne
