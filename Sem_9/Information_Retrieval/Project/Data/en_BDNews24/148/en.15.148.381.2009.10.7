 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has said investment for agriculture and food security should be the priority under climate change funding mechanism in Bangladesh. She made the comment at a workshop on Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture and Food Security at CIRDAP auditorium in Dhaka on Wednesday. Food minister Abdur Razzaque highlighted the achievements of Bangladesh in disaster risk reduction and the strategy and action plan on food security. The workshop also aimed at supplementing Bangladesh's position and country paper in the upcoming World Summit on Food Security (WSFS) in Rome on Nov 16-18, and the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen on Dec 07-18. The workshop was arranged in the context of Bangladesh's position on climate change and the preparation for the World Summit on Food Security in November and the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. Both ministers elaborated on the extended safety net programme to serve the extreme poor. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and myself have long been inviting international support for the south, it is given due attention only recently," Matia said, referring to the vulnerabilities of coastal poor, especially due to increased frequency of natural calamities and salinity intrusion due to climate change. "We attained self-sufficiency in food in our first term; but the progress was not sustained due to causes both natural and man-made," added Matia. "We will do it again as we pledged in the election manifesto and we do not want to miss the train anyway." "Bangladesh can play an important role together with FAO to voice the concerns on and demanding support for agriculture at the Food Security Summit in Rome in November and UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen in December", she said. Ad Spijkers, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation representative in Bangladesh, said: "The despair and darkness on the faces of "Potato Eaters", painted more than a century ago, still stare at with stark similarity on many millions more on a larger canvass." "Our joint efforts here, in Rome and in Copenhagen and beyond", he added, "will hopefully bring lights of hope and prosperity in those faces here and elsewhere in the dusty or rainy rural worlds in the years to come." The FAO representative strongly encouraged continuation of the ongoing endeavours and committed on continued support from FAO to Bangladesh. The main themes of the workshop were the policy, strategy and management interventions in the context of climate change challenges on Bangladesh's agriculture and food security and the global perspective of the matter. The discussion highlighted the vulnerability of Bangladesh and a number of measures were suggested for urgent consideration to fight the impacts of climate change. It was co-organised by the agriculture ministry in collaboration with the FAO and was chaired by agriculture secretary C Q K Mustaq Ahmed.
