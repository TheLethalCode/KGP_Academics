 LONDON, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England are in no danger of allowing their euphoria at regaining the Ashes to obscure the amount of work still ahead of them, captain Andrew Strauss said on Wednesday. Strauss was a member of the England team who were accused of losing their way because they had celebrated too hard and too long after the 2005 Ashes triumph, "There are definitely lessons to be learned.

"If we want to be the best side in the world, which is clearly a long-term goal of ours, then big improvements are required in that respect." England play four Tests, five one-day matches and two Twenty20 internationals on their tour of South Africa starting next month. The Test and one-day squads will be announced on Thursday with Kevin Pietersen likely to be recalled following Achilles surgery which kept him out of the final three Ashes Tests. Infection to the scar tissue then forced him to miss the Champions Trophy. Strauss said he thought Pietersen would have "a fantastic 12 months." "He's one of the greatest players England have ever produced," he
