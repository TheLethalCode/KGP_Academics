 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP secretary-general has said it has no confidence in the Election Commission, saying it is being used as a political pawn by the government as it was by the caretaker government. "The BNP and the people have no confidence in them. The BNP believes it is not possible to hold a fair and neutral election under this commission. They have lost their neutrality," Khandker Delwar Hossain alleged at a press briefing on Wednesday Asked if, then, the main opposition party will run city corporation and municipality elections, he said, "We will decide about the issue later after analysis." Delwar asked the government to stop 'attacks on opposition party leaders and activists' in Narayanganj and elsewhere in the country. He was also critical of the 'Father of the Nation Family Members Security Bill 2009', tabled in parliament on Tuesday for passage, that seeks to ensure special security to the two surviving daughters of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with their children. "Nowhere in the world is there such a special security law. The government which cannot secure the country's people are busy securing themselves." The secretary-general pointed out that tender-terror and land grabbing have increased across the country. "The local government minister also admitted how water bodies in Dhaka are being illegally occupied." He alleged that the government is set to destroy democracy. Delwar accused the government of taking office through tricks and deception and going back on campaign pledges BNP joint secretaries general Abdullah Al Noman, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, among others, were present at the press briefing at the party office in the city's Naya Paltan. b
