 Kushtia, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Two suspected extremists were killed in Kushtia in separate armed encounters with law enforcers on Sunday, police said. The two dead men were Biplob Hossain, 30, a member of the banned extremist outfit Gano Muktifouj, and Marfat Biswas, 34, a regional leader of another banned militant organisation, according to police. District police chief Shahabuddin Khan said information was received of a gang holding a clandestine meeting on the eastern side of the steel bridge of Ailchara village in the sadar upazila. He said police raided the spot at 4am and retaliating against gunfire, found the bullet-hit dead body of Marfat Biswas lying on the ground while his associates escaped. Police also retrieved a shutter-gun, four rounds of ammo and four shells, said Khan. Marfat, a resident of Barho Ailchara, had six cases pending against him on charges of multiple murder and abduction, said Kushtia Sadar police chief Faruque Hossain. In a separate incident near the Eidgah in the housing society area of the town, Biplob Hossain was killed in a gunfight with Kushtia police at around 5:30am, said assistant superintendent of police Alamgir Hossain. He said a joint team of Kushtia Sadar police and Detective Branch police took position at the Eidgah, acting on a tip-off about an extremist group meeting there. When the gang opened fire at them, the law enforcers retaliated, police said. As the 30-minute gun battle ended, the gang fled, leaving Biplob's dead body and an LG with nine rounds of ammo. Biplob, son of Tofazzal Hossain of Kataikhana crossing in Kalishankarpur, had nine cases pending against him including murders, Kushtia police chief Faruque Hossain said. Police sent the two bodies for autopsy. At least 15 people have died in armed encounters with law enforcers in Kushtia since August 1.
