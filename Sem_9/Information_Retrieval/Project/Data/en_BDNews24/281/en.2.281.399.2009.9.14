<TEXT>
 Shariatpur, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)Inter-district bus services to and from Shariatpur were indefinitely suspended on Monday by district transport owners' and workers' associations after a rival organisation with political backing was formed in Noria upazila. "The owners' association has been operating buses out of Shariatpur for a long time, but now an attempt is being made with political backing to run buses from Noria," said Faruq Choukidar, president of Shariatpur Transport Workers Union. Bus owners and workers associations in Shariatpur submitted a joint memorandum to the deputy commissioner on Monday outlining their grievances. Thousands of commuters in the district have been left without transport options, while other forms of public transport in the area have allegedly taken advantage of the situation by hiking their fares up to four times. Housewife 'Rabeya' told bdnews24.com she only came to know of the strike when she arrived at Shariatpur Bus Stand. "It is not right to victimise the general public with these unannounced strikes," said Rabeya. Shariatpur deputy commissioner Mohammed Anisur Rahman confirmed receipt of the memorandum: "I am looking into the matter." "A copy has been given to the superintendent of police, but I cannot comment further," he added. bd
