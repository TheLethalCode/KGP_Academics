 NOTTINGHAM, England, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ricky Ponting piled on the misery for England with a masterful century to help Australia claim a comfortable four-wicket win and a 5-0 lead in the one-day series on Tuesday. Captain Ponting thumped 126 in 109 balls as the visitors eased to their target of 300 with 10 deliveries to spare at Trent Bridge. Australia, who again lost the toss, will now target a clean sweep in the sixth and seventh games in Nottingham on Thursday and in Durham on Sunday. Ponting's side hit 302 for six, Mitchell Johnson clinching victory with a six over long-on from a full toss by seamer Ryan Sidebottom. The win was set up by a well-paced third-wicket partnership of 133 between man of the match Ponting and Michael Clarke (52), who led the team in the first three matches of the series while the skipper rested at home in Australia. MIGHTY SIX Ponting's 27th century in his 317th one-dayer was the highlight of the match. The first of his three sixes, off Sidebottom in the 12th over, went into the third tier of the stand behind the bowler's arm at the Radcliffe Road End. His other sixes came in consecutive balls off leg-spinner Adil Rashid. Ponting was eventually caught on the long-off boundary as Stuart Broad grabbed his second wicket of the over. Earlier, several batsmen made solid contributions in England's 299 all out but yet again in the series no one was able to go on to a three-figure score. Number six Eoin Morgan struck 58 from 41 balls, including three sixes, while opener Joe Denly added 45. Last month England regained the Ashes with a 2-1 victory in the test series against Australia.
