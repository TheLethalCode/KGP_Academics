 Barisal, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)A so-called 'Sarbahara' extremist leader was killed early on Tuesday in Barisal in an alleged gun battle with the police and RAB. Police said Babul Sardar, 35, a regional leader of 'Sarbahara Zia group' and a top terror wanted by the police, died at Batajore crematorium quay under Gournadi police station. A light gun, a shutter gun, a revolver and seven rounds of ammo were recovered from the spot. According to a RAB press release issued on Tuesday, a joint RAB-police patrol sensed the presence of a group of people at the crematorium and challenged them. The suspects suddenly started running and opened fire too when the law enforcers ordered them to stop. The law-enforcers retaliated and an gunfire exchange of 15-20 minutes ensued. The criminals at one point stopped shooting and fled leaving Babul's dead body behind. RAB claimed that they shot 71 rounds during skirmish. The dead body was sent for autopsy.
