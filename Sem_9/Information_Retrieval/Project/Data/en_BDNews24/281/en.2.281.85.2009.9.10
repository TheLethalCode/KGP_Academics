<TITLE> No UN law bars dam building: Dipu Moni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)No United Nations convention debars any nation from constructing water reservoirs or dams in its own territory, foreign minister Dipu Moni told the parliament on Thursday. "People say that as per relevant UN conventions, India cannot raise the proposed dam at Tipaimukh. If it is true, has the government taken any steps to raise the matter with the UN? If not, why, may we know?" Jainal Abdin Farroque, the opposition BNP MP from Feni-2, asked in a written question. Dipu Moni retorted, "It's not clear exactly which UN convention says so. Generally speaking, the UN doesn't have any say in any country building its own dams in own territories." "There's, however, the Convention on Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, which includes issues related to international waterways. But the convention has not yet been put into force. "Another 18 more nations have to endorse and own it as their governmental motion before rendering it effective," she added. bdnews
