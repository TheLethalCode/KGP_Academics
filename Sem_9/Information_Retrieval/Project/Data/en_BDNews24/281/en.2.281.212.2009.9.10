 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)Residents of coastal areas, at a climate change workshop in Dhaka on Thursday, called on the government to address the pressing need to repair coastal embankments and control shrimp cultivation to protect against natural disasters. "We have tried to renovate the dykes as a matter of urgency, but the work is hampered by the tidal flow and rain," minister for food and disaster management Abdur Razzaq told the workshop at the BRAC Centre Inn. He said remedial work on embankments in the area would start when the monsoon season ended. Razzaq said a saline water resistant strain of rice, funded by the United Nations, would soon be available in Bangladesh. "Although flooding brings suffering, it is essential for cultivation. We can only reduce the impact, not eliminate it," Razzaq told representatives of communities in flood affected Sirajganj and vulnerable southern districts. Community leaders from Sirajganj district and the Chalan Beel area said flood alert systems were inadequate to deal with the situation. They also said poorly constructed flood protection barriers were critically endangering the riverside areas. Those who reside near the shrimp farms alleged that the owners illegally tampered with the dykes to flood their fields with water, either undermining the embankments by channelling pipes through or breaking them altogether. The workshop also heard that chronic saline water logging in coastal areas and infiltration of insecticides and fertilisers into water supplies was endangering farmers' health and destroying crops. Residents from the coastal belt, attending the workshop, complained that sources of clean drinking water were increasingly difficult to locate, compared to just a few years ago when they could drink directly from community ponds. They also said the number of cyclone shelters in coastal areas were too few to meet the needs of increasing population. Another Tk 6 cr for Aila victims: Minister Razzak also told the workshop that the government had allocated another Tk 6 crore to help cyclone Aila-affected people rebuild homes. He said the new fund had been allocated for the cyclone victims at four upazilas Dakop and Koira in Khulna and Shyamnagar and Ashashuni in Satkhira, one of the worst Aila -hit districts. Each upazila will get Tk 1.5 crore. He said the government had earlier disbursed Tk 4 crore for the cyclone victims. Tropical cyclone Aila hit the coasts of Bangladesh and India in the last week of May, leaving nearly 300 people dead and thousands more homeless. Razzak said he asked deputy commissioners in the Aila-hit region to prepare a detailed plan on how the government can further assist the victims. He said the government was talking with many development partners and bilateral donors to build water treatment plants to supply safe drinking water in the region. The minister also said that the government had prepared a plan focusing on preventive measures to curb impacts of global climate change, as experts say Bangladesh would be among the worst affected nations as projected sea level rises occur. He said the government had established a fund to tackle the impacts of climate change, and the international community must come forward with financial assistance. The workshop on "Community Voice for Change: Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction" was organised by Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre (BDPC) and NGO Coordination Council for Climate Change (NC4) with support from Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). BDPC director Muhammad Saidur Rahman and Swiss Ambassador Dr Dora Rapold were among those who attended the workshop. bdnews24.com
