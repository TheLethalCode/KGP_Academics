 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)Student activists of left political organisations vandalised two buses on Monday morning at Shahbagh intersection during the half-day hartal enforced protesting the government's leasing of Bay blocks to foreign contractors for oil-gas exploration. Police have kept barricaded all the approaches to the Paltan and Shahbagh intersections. Only rickshaws were seen plying the areas. The agitators have now taken position at Shahbagh intersection, stopping all traffic except rickshaws. As most educational institutions remain closed due to the shutdown, the usual traffic gridlocks seemed comparatively eased in the morning. The hartal is being observed in the general area between Paltan and Shahbagh due to strong picketing. The left student activists proceeded towards Muktangan from Shahbagh at 10:30am and then traffic movement eased around Shahbagh. The activists of National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources and Port-Power assembled at Paltan intersection at 6 am. Udichi cultural activists were performing at the intersection in the midst of rallying and marching of processions. Moshrefa Mishu, Khalequzzaman Ratan, Ruhin Hossain Prince, Tuku Biswas and MM Akash were present. bdnew
