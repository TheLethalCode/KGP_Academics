 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)--State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku has asked the militant outlaws of the south-western region to get back to normal life. However, the government will not volunteer a proposal, the state minister told reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday after a meeting with visiting US deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs Michael Owen. If the extremists do not respond, the current crackdown in the southwest will be strengthened, he warned. On the meeting with the senior US official, Tuku said they had discussed issues on law and order, health and education. The US government has offered training and technical assistance to the police, Tuku said. They had also talked about the US tour of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and foreign minister Dipu Moni slated for Sep 23. US president Barack Obama has invited prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a meeting in New York of the heads of the government of the 10 UN peace-keeping countries who contributed best to the mission. bd
