<TITLE> Hartal callers are trying to harm the country: Ashraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Government spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam on Thursday said those who called hartal on Sep 14 on the excuse of protecting the country are instead trying to harm the country. The minister's comment came after the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas Mineral Resources, Power and Ports on Thursday called a half-day hartal from 6am in Dhaka for Sep 14. This will be the first general strike since the Awami League-led coalition government took office in January. Ashraf, the local government minister, said, "The government is doing everything in a transparency manner. The government's initiative to explore gas and oil is to meet the country's demand, not to export, not to provide anyone with any extra facility." Patience should be exercised by all sides, he said. "Awami League could not come to power in 2001 as it had the policy for export oil and gas keeping a reserve for 50 years. The party still has the same stand," the AL general secretary said. About the sample production-sharing contract, Model PSC 2008, he said: "As for now the PSC will be in force with the prevailing rules. However, the issues will be reformed and modified later in the new contract." The hartal will be enforced to protest against the police attack on the demonstrators during their attempt to besiege Petrobangla headquarters on Sept 2 over recent exploration deals with two international companies at Bay that left dozens of people injured. On Sep 2, dozens of activists including Prof Anu Muhammad, member secretary of the pressure group, were injured in the capital when police charged demonstrators with baton, who were trying to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over the off-shore exploration deals for three blocks. The minister said law enforcers made excesses that day. "What the police did on that day was too much." Asked if there will be any meeting with the public protest group, the minister said, "There is nothing to discuss or to meet over." The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas Mineral Resources, Power and Ports also declared countrywide demonstrations and siege programme of the offices of the deputy commissioners and upazila nirbahi officers on Sept 14. bdnew
