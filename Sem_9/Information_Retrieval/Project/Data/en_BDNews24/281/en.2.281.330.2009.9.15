 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks edged down Tuesday, after recording gains for the last three sessions, as profit-taking in the latter part of the day caused the indices to fall. Dhaka Stock Exchange benchmark general index, or DGEN, rose from the opening bell, crossing the 3,000 point mark before gradually falling in the midday session. The index, however, witnessed a sharp fall over the last hour of trading, slipping 3.75 points, or 0.12 percent, to end on 2991.62. Market observers said the day's trading was marked by "panic" when the index crossed the 3,000 mark "As soon as the index reaches the mark, the market starts to fall. It seems the level creates panic among investors," former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan told bdnews24.com. The DGEN has crossed the 3,000 point level at least ten times over the last month, but has consistently failed to sustain the mark. The broader all share price index or DSI closed at 2515.96, down by 2.29 points, or 0.09 percent. The blue chip DSE-20, however, crawled up 2.23 points, or 0.10 percent, to end on 2147.71. Meanwhile, turnover on the premier bourse slipped to Tk 4.82 billion from Monday's Tk 5.15 billion. Losers beat gainers 121 to 117, with three issues remaining unchanged.
