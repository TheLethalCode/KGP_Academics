 COLOMBO, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar hit a superb 138, his 44th one-day international hundred, to power India to a 46-run victory over Sri Lanka in the tri-series final on Monday. Sri Lanka put up a tremendous fight to stay in the game before being dismissed for 273 in the 47th over. India scored 319 for five after Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid (39) laid a solid platform with an opening stand of 95. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, promoting himself up the order, played second fiddle to Tendulkar in a second-wicket partnership of 110 off 115 balls.

He scored two successive boundaries by reverse-sweeping Ajantha Mendis but was trapped lbw attempting a third. Sri Lanka snapped up the wickets of Yusuf Pathan for nought and Suresh Raina for eight before Yuvraj, in a final flourish, completed his 41st one-day fifty to give India a formidable total. Sri Lanka were given a flying start by openers Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya with 64 off 47 balls but the introduction of Harbhajan Singh cut the run rate and changed in the pattern of the game.
