<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui has told parliament that the government is taking measures to reopen Qaomi and Daulatpur jute mills. But the minister, during the question-answer on Sunday, ruled out the possibility of reopening the Adamjee Jute Mills that were shut down by the BNP-led government in 2002. The parliamentary standing committee on jute and textile on Aug 25 recommended that the ministry reopen all shut jute mills including Adamjee. "As per the directives of the prime minister, my ministry has been working to reopen the closed jute mills. "Reopening of the Qaomi and the Daulatpur jute mills is underway," Siddiqui told parliament, replying to a supplementary question from Shamsur Rahman Sharif of the Awami League. The immediate-past military-installed caretaker government, on the suggestion of the World Bank, shut down the Qaomi and Daulatpur jute mills. Answering to another question, the minister said, "We can hope that the Adamjee Jute Mills will be reopened, but we cannot make assurances." Siddiqui said the Adamjee Jute Mills were closed as part of a conspiracy against the Bangalee nationalism and the spirit of the war of independence. The state-owned Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation operates 27 jute mills. The minister was upbeat about the future of jute. "The global demands for jute and jute products have increased. I can say that the Bengalees will be proud of jute again," said Siddiqui. bdnews
