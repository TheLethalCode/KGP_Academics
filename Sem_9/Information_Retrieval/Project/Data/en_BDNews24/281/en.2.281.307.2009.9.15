<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)A ruling coalition MP has demanded clarification from the home minister in parliament about what punishment the BDR director general should get for changing the paramilitary force's name, uniform and insignia without government approval. Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal's Moinuddin Khan Badal said on Tuesday that Major General Moinul Islam's "grievous" decision had handed the opposition the opportunity to question the very existence of the government. Badal raised the issue a day after the parliamentary standing committee on home ministry discussed Moinul's unilateral decision on renaming the BDR into Bangladesh Border Guard without cabinet approval. However, neither home minister Sahara Khatun nor the state minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku came up with a statement. The government decided to change BDR's name, uniform and insignia, among other organisational reforms, following last February's mutiny in which rebel guards killed over 70 people including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. On Monday, Awami League MP Mirza Azam and Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haq Chunnu demanded the government take action against the director general for his "audacious" decision to change the name of the border force without approval from proper authorities. Badal, standing on a point of order, said there was a vibrant parliament which was trying to rebuild the country's democratic system. "At this stage, some incidents have been taking place and those have raised questions about the efficacy and sovereignty of parliament. "The chief of the BDR, a discipline force, whom the government has assigned to restructure the BDR, has sent Eid greeting cards to the ministers with a new name though the government is yet to decide about it. "No decision on changing the BDR's uniform has been made, but the DG is attending office wearing the new uniform he has chosen. "There is no decision on changing the insignia, but he attempted to change that too," said Badal. He wanted to know what punishment an ordinary soldier would face if he had done so. "I want to know what punishment should he (the DG) face," said Badal. "I want a statement from the home minister". Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was presiding over the session, asked the home minister whether she would issue a statement. "You can issue the statement now or later," said Ali. The minister made a gesture, suggesting she would not make the statement, for now. bdnews
