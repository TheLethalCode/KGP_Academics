<TITLE> ANALYSIS One year on, experts ask can Wall St change? </TITLE>

 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Close on the heels of the eighth anniversary of 9/11, Americans were observing another grim anniversary on Tuesday. Aptly called 9/15, this anniversary marks the collapse of the Lehman Brothers, the giant Wall Street investment bank, exactly a year ago, which triggered the worst financial crisis since the great depression. The crisis sent tremors all around, threatening not only big name banks and financial institutions in the United States but also in other capitalist economies. Analysts say, without swift and bold action by the American government, which injected a staggering $700 billion to bail out other collapsing giants like Bank of America, Citi Bank and American Insurance Group, the whole capitalist system would have crumbled. While the bold action might have averted a complete collapse of the financial system, it raised many pertinent questions as to how the crisis developed and why it took so long to detect the problems that led to the meltdown. Economists and financial experts were almost unanimous in their views that the crisis was caused primarily by the lack of adequate oversight from the regulatory bodies coupled with the inordinate greed of the Wall Street moguls. No wonder it prompted calls for stricter regulation and reining in the powerful bosses on the Wall Street. More specifically, there was broad agreement that Wall Street must restrict its reckless behavior and put a limit on fat bonuses. But as the experts and analysts try to take stock of what has happened in terms of reforms in the past year, they are surprised to see how little has changed in the financial industry. Propped up by huge federal guarantees, the biggest banks have restructured only around the edges. Employment in the industry has fallen just 8 percent since last September. Only a handful of big hedge funds have closed. Pay is already returning to precrash levels, topped by the 30,000 employees of Goldman Sachs, the biggest investment bank, who are on track to earn an average of $700,000 this year. More astonishingly, no major pay cuts are likely; and executives at most big banks have kept their jobs. On the other hand, ordinary folks on the main street bore the brunt. According to official figures, unemployment last month reached 9.7 percent, pushing the total unemployed at over 26 million. On top of that, 40 million Americans are now living in poverty. While these economic body counts keep rising, tough regulatory reform for reckless financial institutions seems more remote by the day. Part of the reasons perhaps lie in the fact that the economy is again showing some signs of progress; financial stocks have soared since their winter lows; and most of the major banks that received bailout money have paid it back or are in the process of repaying. But the real reason, experts say, could be the nexus between the U.S. lawmakers and the Wall Street moguls. It's an open secret in Washington about the enormous clout the Wall Street bosses has on the lawmakers, who receive regular favors from them in the form of campaign contributions and other benefits. There's something called the "revolving door" system in Washington, which ensures that both parties are protected in times of need. It's not uncommon to see that many lawmakers often end up being hired by big companies when they quit active politics. This perhaps explains why President Obama, who last year declared that the days of fat bonuses on Wall Street were over, could do virtually nothing to regulate the financial industry. On the eve of the 9/15 anniversary, he again reiterated his resolve to reshape the financial industry aimed at preventing similar crises in the future. At a gathering of finance officials and bankers at the Wall Street on Monday, Obama issued a stern warning: "I want them to hear my words. We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses." He also warned that "those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall." His critics dismissed his warnings as mere rhetoric. Even many of his backers say they face a difficult road in Congress. For now, banks still sell and trade unregulated derivatives, despite their role in last fall's chaos. Radical changes like pay caps or restrictions on bank size face overwhelming resistance. Even minor changes, like requiring banks to disclose more about the derivatives they own, are far from certain. Experts say unless stricter regulations are put in place there could be another disaster in the near future. Simon Johnson, an Economics professor at MIT and former chief economist of the IMF, said that the seeds of another collapse had already sprouted. If major banks are allowed to keep making bets that are ultimately backed by taxpayer guarantees, they will return to the practices that led them to underwrite trillions of dollars in bad loans. "They will run up big risks, they will fail again, they will hit us for a big check," Prof Johnson told the New York Times. Much the same view was expressed by Robert Shiller, the Yale University economics professor, who predicted the dot-com crash and the housing bust. He said the window for change may be closing. "People will accept change at a time of crisis, but we haven't managed to do much, and maybe complacency is coming back," he told The Times. "We seem to be losing momentum." His apparent frustration stems from the fact that the major bankers have taken it for granted that after the Lehman collapse no U.S. administration could afford to let major banks fail because of the devastating consequences it would have on the global financial system. That predictably will encourage the investors to lend money to the financial industry on easy terms. In turn, financial institutions will use that cheap bailout money to make risky loans and trades. The banks will keep the profits when their bets pay off, while taxpayers will swallow the losses when the bets go bad and threaten the system. Economists call the phenomenon moral hazard. Bankers have a different term: I.B.G. The phrase implies that by the time a deal goes sour, "I'll be gone," after having received a sizable bonus
