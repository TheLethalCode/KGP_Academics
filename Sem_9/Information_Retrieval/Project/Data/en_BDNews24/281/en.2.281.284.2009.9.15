 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan has told parliament that the readymade garment factory owners will pay the workers festival allowances ahead of the Eid. The minister's statement came as Bangladesh Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon MP tabled a notice on the owners not paying wages and allowances. Menon submitted the notice in parliament against the backdrop of increasing number of street agitations by the garment workers over back pay and allowances. "The owners have assured the government that they will pay the workers festival bonus ahead of the Eid. "The government has been closely monitoring the situation," Khan said. He also said a tripartite committeecomprising the factory owners, the government and the workerswas working to increase the wages of the workers. The committee had been working to submit its recommendations to the government. The minister said Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association (BGMEA) formed 20 monitoring committees to look after the payment of wages and allowances by the owners. "Moreover, the BGMEA has set up a control cell. "If there is any allegation of bonuses and wages not being paid, anyone can file a complaint with control cell," said Khan. In reply, Menon said workers of six shut garment factories had taken to the streets demanding their wages, let alone festival allowances. "I will talk to the BGMEA about your allegations today," said Khan. Menon in his notice said the BGMEA demanded Tk 3,000 crore from the government to recoup the losses caused by the global economic crisis. "The owners said they will not be able to pay the workers festival bonuses unless the government gives them the incentive packages. "This is nothing but a ploy to deprive the workers of wages and festival bonuses," Menon said. bdnews
