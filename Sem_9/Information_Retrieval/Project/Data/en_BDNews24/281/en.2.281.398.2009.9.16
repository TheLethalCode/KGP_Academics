 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)--A RAB official has been accused of attempted murder by a fruit trader in the capital. Mohammed Amir Ali Mir, of Khilgaon Rail Gate area, filed a case with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Wednesday against RAB-3 assistant commissioner Nur-uz-Zaman and other unnamed law enforcers. Approached by bdnews24.com, Zaman said he could not make any comment on the allegations without seeing a copy of the case record. Magistrate Julfikar Hayat ordered a judicial investigation into the allegations. In his statement the complainant said Zaman had gone to fruit trader Lutfar Rahman, Amir's nephew, at 2pm on Sept 7 to buy two kgs of Malta and half kg of pomegranate. The official then tried to leave the place without paying for 100 grams of pomegranate that weighed extra. Lutfar insisted Zaman slapped the trader, he alleged. When Amir and other fruit traders came to Lutfar's rescue, Zaman flashed his identity card before them. He also swore at them and said that he could do harm to them because of his being with the elite force. He kept beating Lutfar and took him along with him on a pick-up van, the complainant further alleged. Lutfar was later rescued from in front of Motijheel Ideal School with broken hands and legs and admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. bdne
