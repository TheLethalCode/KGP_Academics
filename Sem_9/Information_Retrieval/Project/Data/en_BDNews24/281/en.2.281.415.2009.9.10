 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)Indices on the twin bourses registered a slight rise on the closing day of the week, with sixty percent of traded scrips gaining. Brokerage house officials said trading had lifted on input by large scale retail and institutional investors. Dhaka Stock Exchange benchmark general index rose a little over 10 points, while Chittagong Stock Exchange selective categories index ended 33 points up. "High rollers are putting up their money, although participation by small scale investors remains very low," an official of Akij Securities told bdnews24.com. Market observers said the upcoming Eid festival and influx of IPOs were the main reasons behind poor overall participation. "Small investors have to sell holdings to fund subscription to upcoming IPOs," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former DSE chief executive. Khan said IPOs generally attract a lot of attention as most investors in Bangladesh sought short-term profits. "The market usually sees funds pulled out ahead of Eid to cover festival expenses," added Khan, who teaches finance at Dhaka University.
