 Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)Former adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan has said organisers of Monday's half-day general strike should engage the government in constructive dialogue, while the government should clarify its position on gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal. "It's more important to dialogue with the government than calling a hartal on the streets of the capital," Khan told reporters after attending a discussion on Sunday at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel on budget presentation in parliament. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports called Monday's half-day hartal in Dhaka to protest gas exploration deals with foreign companies in the Bay of Bengal. The strike was also called to protest a clash between police and members of the national committee at a demonstration on Sep 2 in Dhaka, in which police mounted a baton charge that left committee member secretary Prof Anu Muhammed and dozens others injured. Khan said a televised debate on issues raised by the national committee would allow differing points of view to be heard and allow the general public to make up their own minds. "However, the important thing is the national committee is saying something, but the government is not listening. They're not discussing the matter in parliament or with the public," said Khan. He said the government was at liberty to sign agreements with different parties, but was also obliged to explain its position if any dispute arose regarding them. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters in the areas. The national committee claims a provision in the deals allows the companies to export up to 80 percent of extracted gas, which constitutes a threat to the energy security of Bangladesh. Tullow is one of the largest oil and gas exploration companies in Europe, while ConocoPhillips is the third largest company of this kind in the USA.
