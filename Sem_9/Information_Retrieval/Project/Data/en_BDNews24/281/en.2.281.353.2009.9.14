<TITLE> Regulatory maze slows SMEs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)Entrepreneurs called for an end to regulatory and processing constraints, which they said were stymieing the emerging sector, at a round table in the city on Monday. A recent survey of SMEs in divisional headquarters of the country revealed a regulatory maze sometimes impossible to steer through. One such example that came up was in the licensing process: getting a fire license from the fire department requires having a trade license from Dhaka City Corporation, while the DCC does not give a trade license without a fire license. Likewise, it was also found that financing and BSTI and environment certification were massively time consuming mainly due to the complicated prerequisites. Rules and regulations relating to tax and VAT were described as "beyond understanding" at times. Aftab ul Islam, the newly appointed chairman of the SME Foundation, said entrepreneurs and banks would come forward if authorities could create a better environment for investment. The government has initiated the SME Policy 2009 with guidelines, strategies and proposals on package facilities to develop the SME sector in a balanced way, Islam said. The sector has also been prioritised as a tool of industrialisation in the proposed Industrial Policy 2009. But, Islam said, financing available to SME entrepreneurs, particularly women, is not satisfactory, though the Bangladesh Bank has directed banks specifically to facilitate small and medium entrepreneurs. To address at least this one problem, the SME Foundation has launched 'credit wholesaling' activities as a pilot programme, jointly run by MIDAS and Shakti Foundation, Islam said. Prof Momtaz Uddin Ahmed, managing director of the SME Foundation, said neither policymakers nor entrepreneurs are knowledgeable about the prevailing general, legal and regulatory framework. Ahmed, while presenting the keynote paper, said the outmoded, flawed and weak spots in the overall legal and regulatory framework of the country are the major constraints for the development of the industry. He identified the financing procedure as burdensome, alongside the high interest rates, varying from 11 to 13 percent, charged by the banks. Ahmed cited the examples in some other countries, where entrepreneurs in Turkey can secure loan rates as low as 4 percent and in India 5 percent. He said entrepreneurs also feel it weighty to pay 25-50 percent as service charges in case of imported raw materials and machineries while the rules and regulations relating to tax and VAT are so complex as to be sometimes "beyond understanding". Ahmed, mentioning advanced developed countries, mentioned the need for handling the issues methodically and in a structured manner, to ease the limitations through ongoing reform process and efforts. The Regulatory Reforms Commission and Better Business Forum have made some effective changes to the regulatory measures, which, Ahmed added, must be continued.
