<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR mutiny trial, scheduled for Monday, was pushed back by a day. Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, senior information officer at the law ministry, told bdnews24.com that the meeting would take place at 10:30am on Tuesday. The meeting is expected to make a decision on how to expedite the trial of the mutineers after the Supreme Court gave its opinion on a presidential reference last week. Law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Sunday they would decide in the meeting under which law the trial could be held soonest. The apex court returned its opinion on the president's trial reference on Thursday, saying that the BDR mutiny cannot be tried under army law. Ahmed said: "We will arrange so that the trial process is held properly under whatever law can be applied." The minister said the Supreme Court had given some guidelines for trial with its opinion. "The decision will be made in line with the directions," he said. President Zillur Rahman had sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The SC began hearing their opinions on the president's reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act even by notification. An inter-ministerial meeting on the mutiny trial mode decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, presenting the reference before the court on Aug 25, said the mutiny case filed in Dhaka saw some 1, 779 people arrested so far. Another 40 cases filed in connection with BDR rebellions outside Dhaka saw 1, 721 persons arrested. A total 3,500 people are facing trial in the cases, said Alam.
