<TITLE> Regulatory knots slow down SMEs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)Entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) recommended easing regulatory and processing constraints to facilitate the emerging sector at a roundtable in the city on Monday. A survey of SME entrepreneurs, based in divisional headquarters of the country, found them citing regulatory knots which were almost impossible to unravel. One such example that came up: having a fire license from the fire service requires a trade license by the Dhaka City Corporation, while the DCC does not provide a trade license without a fire license. Likewise, it was also found that the license processing, financing, tax/VAT mechanisms BSTI and environment certification were massively time consuming mainly due to the complicated prerequisites. "Despite the prevailing general, legal and regulatory framework, the policymakers as well as the entrepreneurs do not possess much information," prof Momtaz Uddin Ahmed, managing director of the SME Foundation, said. Ahmed, while presenting the keynote paper, said the outmoded, flawed and weak enforcement laws in the overall legal and regulatory framework of the country are the major constraints for the development of the industry. He identified the financing procedure as burdensome, which also imposes a high interest rate by the banks varying from 11 to 13 percent. Ahmed citing the examples in some other countries, where entrepreneurs in Turkey can secure lending rates as low as 4 percent and in India 5 percent. The entrepreneurs also feel it weighty to pay 25-50 percent as service charges in case of imported raw materials and machineries while the rules and regulations relating to tax and VAT are so complex as to be sometimes "beyond understanding".
