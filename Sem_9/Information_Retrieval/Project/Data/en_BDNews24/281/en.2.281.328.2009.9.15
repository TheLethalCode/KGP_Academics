<TITLE> Indian PM says fight against Maoists is failing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned India's police chiefs on Tuesday that a campaign against Maoist rebels has failed to produce results and that rebel violence was on the rise in many states. Singh's comment is the clearest signal yet of the government's concern at a rebellion that has virtually put a vast swathe of the countryside rich in minerals out of official control, hurting potential business worth billions of dollars. Though the economic impact of the rebellion remains limited with the rebels largely operating out of jungle hideouts, the insurgency and the sense that it is worsening adds to risks for companies mulling investments. "I would like to state frankly that we have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace," Singh said, underscoring concern over what he has described as the single biggest home-grown threat to India's internal security. "It is a matter of concern that despite our efforts the level of violence in the affected states continues to rise." The rebellion began about four decades ago championing the cause of poor peasants in the country's east but has now spread to about 20 of India's 29 states with the rebels targetting police and government property in hit-and-run attacks. India's cities and bigger towns are largely free of the violence, but Singh warned that the rebels had managed to retain support among a cross section of society. "Despite its sanguinary nature the movement manages to retain the support of a section of the tribal communities and the poorest of the poor in many affected areas," he said. "It has influence among certain sections of the civil society, the intelligentsia ... all this adds to the complexity of the problem." India's fight against the rebels has been hurt because police fight Maoist insurgents with outdated weapons and are often outnumbered by rebels, who are skilled in jungle warfare and are well-equipped with rocket launchers, automatic rifles and explosives. "As I have stated before dealing with left-wing extremism requires a nuanced strategy, a holistic approach," he said. "It can not be treated solely as a law and order problem.
