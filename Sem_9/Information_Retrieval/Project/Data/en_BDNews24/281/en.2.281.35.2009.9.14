 Benapol, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)The aging computer system at Benapol Customs House collapsed on Saturday, halting revenue of around Tk 70 million over 48 hours, an official said Sunday. "The government realises at least Tk 4 crore from Benapol Customs House every day," Farid Uddin, assistant commissioner of the customs house, told bdnews24.com on Sunday evening. Customs operations at the land port have virtually ground to a halt since the fault appeared, with perishable goods being released manually on a priority basis until the problem is solved. Farid Uddin said at least Tk 7 crore in government revenue had been held up since the computers crashed. Benapol Customs House computer programme officer Golam Kabir said the system's server was outdated: "We informed the National Revenue Board about the problem," he said. "The port should be back to normal after an expert arrives from Dhaka on Monday," said Kabir. Moshiar Rahman, leader of a clearing and forwarding agents association, said the entire process, from entry noting to delivery, was normally completed by computer. "Complete gridlock in the usual computerised process forced the authorities to release perishable commodities manually," said Rahman. bdnews24.c
