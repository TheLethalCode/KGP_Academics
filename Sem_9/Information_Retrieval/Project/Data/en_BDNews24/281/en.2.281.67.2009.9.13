 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The IEDCR has confirmed the death of another swine flu positive patient in Dhaka, which took the official count of casualties from the special strain of influenza to three. Two more persons who had H1N1 symptoms died, however. "Authorities have confirmed deaths of three H1N1 positive patients so far. The most recent patient died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital's influenza ward," Dr Mushtaque Hossain, senior scientific officer at the Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said on Sunday "He was, however, diagnosed as a H1N1 patient while being treated in another ward." At least 50,000 Bangladeshis are estimated to have been infected with A H1N1 influenza virus, based on confirmed cases, coming to health centres mostly on their own but very few needed hospitalisation, he said at a news briefing on the latest situation of the swine flu epidemic sweeping across the nation. Experts had previously said every person will not be required to take the H1N1 test. If one in the family is found to be infected with H1N1 virus, any other member suffering similar symptoms should be treated for the same ailment, they said. People living in the towns and villages outside Dhaka took treatment as advised by the doctors and almost all got cured, they said. Since Tuesday last, 61 more people tested positive in H1N1 tests, which takes the total number of H1N1 infected patients after lab tests across the country to 372. But mentioning that the total number of patients in the country should be over 50,000, Dr Hossain said, "Many of the infected got well on their own. A lot took medicine at home as advised by the doctors after symptoms were apparent." He said, Nasreen, the RMG worker of Mahakhali who died in Gopalganj on Thursday, had not been infected with H1N1 virus. "We tested samples to ascertain that." The IEDCR asked all to be careful while rushing to village homes before the festival and also about mixing with own folks. The ICDDR, B has started treating H1N1 patients in full swing after setting up 12 beds in a corner of the diarrhoea ward. Space for additional patients has been kept by relocating diarrhoea patients. Dr Md Shahadat Hossain, head of the long stay unit of ICDDR, B Dhaka hospital, told reporters, "A total 39 patients, most of whom were children under five years, have been admitted to the ward to date since the ward was opened on Sept 6. "Again, many have returned home after recovery in five/six days." He said they are prepared to deal with any explosion of the situation with additional space kept to accommodate any sudden swell of patients. bd
