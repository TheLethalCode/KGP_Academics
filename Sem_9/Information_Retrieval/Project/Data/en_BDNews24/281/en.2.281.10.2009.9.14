<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)Two MPs have demanded the government take action against the director general of Bangladesh Rifles for his "audacious" decision to change the name of the border force without approval from proper authorities. Awami League MP Mirza Azam and Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haq Chunnu made the demand at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs on Monday. State minister for home affairs Shamsul Huq Tuku told the meeting that BDR chief Major General Moinul Islam had already made an "informal apology" for issuing Eid greetings as director general of the 'Bangladesh Border Guard'. The government decided to change BDR's name, uniform and insignia, among other organisational reforms, following last February's mutiny in which rebel guards killed over 70 people including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. Islam's greeting cards featured both a new name and a new monogram of the force, though the government is yet to approve the changes. "Mirza Azam said Maj Gen Islam cannot be pardoned for his audacious decision of changing the BDR's name and monogram," Nurul Islam Sujon, a committee member, told bdnews24.com. "This is a decision of the government and parliament. How dare he do so. He should be punished," Sujon quoted Azam as saying. Chunnu said the BDR chief had discredited the government through his decision. Sujon said the two MPs called on the government to issue a show-cause notice "for this unauthorised decision." Chairman of the committee Major Gen (retired) Abdus Salam did not give any decision on Islam's action, said Sujon. But Tuku told the meeting that the government had already taken the decision to rename BDR into Bangladesh Border Guard, Sujon said.
