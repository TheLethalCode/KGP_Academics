<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission will start updating the voter list for Dhaka City Corporation by the month-end and plans the elections early next year if parliament passes the laws on local government in the current session, a commissioner says. "We have plans to hold Dhaka City Corporation polls by January-February if the local government acts are passed," commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com recently. "It will be decided before the elections whether the polls will be held with the previous voter list or the updated one," he said. Hussain said the work on gathering information on the voters for the update will be held between Sept 29 and Oct 8. The registration process including photographs will start from Oct 12. The draft list is supposed to be published by November. The voter listing for DCC started on Dec 1, 2007. Over 35 lakh people were registered as voters before the ninth national elections. Hussain said some four to five percent of the voters might be added to the updated list. Earlier, there were around 40 lakh voters in the cancelled voter list. The countrywide electoral roll updating began in June. The updating is being done in four phases and three phases have been complete. Registration was finished in 154 upazilas in the first phase, 161 upazilas and 17 circle unions in Dhaka in the second and 166 upazila in the third phase. Information will be collected in six city corporations in the fourth phase. People who were born on Jan 1, 1992 or earlier (18 years of age or senior) will be registered as voters during the update. The formulation of voter listing with photographs started in 2007 for the first time in the country. As many as 8.10 people got registered as voters before the ninth national elections. Hussain is hopeful that the proposed city corporation, municipality and union parishad bills will be passed in the current session that would continue through to Sep 15. He said the Chittagong City Corporation polls would also be held before its term expired. "We are planning to hold the polls by April. A final decision will be made by formulating electoral regulations and manual after the passage of the acts," the commissioner said. The DCC ended its term on May 24, 2007 and the CCC will run out of its term on May 9, 2010. Though there is provision that election should be held by 180 days before expiry of term, the Commission does not want to hold both the DCC and CCC polls together. The elections to four Barisal, Sylhet, Rajshahi and Khulna city corporations were held on Aug 4 last year for the first time with photo-based voter lists. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said earlier that the local government polls would be held in 2010. "If the bills are passed in the third session it will be possible to hold city, municipality and union parishad polls by January. The commission has made all preparations to this end," he added. The terms of elections to over 300 municipalities and about 4,000 Union Parishad have already expired. bd
