<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  An international protest group has condemned the offshore exploration deal granted to two international oil companies and recent attack on a group of demonstrators in Bangladesh. "We condemn the off-shore oil deals as well as recent violence against Bangladeshi activists protesting the deal," International Campaign against Oil Companies in Bangladesh and Against Police Brutality in Bangladesh said in a statement. On Sep 2, dozens of activists including professor Anu Muhammad, member secretary, of the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports were injured in the capital when police clubbed demonstrators trying to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over the exploration deals granted to two international companies. "Such anti-people deals, according to the protesters, would enable those companies to explore, extract, and eventually own the country's gas resources without the people's consent. "Indeed, those deals reveal how the ruling classes in Bangladesh operate in close class cahoots with corporations and imperialism," the campaign group said. The government last month decided to award three blocks to the US-based company called ConocoPhillips and the Irish company Tullow Oil plcwith a provision of allowing them to export up to 80 percent of gas. The national committee launched the protest programme against the decision as it feared "such a move would threaten the energy security of Bangladesh, and, by extension, the very sovereignty of the country." "In fact, the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power, and Ports has long argued that the government's drive for plundering its own people's resources comes at a high price, and lacks forethought about how these resources might benefit the people of Bangladesh instead of multinational companies," the group said. The pressure group, comprising teachers, students, writers, artists, and activists around the world, demanded that the government ensure the most appropriate and effective medical treatment of all who were wrongfully injured by the police. It also called for the action plan and demands of the National Committee be taken seriously rather than silenced through any form of brutality. It expressed solidarity with the people who are struggling to protect national and natural resources from the hands of foreign companies. "And we support the Bangladeshi people's right to self-determination under any circumstances," it said
