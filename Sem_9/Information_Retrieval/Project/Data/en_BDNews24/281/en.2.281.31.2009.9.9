<TITLE> Bangladesh slips in 'Doing Business' despite reforms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has slipped four places to 119 in the just released WB-IFC 'Doing Business Report 2010', despite undertaking three significant regulatory reforms during the period of the study to make the economy more efficient and create more opportunities. The fall indicates that other countries surpassed Bangladesh's reform efforts, Syed Akhter Mahmood, senior programme manager of Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund (BICF), managed by IFC, said Wednesday as he presented the report to media. Among South Asian countries, Pakistan ranked 85, Maldives 87, Sri Lanka 105, Nepal 123, Bhutan 126, India 133 and Afghanistan 160. Bangladesh's three notable reforms, in 2008-09, included reducing the start-up time to register a company, cutting corporate taxes and accelerating trade by introducing an automated customs clearance system at the Chittagong port. Between June 2008 and May 2009, 287 reforms were recorded in 131 economies out of 183, 20% more than the year before. The number of reforms hit a record level this year despite the challenges presented by the financial crisis. The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been tracking regulatory reforms aimed at improving the ease of doing business with an annual report since 2004. Mahmood said the caretaker government's reforms in 2008 did not take long-term steps. Even the Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) did not perform well in 2009 after a political government came into power, he added. Automation of customs clearance, at the Chittagong port, is expected to reduce the cost of business by 40-50 percent and time by 90 percent to clear goods. The national budget this year cut corporate tax from 40 percent to 37.5. Mahmood also suggested decentralisation of industry, increasing participation of local authorities, and reanimating the RRC. An online Name Clearance process as well as online application process for new business registration are also two new reforms expected to reduce time involved in starting a business by 29 days.
