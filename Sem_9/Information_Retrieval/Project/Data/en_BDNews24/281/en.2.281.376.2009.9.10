 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni returned to Bangladesh Thursday, ending a four-day visit to India. The minister's arrival was delayed due to an airline strike in India, her personal assistant Maksud Khan told bdnews24.com. She flew in from New Delhi via Kolkata on a GMG flight landing at Zia International Airport at around 10pm, an airport official told bdnews24.com. The foreign minister left Dhaka on Sep 7 to meet Indian leaders over unresolved bilateral issues between the neighbouring countries. Dipu Moni met prime minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister SM Krishna, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal during the trip. India agreed to allow Bangladesh connectivity to Nepal and Bhutan through Indian territories, said a joint-statement of the two governments on Thursday. In return, Bangladesh agreed to allow India to use Ashuganj land port to transport cargo to India's northeastern states, the statement said. Dipu Moni's visit also addressed water and power sharing issues and laid the ground work for prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming tour of India, slated for December
