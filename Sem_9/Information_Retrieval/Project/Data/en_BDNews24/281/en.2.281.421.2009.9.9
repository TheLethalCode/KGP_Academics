<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)State minister for liberation war affairs A B M Tajul Islam was forced to backtrack from a comment he made in parliament on Wednesday on the war of independence. Islam, a retired army captain, said the armed forces led the war against Pakistan, touching off uproar and chaos in the House for about 15 minutes. The minister finally said it was a "political war and it took place under a political leadership". Tajul Islam was answering to a question from Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal MP Moinuddin Khan Badal, who asked whether the government would introduce a new honorary award for those leaders who organised the war but did not take up arms. The minister said some civilian freedom fighters, apart from members of the armed forces, were given gallantry awards for their role. Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, for instance, got an award -- Bir Bikram-- the third highest gallantry award, he said. Just as the minister uttered "since the liberation war took place under military leadership...", the MPs started shouting in protest. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, a retired colonel who was presiding over the session, failed to calm the situation. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was not present in the House when such uproar erupted. A K M Mozammel, Shamsur Rahman Sharif, Fazle Rabbi Mian, Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, Dhirendra Nath Shambhu, Israfil Alam, K M Khalid and others started shouting at the top of their voices. The frustrated state minister, who himself was a freedom fighter as a student, sat down at one stage through the noisy proceedings. Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury took floor and urged the chair to dispose of the matter. The deputy speaker then clarified Badal's question: "The question was whether the government would introduce separate gallantry awards for those leaders who organised the war of independence, but did not fight in the battlefield. "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and four national leaders will be in the category for receiving such honour," said the deputy speaker. Tajul Islam then said, "I fought the war as a student and got commissioned in the armed forces after the war. "It was a political war and it took place under the political leadership." Islam said a new award could be introduced for the organisers if the nation wanted. "I will place a proposal before the government to honour the organisers of the war of independence." Fazle Rabbi Mian continued to scream despite the minister's assurance and demanded that the statement be expunged. The deputy speaker said the demand had already been met. "This is too much," he said. bdnew
