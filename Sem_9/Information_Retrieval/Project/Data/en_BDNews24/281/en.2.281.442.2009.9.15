 KARACHI, Sep 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rising prices and unemployment have tightened the purse-strings of many Pakistanis ahead of the feast ending Ramadan, but some enterprising Pakistanis are determined to get them to spend, if only a little.

"This is one of the biggest festivals for us and I can't just tell my family, especially the children, that I can't get them new clothes and things for Eid," said marketing executive Nadeem Qazi.
