 Kushtia, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)An alleged top outlaw was killed early on Wednesday in a reported shootout with RAB in Mirpur Upazila in Kushtia. Anwar Hossain, 37, son of Aman Malitha from Gachherdiar of Doulatpur upazila, was arrested by the intelligence squad of RAB in Dhaka on Tuesday evening, RAB-12 Kushtia unit squad commander flight lieutenant Nazrul Islam said. Anwar was a top leader of the banned Purbo Bangla Communist Party (ML-Janajuddho) in Kushtia region, he said. Islam said, acting on the information provided by Anwar, the RAB detectives and a RAB-12 Kushtia contingent set out to retrieve cached arms, taking the arrestee along with them. At around 6:30am, a group of alleged outlaws ambushed the arms-hunting law enforcers in Mahdipur and a gun battle ensued. Anwar took bullet and died when he had tried to flee during the gun fight. The outlaws also escaped. Mirpur police chief Sheikh Anwar Hossain said police retrieved a shuttergun, three rounds of shotgun ammo, five bombs and two ramdas (long-bladed chopper with a long handle) from the spot. Anwar had a dozen cases of murder, robbery and abduction filed against him with Mirpur and Doulatpur police stations, he said. Anwar's body has been sent for autopsy, police said. 'Odhikar', a human rights organisation said, 19 people were killed in August across the country in 'crossfire/ encounter/ gunfight'. Of the deceased, 10 allegedly belonged to different militant organisations. A RAB statement issued on Thursday said, a total 577 people died in 472 'crossfire' incidents across the country since RAB was constituted on March 26, 2004. The human-rights organisations have since been calling these incidents as 'extra judicial killings' and urging the government to put a stop to such violations of human rights. bdnews
