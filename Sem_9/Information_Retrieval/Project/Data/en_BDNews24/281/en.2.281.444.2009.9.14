<TITLE> Investment conditions not unfavourable: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)Conditions for investment in Bangladesh are quite favourable, finance minister A M A Muhith said on Monday in parliament. "I accept that there is scarcity of power and energy supplies, but I cannot say facilities for investment are not there," he said, replying to a supplementary query posed by Naogaon-3 MP Shahiduzzaman Sarkar. Muhith said, replying to women's reserved seats MP Apu Ukil's query, "It's not true that the credit flow in the private sector is ebbing because of the currency policy." "The most recent currency policy was formulated keeping in view the envisaged rate of growth of production despite the somewhat ebbing private sector credit flow in the backdrop of the global economic recession." The minister said excessive liquidity existed in the money market at the moment, which stood at Tk 347.62 billion in June 2009 compared with Tk 129.89 billion in June 2008. Answering another supplementary question, he said the incentive package was readied for implementation as soon as it was declared. The incentive package would be further modified and additions should be there, as necessary, he added. The finance minister said the government would soon take steps to order printing of new currency notes carrying portrait of the architect of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. bdnews
