 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)A half-day hartal in capital Dhaka, the first in nearly three years, ended at midday on Monday, having been loosely enforced by a citizen's pressure group. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Port and Power ended the general strike with an ultimatum to the government. The committee called the hartal protesting the government's recently announced gas exploration deals with international companies. Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah, convener of the citizen's pressure group, declared the strike terminated at Paltan intersection at noon. "The government is hereby given up to October 15 to meet our five-point charter of demands, or the committee will call for a national conference on Oct 16," said Shahidullah. The national conference will decide further rigid programmes such as rallies, hartals, he said. The five-point charter of demands includes the cancellation of the model oil-gas distribution agreements, cancellation of leases given to two foreign firms for three offshore blocks, formulation of new model production-sharing contract ensuring 100 percent public ownership, full implementation of Phulbari Agreement 2006 and punishment to the attackers of member secretary Anu Muhammad and others. The hartal was enforced most strictly in the area between Paltan and Shahbagh with strong picketing. Student activists of left-leaning political organisations vandalised two buses in the morning at Shahbagh intersection. Police kept all approaches barricaded to the Paltan and Shahbagh intersections and only rickshaws plied. Vehicles were thin on the Airport Road during the hartal hours. Most educational institutions remained closed due to the strike, and office goers made arrangements other than cars to get to work, emptying the streets of traffic. Unlike most weekdays, the Biswa Road intersection, Mohakhali, Amtali and the road in front of the prime minister's office was free of usual gridlock. The activists had assembled at Paltan intersection at 6am. Cultural activists of Udichi Shilpa Gosthi performed at the intersection in the midst of rallying and marching of processions. Traffic movement eased around Shahbagh as pro-left student activists proceeded towards Muktangan from Shahbagh at 10:30am . An organiser said the general strike was enforced in the national interest to protect public property. "We are not enforcing the strike to wrest power from the government. We have assured the nation that we will not abuse the strike," Mujahidul Islam Selim, one of the main organisers, told bdnews24.com in the Paltan intersection. The government on Aug 24 approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow Oil Ltd in three sea blocks of the resource-rich Bay. The pressure group, and left parties, say a provision in the off-shore deals allows the foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of extracted gas, which constitutes a threat to the energy security of Bangladesh. Monday's strike also protested what the committee said was an "unwarranted police attack" on its members, including member secretary professor Anu Muhammad, on Sep 2 when its supporters were on way to besiege the headquarters of Petrobangla, the state-owned exploration authority. bd
