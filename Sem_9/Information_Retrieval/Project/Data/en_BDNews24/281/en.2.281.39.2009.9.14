<TITLE> New municipality law leaves MPs out </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)Parliament Monday passed the municipality bill which excluded the controversial provision of making the MPs advisers to the local government body. The change came at the last stage of the passage though local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam did not tell the House about the government's decision. Chief whip Abdus Shahid confirmed to bdnews24.com that the MPs would not be the advisers. Awami League MP A K M Mozammel Haq, a former chairman of Gazipur municipality, proposed some amendments to the bill and urged the government not to make the MPs advisers to the local government body. Some MPs, irrespective of parties, started shouting "we don't accept" when Haq was speaking against the provision of making the MPs the ex-officio advisers. Haq suggested exclusion of the provision of creating two posts of deputy mayors in the municipality to avoid conflicts among the mayor, the deputy mayors and the members of the panel of chairmen. "As there is a provision of making a panel of chairmen, I think there is no need to create two posts of deputy mayors," he said. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was presiding over the session, then placed the proposals into vote to decide their fate. Chief whip and whips then instructed the MPs to say "yes" as the speaker announced: "Say yes who are in favour of the changes". The ruling coalition MPs, who earlier opposed the proposals loudly, then shouted "yes", making the municipal admiistrations free from the MPs. "I whipped at the last stage to accept Mozammel's proposal," Shahid told bdnews24.com after passage of the bill. "The MPs will not remain advisers to the municipalities the way it has been passed." Syed Ashraf tabled the bill on March 3, which was then sent to parliamentary standing committee on local government for scrutiny. The standing committee inserted the provision of making the MPs ex-officio advisers to municipalities, proposing that the lawmakers should be the advisers but their recommendation would not be mandatory.
