 LONDON, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been charged with violent and improper conduct during Saturday's 4-2 Premier League win over visitors Arsenal, the English Football Association said on Tuesday. "Under the fast-track disciplinary process, Adebayor has been charged with violent conduct following an incident with Robin van Persie, which resulted in the Arsenal player receiving facial injuries," an FA statement read.

Adebayor has until 1700GMT on Wednesday to respond to the violent conduct charge, which carries an automatic three-match suspension. The forward, who has scored in all four of unbeaten City's Premier League matches this season, has until Sept. 30 to respond to the improper conduct charge, the City website (www.mcfc.co.uk) said.
