 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Monday approved an amendment to the Representation of People's Order allowing the Election Commission to cancel registration of those political parties who fail to submit their ratified constitutions by Jan 25 2010. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Abul Kalam Azad said "The prime minister hopes the Election Commission will be flexible to some extent." The cabinet on Aug 3 approved the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Act 2009, allowing political parties six more months to submit their permanent constitution to the EC. Monday's cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, approved the Representation of the People Order (Second Amendment) Act 2009, as the first amendment had no specific clause on the EC's powers of action against parties who failed to submit. During the immediate past caretaker government, the Election Commission, for the first time, took initiatives to register political parties. The RPO was amended and registration clauses were inserted. Due to the state of emergency, however, political parties could not hold national councils to ratify their permanent constitutions and so 39 political parties registered with draft constitutions. They were given six months from the start of parliamanet, until July 25 2009, for submission of permanent constitutions after ratification. Opposition BNP and 11 other parties, however, appealed to the Election Commission in July for another six months. The Election Commission recommended the government amend the RPO for extending the time. In the end, a total of 29 political parties out of 39 submitted their permanent constitutions to the Election Commission, by the July 25 deadline. Ruling Awami League approved its constitution in a national council July 24 and submitted to the commission the next day. bd
