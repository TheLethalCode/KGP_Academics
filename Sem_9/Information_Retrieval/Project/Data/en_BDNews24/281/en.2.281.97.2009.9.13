 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has extended the deadline for former army chief Moeen U Ahmed to submit a written rejoinder to a Tk 100 crore defamation suit against him to October 1, after he failed to meet Sunday's deadline. Judge SM Saiful Islam, of Joint District Judge's Court-3, gave the order on request by counsel of the former army chief. On Aug 16, a court ordered Moeen U Ahmed to submit a written rejoinder to the case by Sept 13. Former BNP state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku filed the suit on July 12, claiming Tk 100 crore in damages, for reportedly defamatory statements made against him by the army chief in 2007 in public. On Saturday, Tuku filed an objection to the court after Moeen U Ahmed moved for dismissal of the case on Sept 8. A hearing on this will also be held on Oct 1. According to case details, Moeen U Ahmed, at a reception for freedom fighters in March 2007, accused politicians of the past BNP-led administration of massive corruption in the presence of guests including members of the media. The former army chief was quoted after the reception as saying as much as Tk 20,000 crore was siphoned out of the country from the power sector alone during the BNP's government. Tuku was a BNP state minister for power at the time. Moeen was appointed army chief in 2005, during the tenure of BNP-Jamaat alliance; he retired on June 15 this year after the caretaker administration extended his tenure by a year. bdn
