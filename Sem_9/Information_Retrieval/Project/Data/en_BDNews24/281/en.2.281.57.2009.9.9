<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)At least 74 armed forces officers were forced to step down for political reasons during the immediate past tenures of the BNP and caretaker governments, planning minister AK Khandker told parliament on Wednesday. Khandker, also in charge of defence during parliamentary business, said a high-powered review committee had been working in recent months to consider the cases of army officers who were unfairly retired in the seven years from October 2001, when BNP took the reins of power from the last Awami League administration. "Until now the committee has found that 74 officers were made to resign during the period, though it is still reviewing applications," he said. He said the government was considering their reinstatement, with overdue promotions, based on recommendations from the review committee. Khandker was replying to a written query of Waresat Hossain Belal MP for Netrokona-5 during parliament's question-answer session. Chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on defence, Idris Ali MP, told bdnews24.com last August that the Awami League government was in the process of recalling armed forces officers that were sacked by the previous BNP-led government on political considerations. He said a list of "victimised" officers had been sent to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who holds the defence portfolio, in July. The prime minister had ordered their reinstatement "after thorough review". Defence committee member, Monzur Quader Quraishi, told bdnews24.com at the time, "The BNP government dismissed army officers whose relatives were involved in opposition politics  The government will award them overdue promotions." Neither the defence ministry nor headquarters of the armed forces have previously disclosed any information relating to sacking of its officers on political grounds. bd
