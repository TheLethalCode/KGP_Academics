 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)--The draw of the lottery for residential plots allocation in the Purbachal project plot will be held on Thursday. The draw for Uttara project plots will not be held that day, though scheduled earlier. "The lottery draw for the Purbachal plots allocation in four categories will be held tomorrow," state minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan said to reporters on Wednesday. The draw will be held at Osmani Auditorium at 11am in 'judge', 'freedom fighter', 'artist' and 'expatriate' categories. All the judges who have applied will get plots, Khan said. The expatriates will be allocated 10 percent, freedom fighters will get five percent and cultural activists-sportsmen three percent. Of the total 17,500 plots, there now remain 6,000 plots after the allocation by the previous governments. Officials at Rajuk said as many as 1.65 lakh people applied for the plots of the two projects after Rajuk invited applicants to the lottery last year. Many applications were rejected for fault, said an official, preferring to be unnamed. Asked when the remaining plots would be allocated, the state minister said: "Bangladesh University of Enginering Technology is scrutinising the applications. The draw of the remaining lottery will take place soon after they are done." Deposit money will be returned to unsuccessful aspirants, officials said. bdne
