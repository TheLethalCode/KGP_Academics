<TITLE> India's Gambhir out of Sri Lanka tri-series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's in-form opener Gautam Gambhir will miss the ongoing one-day tri-series in Sri Lanka with a groin injury, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) said on Thursday. Left-handed Gambhir strained the muscle and will return home to rest for 10 days, the BCCI said in a statement. India open against New Zealand on Friday and play Sri Lanka the following day with the final slated for September 14 in the short series -- their build up to the Champions Trophy in South Africa later this month. The BCCI is yet to name his replacement. India is already without explosive opener Virender Sehwag and bowling spearhead Zaheer Khan. Both are recovering after shoulder surgery and will be sidelined until after the Champions Trophy.
