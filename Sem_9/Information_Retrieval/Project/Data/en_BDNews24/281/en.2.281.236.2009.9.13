<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The home minister has asked a left-leaning pressure group to withdraw the general strike called for Monday in capital Dhaka but said the government will not hinder the protest programme. "We are urging them to withdraw the strike. However, the government will not hinder their programme as long as they are observing it peacefully," Sahara said on Sunday. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports has called the half-day shutdown from 6am to protest against deals with two international gas companies in three blocs in the Bay of Bengal on provision that they would be able to export up to 80 percent of gas and police on Sep 2. As the supporters of the committee tried to storm the office of state-run Petrobangla, police clashed with them, leaving at least 23 injured including committee's member secretary Prof Anu Muhammad. But, the minister said, the law-enforcing agencies will thwart any move to create anarchy during the strike, set to be the first such programme since the Awami League government came to power in January. Sahara said the national committee has called the strike over a trifle matter, and the leaders of shop-owners association will not be happy with the shutdown as it will hamper their business ahead of Eid. The minister called the national committee leaders to present their demands in dialogue. As the main opposition BNP supports Monday's programme, the Awami League accuses the BNP of instigating the strike call. Top business bodies FBCCI and BGMEA and ruling Awami League have called on the national committee to cancel the planned hartal. bdnews
