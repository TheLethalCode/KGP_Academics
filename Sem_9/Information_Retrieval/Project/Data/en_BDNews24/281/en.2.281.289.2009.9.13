<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's 'Look East' policy will be easier to implement once her trade and commerce links with China, Thailand, Myanmar and Japan are further extended via the Asian Highway Network, communication minister Syed Abul Hossain has said. "Link with the Asian Highways will enable Bangladesh to offer road transportation services to India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, China and other countries," he said in parliament on Sunday, replying to a query from MP for Sunamganj-5 Muhibur Rahman Manik. "Bangladesh will earn considerable revenues by facilitating movement of travellers and transportation of merchandise from other nations through the highway. At the same time, the sea ports of Chittagong and Mongla will be able to handle more cargo. "Bangladesh's policy of cooperation and networking with the Southeast Asian countries will be easier once the country is linked up with the Asian Highway. "If we can set up a deep sea port off Chittagong in the future, there will be manifold increase in trade through the proposed highway," Hossain said. In his answer to a complementary question, the minister said, "We'd like to see the Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane motorway construction project taking off before the year is out." Hossain told Naogaon-6 MP Md Israfil Alam on a question that steps had been taken to recruit manpower for 6,058 class III and 6,150 class IV jobs with Bangladesh Railway. Answering Comilla-8 MP Nasimul Alam Chowdhury on what measures the government has taken so far to curb extortions in the public transport sector, the minister said that the home ministry had been told to take legal steps against the extortionists. The highway police have strengthened their patrols, he said and added that mobile courts have been commissioned too. In addition, the transport owners' and workers' organisations also have been requested to cooperate in combating extortion in the transport sector. He told Kishoreganj-3 MP Md Mujibul Haque that works for implementing the proposed Padma bridge construction project have made considerable progress with funds being mobilised for land acquisition compensations. The funds are being transferred to the deputy commissioners in the districts of the project site, he added. The final design for the bridge has also been completed and a decision has been taken to engage local NGOs in implementing the rehabilitation of the people who will be affected by land acquisition for the project, the communication minister said. The Padma bridge construction may kick off in 2010 and will be completed in Sep 2013, he added. The minister also said the government has taken initiatives to undertake construction of a four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway and build a new Chittagong-Cox's Bazaar railway. Answering a written question, Hossain said the process of commissioning another passenger train, 'Dhoomketu', on the Dhaka-Jessore railway route has been underway while another new train will be running on this route after the Eid. bdnewsd24
