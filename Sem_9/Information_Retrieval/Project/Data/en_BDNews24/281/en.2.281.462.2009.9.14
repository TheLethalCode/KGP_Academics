 KABUL, Sep 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's upper house of parliament has condemned the release of an Afghan journalist who was sentenced to 20 years in jail for blasphemy and was granted asylum in an undisclosed country.

Under Islamic law -- stipulated in Afghanistan's constitution -- blasphemy is punishable by death. Kambakhsh's release came after a number of Western leaders pressured President Hamid Karzai's government to grant him freedom. The upper house of parliament said in a statement on Monday the release of the 24 year-old reporter who worked for the Jahan-e Now daily newspaper was contrary to Islamic values. "The members of Meshrano Jirga (Upper House) expressed concern that this was not the first time a person sentenced for apostasy and impiety with the cooperation of anti-Islamic organisations is freed from punishment," it said the statement, adding that Kambakhsh should have been punished. The parliament "emphatically advises the responsible authorities, in particular the presidency" not to aquit people such as Kambakhsh "under the order of Islam's enemies", referring to Western countries operating in Afghanistan.
