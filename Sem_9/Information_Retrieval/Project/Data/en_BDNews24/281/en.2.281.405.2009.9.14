 Dhaka, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)--A citizens' committee, tied to left-leaning political parties, enforced on Monday a half-day general strike from 6am in capital Dhaka, despite requests from businesses and the government to call off the shutdown, the first such political strike since the Awami League government came to power in January. The government has also warned that law enforcers will thwart any move to create anarchy in the name of hartal. Shop owners, meanwhile, have said they will remain open as they cannot afford to lose business in the lead-up to Eid. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, has called the strike to protest the government's recently announced gas exploration deals with international companies. The pressure group will stage demonstrations and siege programme at the offices of the deputy commissioners and upazila nirbahi officers across the country. The Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) and the Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal (BSD) in separate statements on Sunday asked their supporters to help enforce the hartal in the capital. The government on Aug 24 approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow Oil Ltd in three sea blocks of the resource-rich Bay. The pressure group, and left parties, say a provision in the off-shore deals allows the foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of extracted gas, which constitutes a threat to the energy security of Bangladesh. Monday's strike has also been called to protest what the committee said was an "unwarranted police attack" on its members, including member secretary and economics teacher Professor Anu Muhammad, on Sep 2 when its supporters were on way to besiege the headquarters of Petrobangla, the state-owned exploration authority. The home minister on Sunday made a last call for the committee to withdraw the general strike, but said the government would not hinder a peaceful protest. Leading business organisations such as the FBCCI and the BGMEA also urged the committee to call off the hartal, citing the damages it inflicts on the economy following similar calls by ruling Awami League and its smaller left associates. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), on the other hand, extended its support to the strikers. The national committee asked for public support ahead of the planned hartal. "It was called to protect present and future generations of Bangladesh," convener of the committee Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah and member secretary Prof Anu Muhammad said in a joint statement on Saturday. BSD convener Comrade Khalequzzaman, in a statement on Sunday, asked the people to "build up a mass resistance against the attacks on committee supporters as well as smuggling of national resources". The CPB also asked its supporters to make Monday's strike a success. Shop owners say will stay open Dhaka Metropolitan Shop Owners' Association has said their members will open their outlets on Monday despite the half-day general strike. "There is no way our members can close their shops on Monday; this is the period when most people do their Eid shopping and closing would cause chaos," Mohammed Helaluddin, general secretary of the shop owners association, told bdnews24.com. He said the association had not formally made the decision, but the media was being informed that members would likely open their shops during the strike. 'Call off strike' Home minister Sahara Khatun asked for a halt to the hartal programme, but said the government would not thwart the protest as long as it remains peaceful, but any move to create anarchy would be resisted. She made the comment at a meeting on law and order at the Secretariat. Sahara said the national committee had called the strike over a "trifling matter", and leaders of shop owners association would not be happy with the shutdown as it would hamper their businesses during a busy period ahead of Eid. She said the committee's demand could be discussed in dialogue. "Place your demand to be resolved through dialogue. Calling strike ahead of Eid and Puja is not acceptable," she said. She asked the law enforces to stay alert so that no untoward incident could take place. BNP voices support The main opposition BNP, however, reaffirmed support for the hartal on Sunday and said it would support programmes designed to protest any move against the Bangladesh's interest. Delwar accused the government of acting against national interest by handing over gas blocks to foreign companies. "As we are supporting the strike, now some  are blaming us for instigating the strike," Delwar told party activists at a discussion. "But BNP will continue supporting any move against national interest," he added. Businesses demand ignored BGMEA added its voice on Sunday to those calling for cancellation of the planned strike. A statement by the trade body said garment owners were trying to pay wages and allowances to its workers ahead of Eid and a hartal could hamper the payment process. It also said the growth of the sector has been negative in the face of global recession, and shutdowns would only add to strains on the RMG industry and the economy. The country's apex business body, FBCCI, in a statement on Saturday, also opposed the planned hartal. It said the reasons cited for the strike could be resolved through discussions and did not require such action. FBCCI said the strike would hamper public life as well as business. FBCCI said it was on the side of ensuring the highest level of transparency and neutrality in awarding off-shore exploration deals to foreign companies. It hoped agreement would be reached peacefully over this national issue to maintain a stable economic and safeguard business activities. 'Talk, don't strike' Former adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan also spoke on the issue Sunday. He said those who called the hartal should engage the government in constructive dialogue, while the government should clarify its position on gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal. "It's more important to dialogue with the government than calling a hartal on the streets of the capital," Khan told reporters after attending a seminar in the city. Suspension police personnel A memorandum signed by over 20 civil society leaders has called for immediate suspension of police personnel involved in the alleged police assault on Prof Anu Muhammad. "We believe a democratic country should allow freedom of expression and association, and such behaviour from law enforcement agencies should not go unaccounted or unpunished," said a statement signed by Dr Meghna Guhathakurta, on behalf of 24 civil society members issued Saturday. The statement also called for an independent and impartial investigation into the incident as "no information was made available to the public" on steps taken by the government to date. bd
