 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina personally requested leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia to return to parliament on Thursday as the two leaders, who rarely meet face to face, attended an armed forces iftar programme at Senakunja in Dhaka Cantonment. Hasina arrived at around 7pm, while Khaleda had reached there a little earlier. The two leaders, both seated at the top table with chiefs of the three armed forces, exchanged pleasantries. Hasina was flanked by the navy chief at her left side and the army chief, air chief, speaker and opposition leader Khaleda on her right. Khaleda greeted Hasina, asking, "How are you?" Hasina replied with the request, "Come back to parliament." At a later point, Hasina, turning to speaker Abdul Hamid, said within earshot of others present: "Please make her understand, so that she returns to parliament." Hasina left Senakunja at 7:30pm while Khaleda departed the programme at 7:50pm. The occasion marked only the third time the two have met following their separate releases from special jails in 2008. Last year saw the two, oft-times bitter rivals, also sharing a table at an Armed Forces Day ceremony during the caretaker government. In a more recent meeting this year, Khaleda visited Hasina's Sudha Sadan home to offer condolences on the death of the prime minister's husband Dr M Wazed Miah in May. Khaleda's main opposition party BNP has been absent from the House, with exception of a few days, since the new parliament convened in January, ostensibly due to a dispute over seating arrangements. bd
