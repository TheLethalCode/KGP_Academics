<TITLE> Saber places bill to stop 'crossfire' killings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury has placed a bill in parliament proposing life-term sentence to perpetrators of killings in custody of law-enforcement agencies. Chowdhury brought the bill in the wake of a recent spate of killings of a number of alleged criminals by elite force RAB and police in so-called 'crossfire' and 'encounters'. Another militant outlaw was killed in alleged shootout with police and RAB early on Thursday in Kushtia, taking the total number of dead to eight in the last two weeks. The MP presented two bills -- Torture and Custody Death (Prevention) Bill 2009 and Resisting Eviction of Slum Dwellers from Government Land Bill 2009, which have been sent for scrutiny to the relevant parliamentary committees. In his written statement, Chowdhury said: "The state organisations, particularly the law enforcers forget the basic rights of people. It cannot be possible to ensure justice in many cases. "People are tortured on various excuses through the administration and police forces. They face brutal torture at various times under the custody of law. Even deaths are taking place frequently in security custody." The former AL organising secretary in his bill proposed life term and at least Tk 1 lakh fine for the perpetrators if found guilty. Home minister Sahara Khatun has claimed that no extra-judicial killing was taking place during the crackdown in the southwest. "Those who are getting killed are dying in gun battles with the police and RAB," she said last Sunday. 'Odhikar', a human rights organisation, said at least 19 people were killed in August across the country in so-called 'crossfire, encounter or gunfight'. Of the deceased, 10 allegedly belonged to different underground militant outfits. According to available figures, a total 577 people died in 472 'crossfire' incidents across the country since RAB was constituted on March 26, 2004. The High Court on June 29 ordered the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. It also asked why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Former state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed had said the RAB had launched a departmental investigation into the death of the two students. According to rights group Odhikar, 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past decades have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bdnews24.
