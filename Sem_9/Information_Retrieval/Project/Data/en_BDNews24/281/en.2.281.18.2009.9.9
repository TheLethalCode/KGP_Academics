<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)State minister for liberation war affairs A B Tajul Islam was forced on Wednesday to retract a statement that the military had led the nation's war of independence from Pakistan. The remarks of Islam, a retired captain, touched off uproar and chaos in the House for about 15 minutes. The minister finally said it was a "political war and it took place under a political leadership". Tajul Islam was answering to a question from Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal MP Moinuddin Khan Badal, who asked whether the government would introduce a new honorary award for those leaders who organised the war but did not took arms. The minister said some civilian freedom fighters apart from the members of the armed forces were given gallantry awards for their role. Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, for instance, got an award -- Bir Bikram, the third highest gallantry award -- he said. As the minister said: "Since the liberation war took place under military leadership...", the MPs started shouting their protest. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, a retired colonel who was presiding over the session, failed to calm the situation. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was not present in the House then. A K M Mozammel, Shamsur Rahman Sharif, Fazle Rabbi Mian, Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, Dhirendra Nath Shambhu, Israfil Alam, K M Khalid and others started shouting at the top of their voices. The frustrated minister sat down at one stage. Deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury took floor and urged the chair to dispose of the matter. Ali then clarified Badal's question: "The question was whether the government would introduce separate gallantry awards for those leaders who organised the war of independence, but did not fight in the battlefield. "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and four national leaders will be in the category," said the deputy speaker. The minister then said, "I fought the war as a student and got commissioned in the armed forces after the war. "It was a political war and it took place under the political leadership." Islam said a new award could be introduced for the organisers if the nation wanted. "I will place a proposal before the government to honour the organisers of the war of independence." Fazle Rabbi Mian continued his uproar despite the minister's assurance and demanded that the statement be expunged. The deputy speaker said the demand had already been met. "This is too much," he said. bd
