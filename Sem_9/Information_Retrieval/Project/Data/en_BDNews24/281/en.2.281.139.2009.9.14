<TITLE> UN must empower IAEA, avoid more sanctions : ElBaradei </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA , Sep 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog urged the UN Security Council on Monday to give it more powers to prevent the spread of atom bomb know-how and avoid relying on sanctions he said often did not work. Mohamed ElBaradei's call was a clear reference to the case of Iran, which is expanding a declared uranium enrichment programme without clarifying allegations of illicit nuclear weapons research. He spoke as state television in Iran, which is shrugging off the threat of harsher sanctions, said it and six world powers trying to resolve the standoff over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme would launch talks in early October. Iran last week handed over a package of proposals in which it said it was ready to discuss global nuclear disarmament and other international issues, but not its own nuclear activity, despite US insistence the issue will be raised. ElBaradei, outgoing chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, welcomed the US offer to revive dialogue with Iran without preconditions. But he suggested threats of tougher sanctions on Iran if the talks fizzled would go nowhere. "We must keep open the channels of communication with those with whom we have issues that need to be resolved rather than seeking to isolate them," ElBaradei said in an address opening the annual meeting of 150 IAEA member nations. He said IAEA anti-proliferation inspectors could not do their job "in isolation" but depended on political support from the Security Council. He urged it to give the IAEA greater means to enforce nuclear transparency by problematic member states. SANCTIONS OFTEN MISFIRE, ELBARADEI SAYS "The Council needs to develop a comprehensive compliance mechanism that does not rely only on sanctions, which too often hurt the vulnerable and the innocent," ElBaradei said, referring to the example of Saddam Hussein's Iraq and to North Korea. "It must focus more on conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacemaking, and address the insecurities that lie behind many cases of proliferation, such as mistrust and conflict." Praising new US and Russian initiatives to reduce atomic arsenals, he said: "As we hopefully move towards nuclear disarmament, states should expand and strengthen the agency's verification mandate." Iran is one of dozens of countries which have failed to adopt a voluntary IAEA protocol allowing snap inspections ranging beyond declared nuclear sites -- a measure critical to ferreting out suspicions of covert atomic bomb activity. Iran says it is enriching uranium only for electricity generation. The West suspects Iran's latent purpose with the dual-use nuclear technology is the ability to fuel atom bombs. ElBaradei said six years of arduous IAEA investigation had provided a better grasp of Iran's "civil" nuclear programme concealed from the agency for 18 years in violation of Iran's IAEA safeguards agreement. But he reiterated that Iran's stonewalling of requests for IAEA access to check credible intelligence reports pointing to military nuclear dimensions to the programme was unacceptable. "If we are to restore confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, Iran needs to engage substantively with the Agency to clarify ... the difficult and important questions regarding the authenticity of information relating to alleged weaponization studies," he said. Japan's Yukiya Amano, who succeeds ElBaradei on Dec. 1 and has vowed to pursue cases of alleged nuclear proliferation like Iran's, said the spread of atomic weapons and nuclear terrorism was an increasing threat for the international community. "It is unlikely that this trend will ever be reversed, but rather it will continue to accelerate," the 62-year-old diplomat said in his first address to the IAEA. The agency must be both a watchdog and promoter of peaceful uses of the atom to tackle growing security risks, he s
