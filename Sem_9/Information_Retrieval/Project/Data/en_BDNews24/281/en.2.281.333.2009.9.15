 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)--The government will consider financial assistance to facilitate establishment of a private technical institute to train up the unemployed people, the labour and employment minister told parliament on Tuesday. "The government will consider financial assistance if any private entrepreneur moves to set up a technical institute for the training of the illiterate and half-educated unemployed people," Khandker Musharraf Hossain said in a reply to a query from Chittagong-10 MP M A Latif. There are currently 65 lakh Bangladeshis abroad. He said the expatriates had sent $901 billion in 2008, equal to Tk 62,210 crore. Four banks offer loans for employment in foreign countries, the minister said. Replying to another query, Hossain said the government does not collect any data on expatriate workers on upazila basis. bdnews
