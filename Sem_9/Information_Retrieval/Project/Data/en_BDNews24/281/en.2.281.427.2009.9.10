 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina requested leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia to return to parliament on Thursday as the two, who rarely meet face to face, attended an armed forces iftar programme at Senakunja in Dhaka Cantonment. The two leaders shared pleasantries, before addressing the issue of the opposition's unofficial boycott of parliament. Hasina arrived at the venue at around 7pm, while Khaleda had reached there a little earlier. Khaleda's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com that the BNP chairperson went up to the prime minister as the latter was exchanging greetings with other guests on her arrival. They exchanged greetings before Hasina came straight to the point and asked Khaleda, "Come back to parliament." Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, said her party wanted to return to the House. "We want to assist the government. But the government has refused our assistance." At a later point, when all were seated, Hasina, turning to speaker Abdul Hamid at her table, said within earshot of others present: "Please make her understand, so that she returns to parliament." The two political rivals shared the same table at the meal, Hasina flanked by the navy chief at her left side and the army chief, air chief, speaker and Khaleda on her right. Hasina left Senakunja at 7:30pm while Khaleda departed the programme at 7:50pm. The occasion marked only the third time the two have met following their separate releases from special jails in 2008. Last year saw the two, often described as bitter political opponents, also met at an Armed Forces Day ceremony during the caretaker government. In a more recent meeting this year, Khaleda visited Hasina's Sudha Sadan home to offer condolences on the death of the prime minister's husband Dr M Wazed Miah in May. Khaleda's main opposition party BNP has been absent from the House, with exception of a few days, since the new parliament convened in January, ostensibly due to a dispute over seating arrangements. bd
