<TITLE> Delhi doing its bit to reduce trade gap: Chakravarty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)India's offer to assist Bangladesh in certifying more goods for export could help reduce the trade gap between the two neighbours, Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty said on Tuesday. Bangladesh's trade deficit with India was continuing to widen despite duty-free access on selected Bangladeshi goods to the neighbouring country, Chakravarty said at a trade fair organised by Indian export promotion council, CAPEXIL, at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries office in the city. He said India had removed duty on around 480 items imported from Bangladesh, although the goods were still subject to domestic taxes and VAT, but the trade gap had grown to $300 million, from only $60 million five years ago. Chakravarty said modernising the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) would help raise Bangladeshi goods up to international export standards. "India has offered to assist Bangladesh with experts and technical support to BSTI that would help certify export oriented products, especially food items," said Chakravarty. He requested the Indian trade delegation to invest in the growing Bangladesh economy through joint ventures. Also attending the event, state minister for Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs, Dipankar Talukder, said the government was fully committed to reducing the trade deficit between the two countries through a range of bilateral initiatives. "Bangladesh has a huge potential for investment, where 40 percent of industrial raw materials are imported from India," said Talukder. Talukder said according to the Board of Investment, 181 proposals from Indian companies, worth a potential $460 million, in the agricultural, textile, chemical and engineering sectors were currently under scrutiny. "Some 57 Indian enterprises are already operating in the country," he said. The state minister said SAARC should be strengthened to provide "a powerful trade group" that can compete effectively in the global market. The CAPEXIL trade delegation showcased Indian manufactured goods including marble tiles, glass, chemicals products, printing ink and paper. CAPEXIL is a non-profit making organisation sponsored by the Indian ministry of commerce and industry.
