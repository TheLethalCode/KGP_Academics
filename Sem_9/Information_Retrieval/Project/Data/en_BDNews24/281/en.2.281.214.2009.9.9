<TEXT>
 MANILA , Sep 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The son of former Philippine President Cory Aquino, heroine of the 1986 people power movement, said on Wednesday he would run for the presidency next May. Senator Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino's decision to join the presidential race is likely to win the backing of several opposition groups, propelling him to a place among the front-runners for the post.

Days and weeks after Cory's death, people had left hundreds of flowers and dozens of messages outside the family home in the Quezon City suburb, urging Noynoy to run. Noynoy's father, Benigno, was a senator who opposed Marcos and was killed when he returned home from political exile in 1983. Earl Parreno, an analyst at the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms, said Aquino was the only contender capable of winning a populist following. "He can improve his chances of winning the elections next May if he will not be held hostage by a traditional political party. His campaign must be perceived to be supported by a broad-based movement," Parreno s
