 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)Central bank governor Atiur Rahman told global banking conference in Indian on Tuesday that the region should take the collapse of financial markets in the West as a lesson in fashioning its financial sector regulatory and supervisory regimes. He also said Bangladesh had largely escaped the worst fallout of the global downturn, despite foreign direct investment outflow of $159 million in the last financial year, because of "limited and regulated external openness of the economy". "The financial sector in Bangladesh suffered no contagion from the global financial turmoil," Rahman said in his keynote address at the Conference on Global Banking at Mumbai's Grand Hyatt Hotel. The conference brought together high-level financial experts and policy makers from around the world to address issues impacting the financial sector and develop strategies in the wake of global recession. Rahman said rather than being afflicted by the credit crunch Bangladesh markets remained awash with liquidity from balance of payment current account surpluses. He said growth in inflows of workers' remittances in the last financial year stood at 22.4 percent and export receipts at 10.1 percent, well in excess of the tepid 4.6 percent growth in import payments. "Apart from a net foreign direct investment (FDI) outflow of $159 million in financial year-09 there has been no additional outflow pressure attributable to the global crisis, as resident corporations have no short term external borrowing exposure other than normal trade credit," said Rahman. Addressing the global picture, however, Rahman said shortcomings in financial systems were now under intense scrutiny throughout the world. He said "placid stability" of preceding years had lulled institutions, markets and regulators into complacency and inaction regarding mounting global imbalances. "Risk-taking in large globally active financial institutions was prompted by quest of quick private gains for small inner circles in top managements and boards," he said. The central bank governor stressed Bangladesh remained committed to meeting "global best practice" in the financial sector through reforms in regulation and supervision in line with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Rahman said current supervision routines in Bangladesh allowed for early warning to banks with deteriorating trends, and recent steps intended to build adequate pool of "stress testing capabilities". "In view of recent trend of increasing engagement of commercial banks in capital market activities, oversight on their regulatory compliance in this area has been intensified," he said. Rahman said BB had urged banks to upgrade their IT platforms, and the central bank itself was undergoing similar changes. "Smaller developing economies should have opportunity for representation in these global consultations, to voice their needs and concerns," said the BB governor.
