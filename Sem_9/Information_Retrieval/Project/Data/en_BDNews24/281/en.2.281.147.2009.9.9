 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has promised to investigate controversy surrounding BGMEA, after the trade body demanded a huge incentive package in the face of global recession and claimed inability to pay workers wages and bonuses ahead of Eid without it. "Their attempt to gain financial assistance, and the chaos it inflamed in the industry, is ill-motivated," Hasina told the House during prime minister's question time on Wednesday. "We are now investigating the matter," she said. On Sept 3, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association demanded the government give the sector a massive cash injection of Tk 30 billion (3,000 crore) by Sept 7warning that thousands of garment workers would otherwise go without salaries and bonuses ahead of Eideven though the sector saw exports grow 4 percent above projections last year. Finance minister AMA Muhith immediately dismissed the demand and said it had been "improper" for the organisation to link any recession or stimulus package with wages and bonuses prior to Eid. The BGMEA later admitted "error" and made a full apology on Monday for the controversial ultimatum, which drew flack from government, workers and a fellow trade body. BGMEA a leader said "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted the demand. The demand, however, sparked incidents of unrest among garment workers last week, in a sector which has seen its fair share of industrial strife in recent months, most memorably worker riots in Savar in June that left two workers dead and a factory burned to the ground. Hasina said on Wednesday that garment factory owners were responsible for security of the industry as well as the government, and those behind recent chaos in the sector would be identified. The prime minister was replying to a supplementary question from Fazlul Azim, an independent MP, who also requested information on formation of a proposed industrial police force to curb sporadic violence in the garment sector. The prime minister said she would look into the issue. bdnew
