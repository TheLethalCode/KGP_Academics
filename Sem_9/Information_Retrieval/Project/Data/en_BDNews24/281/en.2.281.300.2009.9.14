<TITLE> Osama bin Laden warns Americans on tape: website </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden issued an apparently new audio tape on an Islamist website on Monday, warning the American people over their government's close ties to Israel. The message, entitled "A statement to the American people", was approximately 10 minutes long and appeared on a website often used by supporters of al Qaeda. The same website said earlier this month it would soon carry a "present" to Muslims from bin Laden, who is thought to be hiding in the mountainous terrain along the Afghan-Pakistani border, on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan. The message comes a few days after the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks carried out by al Qaeda operatives in 2001 in which nearly 3,000 people died in the United States. In his last previous known message in June, bin Laden said US President Barack Obama had planted the seeds of "revenge and hatred" towards the United States in the Muslim world. Those remarks were issued just before a major speech by Obama who said he sought a "new beginning" between the United States and the Muslim community
