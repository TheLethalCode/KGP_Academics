<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)Markets gained substantially Wednesday due to an investors buying spree, which saw around 75 percent of traded issues close up. Marico Bangladesh Ltd debuted with its price closing more than thirty times its face value. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark general index surged just over 52 points, while the Chittagong bourse's selective categories index ended 23 points up. Brokerage house officials said investors were in the mood to buy, as many repositioned their portfolios. "We dealt with a lot of buying orders today," an official of brokerage firm Akij Securities told bdnews24.com. Mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed said: "People took a position on their portfolios ahead of Eid from profits made earlier through buying." Meanwhile, MBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Marico Limited India, well known for its flagship brand Parachute Coconut Oil, started trading on the Dhaka and Chittagong bourses with a strong performance. The company, which bottles and markets coconut oil, floated almost 3 million ordinary shares. The offer price of each share was fixed at Tk 90, with a face-value of Tk 10 and premium of Tk 80. Earlier, it disclosed its diluted earnings per-share at Tk 6.09, and a paid-up capital of Tk 315 million. Its price reached Tk 368, but subsequently fell, ending on Tk 351.50. Observers termed the price "irrational". "The price of shares may rise by 3 or 4 times, but 30 times is ridiculous," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former DSE chief executive. Lack of share supply and too many 'speculator-gamblers' in the market is the reason behind the abnormal hike, added Salahuddin. Market participators suggested implementing demand-based pricing methods to avoid the unhealthy trend. "Actually all issues should come through book building, only then can this behaviour be prevented," said Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, turnover on the premier bourse rose to Tk 5.42 billion from Tuesday's Tk 4.82 billion. Gainers outnumbered losers 183 to 57, with no issues remaining unchanged. Market bellwether, banks, closed mixed with low price deviation, with power and energy shares following. Mutual funds continued their rise, with most non-banking financial institutions edging up. The day turned out to be a good one for insurers as prices saw a strong hike along with IT shares. Meanwhile, all pharmaceutical shares gained except Beximco Pharma and Ibn Sina. State-owned entity Titas Gas topped the turnover board with shares of Tk 342.957 million changing hands, crawling up 0.74 percent to close at Tk 672.75. The rush on Marico left it the second turnover leader, with shares of Tk 325.811 million traded. Turnover on Maksons Spinning Mills reached Tk 169.487 million, closing at Tk 63.50, up 5.30 percent. Beximco edged down 0.14 percent to Tk 275; its turnover reached Tk 156.197 million. Summit Power ended 0.60 percent lower to Tk 1316.75, seeing Tk 155.376 million in turnover. Among other scrips on the turnover board  Grameen Mutual Fund One, Bex Tex, Grameen Mutual Fund One: Scheme 2 and ACI rose . Profit-taking caused Navan CNG to fall from the previous day
