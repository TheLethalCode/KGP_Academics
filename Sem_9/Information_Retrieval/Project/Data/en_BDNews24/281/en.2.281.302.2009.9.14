 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)A taskforce formed by the government to deal with impact of the global recession on Bangladesh is scheduled to meet for only the second time in six months, on Sept 16, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Sunday. "The meeting will determine how best to use the budgetary allocation of a Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package for financial year 2009-10 to cushion impact of the recession on the economy," Muhith, who also heads the taskforce, told bdnews24.com. Muhith said the upcoming meeting would determine requirements for a possible 'second phase stimulus package' to shield the country from impact of the worldwide recession. "The stimulus package announced in April will be reviewed if the situation requires," said Muhith. The finance minister said the stimulus package was an ongoing process and would provide temporary financial support to worst hit sectors of the economy. "The package will not, however, stretch to sectors that are seen to be managing well without support," Muhith said. The government formed the 27-member recession taskforce, which includes politicians, economists and business representatives, on March 18. It held its first meeting on March 24. In April, the government announced a proposed stimulus package of Tk 3,424 crore, based on recommendations of the meeting. However, the two major trade bodies of the garment industry, the BGMEA and BKMEA, were highly critical as the huge export earning RMG sector was excluded altogether from the proposed package. The trade bodies later welcomed the revised Tk 5,000 crore package included in the FY 2009-10 budget, although they again expressed concern the RMG sector still received no specific allcoation. On Sept 3, BGMEA president Salam Murshedi said the sector required its own financial package of Tk 3,000 crore by Sep 7 to salvage the industry and help clear worker wages and allowances ahead of Eid. The trade body's demand generated widespread criticism from trade unions, the government and even fellow trade bodies. Workers also took to streets to protest the statement and demand immediate payment of dues. The finance minister dismissed the BGMEA demand outright, saying it had been "improper" for the organisation to link a stimulus package with wages and allowances prior to Eid. The BGMEA later issued an apology for their request, saying "mistakes in language" and "frustration deriving from the global recession" had prompted their appeal. Taskforce member and BKMEA president Fazlul Haq told bdnews24.com his organisation would like to see the recession taskforce include some initiatives specifically for the RMG sector in its second meeting. "We will ask for a five percent subsidy on our total exports in the second meeting of the taskforce to compensate our losses," said Haq. Speaking Sunday, Muhith said the global economic slowdown had little impact on the Bangladesh economy and was unlikely to worsen in future. The upcoming taskforce meeting is scheduled to be held at the NEC conference room. bdnew
