<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Sep 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's president began talks on Tuesday expected to result in Saad al-Hariri being nominated for a second time to form a government -- a task seen as complicated by rising political tension. President Michel Suleiman began receiving Lebanon's 128 lawmakers at his palace overlooking Beirut on Tuesday. He is obliged to designate the figure with the most support among MPs. The consultations conclude on Wednesday. Hariri, a US- and Saudi-backed billionaire businessman, is expected to be nominated by members of his parliamentary majority coalition, which defeated a rival alliance including the Syria- and Iran-backed Hezbollah in a June election.

"It appears that we are at great odds and the tone is escalatory," he said, in reference to Hariri. Neither Hezbollah or Aoun nominated Hariri in June. Politicians say the deadlock reflects a relapse in ties between Saudi Arabia and Syria, states with great influence in Lebanon and whose rivalries have fuelled political instability and violence in the country over the past four years. Rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh this year has helped Lebanon enjoy its longest spell of political stability since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, Saad's father. But the postponement of a visit Saudi's King Abdullah was due to make to Damascus has signalled a freeze in the rapprochement.
