 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has warned of "ongoing efforts" to repeat incidents similar to the BDR bloodbath to reverse the democratic strides. In her address to parliament, marking the International Day of Democracy on Tuesday, the prime minister urged the main opposition BNP to return to the House for the sake of democracy. Also, she urged people to safeguard hard-earned democracy. Hasina alleged that an artificial crisis of sugar has been stirred up and her administration has had information on the conspiracy. "Conspiracy is on to disrupt the democratic practice. We have to remain alert so that no-one can foil the hard-earned democracy." Hasina said urging the main opposition BNP to return to the house. She said power usurpers had created a "special group" of people and positioned them at different places. "Obstructions are coming from them. People will have to be cautious so that none can snatch the restored democracy," Hasina said. She said her government tackled the BDR mutiny efficiently. "Conspiracies will be on to make incidents like the BDR mutiny happen in future. "People will have to remain alert so that their voting rights are protected; democracy remains secure." Chief whip Abdus Shahid proposed that the House held a discussion on democracy. Awami League's Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Fazle Rabbi Mian and Abdul Matin Khasru, and Bangladesh Workers' Party's Rashed Khan Menon took part in the discussion. In his speech, Sheikh Selim bitterly criticised the United Nations for its "weak role" in facilitating continuation of democratic practices in Bangladesh. "It is easy to say good words. "Where was the UN when the father of the nation Bangabndhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975? "The killers of Bangabandhu have been living in different countries. "I urge the UN to extradite the killers since the government has re-started the process of trying the killers," Selim said. Menon alleged that The UN office in Bangladesh was used during the Jan 11, 2007 changeover. bdnews
