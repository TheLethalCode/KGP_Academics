 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com) Health minister A F M Ruhal Haque has urged people to come to public hospitals for treatment for swine flu. The minister, in parliament Wednesday, also ruled out allegations that the flu drugs were being sold at higher prices. "We have a stock of 20 lakh doses of swine flu drug. All the government hospitals will treat the swine flu patients free of cost. "So, please come to government hospitals," Haque told parliament while replying to a notice on swine flu situation in Bangladesh. Jatiya Party MP Noor-e-Hasna Lily Chowdhury served the public interest notice. The health minister dismissed Lily's allegation that the companies were selling swine flu drugs at Tk 800 per capsule instead of Tk 190. "The private sector people used to sell the drug at Tk 190 per piece. After I requested them, they lowered the price to Tk 150," the minister said. He said at most three people died of the H1N1 virus infection and 311 patients were detected. As many as 2,185 people died of the virus globally since its outbreak in Mexico, Haque said. Bangladesh government was working with the international community to fight swine flu, he said and added that he was heading a national committee to monitor the situation. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told the House during PM's Questions that the government was taking adequate precautions to combat spread of the virus and was in contact with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. b
