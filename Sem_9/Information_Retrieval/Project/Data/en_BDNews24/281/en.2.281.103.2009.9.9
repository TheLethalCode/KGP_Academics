<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has deferred by more than a month the proceedings of a petition by former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar challenging the formation of a parliamentary committee to probe graft allegations. A special High Court bench of justices Tariq Ul Hakim and Borhan Uddin set Oct 14 for a hearing, on request for more time by both sides, as none of the previously appointed amici curiae could appear in court on Wednesday. The court appointed another two lawyers, Ajmalul Hossain QC and Supreme Court Bar Association president AFM Mesbahuddin, as amicus curiae, or advisers to the court for resolving the petition. The court had earlier appointed five amici for the petition. Of them, former attorney general Mahmudul Islam and Dr M Zahir could not appear as they are overseas, while barrister Rafique Ul Haque and AF Hassan Ariff have declined the appointment. The fifth, advocate Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, was unable to appear in court Wednesday due to illness Speaker Abdul Hamid on March 22 constituted an 11-member all-party parliamentary probe committee, headed by Fazle Rabbi Miah MP, to investigate allegations against Sircar of misconduct during his term as speaker. The committee after investigation reported that the allegations, including misappropriation of parliamentary funds, were substantiated, and on July 5 recommended cancelling his parliamentary seat and taking legal measures. Jamiruddin Sircar filed the petition on August 16 with the High Court challenging the formation of the committee, its proceedings and recommendations. bdnew
