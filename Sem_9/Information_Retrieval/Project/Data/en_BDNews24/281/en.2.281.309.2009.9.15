 VIENNA, Sep 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian nuclear energy chief Ali Akbar Salehi said he had agreed new measures of cooperation with UN inspectors during talks on Tuesday with the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA did not comment immediately on the deal which coincides with a diplomatic thaw between Iran and world powers, signaled by a plan for talks on October 1, and which was prompted by rising concern about Iran's drive for nuclear capability.

This is just like a movie which is very consistent and comprehensive but at the end it is a fiction," Salehi said, speaking in English. "We are not here to prove the fictional movie is real..." Iran has said it is enriching uranium only for electricity, not to perfect means to fuel atom bombs as the West fears. Iran has agreed to wide-ranging talks with six world powers, likely to be held in Turkey. It has ruled out discussing its own nuclear activities, but Salehi said on Monday the powers could still raise any question they wished at the ta
