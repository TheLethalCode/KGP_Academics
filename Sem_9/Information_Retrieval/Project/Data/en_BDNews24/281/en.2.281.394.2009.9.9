<TITLE> Merkel urges Afghans to take bigger security role </TITLE>

 BERLIN, Sep 9 (bdnews24.comReuters) - Afghans must shoulder more of the security burden in their country, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday, seeking to defuse a row over Berlin's role in Afghanistan three weeks before a German election. Merkel rejected criticism of an air strike on two fuel trucks near Kunduz last week which Afghan officials say killed scores of people, including many civilians, and which had been instigated by German troops. The strike was the most deadly operation involving German troops since World War Two and has catapulted the subject of Afghanistan into the campaign for the Sept. 27 election. "Now is the right moment, together with the new Afghanistan leadership, to set out at the end of this year how the transfer of responsibility will happen," Merkel told parliament. A majority of Germans want Germany's 4,200 troops operating in Afghanistan as part of a six-year old NATO mission to come home and with violence there on the rise, support for the deployment is also waning in other Western nations. However, Germany's main parties all back the Afghanistan mission which means neither Merkel's conservatives nor her coalition partners and election rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD), are likely to score points with voters, say analysts. "The Afghanistan debate won't help either party very much because of the cross-party consensus on Afghanistan policy," said Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, head of EMNID pollsters. "Even Merkel and (SPD challenger Frank-Walter) Steinmeier agree," he added. PREMATURE JUDGMENT? Merkel said German troops still had a responsibility in Afghanistan but reiterated her call for an international conference this year to agree how to transfer responsibility for security which would allow NATO to reduce its troop levels. "The second presidential elections in Afghanistan mark the start of a new quality to the relations between the international community and Afghanistan," said Merkel. She said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nikolas Sarkozy agreed that decisions had to be made. Merkel said she regretted any loss of innocent lives and promised a full report about Friday's air strike which unleashed criticism from some NATO allies and domestic lawmakers. "We will not gloss over anything, but we will not accept any premature condemnation. I refuse to tolerate that, either from Germany or from abroad," she said on Tuesday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called the decision a major "error of judgment". Some NATO partners and German political foes have questioned the basis for the request for the strike and attacked the government, especially conservative Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung, for being too quick to say no civilians had been killed. "The (Defence Minister's) information policy can only be described as shocking," conservative defence expert Willy Wimmer told the Frankfurter Rundschau daily. Some opposition lawmakers have even urged Jung to resign. Earlier, the NATO-led force in Afghanistan said for the first time it believed civilians had been killed and injured. The only party advocating a withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan is a far-left grouping, the Left party, which has won over many disillusioned SPD voters in the last few years. Emnid's Schoeppner said he would not expect many SPD voters to jump ship to the Left at this stage due to the Afghan is
