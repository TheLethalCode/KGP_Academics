 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)--The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas Mineral Resources, Power and Ports has called a half-day hartal in Dhaka for Sep 14 in what will be the first general strike since the Awami League-led coalition government took office in January. Committee convener Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah announced the general strike from a rally at downtown Muktangan at 12:30pm. The hartal will be enforced to protest against the police attack on the demonstrators during their attempt to besiege Petrobangla headquarters on Sept 2 over recent exploration deals with two international companies at Bay that left dozens of people injured. The public protest group also declared countrywide demonstrations and siege programme of the offices of the deputy commissioners and upazila nirbahi officers on Sept 14. The committee members later marched on to lay seige to the prime minister's office. On Sep 2, dozens of activists including Prof Anu Muhammad, member secretary of the pressure group, were injured in the capital when police charged demonstrators with baton, who were trying to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over the off-shore exploration deals for three blocks. The government last month decided to award the three blocks to the US-based company ConocoPhillips and the Irish company Tullow Oil plcwith a provision of allowing them to export up to 80 percent of gas. The national committee launched the protest programme against the decision as it feared "such a move would threaten the energy security of Bangladesh, and, by extension, the very sovereignty of the country." The government has recently asked energy authorities not to allow any new gas connections since the country is facing up to 250 million cubic feet in shortages of gas each day. Currently, Sangu gas field, operated by Britain's Cairn Energy, is the country's lone operating offshore gas field. bd
