<TITLE> Harvard, Yale lose billions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Two of America's most prestigious universities lost billions of dollars last year, which could force them to further tighten their belts and cut benefits for students. Harvard and Yale disclosed last week that they had lost a substantial chunk of income in their endowments largely because of problems with their equity and hedge fund portfolios. According to news reports, Harvard's endowment dropped 27.3 percent in its latest fiscal year, wiping off $10 billion and shrinking its portfolio to $26 billion. To put it in perspective, the figure is $10 billion more than the annual budget of Bangladesh, which is currently estimated at $16 billion. Yale also suffered about a 30 percent loss in its endowment, to about $16 billion. A year earlier, Harvard's endowment had approached $37 billion, while Yale's endowment had been $23 billion. At Harvard, the loss is the biggest percentage decline in 40 years and has prompted a review of how it manages its money and allocates assets. Although other endowments at major universities suffered declines, many did better than Harvard and Yale, which have been known over the years for their investing prowess. The University of Pennsylvania, another Ivy League school, for example, was down 15.7 percent. A survey of foundations and endowments with assets of more than $1 billion by Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service found an average decline of 17 percent in fiscal 2009. Yale said that the publicly traded portion of its portfolio did not decline further from December through June, but that the illiquid portions in private equity and real estate continued to sag. Harvard had a large share of assets in private equity, about 13 percent of its total as recently as February. In good times these private funds return money as deals are completed. In the recent financial upheaval, not only did the returns dry up but the funds required investors like Harvard to meet their commitments to add new money, creating a cash squeeze. Harvard had been relying on the endowment for roughly one-third of its annual budget, and now plans to reduce that portion somewhat.
