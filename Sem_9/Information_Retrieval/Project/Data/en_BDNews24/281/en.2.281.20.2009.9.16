<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)--The government is moving to introduce a policy aimed at stopping random abuse of 'war of independence' and 'freedom fighter' credentials. "Many organisations using the names of war of independence and freedom fighters have mushroomed. People are setting up such organisations for personal gains," Rafiqul Islam Bir Uttam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on liberation war affairs ministry, said on Wednesday. "It should be stopped," he said at a news briefing after the committee meeting. "We have asked the ministry to stop the trend. The ministry has said it is formulating a policy," Islam said. Once the policy is there, one will have to get the government approval to open such organisations, he said. The committee also recommended reformation of board of directors of the Muktijoddha Kalyan Trust, an entity that provides financial aid to freedom fighters. "There should be a change in the board of directors since incompetent people are there," the committee chairman said. There are 42 not-for-profit organisations under the Trust. State minister for liberation war affairs ABM Tajul Islam and committee members Waresat Hossain Belal and Khan Tipu Sultan were present in the briefing. bdnew
