 TOKYO Sep 14,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister-elect Yukio Hatoyama may choose Masayuki Naoshima, the Democratic Party's policy chief, as finance minister instead of Hirohisa Fujii, a former finance ministry bureaucrat, Kyodo news agency reported on Monday.

Asahi TV said on Monday that Fujii might instead be given the post of deputy cabinet secretary, which would allow him to use his experience to support the prime minister. Naoshima, an upper house lawmaker and a former motor industry union official, has said the Democrat's spending plans on child allowances and expressway tolls can be funded by tapping government reserves and cutting waste, an idea dismissed by critics who say the reserves would quickly dry up. Naoshima said in July that the party's policies would raise economic growth by two percentage points in the fiscal year from April 2012.
