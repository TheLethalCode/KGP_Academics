<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)The home ministry will circulate a statement to clear all confusions and misgivings created by the BDR the chief using the new border force's new name before any official announcement, the state minister for home has said. "The ministry will issue a circular," Shamsul Haque Tuku said to reporters at the Secretariat on Wednesday. He, however, would not say when the statement would be issued. Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal MP Moinuddin Khan Badal demanded clarification from the home minister in parliament on Tuesday on what action the BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam would face for "changing the paramilitary force's name, uniform and insignia" on Eid greeting cards without government approval. The BDR boss distributed his official Eid cards this week, with 'Bangladesh Border Guards' inscribed on them instead of Bangladesh Rifles, which created waves of criticism from those who received them. AL MP Mirza Azam and Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque Chunnu in a parliamentary standing committee meeting demanded the government take measures against Gen Moinul for his "audacious" action. The decision was made to reform the border force, including a new name, insignia and uniform as well as organisational changes, following the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Over 70 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed during the uprising. The government has yet to finalise the reform measures. bdnews24.com/
