<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has unanimously opined against a military trial of BDR mutineers, a highly placed source hinted to bdnews24.com although the opinion has been kept under wraps. The opinion of the 11-member full bench of Appellate Division, headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin, on the reference seeking directives on the trial process, was sent to president Zillur Rahman on Thursday. The source, who asked to remain unnamed, said two of the judges made additional observations, but he would not divulge what those are. Earlier, Supreme Court registrar Shawkat Hossain told bdnews24.com that he handed the file containing the opinion to the president at around 12:45pm. Asked about the apex court's opinion, Hossain said: "The file was sealed. I cannot say anything about the content." State minister for law Kamrul Islam told reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday: "Whatever opinion the Supreme Court has given, it will have to be respected." "No-one should question this opinion." The president sent the reference to the court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the mutineers could be tried under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, advisers to the court', to advise on the reference. It began hearing on the reference on Aug 25, ending on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae observed that the BDR mutiny trial could not be held under the Army Act, even by notification. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided month to seek the chief justice's opinion as views varied widely on whether the mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, presenting the reference before the court on Aug 25, said the mutiny case filed in Dhaka saw 1, 779 people arrested so far. Another 40 cases filed in connection with BDR rebellions outside Dhaka saw 1, 721 persons arrested. A total 3,500 people are facing trial in the cases, said Alam. Majority against court martial Only two of the amici curiae spoke in favour of trial by Army Act at the six-day hearing. Six others either were against army trial or against answering the reference as it may interfere with ongoing investigations. Dr Kamal Hossain said that the defendants would have to be classified based on their offences through investigation. "We want punishment for the criminals. But we do not want innocent BDR personnel punished," he said. Written submissions on the presidential reference were then presented on behalf of Mahmudul Islam and Ajmalul Hossain, who were abroad. Mahmudul's statement said trial of BDR members is not possible under the Army Act, and last February's incident could not be tried by notification with retrospective effect. Ajmalul Hossain also said the provisions of the Army Act were not applicable for BDR members, nor could a notification have retrospective effect. Kamal Hossain had said the same the day before, as had Barrister Amir-Ul Islam. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud was not in favour of the reference itself. He said 57 army officers were killed in the BDR mutiny, more than were killed in the 1971 independence war and, therefore, the trial should be "exemplary". But, Mahmud said, the mutiny case was filed under the criminal code. He said investigation was ongoing, with charges yet to be pressed and if the court gave answer to the president's reference it could "tie the hands of investigators". Mentioning different examples in India and Pakistan's Supreme Court, he said the reference could be sent back. Earlier, advocate T H Khan had also spoken against trial under the Army Act, and against the reference itself, while barrister Rafique-Ul Huq and advocate Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed said the border guards could be tried under military law by issuing notification under the Army Act, Section 5. Mahbubuddin also said there may be some question about the notification's retroactive effect. b
