<TITLE> Trial by tribunal will not be fair: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said the government's move to try the BDR mutineers under speedy trial tribunal would not ensure justice. "Trial under existing general law will ensure justice as the government has influence on the speedy trial tribunal. There are many past examples on that," he said to reporters at party headquarters at Naya Paltan on Tuesday. The law ministry on Tuesday decided to try the BDR mutineers under the BDR Act, but those charged with killings and looting will be tried under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal. "Since the beginning, BNP has been demanding transparent and neutral investigation into the BDR mutiny without any political influence. However, the government decided to try the mutineers under speedy trial tribunal, which will not ensure justice." On the government's decision to change name, uniform and insignia of the paramilitary border force, Delwar said, "What is happening inside the BDR was begun at the instigation of the government. The BDR director general has no authority to change the uniform without the government's opinion. "Now, what the parliament members of AL and their allies are doing over BDR uniform and name is nothing but deception." He also claimed there are many conspiracies to weaken the army and destroy BDR and the government's activities are part of that 'evil plan'. He was critical of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's speech for the International Democracy Day where she warned of "ongoing efforts" by those who failed to come to power to repeat incidents similar to the BDR bloodbath to reverse the democratic strides. "Awami League had killed the democracy by establishing BAKSAL. The constitution in 1972 was democratic. Democracy was buried after the establishment of BAKSAL on Jan 25, 1974. They obstructed democracy in many times. It sounds odd if they accuse others of that." He also remembered late president Ziaur Rahman for his contribution in multi-party democracy and Hasina could take to politics on May 17, 1981 because of multi-party democracy. He also accused the AL and their associates for the chaotic situation after the Jan 11, 2007 changeover. bd
