 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has upheld status quo on the appointment of the imam in the Sholakia Eidgah ground, the site of the country's biggest Eid congregation. The bench of justices Mohammed Ashraful Islam and Mohammed Moinul Islam Chowdhury made the order on Monday on a writ petition. Also, the court asked the government to explain why the decision of appointing Mohammed Farid Uddin Masud and Mohammed Kholilur Rahman instead of imam Abul Khair Mohammad Saifullah is not illegal. The Kishoreganj deputy commissioner on Sept 2 appointed Farid Uddin and Kholilur Rahman, leaving out imam Saifullah. Saifullah filed a writ petition challenging the legality of the action on Monday. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the ruling that they would move the Appellate Division against this ruling. The petition was filed to make the religious matter a political issue, Alam said. The newly appointed imams would administer the Eid congregation, however, he said. Senior advocate Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmed and barrister Ruhul Kuddus Kajal stood for the petitioner while deputy attorney general Karunamoy Chakma represented the state. b
