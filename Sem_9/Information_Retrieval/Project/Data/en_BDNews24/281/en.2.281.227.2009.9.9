<TITLE> CHT cantonments will handle all security issues: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)Armed forces stationed at the six Chittagong Hill Tracts cantonments will deal with security issues in the event of deterioration in law and order after pullout of army camps in the region in line with the CHT peace accord, a minister said on Wednesday. "However, law and order has not worsened in the area over the ongoing withdrawal period, and will continue to remain calm in future," state minister for CHT affairs Dipankar Talukder told reporters after a meeting with Asian Development Bank country director Paul J Heytens at the Secretariat. Talukder said 63 army camps from the three hill districts had been dismantled since tenure of the last BNP-led alliance government ended. The Awami League government, during its last administration, signed the peace accord with CHT regional council in 1997 to put an end to decades-long insurgency in the region after indigenous communities lost lands and rights in the border area in the 60s and 70s. The main conditions of the accord were phased withdrawal of army troops and restoration of land rights. On Aug 19 in Rangamati, deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said all temporary camps in CHT would be dismantled serially, although the six main army cantonments would remain in place. Main opposition BNP and its allies, among others, however, have strongly opposed withdrawal of armed forces from CHT, citing internal and cross-border security concerns. Many Bengali settlers to the hill areas have also opposed the government's decision to withdraw army camps over security concerns. On Aug 9, two CHT residents Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman with petitioned the High Court seeking a ban on the pullout of armed forces from region until a previous petition of theirs was resolved that challenged the legality of the peace accord itself. The petitioners claimed troop withdrawal would nullify their previous petition as well as risk the security of Bangali settlers living in the region dominated by indigenous people. The High Court on Aug 16 directed the government to temporarily suspend withdrawal of troops until hearing on the two petitions. The ban came to an end three days later as the High Court rejected the petitions for a halt to troop withdrawal, but gave a date for hearing of the long-pending challenge against the peace accord. Speaking Wednesday, Talukder said residents of the hill region were "peace loving" and the government would work for their continued development. bdne
