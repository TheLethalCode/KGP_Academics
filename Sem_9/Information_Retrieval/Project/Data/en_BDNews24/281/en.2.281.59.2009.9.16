 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)An alliance of 35 NGOs says the government should not retain the authority to sack the Union Parishad chairmen and members as proposed in a bill on the lowest tier of the local government. At a news conference at the National Press Club on Wednesday, the Governance Advocacy Forum also called upon the government to help establish the authority of the people's representatives at all local government organisations and tiers. Mohsin Ali, the forum coordinator while reading out a written statement, congratutlated the government on its decision to do without the MPs holding advisory positions with the municipalities. Parliament on Monday passed the Local Government (Municipality) Bill-2009, which excluded the system of keeping MPs as advisers to the municipal bodies. The Local Government (Union Parishad) Bill-2009 was also placed in the parliament the same day, which provided the government with the power of removing any UP chairman and member in case of failure to implement the government's instruction. Also, it provides for appointing government officials as union council administrators in the absence of the elected UP office bearers. "In case of the Union Parishad administration, the government seems bent upon exerting full bureaucratic control, which is quite contradictory to the concept of an autonomous local government," said Ali. "Establishing the authority of the people's representatives at all local government tiers and organisations is essential to establishing and promoting true democratic practices and traditions." Justice Golam Rabbani also was critical of the provision of keeping the MPs as advisers in the local government organisations. "The MPs will liberate the people further, this is what the people expect of them." "The MPs should not play such roles that move them further from the people." Disapproving of the idea of the government wielding its baton over the local government bodies, Bangladesh Union Parishad Forum president Mahbubur Rahman Tulu said, "Passing this bill will be as good as nipping democracy in the bud. "We, therefore, demand that the bill may be passed after appropriate amendments are incorporated." Ratan Sarkar, executive director, INCIDIN Bangladesha member organisation of the forum, also spoke at the news conference. bdne
