<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The government will introduce e-tendering by June next year, planning minister AK Khandaker told parliament Sunday against a backdrop of mounting violence in the public tendering process. The statement came as a ruling party MP Nazma Akhter drew the minister's attention through a notice of public importance. "Hopefully, e-tendering in four targeted agencies can be introduced by June 2010", the minister said. The four public agencies are the Roads and Highways Department, Local Government Engineering Department, Water Development Board and the Rural Electrification Board, the minister said. "I hope, full-fledged e-tendering can be started by October 2010," Khandaker added. He said the Public Procurement Regulations 2006 had guidelines for introduction of digital bidding. Nazma Akhter submitted the notice considering a recently reported violence by the pro-Awami League student body, Bangladesh Chhatra League, over control of tender boxes at different public offices. Akhter, an Awami League MP, said, "The traditional tendering system nurtures corruption, nepotism and irregularities and results in violent clashes including murder. "The quality of public infrastructure projects falls and cause wastage of public money. "To stop the irregularities and corruption in the process, e-tender or digital tendering system should be introduced on a priority basis. "It will bring transparency and stop procrastination in the public tendering process". She said some irregularities and corrupt practices, as well as violence, in the public procurement and tendering process had overshadowed the successes of the government. Akhter said if the system was initiated, bidders would be able to submit schedules online, and the results of tender bids would also be published online, avoiding violence. "Therefore, I urge the planning minister to introduce digital tendering system from Jan 1, 2010," Akhter said. bdnews
