<TEXT>
 OSLO, Sep 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg declared victory on Tuesday for the center-left in a tight parliamentary election and pledged to maintain his economic policy course and start coalition talks with partners. With 99.9 percent of votes counted, Stoltenberg's coalition holds a slim but unassailable majority in parliament over the center-right opposition, which had tried to woo voters with promises of tax cuts and more private initiative in the economy. The result showed voters credited Stoltenberg with steering his oil producing country through the global downturn and an active government role in promoting full employment. "We will start the work on a new government platform. I'm confident we'll succeed, as we've had four years of experience with this," Stoltenberg told a news conference. Stoltenberg's Labor, the Socialist Left and the Center Party jointly hold 86 of parliament's 169 seats, one less than they won four years ago but good enough to be the first re-elected Norwegian government in 16 years. "Stoltenberg's grand triumph," daily Dagsavisen flashed on its front page. Mainstream daily Aftenposten said "The Victor" next to a smiling picture of Stoltenberg, while Dagbladet lead with "Proud of you Jens," quoting the prime minister's wife. Tabloid VG looked forward, saying on its front page that "Jens wants new people in his cabinet." The campaign debated issues ranging from whether to tap new Arctic areas for oil and gas exploration as North Sea output falls, to how Norway should use its massive $400 billion offshore wealth fund -- which owns 1 percent of global stocks. Norway has survived the global downturn better than its Nordic peers in part because Stoltenberg has injected more oil money into the economy and offered big relief to banks. Financial markets reacted calmly to the election result, with the crown trading steady and the Oslo bourse gently rising. "The 2010 budget is now more important for markets, which want to see how much oil money will be spent... and if that could influence interest rates and possibly the crown," said Camilla Villand, an analyst at Norway's largest bank DnB NOR. Stoltenberg said he would continue the economic policies that his government has pursued since 2005 and declined to comment on next year's budget, which is due on October 13. SAFE PAIR OF HANDS With unemployment at 3 percent and the mainland economy set to grow more than 2 percent in 2010 after a mild recession this year, many see the red-green coalition as a safe pair of hands. No government has been voted back in since 1993, not long before the country set up the wealth fund to invest oil and gas revenues abroad, instead of pumping them into the local economy. Now worth $80,000 per citizen, the fund stokes expectations for quick improvements in public services, which in turn has led to a series of one-term cabinets. The center-left has promised to return to strict spending curbs on the oil windfall once the crisis fades. It opposes the tax cuts and privatisation proposals made by center-right parties, saying they would eat away at spending on healthcare, education and care for the elderly. Non-OPEC member Norway is the world's fifth-biggest crude exporter and Western Europe's biggest natural gas exporter. However, the powerful oil and gas lobby has said the future of the industry in the country hinges on gaining access to the prospective Lofoten islands region in the Arctic. Stoltenberg voiced hope his cabinet would find "solutions" to questions about exploration off the pristine archipelago, even though the Socialist Left vehemently oppose drilling due to environmental concerns and the region's fishing interests. "We have a demanding set of questions to handle on the issue of drilling offshore Lofoten. We'll have to sit down and talk. We found solutions on the Barents Sea, and I'm confident we'll find solutions on Lofoten as well," said Stoltenb
