 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)--Garment sector trade unions on Thursday threatened to launch a series of 'tougher' protest programmes if factory owners fail to clear up salaries and bonuses by Sep 16. The warning was sounded at a protest rally in the capital's downtown Muktangan area where several trade union bodies rallied and placed a five-point charter of demands for the factory owners and the government to meet. "We will resort to tougher protest measures if we are not paid by September 16," said Salauddin Swapon, president of Biplobi Garments Sramik Federation at the rally. Amirul Haque Amin, convener of Bangladesh Garments Sramik Oikya Parishad, said they were pressing for formation of a wage board to fix Tk 5,000 as monthly minimum salary, implementation of labour law, reopening of the closed factories or arranging jobs for the workers of those factories and freeing the garment sector from goons allegedly hired by owners. He demanded the government and the factory owners meet their demand soon. Bangladesh Garments Sramik Oikyo Parishad, Sammilito Garments Sramik Federation, Biplobi Garmetns Sramik Federation and Swadhin Bangla Garments Sramik Karmachari Federation joined the rally. Tension still runs high in the country's main export-earning sector even after the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) recently said the factory owners would not deprive the workers of their salaries and bonuses before Eid. The situation turned worse last month when the BGMEA said many owners were unable to clear up wages and festival bonuses since their businesses had been pinched by the global recession, and unless the government gives them special incentives. But later the BGMEA backtracked on its statement apparently under pressure from the government and the trade unions. Bangladesh annually earns about $12 billion from exports in garment products, mainly to the United States and Europe. Some 2.5 million workers, mostly female, are employed in the sector. bdne
