<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The BCS information cadre leaders on Thursday sought cooperation from the establishment ministry to elevate more officials of their 1984 batch. A mass promotion earlier this week saw two information cadre officials among a total 32 of the 1984 batch promoted to deputy secretaries. They now want more. The establishment ministry on Sep 7 moved up 494 senior civil servants in the largest administration shake-up since Sheikh Hasina's government came to power in January and possibly the biggest mass promotion in BCS history. On Thursday, a representative team led by president of the BCS Information Officers Association AKM Shamim Choudhury and general secretary Aktaruzzaman submitted written statements to the cabinet secretary and also sought cooperation from the establishment secretary regarding further promotions. The association secretary told bdnews24.com that establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud assured them of looking into their demand. The leaders said administrative cadres always dominate such promotions. The Superior Selection Board made the list of 494 in August after meetings in phases with "deprived officials" following widespread discontent of civil servants of being "passed over" during previous administrations. bd
