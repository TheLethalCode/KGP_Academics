 GENEVA, Sep 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The late Senator Edward Kennedy has been awarded the United Nations refugee agency's annual prize for launching programmes that helped millions of people fleeing persecution to start new lives in the United States. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in announcing its Nansen Refugee Award laureate on Tuesday, paid tribute to Kennedy as "an unparalleled champion of refugee protection and assistance for more than 45 years". "Senator Kennedy's work in establishing US refugee admissions, resettlement and asylum programmes directly helped millions of persecuted individuals to find protection and start new lives in the United States," it said in a statement. In recent years, he played a critical role in drawing attention to the needs of Iraqi refugees, it said, noting the committee had informed the ailing Massachusetts Senator of its choice in June, two months before his death. "Senator Kennedy stood out as a forceful advocate for those who suddenly found themselves with no voice and no rights. Year after year, conflict after conflict, he put the plight of refugees on the agenda and drove through policies that saved and shaped countless lives," said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. Kennedy, who died of brain cancer at age 77 after 47 years in the Senate, was the "chief sponsor of more than 70 refugee related measures and was instrumental in codifying international refugee obligations into US law", the UNHCR said. The award was created in 1954 in honour of Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian polar explorer who served as the first High Commissioner for Refugees and received the Nobel Peace Prize. Eleanor Roosevelt was the first winner of the award which carries a monetary prize of $100,000 donated by Switzerland and Norway -- which the winner can donate to a cause of his or her choice. The award ceremony will take place in Washington on Oct.
