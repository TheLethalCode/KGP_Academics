 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Thursday said the government is behaving in a way as if the administration and judiciary are its party property, BNP secretary general. "Party people are getting promotions while neutral ones are not," Delwar said, as he addressed party activists at a discussion in the city. Referring to Zia Orphanage Trust corruption charges involving BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Delwar said the government is using judiciary to confirm its long staying in power. Delwar accused the government of resorting to contradictory policies in withdrawing the so-called politically-motivated cases against political leaders. He said the government itself is violating law when withdrawing such cases involving the ruling party men. He asked the government to withdraw such cases meant to harass political leaders as a way of showing respect to democracy and rule of law. He, in particular, demanded withdrawal of all cases against Khaleda, Tarique Rahman and other BNP leaders. Delwar was also critical of what he said was the government's failure in controlling prices of essentials and law and order situation. Delwar believed India has captured Bangladesh like an octopus and is using the government as its puppet. "Now India is saying they won't do anything, which might harm Sheikh Hasina," he said, apparently referring to recent media reports that Indian prime minister Manmohon Singh had said so. Delwar asked his supporters to get united against any conspiracy against the country. The discussion was organised to observe the one-year anniversary of Khaleda's release from special jail in September last year. bdnew
