 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com  Home affairs minister Sahara Khatun said Thursday that police were undertaking a two-month long drive in the country's troubled southwestern region to root out crimes linked to banned political groups, but declined to admit that law and order had deteriorated recently. During a question-answer session in the parliament on Thursday, the minister told the House that the measures have been taken in addition to regular countrywide drives against crime. She, however, declined to admit that the overall law and order situation had deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, rather, she said, security measures have been beefed up ahead of Eid and Durga Puja. She sought assistance from the lawmakers to tackle tender-related crimes, which, according to media reports, have taken a pervasive turn in recent weeks. Sahara's statement came regarding questions from the parliament members from various constituencies. Replying to Thakurgaon-3 MP Hafizuddin Ahmed's question regarding the withdrawal of "politically-motivated" cases, the home minister said, the process was still on. She said the government has so far decided to withdraw 449 "politically-motivated" cases, adding the government has moved to partially withdraw another 16 "false" cases including one involving BNP leader Moudud Ahmed. She said the motives of the cases under consideration were to harass political leaders. As per statistics given by the minister on case withdrawal, a total of 230 cases in Dhaka district have so far been cancelled. Replying to a supplementary question, the minister said, "The opposition had one case withdrawn to date, which was filed against BNP leader Moudud Ahmed." On increasing the manpower in the police department, Sahara said the government is contemplating creation of an additional 32, 031 posts in the department over years till 2011. She made the announcement in replying to a query by Natore-1 MP Md Abu Talha. The minister accused the past BNP-Jamaat coalition government of using the police department for the political purpose, but, she claimed, the present government is working to make the force a professional one. Responding to Chittagong-11 MP Shamsul Haque Chowdhury's call to make the dowry prevention law more effective, the minister told the House that a national committee is actively involved along with all other ministries for monitoring and enforcing the dowry prevention law. She said countrywide awareness campaigns are also going on in various forms to fight the social menace. Replying to Netrokona-1 MP Mostaque Ahmed Ruhi's question regarding setting up of control rooms and satellite watch towers for effective crime control and identification of criminals nationwide, the minister assured the House of taking the issue into consideration. Presided over by the deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, the parliament session began at 11 am Thursday. bdnews24.com
