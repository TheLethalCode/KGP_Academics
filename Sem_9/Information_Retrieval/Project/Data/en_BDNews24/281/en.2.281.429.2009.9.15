 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)--Two Bangladeshi factory workers on Tuesday were found dead, believed to have been attacked with sharp objects at a workers hostel in Seremban in Malaysia, according to Malaysia's national news agency Bernama. The dead were identified as Abdul Kader Fazer Ali, 22, and Shahin Md Amir Hossain, state police chief Osman Salleh said. He added that their one friend at work had injuries on his body and had also been sent to Tuanku Ja'afar Hospital. Seremban is the capital of the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan, one of thirteen states in Malaysia. It is located approximately 60 km to the south of Kuala Lumpur. The incident occurred at around midnight on Monday (BdST) when nine Bangladeshis were sleeping while four others were at work, Bernama quoted the police official as saying. A security guard at the hotel informed them two hours later of the incident at Taman Kemuning, Senawang in the state's capital, Saleh said. At the scene, police found one man dead in the sleeping area and another in the kitchen. Both were covered in blood and were believed to have been stabbed in the ribs and slashed at the neck, he told reporters. Police found two 0.3 metre long knives and two forks with blood stains. Outside the hostel they found a blood-stained shirt and a pair of jeans. Meanwhile, police are looking for a Bangladeshi worker, Olier Shekh, 26, who also resided at the hostel, to help in investigations. Around 500,000 Bangladeshi workers live in Malaysia
