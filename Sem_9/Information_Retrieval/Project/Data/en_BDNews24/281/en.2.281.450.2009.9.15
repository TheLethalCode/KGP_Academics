 Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)Marico Bangladesh Ltd, well known for its market leader Parachute Coconut Oil, is debuting on the country's capital market Wednesday. "Trading of Marico shares is set to start from tomorrow," Saiful Islam, the senior vice president of Dhaka Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. MBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mumbai-based Marico Limited India, got a huge response for its IPO seeing massive oversubscription. The subscription opened on Aug 2, and closed on Aug 10. On Aug 10, company secretary of MBL, Iqbal Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that in Dhaka and Chittagong alone Tk 180 crore worth of the subscriptions were submitted. The company raised around Tk 27 crore from the local capital market through the floatation of almost 3,000,000 shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission initially cleared Marico to issue 1,492,100 ordinary shares to raise Tk 13.42 crore to repay outstanding loans of with several local commercial banks. The offer price of each share was fixed at Tk 90, with a face-value of Tk 10 and premium of Tk 80 created massive demand from investors when the subscription opened on Aug 2. On Aug 5, the market regulator agreed to double the size of the IPO, and extended its subscription deadline under a 'green shoe option', legally known as an over-allotment option, in which underwriters seek to stabilise the IPO. The scheme allows a company to float more shares than stated in the prospectus if oversubscribed. MBL began operating in 2000, with an authorised and paid-up capital of Tk 1 crore. Its flagship brand Parachute Coconut Oil now holds over 70 percent of the market share of branded coconut oils in Bangladesh. Over the last 8 years, the company has developed an annual growth rate of 37 percent in turnover. In the 2008 FY, MBL's turnover reached almost Tk 265 crore, from Tk 20 crore in the 2001 FY. In 2005, MBL expanded its foothold in the household soap sector, when it acquired the intellectual rights to well-known local brands, Camelia and Aromatic. It re-launched Aromatic under the name 'Aromatic Gold', but failed to gain traction against the major players, presently taking about 4 percent of the market. Parent company Marico Limited India is a global concern with business interests in manufacturing and retailing personal consumer products as well as providing services in the beauty industry. It also has subsidiaries in the Middle East and South Africa.
