 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The government has admitted before a parliamentary body that it violated the constitution in retiring two judges late July. Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal admitted procedural mistakes and took "all responsibilities" for the irregularities done to sack the judges, Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, said on Sunday. The judges were sacked for demonstrating against a government's decision on separation of the judiciary from the executive on July 30. "As the law secretary has shouldered all responsibilities for the irregularities and the violation of constitution, we have disposed of the matter," Sengupta told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. "Therefore, the committee unanimously decided that the prime minister's adviser H T Imam and establishment secretary (Iqbal Mahmud) need not appear before the committee," State minister for law Quamrul Islam was present while Suranjit was briefing journalists. "Better you interpret," Qamrul told reporters as he was asked whether the committee reproved his ministry for the violation of the constitution in sacking the judges. The government sent Dhaka district and sessions judge Mohammed Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression (prevention) tribunal judge Mohammed Shahjahan into retirement on July 30 without the consent of the Supreme Court, a decision that was overturned just days later. They are also Bangladesh Judicial Service Association president and secretary general, respectively. The two judges had led a demonstration at the law ministry protesting certain procedures in the government's separation of the judiciary from the executive. Supporters of judges Gafur and Shahjahan opposed the decision to retire them and issued a deadline for their reinstatement. The government reinstated the two on Aug 2. The standing committee at its meeting on Aug 27 decided to invite Imam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud to clear their position. Suranjit earlier said H T Imam initiated the file to sack the two judges without the knowledge of law minister and state minister for law. He also said the government did not take suggestion from the Supreme Court, as per the constitutional guidelines, before sacking the judges since the judiciary was separate from the executive. Imam in reply told journalists that the decision to sack the judges came from the highest level of the government. He said the two judges were reinstated after they had sought amnesty from the prime minister, Imam said.
