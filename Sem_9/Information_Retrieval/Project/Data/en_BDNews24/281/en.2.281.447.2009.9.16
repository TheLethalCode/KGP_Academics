 Dhaka, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday began hearing two petitions to quash the Zia Orphanage Trust case against BNP chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon lodged the petitions on behalf of Khaleda and Tarique on Tuesday with the vacation bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Mohammad Rezaul Hassan. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against two-time former prime minister Khaleda, son Tarique and four others on Aug 5, accusing them of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust. During the hearing, barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque, counsel for the accused, told the court the Trust was a private-owned organisation, where the ACC cannot interfere with its activities. He said the accused were not guilty of any corruption and the case should be quashed. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said the merit of the case was to be decided by a court and the petitions were 'worthless' in this situation. The petitions claim the deputy director of the ACC filed the cases and pressed charges without correct approval of the commission. Moreover, the petitions said, charges were submitted 392 days after the cases were filed. ACC rules require charges be filed within 60 days. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed, Dr Kamal Uddin Siddiqui and Khaleda's nephew Mominur Rahman. bd
