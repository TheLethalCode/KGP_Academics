 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)The government has revoked the approval of five housing projects of three real estate firms, the chairman of a parliamentary standing committee says. The projects cancelled are Bashundhara Housing Project (Phase-I) of the East West Property Development, Sharnali Housing Project (Phase-I) of Swadesh Properties, Banasri New Town Housing Project, Pallabi Housing Project (Phase-II) and Rampura Extension Housing Project of the Eastern Housing Limited. The names were disclosed at the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works on Tuesday at the parliament building. City developer RAJUK, under the ministry of housing, said the projects' approvals were scrapped on the firms' failure to meet the pre-conditions for the government nod, committee chairman A B M Fazle Karim Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The conditions were set as per the land development rule for the private housing projects (2004), according to the working paper presented at the meeting. The private companies were given approval on Oct 21, 2006 provided they met up to 13 conditions or face cancellation of permission by September 30, 2008 Some of the conditions were that the companies would not change the original designs and not obstruct the water outlet in the floodplain, must ensure wide roads and necessary infrastructure and proper drainage facility. The companies were also to make their projects environmentally sustainable. According to RAJUK paper, one of the conditions authorised the government to cancel the approval of the projects. "They have totally failed to meet the conditions. So, the government has cancelled the approval of the five projects," Chowdhury, the committee chairman, said. "Actually, the projects became illegal after Sept 30 last year." The chairman said the committee had also asked the RAJUK officials why it had approved the projects before the companies had fulfilled the conditions. The working paper said RAJUK alerted people through media not to buy plots in the unapproved projects inside Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan area. "The private developers were also requested not to go ahead with the unapproved projects," the paper said. State minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan and other members of the committee attended the meeting.
