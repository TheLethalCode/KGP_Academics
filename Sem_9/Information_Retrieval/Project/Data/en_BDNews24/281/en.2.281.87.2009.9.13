 Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh scored 42 percent in the Open Budget Index 2008, which shows that the government provides the public with some information on the national budget and related financial documents during the course of the budget year, according to a report released on Sunday. The UK came top with a score of 88 percent. Only five countriesthe United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Statesscored above 80 out of a possible 100 points on the OBI, making extensive information publicly available as required by generally accepted good financial management practices. The survey by the Open Budget Initiative, a US-based global research and advocacy programme under the International Budget Partnership, was conducted on the budgets of 85 countries passed in 2008. The report took into account eight key documents that all countries should make available to the public: the pre-budget statement, budget proposal, citizen's budget, enacted budget, in-year reports, mid-year review, year-end report and the audit report. However, 25 countries provided negligible or no budget information. These include low-income countries like Cambodia, Congo, Nicaragua, and the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as several middle and high-income countries, such as China, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. The OBI report was unveiled at a dialogue titled "To What Extent Is Our National Budget Open?", organised by local research organisation Shamunnay and advocacy group Manusher Jonno, at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel on Sunday. M Abu Eusuf, Shamunnay researcher and associate professor of development studies at Dhaka University, presented an analysis of the ranking. In Bangladesh, the pre-budget report is not published for the public, Eusuf said, but should be available at least one month prior to the budget proposal is introduced. The budget proposal is published in the media to reach the public, but citizens are given an incomplete picture of the government's plans for taxing and spending for the upcoming year, he said. The enacted budget, usually published after cuts and adds every year, is not made public, said discussant of the programme, Arastoo Khan, additional secretary of the finance ministry. The finance ministry does not publish a citizen's budget, a simplified version of the proposal and the enacted budget. Shamunnay has been publishing two such versions, where one of those is for school going students, for the last six years, Eusuf added. The in-year reports, sometimes referred to monthly or quarterly reports, are published in a limited or irregular manner, hard to access for the public. The finance ministry has recently enacted the 'Fiscal Responsibility Act 2009', which makes it mandatory to publish quarterly reports of the progress of a current budget, Khan said. Mid-year is absent in Bangladesh while year-end reports are made but not published for the public. The audit report, prepared after the end of each fiscal, takes a couple of years to reach to the public, Eusuf added. He said Bangladesh could also improve by increasing opportunities for citizen participation in budget debates. The legislature does not hold hearings on the budget in which the public can participate, Eusuf said.
