 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnws24.com)The government is likely to announce the new pay scales soon, finance minister A M A Muhith told parliament on Monday on a question from Jatiya Party MP Golam Reza. "There is a possibility of announcing the (national) pay scales very soon. "Considering its limitation, the government has recommended its pay scales," Muhith said. The minister made it clear that the new pay scale will increase the salaries of the public servants. "The new scales in no way will reduce their salaries," he said. Muhith said the government framed the new pay scale considering the basic needs of the people, inflation, income and expenditure of the government and other factors. The Awami League government prepared new scales of the public servants, but the scale is yet to come into effect. Parliament started its business Monday at around 11:05am with deputy speaker Shawkat Ali in the chair. bdnews
