 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)Parliament saw a proposed Union Parishad law tabled on Monday, which would hand the central government huge control over the lowest tier of local government. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam tabled the Local Government (Union Parishad) Bill 2009 that has contents similar to the ordinance of the same name issued under the past caretaker government. The parliamentary standing committee on local government was asked to further scrutinise the contents and report back to the House in seven days. The proposed law empowers the government to suspend the elected chairmen and members of any elected Union Parishad if they fail to carry out government orders. Section 18 of the law authorises the government to appoint bureaucrats as administrators to union councils in case of absence of an elected Union Parishad. The government can also appoint some members to assist the administrator. The administrator and the members will exercise the powers of the elected chairman and the members of the council. According to section 33, the council will form a three-member panel of chairmen, at least one of them a woman, in order of seniority, in 30 working days from the election of a new Union Parishad. Members of the panel will act as chairman in absence of an elected chairman. If no such panel is formed, the government, as per its necessity, will prepare a panel of chairmen from the elected members of a Union Parishad, according to section 34 of the law. "The government can temporarily suspend any chairman or members if it considers any of their actions 'against the interests of the council' or 'imperfect' from administrative point of view." As per section 73, the government can also force the Union Parishad to accept the development project designs and guidelines and other activities. Section 74 of the law says the government will be able to direct the Union Parishad chairmen and members to carry out any government orders in a specific time frame if it thinks they have failed to do so. Section 77 gives the government the powers to rescind an Union Parishad if it thinks that council failed to act in line with the relevant law or any of the laws or circulars or orders of the government. The House also passed the Pesticides (Amendment) Act 2009 raised by agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury. Jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui tabled a bill to pass the Jute (Amendment) Act 2009. The bill was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on jute ministry to finalise its recommendations in seven days and refer it back to the House. bdnews
