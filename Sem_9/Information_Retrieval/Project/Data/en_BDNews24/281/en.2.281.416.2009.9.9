 KUNDUZ, Afghanistan, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO troops released a kidnapped British reporter for the New York Times in northern Afghanistan in a commando raid before dawn on Wednesday, but his Afghan interpreter was killed. Reporter Stephen Farrell was abducted on Saturday along with Afghan colleague Mohammad Sultan while attempting to visit the scene of a NATO air strike that killed scores of Afghans in the north of the country.
