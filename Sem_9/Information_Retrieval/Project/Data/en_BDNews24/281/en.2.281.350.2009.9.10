 UNITED NATIONS, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Haiti has kept its promise to build a government but donor nations have failed to deliver the aid they pledged to the poorest country in the western hemisphere, Bill Clinton said on Wednesday. "They've only gotten a pittance of the aid that was pledged to them," Clinton, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special envoy to Haiti, told reporters after addressing a meeting of the Security Council on the Caribbean nation. "A lot of that is part of the appropriations process that plays out in the latter half of every year," the former US president said. "But we can't get to January with only $21 million of over $760 million in commitments disbursed down there (in Haiti)." "We've got to get the show on the road," Clinton added.

Ban has also urged donor countries to be generous to Haiti. He has been influenced by a report by British academic Paul Collier which said that if Haiti could improve its roads and ports, it was well-placed to benefit from low labor costs and duty-free access it enjoys to the US market. UN officials say that security has improved dramatically in Haiti, where just a few years ago large areas were controlled by heavily armed gangs that killed, kidnapped and raped with impunity. After decades of dictatorship and military coups, Haiti's civilian police force was created just 15 years ago, when its army was disbanded. The UN peacekeeping mission known as MINUSTAH, made up of 7,000 soldiers and 2,000 police, has worked to help stabilize Haiti since its last revolt in 2
