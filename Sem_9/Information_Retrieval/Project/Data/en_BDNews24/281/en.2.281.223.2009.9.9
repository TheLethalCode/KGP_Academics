<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia coach Guus Hiddink has said he would like to coach in the Premier League again after his temporary spell at Chelsea last season. Hiddink, whose side play Wales in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday with an excellent chance of either winning Group Four or reaching the playoffs, was quoted in British daily The Guardian as saying he missed England and wanted to return. The 62-year-old Dutchman said he planned to take a break after next year's World Cup in South Africa but would like another chance in England in the future. "I had a wonderful time in England and before I worked for Chelsea I was often watching the Premier League," said Hiddink, who spent four months at the London club last season, steering them to victory in the FA Cup final over Everton in May. "I love to be in England to smell the atmosphere. So, missing it? Of course I am missing it." Asked if it meant he had the appetite for a second stint in the English top flight, he replied: "Of course. England is very attractive. "It's unique in that the level of competition is high. But I have to make a judgement whether I stop for a few months, or half a year or a year, or do something different within football." Hiddink, who took charge at Stamford Bridge after Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari left, said Chelsea skipper John Terry and midfielder Frank Lampard would make a big impact for England at the World Cup. "I loved to work with them every day," he said. "They are key players for Chelsea and key players for the national team. England depend a lot on them but it is encouraging that there are good young players coming up as well. "England are playing a modern way of football, very intelligent, smart and attractive. And I think they can go all the way in South Africa." England will qualify for the World Cup on Wednesday if they beat Croatia.
