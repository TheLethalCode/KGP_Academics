<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)Two petitions were submitted to the High Court on behalf of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman seeking to quash the Zia Orphanage Trust case. The petitions may be heard on Wednesday, deputy attorney general Motahar Hossain Saju told bdnews24.com. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon lodged the petitions with the vacation bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Mohammad Rezaul Hassan. The petitions claim the deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission filed the cases and pressed charges without correct approval of the commission. Moreover, the petitions said, charges were submitted 392 days after the cases were filed. ACC rules require charges be filed within 60 days. The ACC pressed charges against two-time former prime minister Khaleda, son Tarique and four others on Aug 5, accusing them of embezzling more Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed, Dr Kamal Uddin Siddiqui and Khaleda's nephew Mominur Rahman. bdnew
