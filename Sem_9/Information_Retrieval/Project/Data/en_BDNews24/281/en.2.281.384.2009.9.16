<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)--The government has decided to withdraw another 123 cases on the grounds that they were pressed for political persecution, says the state minister for law. A total of 241 applications for cancellation of cases were presented at the seventh meeting of the scrutiny committee for recommendation, Kamrul Islam, the committee's chairman, told reporters on Wednesday. Of them, 225 were filed under the penal code and 16 by the Anticorruption Commission, he said. The committee rejected nine applications and kept 75 cases for further review in the next meeting. Wednesday's meeting recommended quashing cases against Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Awami League leaders Shamim Osman, Tobibur Rahman, Hazi Selim and Jatiya Party leader Nasim Osman. The state minister said the committee would make a positive decision if opposition chief Khaleda Zia and her two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco applied for withdrawal of their cases provided they are "really politically harassed". The Awami League-led government, soon after assuming office in January, announced that it would look into cases filed under past administrations against politicians and others for "political harassment only". The government invited applications seeking cancellation of such cases from February, forming district-level vetting committees and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended three times up to July 12. The scrutiny committee has so far recommended 578 cases to be quashed, and 14 to be partially withdrawn, since its first sitting. Its first meeting, on June 10, recommended withdrawal of 62 cases, including 12 against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On June 21, it approved another 46 cases to be cancelled. In its third meeting on July 1, the committee recommended quashing another 66 cases. On July 15 it recommended 69 cases be cancelled. On Aug 5, in its fifth meeting, the committee recommended cancellation of 121 cases and on Aug 26 in its sixth meeting, it recommended another 105 cases. Most of the cases to be quashed were filed against leaders of the ruling Awami League and its associate organisations. The scrutiny committee received a total of 4,433 applications from district-level committees. bd
