 Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)  BGMEA is the latest group to call on the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports to withdraw its planned half-day hartal in the capital on Monday. The committee, a citizens' action group, has called the hartal to protest recently approved gas exploration deals with foreign companies in the Bay of Bengal. The strike was also called to protest what the committee called an "unwarranted police attack" on its members during a demonstration on Sep 2. A BGMEA statement on Sunday said garments owners were busy trying to pay wages and allowances to its workers ahead of Eid. A hartal could hamper the payment process, the trade body said. It also said the growth of the sector is following a negative trend in the face of global recession, and hartals would only add to strains on the RMG industry and the economy as a whole. Former adviser to the caretaker government Akbar Ali Khan also spoke on the issue on Sunday. He said those who called the hartal should engage the government in constructive dialogue, while the government should clarify its position on gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal. "It's more important to dialogue with the government than calling a hartal on the streets of the capital," Khan told reporters after attending a seminar in the city. Businessmen, politicians and others have been urging the committee over the past week to reconsider its planned hartal, the first general strike in the capital since the Awami League-led government took office in January this year. The country's apex business federation, FBCCI, in a statement on Saturday, said the reasons cited for the hartal could be resolved through discussions and did not require such action. FBCCI said the strike would hamper public life as well as business. FBCCI said it was on the side of ensuring the highest level of transparency and neutrality in awarding off-shore exploration deals to foreign companies. It hoped agreement would be reached peacefully over this national issue to maintain a stable economic and safeguard business activities. Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub Alam Hanif also called on the national committee on Saturday to cancel the hartal. Hanif said the protesters should look into details of the exploration deals with US company ConocoPhillips and Ireland's Tullow Oil plc. Meanwhile, the national committee has asked for public support ahead of the planned hartal. "It was called to protect present and future generations of Bangladesh," convener of the committee Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah and member secretary Prof Anu Muhammad said in a joint statement on Saturday. They said the hartal's success would depend on the strike's observance by the general public. bd
