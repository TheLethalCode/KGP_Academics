<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)The military police of the army have landed on Dhaka roads on Tuesday to help the police ease the traffic gridlocks specially before the Eid. As many as 32 members of the military police (MP) were seen controlling traffic movement since 9am at four strategic points in the city, which were Farmgate, Karwan Bazaar SAARC Fountain roundabout, Mohakhali and Maghbazaar intersections. State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku told reporters on Tuesday: "Military soldiers have been deployed at certain points in the city to help the police control traffic." "This additional manpower will be easing the city traffic jams until the Eid and through the Durga puja." Shafiqur Rahman, joint commissioner (traffic) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told bdnews24.com that the traffic police will now work with the MP personnel to regulate traffic movement throughout the city. Manpower shortage in the DMP's traffic wing, illegal vehicle parking and general nonchalance of the drivers are mainly responsible for the city traffic gridlocks. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said in parliament on Monday that lack of coordination among the DMP, Dhaka City Corporation and Bangladesh Road Transport Authority was the chief reason of the relentless Dhaka traffic snarls. bdne
