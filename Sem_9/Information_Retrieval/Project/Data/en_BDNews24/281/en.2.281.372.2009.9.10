 Kushtia, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Another militant outlaw was killed in alleged shootout with police and RAB early on Thursday in Kushtia, taking the total number of dead to eight in the last two weeks. Doulatpur police chief Hassan Hafizur Rahman said the deceased, 30-year old Sohel Ahmed Tokan, a resident of Khalishakundi of Doulatdia upazila, was an operative of outlawed Ganomukti Fauz. Tipped off that a group of criminals were holding a secret meeting at the garden of Abdul Haque, a resident of Mistiripara of the Upazila, a team of RAB-12 stormed the spot, Rahman said. A gunfight ensued and at one stage, Sohel died on the spot. RAB recovered one LG rifle, five rounds of ammunition and one sharp weapon from the scene. There were six cases against Sohel with Doulatpur Police Station, the police officer added. Law and order deteriorated severely in the south western region in recent times. A few severed heads were recovered over last two months in Kushtia. 'Odhikar', a human rights organisation, said at least 19 people were killed in August across the country in so-called 'crossfire, encounter or gunfight'. Of the deceased, 10 allegedly belonged to different underground militant outfits. According to available figures, a total 577 people died in 472 'crossfire' incidents across the country since RAB was constituted on March 26, 2004. The human-rights organisations have since been calling these incidents as 'extra judicial killings' and urging the government to stop such violations of human rights. bd
