<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court on Thursday sent its opinion to the president on the reference on the BDR mutiny trial, but the views of the court could not be known. SC registrar Shawkat Hossain handed the opinion file to the president at around 12:45pm, he told bdnews24.com. Asked about the apex court's opinion, Hossain said: "The file was sealed. I cannot say anything about the content." "But whatever opinion the Supreme Court has given, it will have to be respected," he said. "No one should question this opinion." President Zillur Rahman sent the reference to the court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the mutineers could be tried under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, advisers to the court', to advise on the reference. It began hearing on the reference on Aug 25 and ended it on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae observed that the BDR mutiny trial could not be held under the Army Act. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month to seek the chief justice's opinion as views varied widely on whether the mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, presenting the reference before the court on Aug 25, said the mutiny case filed in Dhaka saw 1, 779 people arrested so far. Another 40 cases filed in connection with BDR rebellions outside Dhaka saw 1, 721 persons arrested. A total 3,500 people are facing trial in the cases, said Alam. bdnew
