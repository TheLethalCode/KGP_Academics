 Chittagong, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com) The government will soon appoint some 450 officials, including magistrates, to the Department of Environment to overcome manpower crunch, said state minister for environment and forest Hasan Mahmud on Saturday. Mahmud, speaking to reporters in Chittagong city, said the government would also open DoE offices at all districts, the first phase covering 20 of the total 64. The state minister, however, admitted that DoE offices at divisional headquarters were not working effectively, saying he believes manpower crisis is one of the major reasons behind their sluggish operations. He said seven magistrates would be appointed to the DoE to run mobile courts against violation of environmental laws. Earlier, Mahmud visited Chittagong's hilly areas at Kushumbagh, Khulshi, Lalkhanbazar and Shershah to have a firsthand idea about how hills are being destroyed there. Regarding unabated hill cutting in Chittagong, the state minister warned that no influential people involved with such activities would be spared. He asked the DoE officials to take steps against all those involved with hill cutting. Allegations exist against local politicians being involved in hill cutting activities. The state minister said the government was considering environmental protection as a serious issue and would not hesitate to take legal action against responsible irrespective of party affiliation. He said a separate law is in the making to deal with the hill cutting issue seriously. Mahmud also said that a total of 7.58 lakh hectres of land would be brought under social forestation across the country. bdnews24
