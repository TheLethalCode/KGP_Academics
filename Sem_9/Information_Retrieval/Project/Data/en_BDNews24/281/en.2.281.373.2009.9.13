 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun placed a bill for passage of the Mobile Court Act 2009 in parliament Sunday, to allow magistrates the power to award maximum sentences of two years. Speaker Abdul Hamid sent the bill to the standing committee on home affairs for scrutiny. The committee was asked to give its recommendations in a day. The cabinet meeting approved the draft law in its Sept 9 meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The law would empower executive magistrates to give on the spot sentences ranging from a minimum three months to maximum two years, under 84 separate laws in addition to sections of the penal code, for more effective working of mobile courts. The statement regarding the purpose and reason of the law says: "There was a vacuum in the operation of mobile courts by executive magistrates, who lost judicial powers, since the separation of the judiciary from the executive on Nov 1, 2007. "It caused problems in controlling law and order and crime at field levels." An ordinance was issued to empower executive magistrates to run mobile courts again during the past caretaker government regime. That ordinance became ineffective in February since it was not placed before the new parliament for enactment. The incumbent government formulated the Mobile Court Act 2009 on June 4 this year. President Zillur Rahman promulgated a new ordinance in July to allow mobile courts to function until passage of the act. Sunday also saw communication minister Syed Abul Hossain place the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (Amended) Act 2009, which was passed by voice vote. AHM Mustafa Kamal, chairman of standing committee on finance, tabled bills on Insurance Control Authorities Act 2009 and Insurance Act 2009. They were referred back to the committee for further scrutiny. bdnews24.com/
