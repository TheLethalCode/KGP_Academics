 TOKYO, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's new leader Yukio Hatoyama will take office and finalize his cabinet on Wednesday, putting in place an untested line-up to tackle challenges ranging from restoring economic growth to managing ties with Washington. Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) trounced the long-ruling Liberal Democrats in an election last month, faces pressure to make good on campaign promises to focus spending on consumers, cut waste, and reduce bureaucrat control over policy. "I have mixed feelings of excitement about changing history and the very heavy responsibility of making history," said Hatoyama, whose party ousted the LDP for only the second time since its founding in 1955. "The fight begins now." Hatoyama's cabinet, a delicate balance of former Liberal Democrats, ex-socialists and younger conservatives, must hit the ground running. "The DPJ has got to come up with an agreed list of priorities quickly, because its manifesto is just a long laundry list," said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. "And it better not just be how they will govern differently, but actual policies," he added. "They can expect something of a honeymoon for a year, but not longer than that." Hatoyama's choice of veteran lawmaker Hirohisa Fujii, 77, as finance minister has soothed some analysts' concerns that the government's spending programs will inflate an already huge public debt as Japan struggles to emerge from recession. But his choice of Shizuka Kamei, the outspoken head of a tiny coalition partner, as minister for banking supervision and postal services has spooked some experts worried about Kamei's opposition to market-friendly reforms. "If foreign investors interpret Kamei's position as a slowdown for reform in Japan, stocks could come under pressure and this would be a buying factor for bonds," said Makoto Yamashita, a strategist at Deutsche Securities. INDEPENDENT DIPLOMACY, BUDGET BATTLES Hatoyama's vow to steer Japan on a more independent diplomatic course has sparked concerns about possible friction with top ally the United States ahead of his diplomatic debut there next week, where he will meet President Barack Obama. The US-educated Hatoyama is expected to reassure Obama over ties and perhaps postpone calls for re-negotiation of agreements on US troops stationed in Japan. On his return, Hatoyama faces the urgent task of drafting a budget for the year from April 1 and finding ways to plug holes in this year's budget caused by sliding tax revenues as Japan struggles out of its worst recession since World War Two. The new government must balance the need to nurture a recovery and fund its consumer-friendly spending programs with concerns about a public debt heading toward 200 percent of GDP.
