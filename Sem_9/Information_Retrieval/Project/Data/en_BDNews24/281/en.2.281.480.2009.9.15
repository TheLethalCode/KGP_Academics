 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith has urged the tax officials to curb corruption and not harass the taxpayers. The finance minister made the call at a ceremony on Tuesday to hand prizes among the 350 best taxpayers at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre (BIFC), marking the National Income Tax Day 2009. "The tax-collectors must be careful so that the taxpayers are not harassed in any case. We must ward off all forms of corruption," said Muhith. "Since corruption is our national ailment, we may not be able to sever all the tethers of graft yet, but we got to rid ourselves of all forms of graft eventually." Muhith said, "Paying one's income tax is similar to repayment of social debts. Our taxation system is very just." "Those who can afford must pay their taxes. Those who earn more must pay more. "The taxpayers must pay taxes keeping in view the fact that paying taxes means serving the country." The minister said, "Out of our 15 crore population, only seven lakh pay tax, which is a shame." He said he expected that the total income tax deposited with the government in the final year of the incumbent government's five-year tenure should exceed Tk 20,000 crore. "We'll determine our work plan to achieve that goal." During the fiscal year 2008-09, Tk 13, 812 crore was realised in income tax. Moshiur Rahman, the prime minister's economic adviser said, "The gruesome income tax calculations have to be simplified." "The rules on paying income tax are not clear to those who pay. They face complications even at the income tax offices." National Board of Revenue chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed presided over the programme. bd
