 WASHINGTON, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US poverty rate jumped to its highest level in 11 years in 2008, according to a government report on Thursday that underscored the impact of the worst recession since the Great Depression on households. The Census Bureau said the poverty rate rose to 13.2 percent in 2008, the highest level since 1997, from 12.5 percent in 2007. It said this was the first statistically significant increase in the annual poverty rate since 2004. "There were 39.8 million people in poverty in 2008, up from 37.3 million in 2007, the department said. Real median household income fell 3.6 percent to $50,303 in 2008. "This breaks a string of three years of annual income increases and coincides with the recession that started in December 2007," the department said. The longest and deepest recession in 70 years has been marked by rising unemployment as companies aggressively cut payrolls to cope with slumping demand.
