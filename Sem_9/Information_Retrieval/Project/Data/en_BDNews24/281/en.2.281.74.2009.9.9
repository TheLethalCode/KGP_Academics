<TITLE> Dipu Moni meets Indian water minister </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Sept 09 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni Wednesday had talks with Indian water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal to discuss the sharing of the common rivers. "They discussed bilateral relations including sharing of the common rivers between the two countries," said a foreign ministry press statement issued Wednesday. But the statement made no mention of the outcome of the talks. The two countries share 54 rivers, which enter Bangladesh through India. Water sharing is one of the thorny issues in Bangladesh-India relations since India's unilateral commissioning of the Farakka barrage on the Ganges in the 1970s. Hundreds of rivers in Bangladesh's north and south west are dependent on the Ganges for their flows. India's recent proposal for construction of the Tipaimukh dam over the cross border Barak river has added another recent dimension to the water-sharing issue. Environmentalists say the proposed dam would dry up Bangladesh's Surma riverone of the main suppliers of waters to the country's greater Sylhet region. Dipu Moni flew to Delhi Monday to meet her Indian counterpart SM Krishna, and other officials, to address the gamut of bilateral issues between the two neighbours. She had told reporters prior to her departure that she would discuss the contentious Tipaimukh dam with Indian leaders. She also discussed demarcation of maritime boundary issues and Bangladesh-India cooperation in power sector in talks with Krishna and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday. The foreign minister is set to return home Thursday.
