<TITLE> Climate change 'threatens 4.5m children' </TITLE>

 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)Climate change puts the lives of 4.5 million children at risk worldwide, if rich nations fail to deliver additional funds to poor countries to combat global warming, British charity Oxfam said in a report published Tuesday. Without at least $50 billion a year in addition to the 0.7 per cent of national income rich countries have already pledged as aid, recent progress toward the Millennium Development Goals could stall and even go into reverse, the report titled 'Beyond Aid' warned. The warning comes as world leaders prepare for next week's United Nations General Assembly and Climate Summit in New York on Sept 22, where US President Barak Obama will give his first address to the UN on climate change. The meeting will be followed by a G20 Summit on Sept 24, where climate finance will be high on the agenda. The United Kingdom, Netherlands and Denmark are the only developed countries at present supporting the call for additional climate funds. Oxfam is concerned that December's major climate negotiations in Copenhagen could fail, unless action is taken now by heads of state of rich nations. The Oxfam report highlighted the great strides toward the Millennium Development Goals since their inception in 2000. In just seven years, 90 per cent of children in poor countries have been enrolled in school. Between 1999 and 2005 there was a 24 per cent drop in the number of people living in extreme poverty, and between 1990 and 2007 the annual number of deaths of children under five plummeted by 3.6 million, despite population growth. But despite these gains, poor countries are struggling to meet the MDGs and many goals still fall short of the mark. To divert existing aid for climate adaptation would strain already overstretched systems, says Oxfam. "Forcing poor countries to choose between life saving drugs for the sick, schooling for their children or the means to protect themselves against climate change is an unfair burden that will only exacerbate poverty," said Barbara Stocking, CEO, Oxfam Great Britain. "Stealing money from tomorrow's schools and hospitals to help poor people adapt to climate change is neither a moral nor effective way of rich countries paying their climate debt. Funds must be increased not diverted", she added. With some estimates quoting 20 million people under threat of rising sea levels in Bangladesh alone, as a direct result of climate change, and many facing hunger and loss of life due to climate shocks, the twin challenge of addressing poverty and alleviating climate change has never been more pressing for aid agencies around the world. The report points out, in the absence of additional adaptation funding, people in poor countries will be forced to go without food, pull their children out of school or sell off cattle and other assets critical to their livelihoods, so that they can pay for debt caused by continuing failed crops and other climate shocks. Climate shocks and the short-term measures that poor people take in order to cope can have long-term impacts, potentially spanning generations. Without adequate support to adapt to the changing climate, the effect is a downward spiral into deeper poverty and increased vulnerability. Oxfam points out its efforts to help communities adapt to climate change have proved successful around the world. In Char Atra in Bangladesh, where increased flooding has caused people to lose both homes and lives, 70 per cent of people now have access to clean water during flooding, death due to diarrhoea has been virtually abolished and over 100 homes have been raised above flood level. Likewise investment in small-scale farmers, such as training in new cropping techniques, the introduction of drought and flood resistant seeds and effective irrigation systems has helped ensure that food is available even in times of disaster. Oxfam also highlights the Global Fund, set up in 2002 to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as an example of how political will on a global scale can mobilise money quickly and effectively. To date, the Global Fund has approved funding for $15.6 billion in more than 140 countries.
