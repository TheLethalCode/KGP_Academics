 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)A crack appears to have developed in the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas Mineral Resources, Power and Ports over the pressure group's decision to enforce a half-day hartal in capital Dhaka on Sep 14. Workers Party of Bangladesh, a key component, has opposed the committee's decision to enforce hartal in capital Dhaka on Sep 14. "We had a different opinion about the protest programme. We gave note of dissent too," party president Rashed Khan Menon told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "We will give our opinion [Friday] after reviewing the general strike proposal," said Menon. the party's general secretary Bimal Biswas were present when national committee convener Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah announced the general strike from a rally at downtown Muktangan at 12:30pm. Biswas said at Muktangan: "We will have to continue with and take forward this mass movement in phases because this is people's movement." The hartal will be enforced to protest against the police attack on the demonstrators during their attempt to besiege Petrobangla headquarters on Sept 2 over recent exploration deals with two international companies at Bay that left dozens of people injured. On Sep 2, dozens of activists including Prof Anu Muhammad, member secretary of the pressure group, were injured in the capital when police charged demonstrators with baton, who were trying to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over the off-shore exploration deals for three blocks. The committee also declared countrywide demonstrations and siege programme of the offices of the deputy commissioners and upazila nirbahi officers on Sept 14. The party has been actively campaigning for the public protest group. Menon was also present in the Sep 2 demonstration. Menon had told the demonstrators that day, "Our gas reserve can never be handed over to the foreigners. We have BAPEX. If exploration is done by BAPEX in partnership with international companies, that would be more beneficial." "We achieved democracy after seven years of fighting. Efforts are ongoing to destroy the hard-earned democracy," Menon, who was also injured, had said in his reaction to the police attack on the protesters. bdnews
