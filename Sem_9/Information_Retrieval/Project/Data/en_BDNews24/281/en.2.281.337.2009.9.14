 Kushtia, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)--An outlawed extremist was killed early on Monday in an alleged shootout with police in Padmanagar village of Kushtia Sadar upazila. Kushtia assistant police superintendent Alamgir Hossain said 35-year old Samir Uddin, a resident of Mohishadanga village, was a military operative of outlawed JSD Gana Bahini. Being tipped off that a group of armed militants were holding a clandestine meeting beside a canal of Padmanagar village under Islamic University Police Station, police launched a drive shortly after 4am, Hossain said. Sensing the presence of police the criminals opened fire on the law enforcers, forcing them to fire back, triggering off a gunfight. At one stage of the 20-minute shootout Samir Uddin was shot and killed. His associates fled the scene. Police recovered Samir's body and one LG gun and two rounds of ammo from the spot. Islamic University Police Station chief Motiar Rahman said they had sent the body to Kushtia General Hospital morgue for autopsy. There are a number of cases against Samir, he said.
