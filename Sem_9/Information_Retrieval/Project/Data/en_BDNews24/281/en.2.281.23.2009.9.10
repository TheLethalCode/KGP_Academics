 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)India has agreed to provide Bangladesh "connectivity" with Nepal and Bhutan through Indian territories, says a Bangladesh-India joint statement on foreign minister Dipu Moni's recent visit to that country. New Delhi gave the consent after Dipu Moni held series of talks with top Indian leaders including prime minister Manmohan Singh. In turn, Dhaka agreed to give India access to Ashuganj port to facilitate movements of Indian consignments through Bangladesh, said the statement issued by the Indian high commission in Dhaka on Thursday after the two-day talks on Sept 8 and 9. The two countries agreed also to hand over convicted criminals to each other and cooperate to curb international crime. India also agreed to provide Bangladesh 100 megawatts of electricity "on a priority basis", subject to completion of a feasibility study on a power grid connectivity between the two countries. The two sides discussed the use of Chittagong port by India, but no agreement was reached. "Both sides recognised the importance of bilateral and regional connectivity," the joint statement reads. "In this context, both sides discussed designating Ashuganj as a new port of call under Article-23 of the Inland Water Transit and Trade Agreement as well as the use of Chittagong port by India." Continued the statement: "Bangladesh side agreed to provide access to Ashuganj Port to facilitate the transportation of the Over Dimensional Consignments for the Palatana Power Project in Tripura. "Indian side agreed to facilitate Nepal-Bangladesh and Bhutan-Bangladesh connectivity." The statement said, "India agreed to provide at least 100 MW to Bangladesh on a priority basis. "Ahead of this, it will also undertake a feasibility study on power grid inter-connectivity for transmission lines, etc from India to Bangladesh". More to follow
