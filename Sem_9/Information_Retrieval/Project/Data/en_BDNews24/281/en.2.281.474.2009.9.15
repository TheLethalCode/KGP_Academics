 JERUSALEM, Sep 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US envoy George Mitchell will try in talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Tuesday to finalize a deal on an Israeli settlement freeze crucial to resuming Middle East peace talks. News of the success or failure of Mitchell's current mission appeared unlikely until at least Wednesday. Mitchell and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has resisted a total construction halt in settlements in the occupied West Bank, met for more than two hours. Netanyahu's office said they held "good" talks and would meet again on Wednesday. Mitchell planned to see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later on Tuesday.

"We hope to bring this phase of our discussions to early conclusion and to move forward in our common search for a comprehensive peace in the region," Mitchell told reporters at the start of his meeting with Netanyahu, indicating he hoped to finalize a deal.

The move was widely seen in Israel as a bid to placate settlers before any deal with Washington on construction limitations. But Israel also has made clear it would continue building 2,500 settler homes already under construction and that any restrictions would not include Jewish housing in East Jerusalem, which it also captured in the fighting 42 years ago. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and in Arab East Jerusalem, also captured in 1967, alongside some three million Palestinians. The World Court calls the settlements illegal and Palestinians say the enclaves could deny them a viable st
