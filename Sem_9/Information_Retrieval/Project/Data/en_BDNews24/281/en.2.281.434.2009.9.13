 Dhaka, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com)A criminal gang managed to release one of their members from the hands of the Rapid Action Battalion, leaving a RAB officer injured, in Mirpur on Sunday, officials said. Acting on a tipoff, RAB went to NAM Garden in Mirpur to arrest members of the Shahar Ali gang, Lt Col Kabir Hossain, of RAB-4, told bdnews24.com. At one point Major Golam Sarwar became isolated from his fellow officers while chasing down and detaining a gang member, said Hossain, who added that the gang then rounded on the officer to free their associate. Major Sarwar was admitted to Combined Military Hospital for treatment of injuries after being hit over the head and legs, Hossain said.
