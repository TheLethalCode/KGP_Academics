 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com) The government is moving to reinstate the National Women Development Policy formulated by the previous Awami League government in 1997, the state minister for women and children affairs Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury told parliament on Sunday. "The previous government of Sheikh Hasina formulated and enforced the Women Development Policy. But the subsequent BNP government cancelled the policy." "The incumbent government will move to reinstate the policy," Shirin said in reply to a supplementary question by Awami League MP Junaid Ahmed Palak. Replying to another query the state minister said the previous AL government also introduced a women's agriculture training course and the BNP government halted that too. "The government has arranged to reopen Begum Fajilatunnesa Women Agriculture Training Centre located at Jirani in Savar," she told the House. Parliament sat from around 11am on Sunday after a two-day weekend with deputy speaker Shawkat Ali in the chair. In reply to a query by Jatiya Party MP Salma Islam, Shirin said the government had set up a National Trauma Counselling Centre at the Women Affairs Directorate. It has also launched a Violence against Women Helpline, the state minister said. She also said the women repression control cell had so far resolved 277 dowry cases, 339 family feud cases and 356 other allegations. Apart from that as many as 153 'uthan boithak' (courtyard meetings) have been held in participation with rural women under the government's awareness programme to curb dowry and early marriage.
