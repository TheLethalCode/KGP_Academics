 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com. correspondent Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)The cost of sugar in retail markets has shot up 20 percent in just three days despite ongoing meetings between government officials and traders to stabilise the price of the essential commodity. A visit to markets in the capital on Thursday found sugar selling at Tk 60 a kg, while it was retailing at Tk 48-50 a kg just three days ago, and around Tk 42-44 a month ago. Retailers alleged wholesalers are hiking the cost of sugar on the pretext of supply shortfalls, while wholesalers continue to pass the blame on to sugar mills for failing to meet required supply. "There is no valid reason for this sugar crisis. We have information about sufficient stocks and so it does not make sense," commerce secretary Firoj Ahmed told bdnews24.com. But, Ahmed said, an inter-ministerial meeting on Thursday received information that sugar supplies had reduced to markets in the country. On Thursday, Dhaka kitchen market shopkeeper Jahir Uddin said he had no stocks of pre-packed sugar left, and accused wholesalers of hiking the cost of the essential "on an hourly basis" over the last two or three days. "We purchased sugar from wholesalers at Moulivibazar and Kaptan Bazar at Tk 56 a kilogramme on Wednesday and sold it at Tk 60 to cover transport costs," said Jahir Uddin. Retailers said the Desbandhu and Fresh companies usually sold sugar at Tk 42 from trucks at the market, coming directly from their factories, although they failed to arrive Thursday. Moulivibazar wholesaler association general secretary Golam Mowla said: "We wholesalers are not increasing the price of sugar, but there is a crisis of sugar in the market." Mowla blamed sugar refiners for the ongoing price hikes, saying they had been selling sugar to wholesalers at Tk 39 a kg at the mill gate, and had suspended selling altogether over the last two days. "On top of that, refiners have difficulty meeting supply because Trading Corporation of Bangladesh has purchased 1,000 tonnes of sugar," Mowla said. However, a retailer at Karwan Bazar, who asked not to be named, said sugar was always available at the mill gate "for the right price". Golam Mostafa, Bangladesh Sugar Refiners Association secretary and Deshbandhu Sugar Mill chairman, denied the existence of sugar shortage at the mills. "We supply 4,000 tonnes of sugar a day over Ramadan, though demand stands at 3,000 tonnes a day," said Mostafa. He said sugar was selling at Tk 39 a kg through delivery orders at the mill gate. The government withdrew tax on imported of unrefined sugar on Aug 15 to help stabilise the essential and reduced tax from Tk 7,000 to Tk 3,000 per metric tonne on purified sugar. The commerce secretary said TCB had already received 600 tonnes of sugar for refiners and would take remaining 400 tonnes soon. This will have a positive impact on the market, he said. bdne
