 LOS ANGELES, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities on Tuesday returned to the Northern California home where kidnap victim Jaycee Dugard was held for 18 years, searching the grounds for evidence that could link her suspected abductors to two girls missing since the late 1980s. Investigators from two nearby towns said they were hunting for clues that could tie Phillip and Nancy Garrido, the married couple charged with snatching 11-year-old Dugard from a street near her South Lake Tahoe home in 1991, to the kidnappings of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht or 13-year-old Ilene Misheloff. Dugard, who is now 29, surfaced last month after convicted rapist and registered sex offender Phillip Garrido, 58, aroused the suspicion of police at a college campus while proselytizing and was questioned by his parole officer. The couple is accused of holding Dugard for nearly two decades in a squalid collection of tents and sheds behind their home near Antioch, east of San Francisco, where prosecutors say Phillip Garrido raped her and fathered her two children. Both Phillip and Nancy Garrido, 54, have pleaded innocent to 29 criminal counts that include kidnapping for sexual purposes, forcible lewd acts and rape. Police say Garecht, who was grabbed in front of the Rainbow Market in the town of Hayward on Nov. 18, 1988, bore a striking resemblance to Dugard and and that a sketch of the suspect had been likened to Phillip Garrido. "I'm hoping this will lead to a resolution," Michaela's mother, Sharon Murch, told reporters. "I know that if Jaycee Dugard can be found alive and come home after 18 years, then my daughter can be found alive and come home after 18 years." "Michaela, if you're out there somewhere within the sound of my voice, I just want you to know that we love you, we miss you, there's nothing that could possibly have happened over the last 20 years that could change that and we want you to come home," she said. Hayward Police Lieutenant Christine Orrey called it "one of the strongest leads we have pursued so far" in the Garecht case. Misheloff vanished on Jan. 30, 1989, and a car found on the Garrido property appears to fit the description of a sedan she was seen getting into on the day she disappeared, police said. Forensic scientists have already concluded that a sliver of bone found on a property neighboring the Garridos' home was probably human, although further tests are required to establish that it is modern and not Native American remains, which are commonly found in the area. Phillip Garrido served 10 years in prison for the 1976 rape of another South Lake Tahoe woman. He was arrested in 1972 for drugging and raping a 14-year-old girl, but was never prosecuted because she refused to testify in court
