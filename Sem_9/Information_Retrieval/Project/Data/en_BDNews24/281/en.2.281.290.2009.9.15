 BRUSSELS, Sep 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union expressed concern on Tuesday about delays in finalising the results of Afghanistan's presidential election, but said the most important thing was to gain a credible outcome. Partial results from the Aug. 20 election show President Hamid Karzai inching towards possible re-election in a single round, but investigations into fraud could play a key role in determining the outcome. "I am concerned we don't have the final result, but at the same time I know the difficulties of this process," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told reporters before the 27-country bloc's foreign ministers discussed Afghanistan in Brussels. "I don't think we should precipitate this," he said. "We would like to see things going faster but the most important thing is that we have a result that is credible in the end." German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said it was vital to deal with election-related complaints properly. "We cannot ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the European foreign ministers that these will be scrutinised. It is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole Afghan population." The head of a U.N.-backed watchdog, the Electoral Complaints Commission, said on Tuesday a partial recount ordered to prevent fraud in the election would cover more than 10 percent of polling stations. The announcement means enough votes are likely to be subjected to the fraud investigation to potentially alter the outcome, prolonging uncertainty over the result. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said the future EU aid effort should be shaped to ensure it gave maximum assistance to those politicians determined to make a difference in changing the country. "We are engaged in a long-term effort to help to build some sort of stability in that country. It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be fast, it is not going to be cheap but it is essential for the people of Afghanistan," Bildt said. "The most important thing now is the conclusion of the election process and that we get a new government in Kabul, and then we will see how to help that government move forward with its programme." STEINMEIER EXIT PLAN French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said it was important the election produce a government that was the most credible and least corrupt as possible. He said it would be up to Afghans to decide whether the election was credible. Steinmeier said he was pleased with support from EU ministers for a 10-point plan he had drawn up that would allow a withdrawal of the roughly 4,200 German troops in Afghanistan by 2013 if Afghan forces could handle the country's security. "We need a clear agreement with the newly elected president about which objectives we want to achieve in which time frame," the German minister said. "Everybody knows one has to put pressure on the Afghans with respect to good governance, the fight against corruption and drug production. But we must enhance our own efforts at the same time ... to create the conditions to reduce the troops. "This is only possible if the Afghan state is able to take over security in its own hands," he said. Analysts say Afghanistan's foreign backers have been dismayed by the prospect of another victory for Karzai, once a darling of the West, as his previous administration was widely seen as corrupt and unable to exert influence throughout the insurgency-racked country. They say that if Karzai stays in power it will increase pressure on Western governments to withdraw troops from the big Western military operation in the country, given the increasing unpopularity of the war among vot
