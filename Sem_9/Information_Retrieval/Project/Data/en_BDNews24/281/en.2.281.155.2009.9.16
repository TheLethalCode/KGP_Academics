<TITLE> Pakistan's Younis wants international break </TITLE>

 KARACHI, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council should give serious consideration to organising a proper break before major tournaments, Pakistan captain Younis Khan said on Wednesday. The Champions Trophy starts in South Africa next week and some teams are still involved in international series. "There is too much cricket being played before the Champions Trophy. I think it is only fair that before such a major event players should get a break from international matches," Younis told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. Australia and England finish a one-day series just two days before the start of the eight-nation Champions Trophy, while a tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand ended only on Sunday. Younis said international cricketers were under great pressure because of the packed calendar, adding that the quality of the sport was suffering. "It would be ideal if the ICC and its boards can agree to say a 10-day break in the international calendar before a World Cup or Champions Trophy which are major events," he said. Younis said too much international cricket also tended to dilute interest in tournaments. "Every board and team naturally has it own way of looking at how the international cricket calendar should be run or organizing their commitments before a major event. But I think the ICC can enforce a uniform policy when it comes to a World Cup or Champions Trophy," he added. "One series ends and the next one begins soon after and the players don't get a chance to take a proper break to recharge themselves. It is also adding to the fitness problems of players." Pakistan, who won this year's World Twenty20 tournament, have had a long break to prepare for the Champions Trophy with their last match on Aug. 12. "The last time we went to the T20 World Cup in England in June we had not played much cricket. But the players were fresh and it worked for us. This time also we have done our preparations for the Champions Trophy," he said.
