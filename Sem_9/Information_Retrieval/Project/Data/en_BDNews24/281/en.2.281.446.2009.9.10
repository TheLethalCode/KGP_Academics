<TEXT>
 Pabna, 9 September (bdnews24.com)  The government is planning a concerted crackdown on criminal activities extremist groups in the crime-blackspots of Pabna and 12 southwest districts, which could be launched as early as October, officials said on Wednesday. Pabna superintendent of police Nibash Chandra Majhi told bdnews24.com, "An emergency meeting has been called on September 12 in Pabna with all top law enforcement officials of the concerned districts." Majhi said state minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku, Inspector General of Police Nur Mohammad and Director General of Rapid Action Batallion Hasan Mahmud Khandker would also be present. The central district of Pabna, always troubled by extremist groups, has recently seen a serious deterioration of law and order, officials say. Law enforcers of the district have reported a spate of encounters with extremists in past weeks, many ending in shootouts and 'crossfire' deaths of the suspects. According to law enforcing agencies, the southwestern districts of Khulna, Barisal, Rajbari, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Jessore, Jhinaidah, Meherpur, Narail, Magura, Chuadanga, Kustia have also seen extremist groups becoming more active, with crimes such as murder, extortion and kidnapping on the rise. A top police official in Pabna said Wednesday that authorities had wanted to launch a crackdown earlier but had postponed it until the end of Ramadan. "The date will be fixed in the Sept 12 meeting for some time after Eid. It could be as early as October 1," he said. Law and order break-down In recent weeks, the IGP, chief of RAB and a parliamentary standing committee have all voiced concern on the deterioration of law and order in the southwest. IGP Nur Mohammad has asked the government to look into possible alternatives to the tender process of awarding contracts in the southwest as a means to curb rampant crime in the region. "Trouble often arises in the southwest over the tendering process, and so the police have advised the government to look for some alternative to current practices at the policy making level," Nur told reporters on Sept 1 after a monthly meeting on crime at police headquarters. Nur said the meeting had decided to conduct a "vigorous drive against extremists" in the crime-prone region of the country. RAB chief Hasan Mahmud Khandaker just two days later said extortion and tender-grabbing ruled the region. He said investigations were ongoing into who are directly involved and who are behind such crimes and why they are on the rise. "Those indirectly backing these crimes in the region are being identified. RAB has already intensified its operations to keep such crimes under control," Khandaker told reporters at a views-exchange meeting at RAB headquarters on Sept 3. He said all efforts were on to curb them. A parliamentary watchdog on the same day observed that the law and order in the southwestern region "has deteriorated in recent times" but it ruled out ruling party links, as has been alleged by some quarters. Meanwhile, home minister Sahara Khatun said last Sunday an ongoing drive against outlaws and extremists in the southwest is based on a list prepared by the law-enforcement agencies. "Extremists and terrorists have regrouped in the south-western region," the minister said. But she denied that any extra-judicial killings were taking place. "Those who are getting killed are dying in gun battles with the police and RAB," she said. Sahara hinted that another list of outlaws was going to be prepared. "The people linked to the outlawed parties should also be listed." "They are changing their strategies. The law enforcers will have to change theirs as well," the minister said. Human-rights watchdog Odhikar said 19 people were killed in crossfire/shootouts/encounters with RAB and police in August, most of them occurring in the southwestern region. Ten of the victims were activists of outlawed parties. According to RAB statistics, presented at the start of September, among the 577 killings countrywide in crossfire/shootouts/encounters with RAB and police over the past five year, 509 occurred in the 13 districts mentioned above. bdnews24
