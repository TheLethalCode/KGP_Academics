 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)The Asian Development Bank has stressed the importance of the government's "bold" public-private partnership initiative in bridging the widening infrastructure gap as public investment slides. ADB's Quarterly Economic Update on Bangladesh, released Tuesday, also said the country faces several downside risks in the near term including delayed recovery of the global economy, likely shortfalls in revenue collections and mobilisation of external financing, and the onset of natural disasters. Public investment declined from 5 percent of GDP to 4.6 percent in FY 2009, as Annual Development Programme implementation remained weak, said the QEU. "Taking the economy to a higher growth trajectory and more rapid and sustainable poverty reduction will require large-scale infrastructure investment well beyond what the government can provide," the said. The report praised the government for "striking a prudent balance between the need to stimulate the economy against the backdrop of the global recession" in its budget for FY 2010. "The budget increases spending on social safety net programmes to protect the poor, while preserving macroeconomic stability." The ADB also lauded the government's "bold initiatives to create a framework for PPP to enhance private investment and streamline project approval processes (among other measures) to accelerate ADP utilisation". But, in view of the widening infrastructure gap, the report highlighted the need for strengthening the PPP framework. Growth and decline The QEU said high growth in food-grain production (8.1 percent) aided by favourable weather and strong government support saw the agriculture sector grow by 4.6 percent in FY 2009, up from 3.2 percent in FY2008. However, industry sector growth declined to 5.9 percent in FY 2009 from 6.8 percent in FY 2008 as export production in the second half of the fiscal year slowed due to the global slowdown. "Weak investor sentiment also affected manufacturing growth, as did slow implementation of power and energy projects, and weak construction activity," said the report. Growth in the power and gas subsectors dropped to 4.5 percent in FY 2009 from 6.8 percent in FY 2008, while growth in the construction sector dipped slightly to 5.7 percent. Slower trade growth and slack in investment activities due to the global economic recession led to a slowdown in private sector credit growth to 14.6 percent year-on-year in June 2009, down from 24.9 percent in June 2008. Targets The Bangladesh Bank's inflation target of 6.5 percent in FY 2010 appears realistic in view of recent trends, said the report. Annual inflation declined to 6.7 percent in FY 2009 from 9.9 percent in FY2008, with successive cuts in domestic fuel prices, and the fall in international commodity prices. On a year-on-year basis, inflation fell steadily throughout the fiscal year, reaching 2.3 percent year-on-year in June 2009, its lowest level since December 2001.. Revenue collection remained unchanged at 11.2 percent of GDP in FY 2009 because of the sharp fall in import growth due to the fall in international fuel and commodity prices, the global economic crisis and slower expansion of economic activity. Revenue from the national Board of Revenue sources increased by 10.7 percent, far below the budget target 18.6 percent and the 27.4 percent growth of the previous fiscal year. On the expenditure side, public spending was lower at 15.3 percent of GDP, down from 15.9 percent in FY 2008, because of savings on food, fuel, and fertiliser subsidies given the fall in international prices, and ADP underutilisation. As savings on public spending was larger than the shortfall in revenue, the fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP was lower than the budget target of 5.0 percent. Balance of Payments Exports grew by only 10.3 percent in FY 2009, a sharp deceleration from the 15.9 percent in FY 2008, as retail sales in developed economies fell, leading to a slowdown in garment export orders. However, imports in FY 2009 rose by only 4.1 percent, mainly due to the sharp fall in imports of food items and capital machinery. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed to $4.7 billion in FY 2009, from $5.3 billion in FY 2008. Growth of workers' remittances remained robust at 22.4 percent and pushed the current account surplus of $2.5 billion from $680 million in FY 2008. The overall balance of payments surplus ballooned to $2.1 billion in FY 2009 from $331 million in FY 2008. Gross foreign exchange reserves were $7.5 billion (3.8 months of imports) at end-June 2009, up $1.3 billion during the fiscal year.
