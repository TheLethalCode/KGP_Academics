<TITLE> Power for transit not acceptable to BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP on Sunday said the nation will not accept the government plan to import power from India "in exchange for providing corridor or transit". It reaffirmed support to Monday's half-day general strike in the capital and said it would support programmes designed to protest any move against the nation's interest. BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, referring to the foreign minister's recent visit to India, said: "What our foreign minister promised to India and what she is expecting in return is not clear to the nation." "The people of the country will not accept any deal to import power by providing transit. Providing transit will threaten our country's security and sovereignty." He said, "We believe in friendship and brotherhood with the neighbouring country, we are respectful to them. But the people of the country will not accept any bid, which will sell out our interest." A left-leaning pressure group, the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, has called the strike in Dhaka to protest against deals with two international gas companies on provision that they would be able to export up to 80 percent of gas if found in three blocs in the Bay of Bengal. The ruling Awami League accuses the BNP of instigating the strike call. The Awami League and the government have also asked the national committee to withdraw the strike. Delwar accused the government of acting against the country's interest by handing over gas blocs to the foreign companies. "As we are supporting the strike, now some of the ministers are blaming us that we are instigating the strike," Delwar told party activists at a discussion organised by its farmers' wing, Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal. "BNP supports it (Monday's strike) and will be supporting any move against national interest," he added. Delwar criticised the government for what he said was "weak foreign policy", in particular reference to border killings by Indian border guards, the BSF. bdnew
