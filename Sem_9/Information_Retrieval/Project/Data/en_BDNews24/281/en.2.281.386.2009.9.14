 Dhaka, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com)Local fashion houses have emphasised fabrics in this year's Eid collections. "This year's Eid falls right in between summer and winter. So, everyone is concerned about the material," said fashion designer Khalid Mahmud Khan. The timing of this year's Eid-ul-Fitr led fashion designers to think about not too heavy or not too light cloth, comfortable for the weather, Khan who has runs Kay Kraft told bdnews24.com. According to him the best fabric fit for this Eid is Tant (loom cloth), either hand made or machine made. "That's why this year's collection is mainly based on loom fabrics from all the regions of Bangladesh." On colours, he said Kay Kraft has worked with all the basic colours in different shades. Designs are based on local motifs, with this year's new introduction of floral and geometric patterns, Khan said. Shahin Ahmed of fashion house Anjan also said loom fabrics were their top priority. "Naturally, it is the best thing to wear, if you opt for local fabrics." Then again, local made cotton, endi cotton, endi silk, half-silk and muslin are also popular among customers this year. Ahmed said Anjan's Eid collection this year stressed different shades of maroon. "Maroon always tops customers' favourites," he told bdnews24.com. Anjan's has also experimented with sleeve lengths on salwar-kameez outfits. "We've introduced the same basic design with 3-4 types of sleeves like short, quarter, long and sleeveless as well." Biplob Shaha, the chief designer of fashion house Rong says that the cut of this year's salwar-kameez has seen a lot of change. "Designers have also concentrated more on Orna (the scarf) this year." But, Saree, is still the most popular outfit for women. "Traditional Sarees saw designs on only one side, but this year whole body design of the Saree has come up as the newest thing," said Ishrat Jahan, the designer for Deshal. Usually Sarees are made with a combination of one or two colors of thread but this year as much as four to five colors have been used, she added. "Bright colors combining designs based on lighter shades along with the use of glittery materials are popular this year," Jahan told bdnews24.com. The designers may differ on patterns, material or even the colour of the year, but all of them had one thing in common, trying to reach all ages and income groups. All the fashion houses which used to sell products at a premium price and specialised in a single category have switched to multi-priced ranges for children to adults. "The thing is we are trying to reach all type of customers; that's why you will find dresses starting from Tk 600 to Tk 10,000 in our outlets," said designer Khalid Mahmud Khan of Kay Kraft.
