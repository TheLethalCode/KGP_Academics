 MUMBAI, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rupee firmed to its highest in nearly a month on Thursday, as a fifth straight rise in stocks boosted hopes for foreign portfolio inflows. The dollar's weakness overseas also helped sentiment. At 10:40 a.m. (0510 GMT), the partially convertible rupee was at 48.33/34 per dollar, 0.4 percent stronger than its Wednesday's close of 48.51/52.

One-month offshore non-deliverable forward rupee contracts were quoting at 48.33/43, unchanged from the onshore spot rate, indicating a bullish outlook in the near term. "The strong rally in crude oil from below $70 to $73-$75 is a concern for the rupee," J.Moses Harding, head of global markets at IndusInd Bank, wrote in a daily note. "For today and tomorrow, let us stay tuned to 48.25-48.50 and watch EUR/USD at 1.45-1.46 and also the Sensex between 16,100-16,500," he said, referring to the main stock in
