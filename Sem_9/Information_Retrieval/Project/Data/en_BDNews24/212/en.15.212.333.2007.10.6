 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh has been elected chairman of the group of 50 least developed countries, the government said in a statement. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury was installed as chairman of the LDC group Friday. The outgoing chairman, Benin's foreign minister Moussa Okanla, formally handed over the charge to Chowdhury. The group of 50 least developed countries at the UN was formed in January 2001. Benin, an African country, was elected the first president of the group. "Bangladesh was elected chairman with unanimous support of the foreign ministers of the 50 member countries. The election victory was the result of a diplomatic effort over a period of more than one month," the statement said. After taking over as the group's chairman, Chowdhury said: "Our challenge at the moment is the proper implementation of the Brussels Programme agreed upon unanimously by the international community." The programme was adopted by the least developed countries at the third UN conference in 2001. Chowdhury hoped that developed countries would fulfill their pledge to give duty-free access to commodities from developing countries. bdnew
