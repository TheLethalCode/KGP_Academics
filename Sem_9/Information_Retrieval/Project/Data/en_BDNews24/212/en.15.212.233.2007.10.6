 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka roads virtually ground to a standstill Saturday as the annual Ramadan traffic jams were compounded by an overturned goods truck at Jahangir Gate. Hundreds of vehicles idled in the baking heat with some taking up to an hour and a half to travel from Farmgate to Shahbagh. Sub-inspector Hafizur Rahman from Tejgaon Police Station said the situation eased slightly after the truck was removed at 1.15pm, after blocking the road for over four hours. Hundreds of frustrated passengers abandoned packed buses, CNG autorickshaws and rickshaws in favour of the sidewalks as the traffic police struggled to deal with the gridlock. Traffic police and commuters reported widespread gridlock throughout the capital with traffic backed up from Kanchpur Bridge to Tongi Bridge following the snarl-up in front of the entrance to the cantonment. Many of the main routes in and out of the city became impassable including the main urban arteries of Sayedabad and Jatrabari. Ambulance sirens blared as they were caught up in the chaos, although traffic police could do little to help in the bumper to bumper conditions. Bus driver Majid Mia, who got caught up in the city-wide jam at Sheraton Hotel crossing, said: "The passengers were shouting at me. Most of my passengers eventually left the bus." Eid shoppers travelling to markets around the capital increased the misery, often leaving two rows of parked cars outside popular destinations such as New Market. bdnews24.
