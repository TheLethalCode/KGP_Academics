<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  The chief coordinator of the newly formed Progressive Democratic Party Saturday said there was no problem with holding national elections amid a state of emergency. Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi told reporters at a news briefing in the city: "The elections will be fair if the state of emergency is in force. Otherwise it won't be." His comment stands in exact opposition to the demands of the country's two major political parties. Both the Awami League and the BNP have called for the withdrawal of the state of emergency well ahead of polls. Quarishi asked the government to take stern action against miscreants to keep emergency rules intact, "because these miscreants disrupt law and order during voting". On the proposed 'Truth Commission' he said: "The government can make concessions to businessmen within the purview of the law. The business community is truly panicked." The PDP helmsman said he would declare a 151-strong party committee before the Eid. The party's constitution has already been prepared, he said. bdnews24.com
