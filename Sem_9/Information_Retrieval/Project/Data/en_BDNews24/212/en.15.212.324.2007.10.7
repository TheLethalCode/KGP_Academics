<TITLE> China's poker-faced leader shows hand at paper cutting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poker-faced Chinese President Hu Jintao's prowess in decorative paper-cutting will soon go on display at an exhibition of the traditional art, local media reported on Saturday. Hu is known to the outside world as the stern chief of China's ruling Communist Party who spurns the public singing and theatrics that were a hallmark of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. But that stiff image will be slightly dented when Hu's amateurish effort at paper-cutting, titled "Returning to mother's home," is shown at a handicrafts exhibition in the central city Wuhan in November, according to a city newspaper, the Changjiang Times (www.changjiangtimes.com). Cutting red paper into intricate images often displayed on home windows is a traditional Chinese craft still popular in many parts of the countryside. Hu made his paper-cut when visiting northwestern Chinese villagers in February for the traditional Lunar New Year celebrations. He is preparing for a Party congress in mid-October that is set to give him five more years as national leader.
