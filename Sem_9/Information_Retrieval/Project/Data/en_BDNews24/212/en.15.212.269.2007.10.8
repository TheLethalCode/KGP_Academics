 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The education ministry has asked educational institutions in the capital to remain closed temporarily from mid-November to December to facilitate work on voter-listing. The ministry in a circular Monday said that a voter list with photographs would be prepared and national identity cards issued in Dhaka City Corporation area from mid-November to December. Different examinations of schools and colleges, including annual examinations in secondary schools and junior scholarship examinations, are scheduled to be held at the time. The statement said that different examinations including annual examinations and junior scholarship examinations were important. "On the other hand, preparation of the voter list with photographs and issuing national ID cards were also in public interest. The two things have to be complete with priority," the ministry said. The circular gave guidance to the educational institutions, saying the schedule for examinations would have to be slightly changed or coordinated in the interest of voter registration work. "Besides, if necessary, classes have to be suspended in those educational institutions where voter registration would take place." The circular also said the director general of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education as well as heads of educational institutions would take necessary steps. bdnews24.
