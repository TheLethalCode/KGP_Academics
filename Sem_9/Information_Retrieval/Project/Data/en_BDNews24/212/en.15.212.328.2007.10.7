<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has no plan to grant general amnesty to corruption suspects, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday. In a meeting with OCAB at the Jatiya Press Club, Mainul said the government was pondering "reconciliation" but how it could be done was not clear. "The government was thinking about reconciliation through the proposed Truth Commission," he said. Asked why the reconciliation process would be applicable to the businessmen alone, the adviser said the law would not mention businessmen in particular. "But the government will give preference to the businessmen." Asked whether such reconciliatory steps would be considered for the politicians as well, Mainul said: "It depends on the situation to be created." "We don't want to establish any controlled democracy. We want to set an example by handing power over to a responsible government elected through fair election." Election is not far away, he said. bdnew
