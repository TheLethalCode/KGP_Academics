 KABUL, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a US convoy in Kabul on Saturday, killing two Afghan civilians, an Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman said, and wounding at least one US soldier. It was the third suicide bombing in Kabul in the past eight days and comes amid a Taliban Ramadan offensive. "I can see fire and smoke coming from the foreign vehicles," said a witness, Ghiasuddin Barez. "The explosion took place about 100 metres (yards) in front of me. There were two black vehicles on fire and people running and screaming." Two large, black Chevrolet four-wheel drive vehicles of the type usually used by non-military or diplomatic staff were hit by the blast. One of the vehicles was turned on its side and on fire, the other received minor damage. "The attack was on a US convoy," said Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary. "Two Afghan civilians were killed and one wounded. We are still investigating. We don't know about foreign casualties at the moment. It will be announced later." Witnesses said they saw two bodies on the ground and said they appeared to be US civilian or diplomatic staff. One US soldier lay wounded on a stretcher receiving first aid. "I was sitting just over there reading a book," said witness Zekeria Jan. "Suddenly, I heard a bang. I was shocked and fell to the ground. I saw two cars hit by a suicide bomber. Then I was unconscious so I don't know how many people were killed." Afghan police cordoned off the area as US and British troops arrived at the scene. Four US military humvees emerged from the US embassy compound and headed for the site. A US-led coalition force spokesman said he was unaware of the attack, but said a soldier had been wounded by a roadside bomb in another part of Kabul. After suffering heavy casualties in conventional battles, Taliban rebels have grown increasingly reliant in the last two years on suicide attacks aimed at convincing ordinary Afghans their government and its Western backers cannot provide security. Afghanistan is going through its worst period of violence since US-led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in 2001. bd
