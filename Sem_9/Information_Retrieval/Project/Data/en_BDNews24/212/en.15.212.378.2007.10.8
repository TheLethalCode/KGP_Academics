 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Monday officially announced the Ispahani Group of Companies as title sponsor of the National Cricket League (NCL) 2007-2008 on the seventh occasion of nine. "Many corporate houses showed their interest and collected papers, but only the Ispahani Group and earned the right to sponsor the National Cricket League," said BCB tournament committee chairman Selim Bhuiyan at a press conference at a city hotel Monday. "Ispahani offered Tk 35 lakh, but we later raised the amount to Tk 40 lakh after a fruitful discussion," said Bhuiyan adding that the same company last year gave Tk 30 lakh for the NCL. The Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League, the country's lone first class cricket league, is scheduled to begin on Oct 19 with six divisional teams first playing four-dayers, followed by one-dayers. On the opening day, defending champions Dhaka will take on Khulna at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, Barisal host Chittagong at Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Borga and runners-up Rajshahi host Sylhet at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. The tournament committee has already taken a massive initiative to make the NCL competitive through announcement of a number of prizes and increases in the match fee for the cricketers. "To make the league attractive, we have talked to some satellite channels for telecasting the matches live from venues, but we haven't still reached any agreements," said the tournament committee chairman. Tournament committee member secretary Hafizur Rahman Joarder said the total budget of the NCL has been increased to 4.15 crore this year from last year's 2.56 crore with most of the money to go for players' accommodation, food, transport and practice. Chairman of Ispahani Group of Companies Mirza Ali Behrouze Ispahani, its senior manager (marketing) SM SHowkat Hussain, member secretary of the BCB media committee Ishtiaq Ahmed and BCB chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman were present among others. bdn
