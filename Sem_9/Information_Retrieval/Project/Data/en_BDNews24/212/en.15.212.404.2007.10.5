 KARACHI, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani selectors have included former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq in the squad for the second test against South Africa in Lahore from Oct 8. Chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said Inzamam and senior batsman Mohammad Yousuf would play. "Inzamam and Yousuf should add depth to the batting line-up for an important test," he said. Pakistan are in danger of losing the first test which is in its fifth day in Karachi. Yousuf pulled out of the first test at the last moment saying he was not match fit after having not played any cricket or trained since early August. But the selector said Yousuf had remained with the team and trained with them. He said Inzamam had also been training and had just returned after playing for county side Yorkshire in England. Inzamam has announced he will retire from test cricket after Lahore. He retired from one-day internationals in March this year. Pakistan squad: Shoaib Malik (Capt), Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Younis Khan, Salman Butt, Taufiq Umar, Faisal Iqbal, Kamran Akmal, Mohammad Hafeez, Danish Kaneria, Abdul Rehman, Mohammad Asif, Umar Gul, Misbah-ul-Haq and Rao Iftikhar
