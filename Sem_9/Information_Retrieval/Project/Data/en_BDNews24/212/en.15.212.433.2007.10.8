<TITLE> Second nationwide postal strike starts in UK </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Householders across the country face another week of little or no post as thousands of Royal Mail workers began a second 48-hour nationwide strike on Monday in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. Up to 130,000 members of staff stopped working from 3 a.m, Royal Mail confirmed. "Customers should expect severe disruption to all postal services during the strikes and for a significant period afterwards," it said. Media reports said the strike, which is due to end on Wednesday, would cost Royal Mail more than 50 million pounds, and could cause long-term damage as customers switched to other communication methods. Royal Mail says the Communication Workers Union (CWU) has "unrealistic and unaffordable proposals", but that support for the action is weakening, with 50 percent more people working than during previous national strike days. It said it would try to keep some post moving through the system during the latest action. Customers can take letters directly to 14,200 post offices, which remain open. Union leaders, who have called for a mass rally later on Monday, have called on the government to try to end the dispute. The government however says it is up to the union and the company to try to reach agreement in talks, which are due to continue on Monday. Further weekly strikes are scheduled from Oct. 15 if no agreement is reached. The strikes follow what the union calls a below inflation pay offer and plans to cut 40,000 jobs through automated mail-sorting. The company, fighting private competition after losing its 350-year monopoly on postal services last year, says the only way it can improve pay, protect pensions and deliver customer service is by modernising.
