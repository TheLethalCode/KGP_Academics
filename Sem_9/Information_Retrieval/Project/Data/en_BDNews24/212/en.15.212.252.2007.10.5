 LONDON, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown kept election speculation alive on Friday by scheduling two major announcements for early next week, though opinion polls showed his party's commanding poll lead evaporating. Brown will update parliament on plans to reduce the number of British troops in Iraq on Monday while finance minister Alistair Darling will announce government spending plans on Tuesday. That fits in with a scenario of Brown rushing out major announcements ready to call an election in early November, two and a half years before he needs to. But analysts believe an election is far less likely after three new opinion polls showed the ruling Labour Party's lead over the opposition Conservatives shrinking, and in one case disappearing. "Whether they will or not will depend on their own analysis of the polls and at the moment it is looking highly uncertain," said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. Wyn Grant, politics professor at Warwick University, said Brown must weigh up whether Labour could increase its parliamentary majority in a snap poll. "I think the chances are against that," he said. "They've created this expectation there is going to be an election, so if they back down now it looks as if they are scared of going to the country at this time. So they've painted themselves into a corner to some extent," he told Reuters. Brown gave the green light on Friday to a 16 billion pound ($32.57 billion) underground rail link across London he said would create 30,000 jobs, a move sure to please voters in the capital. CONSERVATIVES BOUNCE BACK Brown was tempted to call an early poll after Labour soared to an 11-point lead over the Conservatives. But David Cameron's Conservatives bounced back after a party conference this week when they called for cuts in inheritance tax and tax breaks for people buying their first home. An ICM poll in the Guardian newspaper, carried out after Cameron's conference speech, showed the Conservatives closing an eight-point gap and drawing level with Labour on 38 percent. A Populus poll for The Times showed Labour's lead slipping to three points from 10 points a week earlier. A YouGov poll for Channel 4 poll put Labour on 40 percent and the Conservatives on 36 percent, a drop of seven points in Labour's lead in little over a week. The Conservatives would accuse Brown of losing his nerve if he now decided against an election. Brown is expected to make a final decision on an election over the weekend after seeing whether the Conservatives' 'bounce# is sustained in newspaper polls and the party's own surveys. Brown, in office for 100 days since taking over from Tony Blair, knows that if he loses an election, he would be one of the shortest serving prime ministers in British history. Tuesday is the last day Brown could call a Nov. 1 poll and scheduling the lengthy public spending debate for that day makes it unlikely Brown could also fit in an election announcement. He could announce a Nov. 8 election in the following week however. Darling looks set to lower Britain's 2008 economic growth outlook and pour billions more into the state health service on Tuesday. Analysts say one reason for Brown to call an early election would be to win a new term before the economy weakens next ye
