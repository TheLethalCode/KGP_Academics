<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 07 (bdnews24.com) The two Bangladeshis, arrested by the Maldives police in connection with a bomb explosion on Sept 30, were released Sunday as they had no links with the blast, foreign ministry officials said. "The Bangladeshi mission in Male informed me that the two Bangladeshis arrested by the Maldives police were released today," MAK Mahmood, additional secretary to the foreign ministry, told bdnews24.com. However he could not confirm the names of the Bangladeshis. He disclosed that the Maldives police said the two arrested Bangladeshis did not own the four mobile SIM cards, which may have been used in carrying out the bomb attack. Unknown persons are now thought to have counterfeited the signature of the two Bangladeshis and bought four SIM cards in their names, the police said. The two Bangladeshis were earlier suspected of maintaining links with the bombers using the SIM cards in question. The police arrested 10 people on Oct 1 for their alleged links with the bomb explosion that wounded 12 foreign tourists in the remote Indian Ocean island chain. bdne
