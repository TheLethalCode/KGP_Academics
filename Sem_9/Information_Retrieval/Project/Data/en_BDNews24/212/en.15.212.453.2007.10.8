 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  To shrug off the 'picnic image' of the National Cricket League, the Bangladesh Cricket Board Monday announced a number of new prizes for cricketers and teams in a bid to make the national league more attractive. The Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League is scheduled to start on October 19 with six divisional teams taking part in home and away matches. It is said that national cricketers focus least on the national cricket league due to lower financial incentives, so that the country's only first class cricket league turns into 'picnic cricket' by the day. The BCB ad hoc committee has therefore included the new prizes in the award-list this year, alongside the proposal of the previous elected committee. The match fee and previous prize moneys have also been increased substantially. These various initiatives have doubled the total cost of the NCL compared to its last budget. The total budget for the tournament has been increased to Tk 4.15 crore from Tk 2.56 crore last year. Each cricketer will now receive Tk 10,000 and Tk 5,000 for playing four-dayer and one-dayer matches respectively, compared to the previous Tk 2000 and Tk 1000. The 12th man will get Tk 5,000 in both versions, and the 13th, 14th and 15th man will receive Tk 40%, 30% and 20% of the match fees respectively. The 1000-run scorer and 60-wicket taker in a four-dayer will receive Tk 1 lakh each, while man of the tournament, best all-rounder and best fielder get Tk 40,000, Tk 30,000 and Tk 20,000 respectively. The man of the match in four-dayer and one-dayer matches will get Tk 5,000 and Tk 3,000 respectively, while the match winners will receive Tk 20, 000 and Tk 10,000. The league champions and runners-up in both four-dayer and one-dayer matches have been increased to Tk 10 lakh and Tk 4 lakh. The tournament committee has also increased the transport allowance and daily allowance for the cricketer. Other prize amounts include: Tk 5 lakh for four-dayer runners-up; Tk 2 lakh for one-dayer runners-up; Tk 20,000 each for the highest run-scorer and highest wicket-taker in both versions.
