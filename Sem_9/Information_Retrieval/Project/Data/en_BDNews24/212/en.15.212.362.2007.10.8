 MANILA, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Developing countries in Asia are struggling to meet the UN-set millennium goals although the region is on course to cut extreme poverty, a report released on Monday showed. The Asian Development Bank said that the region, home to 61 percent of the world's population, is on its way to meeting the extreme poverty goals thanks to rapid economic growth in China and India.

Ali said corruption was preventing some developing countries from improving the lives of their poorest citizens.

This is to my mind an acid test, and otherwise everything is just rhetoric, nothing is real," Ali said.
