<TITLE> German train drivers stage 3-hour nationwide strike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's GDL train drivers' union briefly halted much of the country's train traffic during a 3-hour strike on Friday but failed to achieve its aim of bringing rail operator Deutsche Bahn's service to a standstill. Deutsche Bahn, which the government wants to partially privatise by 2009, has been locked in a months-long wage dispute with GDL, which says Germany's train drivers are underpaid compared with their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. At 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) the union's drivers stopped their trains and blocked many tracks across Germany to force Deutsche Bahn to give into their demands for a pay increase of up to 31 percent. Deutsche Bahn has rejected GDL's proposed pay hike. After the strike ended at 11 a.m. The 34,000-member GDL warned Deutsche Bahn to expect more disruptions, possibly as early as Monday. Deutsche Bahn had prepared for Friday's strike action by hiring replacement drivers to take over locomotives after striking union drivers were ordered out of train stations by Deutsche Bahn personnel, often accompanied by police. The rail operator said it managed to keep half the country's regional and local trains running, though GDL disputed this figure, insisting the real number was closer to 10 percent. But Reuters eyewitnesses saw trains moving through train stations in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, indicating that GDL had failed to achieve its goal of crippling train travel. Berlin's main train station, a major hub for international, regional and local train traffic in the city of 3.4 million, was unusually quiet during the morning rush hour as commuters steered clear of train travel, preferring to drive instead. Traffic jams clogged many German motorways as a result. Deutsche Bahn set up customer care centres at train stations with coffee and croissants. Few German passengers appeared angry about the strike though a few tourists had been caught by surprise and complained about delays. GDL deputy chairman Guenther Kinscher said they did not want to excessively inconvenience Deutsche Bahn's passengers but made it clear train travellers should expect more strikes soon. "I can't rule out the possibility of another strike on Monday," he told n-tv television. Hagen Lesch, an analyst at the economic think-tank IW in Cologne, said the economic and political impact of GDL's latest strike was probably negligible. He also predicted that the union would eventually have to compromise with Deutsche Bahn. "GDL is running into a dead end," he said. "This will only work if the labour unions are in agreement with one another." Two other unions struck an agreement with Deutsche Bahn for pay increases of 4.5 percent and are no longer striking. The company tried unsuccessfully to persuade GDL to accept the deal. After disruptive GDL strikes over the summer, Deutsche Bahn and the union agreed to hold new talks through September, but they have been unable to reach a compromise. Recently Deutsche Bahn offered to pay the drivers for an extra two hours' work per week -- which it said would result in bottom-line salary increases of up to 10 percent. But GDL has said the new offer just means more work for the same p
