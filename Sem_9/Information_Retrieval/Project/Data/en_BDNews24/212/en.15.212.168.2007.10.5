 ISLAMABAD, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court rejected on Friday an opposition bid to postpone Saturday's presidential election but said the result would not be announced until a ruling on challenges to military president Pervez Musharraf's participation. "It is unanimously decided that the election process that has already commenced shall continue," judge Javed Iqbal told the court. "But the final notification of the result of the election shall not be announced until the decision is made," he said, referring to a ruling on the opposition challenges. The court will hold its next hearing into the challenges on Oct. 17 The ordinance, a final draft of which Bhutto approved late on Thursday, addresses one of her main demands by removing the threat of prosecution against her and other former politicians and government officials. It will erase corruption charges against her and others paving the way for her return on Oct. 18 from more than eight years of self-exile to lead her party in a general election due by mid-January. But it must be formally promulgated by Musharraf before it takes effect. "The ball is now in the government's court. We have handed over the draft to them," said a legal aide to Bhutto, Mohammad Latif Khan Khosa. A government official said Musharraf was expected to promulgate the ordinance on Friday after a cabinet approval. STOCKS UP, THEN EASE BACK Musharraf has gone a long way to meeting another of Bhutto's conditions by saying he would quit as army chief by Nov. 15. Bhutto said on Thursday her other main political demands -- including clipping the powers of a president in favour of a prime minister -- would be addressed in a "stage two" of negotiations. The two-time prime minister is also demanding the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term. Bhutto said in London on Thursday that if her terms were met, her Pakistan People's Party would not join other opposition parties seeking to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by quitting parliament. PPP assembly members would abstain or vote for their candidate. An opposition alliance headed by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's party will boycott the presidential election. Musharraf's coalition is expected to fare badly in the general election because of resentment over attempts to dismiss the country's top judge, inflation, insecurity that many blame on an alliance with Washington and resentment of military rule. The United States has quietly encouraged Musharraf and Bhutto to work together to stop Pakistan falling into the thrall of religious conservatives and becoming prey to militants. Pakistani shares rose sharply early on Friday on hopes of a deal between Bhutto and Musharraf but then fell back on fear the Supreme Court would postpone Saturday's vote, dealers said. Investors are keen to see Musharraf stay in power and continue policies that have produced growth and a strong stock mark
