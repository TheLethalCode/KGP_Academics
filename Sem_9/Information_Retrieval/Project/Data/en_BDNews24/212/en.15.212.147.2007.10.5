<TITLE> Polish president to seek ally in Sarkozy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish President Lech Kaczynski meets French counterpart Nicholas Sarkozy in Paris next week as part of a drive to repair Poland's troubled relations in Europe ahead of a parliamentary election at home. The main topic of their talks on Sunday and Monday will be the European Union's new treaty, aiming to make the bloc more efficient. Sarkozy and other EU leaders are keen on getting it approved at a summit in Lisbon on Oct. 18-19. Poland, the biggest ex-communist nation in the 27-nation EU, has reluctantly agreed to the new treaty but is still holding out for minor changes which would give it more clout. Diplomats say Sarkozy sees the meeting with Kaczynski as a step towards healing France's rift with central European nations caused by his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, who lambasted the new democracies for backing the US invasion of Iraq. But this will not stop the new French president from putting pressure on Kaczynski over the EU accord, which he sees as a major, achievement early in his term. "It seems that Poland is effectively making known some additional requests," Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon told reporters on Friday. "The president will have the chance to say again to President Kaczynski that if we want to get a result we must stick to the mandate and nothing but the mandate." Polish diplomats say Kaczynski will try to win Sarkozy's support on the treaty, but his main aim is to make the fellow conservative become Poland's chief ally in the European Union. They say Poland seeks French support for putting a U.S. missile defence system on its soil, a plan which has angered Russia and drawn protests from some European politicians. TOUGH ON RUSSIA Sarkozy meets President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday and has pleased central Europeans by signalling he is going to take a tougher approach in dealing with Russia than Chirac. "Nicholas Sarkozy's presidency will definitely breathe new life into Polish-French relations," Karol Karski, deputy foreign minister told Reuters. "The generation of European leaders who were enamoured of Russia has passed." Warsaw's past opposition to the EU treaty and other fights with European partners have earned conservative Kaczynski and his identical twin brother Jaroslaw, the prime minister, a reputation as troublemakers. European diplomats have expressed worries that the brothers may torpedo the EU treaty in Lisbon two days before the Polish election to play to their core eurosceptic electorate. The vote is a close race between Kaczynski's Law and Justice and the opposition Civic Platform, a pro-EU centre-right party. But government insiders say the brothers have actually decided to soften their eurosceptic image and win over conservative but pro-European voters that tend to support their rivals. "Poland will negotiate hard but when there is a deal a day before the election, the prime minister will be able to boast about his success at the summit," a government official said. Lech Kaczynski is also due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday. Polish-German relations took a dive since the Kaczynskis took power two years ago as they aired Poland's historical grievances against the big neighbour and spoke ominously of the need to stop Germany from dominating Europe. The meeting with Merkel will aim to show they can do business with Germany, Polish diplomats say, admitting that it will take much longer to truly repair relations.
