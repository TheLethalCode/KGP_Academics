 MILAN, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan forward Kaka was named FIFPro World Player of the Year on Friday for inspiring his side to a seventh European Cup win last May. More than 45,000 professional footballers throughout the world, members of the players' union FIFPro, were invited to vote in the annual awards which are in their third year. The 25-year-old Brazilian was instrumental in Milan's Champions League triumph, ending up top scorer with 10 goals including three in the semi-final win over Manchester United. Kaka, the subject of an unsuccessful, large bid from Real Madrid in the close season, was also a driving force in helping Milan to finish fourth in Serie A last term despite an eight-point deduction for match-fixing. However, he missed Brazil's Copa America victory in July because he opted out of the tournament to rest. Barcelona forward Ronaldinho was named FIFPro World Player of the Year for the second time in succession last year
