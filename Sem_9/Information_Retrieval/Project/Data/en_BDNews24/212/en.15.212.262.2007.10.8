 Islamabad, oct, 8 (bdnews24.com/BBC News)--- The former head of Pakistani intelligence has been sworn in as the new vice-chief of the army. Lt Gen Ashfaq Kiani is expected to become overall head of the army shortly if President Pervez Musharraf resigns from this position as promised.

Some of the fiercest fighting took place at the weekend in the tribal area of North Waziristan. After a number of attacks on military convoys, the army sent helicopter gunships and even jet fighters to target suspected militant positions in several villages. Scores of people have been killed. The army says they are militants and soldiers. But local report at least 10 civilians are among the dead. These military campaigns are deeply unpopular in Pakistan.
