 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)Police have arrested four men with ties to the killing of North South University teacher Rahat Karim Mukul after tracking the suspects for days through the victim's stolen mobile phone, an official said Monday. In a press briefing, Detective Branch joint commissioner Abdul Jalil said the NSU teacher was returning home from work by CNG autorickshaw on Sep 25 when the gang allegedly stopped his vehicle and stole his mobile phone and some money. As the muggers fled the scene they rubbed "chili paste" into Mukul's eyes before beating him up and leaving him on the roadside. Doctors later declared him dead when he was taken to hospital by the police. The joint commissioner said: "The four were arrested after we tracked the victim's mobile phone calls. All of the arrested have admitted to being involved in both the mugging and murder." A special team of detectives tracked the mobile phone and arrested Moktar Hossain, Hazi Mosharraf Hossain and Jahangir at a house in Matuail Thursday, Jalil said. The police also arrested one Alal in Badda who allegedly fixed the auto-rickshaw but was not present during the murder. A fifth suspect in the case remains at large. bdnews
