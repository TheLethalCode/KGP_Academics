<TITLE> Ukraine leader: Stability depends on allies, rivals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Viktor Yushchenko said on Friday that Ukraine could achieve stability after a closely-run election only if both his allies and rivals were involved in forming a government. But the president's allies from the "Orange Revolution", who appear to hold a narrow majority after last weekend's election, launched talks on forming an "orange" coalition on their own. Ahead of the poll, intended to end a year of political turmoil, Yushchenko had backed an "orange" coalition and suggested the woman he had once sacked as prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, could return to her old job. Yushchenko, visiting Paris, stuck to his post-election u-turn and urged three major parties to start talks on forming a government -- the two "orange" parties and the Regions Party of his rival, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. "Everyone must sit down around the table. The participation of the three major players is absolutely essential for there to be a solid government and a stable parliament in Ukraine," Yushchenko said after meeting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The president said his move implied no "deceptive intentions", but as the Regions Party had won one-third of the vote its opinions had to be heeded. "I simply said that the political situation...suggests that the three players should sit around the table together. Then we can negotiate over the model of the new system," he said. "Is it an 'orange' coalition, with a constructive 'role' given to the opposition with key posts in parliament and in the government? That is the subject of the negotiations." He refused to rule out the possibility of a nominee for prime minister coming from Yanukovich's Regions party, saying: "Everything is the subject of negotiation." ORANGE GROUPS HOLD MAJORITY The Regions Party took first place in the poll. But the combined "orange" tally outscored it with about 45 percent of the vote, with Tymoshenko's bloc scoring the biggest gains. With results still incomplete, the "orange" coalition is expected to hold 228 seats -- two more than the majority of 226 needed for most votes in parliament. Yanukovich has welcomed the call for three-party talks as a step towards a "broad coalition" of rival groups in a country polarised between a nationalist west and Russian-speaking east. The president did not refer to such a coalition, but said it would be "constructive" for his rivals to hold cabinet posts. In Kiev, members of the two "orange" groups held their first talks on forming a coalition on their own. A senior official of the president's Our Ukraine party said elected members had written a letter to Yushchenko backing such a coalition -- possibly incorporating the small centrist Volodymyr Lytvyn bloc which also won seats. Tymoshenko was a key figure in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the president to power and served as his first prime minister but was sacked within eight months. She rejects any coalition involving the prime minister. Analysts say a cabinet with members from rival parties could be fractious, given the stormy "co-habitation" since Yushchenko appointed his rival prime minister in August 2006. Yanukovich was defeated in the 2004 revolution but, after Tymoshenko's dismissal, bounced back to take first place in a parliamentary election last year. He became prime minister after four months of talks, marked by defections in the "orange" camp
