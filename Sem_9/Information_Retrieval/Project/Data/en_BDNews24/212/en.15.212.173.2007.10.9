 NEW DELHI, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian government and its communist allies meet on Tuesday to discuss a nuclear energy deal with the United States, as speculation grew that a political impasse between the two sides would spark snap elections. A fourth, and potentially final, meeting of a joint panel formed to end the face-off between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government and the left was expected to make no progress, with the communists insisting the deal would make India subservient to US interests. The deal would be a milestone in India-US relations, not the best of friends during the Cold War. It would allow India to import US nuclear fuel and reactors, despite having tested nuclear weapons and not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Critics, including many in the US Congress, say the deal unfairly rewards India and undercuts a US-led campaign to curtail nuclear ambitions of nations like Iran. The crisis appears headed for a final showdown, with India facing an informal end-October deadline to begin securing clearances from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and others to clinch the deal. The communists, who prop up the ruling coalition, have warned the government against negotiating with the IAEA to place India's civilian nuclear reactors under U.N. safeguards, one of the first steps towards making the deal operational. Sonia Gandhi, ruling Congress party head and India's most powerful politician, talked with communist party leaders on Monday night in a surprise meeting and said the government wanted to start safeguard negotiations with the IAEA. That was rejected by the communists, according to media reports, heightening speculation that Tuesday's panel meeting could see the government and the communists openly parting political ways, paving the way for early elections. An early election could spark uncertainty in India's financial markets, worried what an election would mean for the fiscal deficit and the US nuclear deal. The growing crisis came just as Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, arrived in India on a technical visit to speak at an energy conference, visit a nuclear research facility in Mumbai and meet with Indian nuclear officials. While the IAEA says his visit is not political, the timing added to tension between the government and the deal's opponents. Newspapers on Tuesday talked about early general elections, originally scheduled for 2009, being almost inevitable. Morning television shows on Tuesday splashed headlines on their screens of "Nuclear Showdown" and "Will The Government Survive?" "D-Day is now October 9," wrote political analyst Prem Shankar Jha in the Hindustan Times, referring to the potential showdown at the panel meeting. "The war of nerves drags on. Indian stocks were down 1.6 percent on Monday on the political uncertainty. The political crisis reached a flashpoint after Gandhi on Sunday called opponents of the nuclear deal enemies of development in a statement widely seen as hinting she was ready for a snap vote. That infuriated the communist parties, who issued a joint statement on Monday saying "We need not to surrender our vital interests to America". The Congress party has already started preparing for early elections, shuffling party leaders and announcing a slew of populist welfare measures to woo poor voters. After negotiating with the IAEA, India must get clearance from the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) that controls global civilian nuclear commerce. Then the deal goes back to the US Congress for a final approval.
