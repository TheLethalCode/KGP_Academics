 TOKYO, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Japanese navy will not be permitted to refuel ships supporting US-led ground troops in Afghanistan under a new ruling party proposal aimed at winning opposition support for continuing the mission, the foreign Minister said on Sunday. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) bill, which limits Japanese support to providing fuel and water to ships policing the Indian Ocean, needs cooperation from the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan to pass before the Nov. 1 end of its current mandate. But the Democrats have said they are determined to push for an end to the mission, which they say lacks a UN mandate and violates Japan's pacifist constitution. "Under the new law, Japan will not fuel ships providing support for ground operations," Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said in a talk show aired by public broadcaster NHK. A suspension, which looks inevitable, could sour relations with the United States. But LDP officials predicted they eventually would win over the Democratic Party-controlled upper house, opening the way for operations to resume. "Ninety percent of Japan's crude oil is transported through the Indian Ocean. This mission is in Japan's interests, as well as in the international community's. We will not end it," Komura added. The ruling coalition, which dominates the more powerful lower house, can override the upper house with a two-thirds vote, enabling the Japanese ships to resume operations. But the upper house has 60 days to vote on a draft law. An election rout for the LDP in July handed the opposition a majority in the upper house, enabling them to delay legislation. "If the mission were suspended temporarily, the damage to Japan's status in the eyes of the international community would not be something to worry about," LDP lawmaker Nobuteru Ishihara said later on a TV Asahi talk show. The LDP proposal would also prevent the Japanese navy from refuelling foreign tankers, after a non-governmental organisation said that fuel provided to a US supply ship had been passed on to an aircraft carrier that then headed to Iraq, in a move outside the remit of the mission. Komura said, "I do not think the fuel was used in Iraq, and the US also informs us this is so." The Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday that Japan was about to inform the US and Britain that it would pull its ships out of the Indian Ocean on Nov. 1, but no one was willing at the Defence Ministry to comment at the weekend. The refuelling mission has supplied 480,000 kilolitres of fuel to 11 coalition nations since 2001, according to government da
