<TITLE> UN patent agency chief faces calls to step aside </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland on Thursday joined calls for the UN patent and trademark agency chief to quit because of the "serious credibility problem" stemming from his age being misstated on a job application 25 years ago. Kamil Idris, who has led the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) for a decade, was found by internal auditors last year to have signed documents with an earlier false birth date when he joined the Geneva-based body in 1982. Diplomats say the auditor's report suggests Idris misled the agency about his age when signing documents stating his birth date as 1945 although he was born in 1954. The report says that as a result he may have gained promotion and eventual appointment to the top job sooner than would have otherwise been possible. In an unusually blunt statement, the agency's host country Switzerland said on Thursday it regretted that Idris had not responded personally to questions addressed to him during the 10-day WIPO general assembly that ended on Wednesday night. "Various failings have been brought to the attention of member states and are documented in internal and external audits," the Swiss foreign ministry said. "In this context, Switzerland believes that the process of renewing WIPO's leadership should proceed henceforth without delay." The United States, European Union and other wealthy nations on Wednesday night refused to approve the United Nations agency's new two-year budget in protest over the lack of a full and open debate on Idris' reported misconduct. The Swiss said the fact the WIPO general assembly had not been able to adopt a 2008/09 budget due to the lack of a majority "showed that this important organisation now faces a serious credibility problem". WIPO, which will operate in the confines of its previous budget if a new one is not approved by January, has denied any misconduct by Idris and said the accusations were part of a campaign to discredit the Sudanese lawyer. WIPO officials say it was an unintentional error which he later corrected. The United States, one of Idris' most vocal critics, said discussions were underway among WIPO members about convening a special session on the issue, a move that would require support from a quarter of the agency's 184-country membership. "It is under discussion," a US official said on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said such a meeting would likely be held "early in the New Year." While only the United States came close to openly calling for his resignation during the WIPO general assembly, European countries have been trying to convince Idris to step aside gracefully before his current term six-year term ends in 2009. Idris was first elected to the top post in 1997. Diplomats familiar with the audit have said it raised questions whether he could have had the 10 years senior experience required for the post he applied for in 1982, given his real age at the time. Also at issue is the amount of severance pay Idris could get on leaving his job, given he is 9 years younger than initially he stated and therefore that much further from retirement age. Former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz was forced to resign last June amid an ethics scandal involving a high-paying promotion for his companion.
