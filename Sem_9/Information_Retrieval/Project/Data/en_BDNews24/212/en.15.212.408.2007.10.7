<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday revealed that the government had tried to keep the two former prime ministers abroad instead of putting them behind bars at home. "We wanted to keep them (Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina) outside instead of going into hassles. But they did not give us that chance," he told reporters at a meeting of the Overseas Correspondents Association Bangladesh (OCAB) at the National Press Club. Mainul's comment came in reply to a question by Farid Hossain, Bangladesh Bureau chief of the Associated Press. Asked whether the government would consider "house arrest" or any other arrangement for the two former prime ministers instead of keeping them in special jail, the adviser said: "It's a question loaded with political points." Mainul said politicians have to take responsibility for what he said were "corrupt practices" when they were at the helm. In other countries, even minor mistakes of politicians are not forgiven, Mainul said. "But we have no conflict with the politicians." Mainul also said the government has no plans to grant general amnesty to corruption suspects. The adviser said the government was pondering "reconciliation" but how it could be done was not clear. "The government was thinking about reconciliation through the proposed Truth Commission." Asked why the reconciliation process would apply to businessmen alone, the adviser said the law would not mention businessmen in particular. "But the government will give preference to the businessmen." Asked whether such reconciliatory steps would be considered for the politicians as well, Mainul said: "It depends on the situation." "We don't want to establish any controlled democracy. We want to set an example by handing power over to a responsible government elected through fair election." Election is not far away, he said. bdnew
