<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com)  Baitul Mukarram Khatib Moulana Ubaidul Huq died from old-age complications in Dhaka late Saturday night, his family said. Huq was 79. The chief cleric of the national mosque was born in Zakiganj Upazila of Sylhet in 1928. From his Azimpur home, Huq went to visit a "guest" at the Iranian Cultural Centre in Dhanmondi where he fell sick. He was first driven to Medinova Hospital in a car of the Iranian embassy, the Khatib's son Shahidul Huq told reporters in a midnight press briefing. Huq, a diabetic, was then rushed to Bangladesh Medical College Hospital in Dhanmondi before he was shifted to Labaid hospital where he died at 11:15pm. "He (Huq) was having a breathing problem over the last few days," his son said. A namaz-e-janaza has been set for 3:00pm Sunday at the National Eidgah Maidan. The body will be kept at the Baitul Mukarram Mosque for mourners to pay their last respects from 10am Sunday. Huq, son of Moulana Zahurul Huq, was survived by four sons and seven daughters. M Fazlur Rahman, director general of the Islamic Foundation, who visited Labaid early Sunday, said the government would decide on the appointment of the next Khatib. bdnews
