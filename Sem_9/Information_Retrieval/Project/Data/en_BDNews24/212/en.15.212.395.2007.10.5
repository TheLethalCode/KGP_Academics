<TEXT>
 United Nations, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)- Myanmar told the United Nations on Friday that no action was warranted against its military government over its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. The Southeast Asian country's U.N. Ambassador Kyaw Tint Swe urged the Security Council to take no action that would harm the "good offices" role of the world body to defuse the situation in Myanmar. He said Myanmar would cooperate fully with the U.N. special envoy Ibrahim Gambari, who reported to the Security Council on Friday on his return from a four-day visit to Myanmar and is due to return to the country in November. "No Security Council action is warranted with regard to the situation in Myanmar," Kyaw Tint Swe said. He said Myanmar had recently faced a situation that amounted to a "daunting challenge" but that it had now returned to "normalcy." He said many of those detained had now been released. "To date ... a total of 2,095 people, including 722 monks, have been released," he said. "More releases will follow."
