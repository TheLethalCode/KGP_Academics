 Sylhet, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Joint forces arrested Monday former Awami League lawmaker Muhibur Rahman Manik in Sylhet. The Sunamganj District AL vice-president was detained at 10:30am as he left the Anticorruption Commission's Jallar Parh office in the city after submitting his wealth statement. Kotwali police chief Abdun Noor told bdnews24.com: "Joint forces arrested former MP Muhibur Rahman Manik and turned him in to Kotwali Police Station." Manik was subsequently handed over to his home district police station in Chhatak at 3:30pm where a case may be filed against him under the emergency powers rules, said SI Nasimul Islam of Kotwali Police Station. The ACC asked Manik to submit a wealth statement within a week on September 30 following his inclusion on the first ACC list of graft suspects drawn up under the emergency power rules. In 1999, a bomb blast at the former lawmaker's residence in Chhatak killed two people. It was alleged that they were manufacturing bombs under the protection of Manik when the blast occurred. Police arrested the AL leader two months after the bomb explosion, although he was subsequently released after appealing a 10-year jail sentence. bdnews24.com/corr/
