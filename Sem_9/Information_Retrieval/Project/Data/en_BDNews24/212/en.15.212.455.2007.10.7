 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh embassy in Saudi Arabia has confirmed the identity of the seven Bangladeshis who burned to death in Saturday's fire in the kingdom. The seven Bangladeshis died when an illegal furniture-manufacturing workshop caught fire in Al-Khumra district, some 30 kilometres off the second largest Saudi city of Jeddah, according to a Bangladesh embassy report sent to the foreign ministry Sunday. Six victims were from Balaganj Upazila of Sylhet and the other was from Rajanagar Upazila of Moulvibazar, the report said. The victims from Balaganj are Jonab Ali and Sharaf Ali, sons of Kutub Ullah of Khashipur, Chonu Mia, son of Lal Mia of Asampur, Shahi Mia, son of Jalal Mia of Gorinathpur, Nurul Islam of Tilok Chandpur and Monju Mia, son of Rahim Ullah of Kharmapur. The other victim, Ali Hossain, son of Haris Ali, came from Hashgaon under Rajanagar in Moulvibazar district. The charred bodies have been kept at the morgue of Al-Mahzar hospital in Jeddah, the report said. "We have already come to know that seven Bangladeshis have lost their lives in the incident of fire in Al-Khumra district," MAK Mahmood, additional foreign secretary, told bdnews24.com Monday. The official said the bodies would be brought to Dhaka once necessary formalities were done. The Bangladesh mission in Saudi Arabia in its report said the fire broke out in a furniture factory owned by Jonab Ali, one of the victims. At least 14 workers were inside the factory when the fire broke out at around 1pm Saudi time Saturday, Abu Abdullah, a director for the foreign ministry, told bdnews24.com, quoting embassy officials. The embassy report said four victims had no legal papers. Nasir Uddin, director of External Publicity Wing of the ministry, said the relatives of the victims have been informed of the incident. Meanwhile, Arab News reported that the victims used to live in the workshop, which had a living area and three bedrooms, according to the Saudi Civil Defence. The Saudi Arabian English-language daily also said the roof of the house collapsed before the fire could be brought under control. Firefighters reported having a difficult time entering the facility because the area was packed with furniture. "The victims of the blaze were trapped in the living area; four of the bodies were found in one bedroom with the others in a neighbouring bedroom," the daily said. "Workers in the third bedroom managed to escape the fire and fled, but two of them were caught and questioned by Civil Defence officials who believe the factory was operating illegally and was employing workers who were living illegally in the kingdom. "The factory is located in a predominantly residential district," Arab News added. bdn
