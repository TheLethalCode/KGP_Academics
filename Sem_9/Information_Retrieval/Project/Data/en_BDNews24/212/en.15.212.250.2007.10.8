 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Monday slammed the law adviser for his statement on the government's botched exile plan for former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Adviser Mainul Hosein at a meeting of the Overseas Correspondents Association Bangladesh (OCAB) Sunday said, "We wanted to keep [former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia] outside instead of going into hassles. But they did not give us that chance." Delwar at his Sangsad Bhaban NAM flat said, "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is a citizen of this country. She is a leader of a major political party. She formed government winning two-thirds votes. "This is her birth and constitutional right to stay in the country. He, as a barrister, cannot say anything about one's inherent right." He renewed the claim he has been making the last few days that the BNP was united under the leadership of Khaleda across the country and abroad. Most of the central leaders and former lawmakers were with them, he said. On the reformists, he said, "They do not have any position anywhere at the grassroots level. They will understand it well when they will go home during the Eid." "Their position in the party is responsible for such condition." Delwar asked the government to open the party's central office at Naya Paltan as early as possible. He also came down hard on expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. "The office has been kept closed following an illegal letter by an illegal person." "This is not right. "Mannan Bhuiyan is nobody in the party; this is not a neutral attitude [on the part of the government] to accept his application," Delwar said. bdnews24
