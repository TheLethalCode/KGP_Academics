 LONDON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown's flagship tax credit system is causing unnecessary distress and hardship to the poorest families it was designed to help, a critical report said on Tuesday.

In her report, her second on the system, Abraham said that despite improvements introduced by HMRC, decisions to recover such overpayments were still putting low income families and earners into debt, often for many years to come. "What was very clear from the complaints referred to me was that the lack of proper regard to those circumstances and needs led to the system often having harsh and unintended consequences for HMRC's more vulnerable customers," she said. "As one complainant put it: 'Tax credits are supposed to help families, not cause them money worries,'" she added.
