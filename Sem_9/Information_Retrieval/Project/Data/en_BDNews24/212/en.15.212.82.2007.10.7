<TITLE> Sales of NSD certificates slip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) The sales of national savings certificates have dropped 5.80 percent to Tk 1,355.54 crore in July of the present fiscal year, from Tk 1,438.93 crore in the same month a year ago, due mainly to imposition of 10 percent tax at source, experts said. The anticorruption and anti-tax evasion drive has also produced a negative impact among investors. A significant number of people are now investing in the stock market to cash in higher returns from the recent upbeat trend. "A portion of investors may shift to the capital market to bag in high capital gains," Saifuddin Ahmed Mojumder, director of the National Savings Directorate, told bdnews24.com Sunday. He was however optimistic about the rise in sales of NSD certificates, a government instrument used to borrow from the public, after the council of advisers decided to raise the ceiling for tax-free income up to Tk 1,50,000 from Tk 25,000. "We hope that NSD certificate sales will rise due to the re-fixation of tax free income from investment in the certificates," Saifuddin said. The National Board of Revenue had earlier imposed a 10 percent income tax at source on annual interest of Tk 25,000 or above on the savings certificates, with effect from July 1. Md Asaduzzaman, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, has said the decline in NSD sales could adversely affect government revenue, observing that imposition of tax 10 percent at source discouraged households to invest in NSD certificates. b
