<TITLE> Bhuiyan can appeal for a comeback: RA Gani </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader RA Gani Sunday said expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan could always appeal for a review of the chairperson's decision. "Mannan Bhuiyan has finally realised that he cannot achieve anything by taking a separate path. Though late, he has realised that it is not easy to split BNP," Gani, a member of the policymaking standing committee, said. "The chairperson expelled Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain following the dictates of the party constitution. "If the two expelled leaders now think that it was unjust, they may appeal for review of the chairperson's decision," he told reporters at his Dhanmondi home. Gani said reform to the party was an urgent need to replace individual leadership with joint leadership and promote intra-party democracy. "BNP is in a mess today as it did not carry any intra-party reforms. Joint leadership must be established in the party doing away with the practice of individual decision-making. "There are no anti-reform elements in the BNP. All of us including the chairperson are in favour of effecting necessary reforms." He said, "Though expelled, Mannan Bhuiyan can always urge all to stay united as a well wisher or supporter of BNP. I see nothing wrong in that. There is no division, however, in BNP and the party is united." Asked if all felt reform in the party was a necessity, then why Bhuiyan was expelled, Gani said, "The chairperson took action against Mannan Bhuiyan as he breached party discipline. I regard Bhuiyan as a good person. I do not want to criticise him." He said work on reforming BNP could start as soon as the embargo on politics went. The party constitution needed to be changed and democratic processes established within the party. Reform was a fundamental demand of the time, he said and asked the government to reopen the party central office to facilitate the reform process. Gani proposed setting qualification standards for the lawmakers and limiting electoral expenses of the candidates by enacting laws in the parliament. He said the caretaker government can take the country forward by bringing about reforms in different sectors for the benefit of the country. bdnews2
