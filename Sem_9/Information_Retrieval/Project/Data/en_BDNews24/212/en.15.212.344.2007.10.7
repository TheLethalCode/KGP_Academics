 Dhaka, Oct 07 (bdnews24.com)  No major airline including national flag carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines has responded to the government's 'open skies' policy. The government launched the policy to sort out flight shortages for some 1.5 million Bangladeshi workers headed abroad but stranded in Dhaka. The temporary policy will allow domestic and foreign airlines to operate additional flights until the crisis passes. Airlines have been given permission to run international flights from Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet airports from October 1. Officials said that getting stranded workers to their places of employment was a priority. But airline industry officials said that Biman, Emirates, Saudia and Qatar Airways do not have the available aircraft to run additional flights. A Biman official preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com, "Because we don't have enough airplanes, we've failed to grasp the offer to offer additional flights." Civil aviation officials said Biman's current operational fleet consists of just five aged, accident-prone aircraft, out of the 13 DC-10, Airbus and F-28 planes the national airline has in its inventory. A Biman scheme to lease a Phuket Air Boeing 747 has not been finalised. On Biman's plan to hire a Boeing 747 from Phuket Air, the official said: "Once we hire the plane, we'll be able to operate both scheduled and additional flights." "But no agreement has yet been executed on the leasing or hiring of the plane." Officials with the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh said some 1.5 lakh Bangladeshi workers have been cleared by Bangladesh immigration and are ready to fly abroad. Most of them are scheduled to fly to Kuala Lumpur, Dubai and other points in the Middle East. ATAB secretary general HAM Bari told bdnews24.com Sunday that he spoke to the Dhaka representatives of Emirates, Saudia and Qatar Airways. and said they too don't have extra aircraft with which to participate in the 'open skies' programme. "That's why Emirates, Saudia and Qatar Airways have not come forward to run extra flights in addition to their scheduled ones," he said. The busy summer vacation season in Europe and the Middle East has meant that few airlines have surplus capacity to divert to Dhaka. Earlier on Sept 10 at a meeting held at the civil aviation and tourism ministry, domestic and foreign airlines proposed to the government to introduce the 'open skies' policy to deal with stranded passengers. The airlines said once the policy was introduced, the problem of sending thousands of workers to various countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia would be resolved. After the meeting, civil aviation and tourism secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali told reporters that there was a shortage of plane tickets because sudden demand from expatriate workers had surpassed the scheduled capacity of Biman and other airlines. Biman offers seven scheduled flights a week to Kuala Lumpur and Dubai. Emirates, Saudia and Qatar Airways each operate seven flights a week to various Middle East destinations. bdnews24.co
