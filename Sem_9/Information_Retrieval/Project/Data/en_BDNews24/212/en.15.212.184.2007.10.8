 ANKARA, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey may cut logistic support to US troops in Iraq if the US Congress backs a bill branding as genocide the 1915 massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turks, a senior ruling AK Party lawmaker was quoted as saying on Monday. Congress's Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to approve on Wednesday a bill on the genocide issue and speaker Nancy Pelosi, a known supporter of the Armenian cause, could then decide to bring it to the House floor for a vote. Turkey, a NATO ally of Washington, strongly denies Armenian claims, backed by many Western historians and a number of foreign parliaments, that up to 1.5 million ethnic Armenians suffered genocide at Turkish hands during World War One. It says many Muslim Turks as well as Christian Armenians died in inter-ethnic conflict as the Ottoman Empire collapsed. "Don't accept this bill.

Bagis noted in his comments to Hurriyet that Turkish public opinion has already turned very anti-American due to the Iraq war and Washington's failure to crack down on Kurdish rebels who use northern Iraq as a base from which to attack Turkey. "If the bill passes, pressure from public opinion (to take action against US interests) will be very strong," he said. Bagis left for Washington with two other Turkish lawmakers on Monday to lobby Congress to drop the bill. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan raised Turkey's concerns with US President George W. Bush in a telephone conversation last Friday. The Bush administration is opposed to the bill but Congress is now dominated by its Democratic opponen
