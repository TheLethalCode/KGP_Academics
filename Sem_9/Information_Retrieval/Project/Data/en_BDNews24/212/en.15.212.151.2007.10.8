 MANILA, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Speaker of the Philippine lower house and an ally of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was accused of graft on Monday as a corruption scandal dogging the government rumbles on.

A split in their alliance could be damaging for the president, who has relied on de Venecia's support against two impeachment complaints over allegations she cheated in the 2004 elections. De Venecia's son said the graft charge was politically motivated and was designed to, "destroy my father's credibility".

Under Philippine law, if an impeachment complaint against the president is defeated a fresh attempt cannot be made for 12 months. "This in an attempt to vaccinate the president from a more solid impeachment case," said Ronaldo Zamora, the opposition leader in the House of Representatives. The Philippine Senate has called Arroyo's husband to a hearing later this month into the telecoms scand
