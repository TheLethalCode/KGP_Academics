 BAGHDAD, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A European lawmaker told an Iraqi court on Thursday that refugees who fled Saddam Hussein's 1991 crackdown on a Shi'ite uprising showed signs of napalm bombing and chemical attacks. Baroness Emma Nicholson was testifying at the trial of Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majeed, known as "Chemical Ali", and 14 others over their role in crushing the Shi'ite rebellion which broke out after Saddam's Gulf War defeat. Nicholson, who visited south Iraq and Iran in August 1991, four months after the uprising broke out, said around 95,000 Iraqis sought shelter in huge refugee camps in Iran. "During my visits to the refugee camps, I saw many, many, many people with injuries," she told the court. "I am not a medical professional but the injuries were caused by bullets, bombs, chemical weapons and the high impact of houses tumbling." Asked how many cases she had seen that appeared to be from chemical attacks, Nicholson, a British member of the European Parliament and a campaigner for Iraq's Shi'ites and Kurds, said: "At least 30". Prosecutors say up to 100,000 people were killed in the quashing of the Shi'ite uprising. Majeed and the other defendants face charges of crimes against humanity, which carry the death penalty. Majeed is already facing the death penalty after his conviction earlier this year for masterminding a genocidal campaign against Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988 that killed tens of thousands. An appeal court upheld that sentence on Sept. 4 and under Iraqi law he should be executed within 30 days. But Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Iraq would avoid hanging Majeed during the holy month of Ramadan, which ends in a week. MUSTARD GAS AND NAPALM "The victims were telling me about yellow clouds that destroyed their kidneys and insides. I was told by medical experts later that that meant mustard gas," Nicholson said. At a hotel being used as a hospital to treat some of the victims, most of the men were too sick to move, she said. "One had both his eyelids burnt as well as burns all over his body from napalm. He was a primary school teacher who had no political affiliation," she said. "Another had his stomach dangling outside his body on the side of his bed." The court was adjourned after Thursday's session until Oct. 21, meaning it may have been Majeed's final appearance in public before the death sentence from his earlier trial is carried out. Two other defendants in the Shi'ite uprising trial also received death sentences in the earlier trial -- former defence minister Sultan Hashim and another former army commander, Hussein Rasheed Muhammad.
