<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 05 (bdnews24.com) - The leader of the BNP's reformist faction, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Friday asked the government to ensure a fair trial to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. "I won't comment on the case of Begum Zia since it is on trial. But I do want her to get justice," Bhuiyan, the former BNP secretary general who was expelled from the party, told reporters at his Gulshan NAM flat in the morning. "It's not possible to cut on corruption only by detaining people. A social campaign is needed to curb corruption. Everybody needs to chip in to help establish good governance and democracy," he said. Khaleda expelled Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain from the party and appointed Khandaker Delwar Hossain secretary general on September 3, before her detention. Bhuiyan has since refused to accept the expulsion, arguing that it had been done going beyond party constitution. "The BNP must be prepared for the next election. I want the party unified because the election is knocking at the door. "The country will not revert to what it was before January 11. That is why a united BNP is necessary," he said. "I want to reform the party to establish good governance in the country. The people will accept a reformed BNP as a powerful party." "Nothing is final. These are only proposals. There may be other reform proposals. The proposals will only come into effect after they are discussed at the party's council meeting." In answer to a question he said, "We want to hold an all inclusive party council." "Unity is not about personalities. There must be political unity. "Mr. Delwar is my senior. I obey him. I hope there will be political unity between us," Bhuiyan said when asked if he was likely to meet Delwar Hossain. bdnews24.com
