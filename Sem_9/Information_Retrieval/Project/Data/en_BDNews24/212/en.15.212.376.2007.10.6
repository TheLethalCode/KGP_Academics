<TEXT>
 WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American track champion Marion Jones announced her retirement from athletics on Friday moments after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about her use of steroids. "Because of my actions, I am retiring from the sport of track and field, a sport which I deeply love," Jones said outside the courthouse, tears streaming down her cheeks. "I promise that these events will be used to make the lives of many people improve, that making the wrong choices and bad decisions can be disastrous." Jones, 31, pleaded guilty to two felonies, lying to federal investigators about her steroid use and lying to them about a separate check fraud case. She could lose the five medals she won at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. "It is with a great amount of shame that I stand before you and tell you that I have betrayed your trust," she told reporters and onlookers outside the federal courthouse in White Plains. "Making these false statements to federal agents was an incredibly stupid thing for me to do and I am responsible fully for my actions. I have no one to blame but myself for what I have done." "To you, my fans, including my young supporters, the United States Track & Field Association, my closest friends, my attorneys, and the most classy family a person could ever hope for... I want you to know that I have been dishonest. "And you have the right to be angry with me. I have let them down, I have let my country down and I have let myself down.
