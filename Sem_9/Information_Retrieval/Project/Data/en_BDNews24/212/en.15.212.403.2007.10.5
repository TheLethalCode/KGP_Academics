<TITLE> US data lifts Europe stocks to 10-week high </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks rose for a fifth straight session on Friday, to hit a 10-week closing high as stronger-than-expected US employment data soothed worries over the outlook for the world's biggest economy. Mining shares were among the biggest gainers, helped by rising metal prices and an upbeat brokerage note on the sector, and rebounding after sharp losses earlier this week. Anglo American gained 2.9 percent and Rio Tinto advanced 2.9 percent. German carmaker Volkswagen jumped 4.4 percent on market talk that the stock could become part of the DJ EuroSTOXX 50 index of top European shares, as well as continuing speculation about Porsche increasing its stake in VW. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,584.94 points, ending the week with a gain of 2.2 percent. Europe's benchmark index is up 6.8 percent on the year, but still down 3.1 percent from its multi-year high reached in mid-July, since when concerns that a crisis in subprime or risky US mortgages would slow the economy sparked waves of sell-off on equity markets worldwide. Data showed the US economy added 110,000 new jobs in September and hiring in each of the two previous months was revised up significantly, showing a more resilient labour market than previously thought. "The report is overall reassuring, suggesting the labour market is likely to hold up and give good support to private consumption, avoiding a severe downturn in growth," UniCredit Chief Economist Marco Annunziata wrote in a note. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the data to show that employers added 100,000 jobs outside the farm sector last month. "The US growth situation is still fragile, however. While the September job figures have brought important relief, it is clear that the US labour market has lost some steam over the course of the year," Annunziata wrote. "Whether or not the labour market holds up will likely make the difference between a soft landing and a recession." Around Europe, Germany's DAX index, UK's FTSE 100 index and France's CAC 40 all rose 0.7 percent. Shares in Belgian-Dutch financial services firm Fortis surged 3 percent, adding to recent gains. Bear Stearns raised its rating on Fortis to "outperform" from "peer perform", while saying the earnings outlook is robust and the group can contain the current credit-market dislocation. Friday marked the last day of the mostly cash 71 billion euro takeover bid for ABN AMRO by a consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander. EARNINGS EYED German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse soared 4.6 percent, also on speculation that the stock would be included in the DJ Eurostoxx50 index. Among the day's biggest losers, shares in Alliance & Leicester tumbled 6.8 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to "sell", citing the impact of rising wholesale funding costs. The earnings season, which gathers steam next week, would be crucial for equities, especially for banks, the worst affected by a global crunch on credit markets that stemmed from the subprime mortgage crisis, said Franz Wenzel, a strategist with AXA Investment Managers in Paris. Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse and Germany's Deutsche Bank have already flagged hits to their earnings from the credit-market ructions, but been rewarded with share price rises as investors welcomed greater certainty around the numbers.
