 UNITED NATIONS, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations envoy Ibrahim Gambari said on Friday he could bring forward the date of his next visit to Myanmar from mid-November. Gambari told reporters a meeting of the UN Security Council about Myanmar on Friday had shown consensus on several points, including that the country could not go back to the "status quo" prevailing before recent pro-democracy protests that were crushed by the military government. "We can't go back to the situation before the recent crisis," he said after briefing the Council on his four-day trip to Myanmar. Asked about bringing forward the time of his next visit, he said: "Yes, we are thinking of a visit earlier than mid-November ... We have to work on exactly when that would take place." China and the United States disagreed over whether the Security Council should take action on Myanmar, with China insisting the crisis is an internal matter. But Gambari said a number of points "emerged by real consensus," including support for his efforts as well as the need for unity among the Security Council members. Gambari said it was vital for the government to start "timebound, concrete and serious" dialogue with the opposition, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest but whom he met twice during his visit. Her party dismissed a conditional offer by the junta for talks as a surrender on Friday, saying the conditions were effectively asking her to abandon her campaign for democracy. But Gambari said: "From my own conversation, she appears to be very anxious to have a proper dialogue and of course the (UN) Secretary General (Ban Ki-moon) has characterized (that) as without preconditions, because that would be the best way to move forward." The UN envoy reiterated his call for Suu Kyi to be released and said he hoped talks would go ahead
