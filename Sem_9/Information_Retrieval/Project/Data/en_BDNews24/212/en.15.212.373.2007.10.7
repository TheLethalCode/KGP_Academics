 Christian Plumb NEW YORK, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual Inc and Sovereign Bancorp Inc on Friday became the latest banks to take big writedowns on mortgages and other credit-related losses, but their shares rose on hopes the worst was over. Following similar warnings earlier this week from Citigroup Inc, UBS and Deutsche Bank, the latest disclosures dramatised the sweeping impact of the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market and left investors wondering how many profit warnings were still to come. The share gains echoed a similar rally in Citi stock on Monday after the largest US bank's own multibillion dollar writedown. "The market I think has pretty much signaled that coming clean and taking your lumps is the best thing you can do for your stock price, as long as the lump doesn't put you out of business," said Bill Hackney, a managing partner at Atlanta Capital Management. Merrill shares were 3.1 percent higher to $77.12 in afternoon trade while Wamu stock rose 2.7 percent to $36.23. Sovereign trimmed gains after its profit warning but was still up 2.2 percent. Merrill said it would write down $5.5 billion for bad bets on subprime mortgages and leveraged loans, taking the worst hit yet among major Wall Street brokerages from turmoil in the credit markets. As a result, it will post a loss of as much as 50 cents a share for the quarter. Analysts on average had expected a steep decline in profits to $1.43 a share. The warning came on the heels of an executive shakeup at the bank, which blundered by spending $1.3 billion to buy subprime mortgage lender First Franklin Financial last December just before the market for home loans to buyers with weak credit histories went into free-fall. ONE-OFF HIT? Wamu, the No. 1 U.S. savings & loan, said it expected a 75 percent plunge in profit after provisioning nearly $1 billion for loan losses and taking $410 million in losses and writedowns for various loans and securities in its portfolio. Sovereign, the second-largest thrift, roughly tripled its provision for credit losses sequentially to $155 million to $165 million and said it would take $35 million in charges related to financings extended to troubled mortgage lenders and as well as writedowns of loans in its portfolio. Both Merrill and Wamu sought to portray the losses as a one-off hit and said they were hoping for a fourth-quarter turnaround. "While we're disappointed with our anticipated third-quarter results, we look forward to an improved fourth quarter as we continue to see good operating performance in our retail banking, card services and commercial group businesses," Wamu Chief Executive Kerry Killinger said in a statement. Merrill Lynch CEO Stan O'Neal was similarly reassuring. "While it is very early in the current quarter and despite continued challenges in structured finance, we are beginning to see signs of a return to more normal activity levels in a number of markets," he said. But many believe the writeoffs will continue. "Although they may firmly believe this gets everything out of the way, I think there's going to be further reserve additions in future quarters," said Keith Davis, an analyst at fund manager Farr, Miller & Washington. "I'm pretty bearish on the whole banking sector." Citi, Merrill and Wamu were three banks in the spotlight coming into the third quarter because of their exposure to collateralized debt obligations, leveraged loans and subprime mortgages. Now they have made a clean breast of their losses, investors are betting they will soon have company. JPMorgan Chase and to a lesser extent Bank of America and Wachovia Corp may all take hits as well. "I just think you can expect more of those," Hackney said. "They're big boys, they're engaged in lending on private equity deals and other things, so there's going to be an impact."
