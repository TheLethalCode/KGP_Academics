 COLOMBO, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan soldiers killed six Tamil Tiger rebels in "confrontations", the military said on Tuesday, as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights began a five-day visit to investigate rights abuses. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour's is visiting Sri Lanka following reports that hundreds of people have been killed or abducted since last year amid renewed civil war after a four-year lull. Some abuses have been blamed on state security forces and some on the rebels. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since civil war erupted on the Indian Ocean island nation in 1983. Around 5,000 people have been killed since early 2006 in the latest chapter of the two-decade war between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sri Lanka says the reports are overblown and designed to tarnish its image. It has slammed foreign governments and rights groups for the criticism. On Monday, government forces and LTTE rebels clashed in the northern districts of Jaffna and Vavuniya and the northwestern district of Mannar, the latest in a series of near daily battles in recent months. "The army killed six terrorists in Monday's confrontations," said a military spokesman. "The army killed two terrorists in Jaffna and another four in Manar. One soldier was also killed in the Vavuniya confrontation." The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who say they are fighting for an independent state for minority ethnic Tamils in the north and east, were not immediately available for comment. There was no independent confirmation of how many people were killed in the fighting or what had happened. Military analysts say both sides tend to exaggerate enemy losses and play down their own. The military has launched an offensive to drive out the rebels from Mannar, after evicting them from jungle terrain they controlled in the east earlier this year.
