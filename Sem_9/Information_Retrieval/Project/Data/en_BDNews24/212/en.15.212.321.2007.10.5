<TITLE> Pakistan struggle to save test against SAfrica </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa pushed for a deserved victory against Pakistan at lunch on the final day of the first test, having removed the dangerous Younis Khan who scored a flawless hundred on Friday at the National stadium. Younis hit his 13th test career hundred and his first against South Africa but his dismissal for 126 runs by Dale Steyn left Pakistan on 230 for five with the difficult task of trying to save the test. They require another 194 runs for victory. Misbah-ul-Haq (23) and captain Shoaib Malik (15) were battling hard as the South African bowlers kept up the pressure. Malik was fortunate to survive a dropped catch by AB de Villiers at silly mid-off when he got an inside edge to left arm spinner, Paul Harris. Younis, resuming on 93 this morning with nightwatchman Mohammad Asif, continued in the same positive vein he had exhibited on the fourth day despite the pressure situation. He reached his hundred with a slick drive down to square leg off Andre Nel in the third over of the day but Nel was able to get his 100th wicket when he had Asif (6) caught by Hashim Amla off a flier. Nel became only the 11th South African to get 100 test wickets. Younis reached his hundred from just 108 balls with 15 fours and one in his 54th test. He and Misbah continued to play positively despite the slow nature of the pitch and some excellent stuff from the bowlers before Steyn got his third wicket of the innings by bowling Younis at the total of 197 to deliver a body blow to the home side
