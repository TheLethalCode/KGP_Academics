 SYDNEY, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A global day of demonstrations against Myanmar's violent suppression of pro-democracy protests failed to spark in Asia, with a Tokyo rally cancelled and one in Bangkok drawing only around 100 people. The turn out was slightly better in Australia, where around 250 mainly Burmese expatriates staged a march to the Sydney Opera House and around 200 protesters gathered in Melbourne. "We are united in opposition to the military dictatorship in Burma. It's time for the regime to start reconciliation," said Sydney rally organizer Maung Maung Than, 40, calling for pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners to be freed. Than said the protests were also aimed at keeping up the pressure on the international community to act: "The international response is just getting started, it must get a lot stronger." One banner at the protest called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, reflecting a view that regional powerhouse China should be exerting more pressure on the junta. A planned protest in Tokyo was cancelled, with organizers saying they were satisfied with a U.N. draft proposal on Myanmar released on Friday which condemned repression by the junta and demanded it free political detainees and begin dialogue with the opposition. In Bangkok, about 100 activists shouted anti-junta slogans and waved placards saying "No More Bloodshed" and "Stop Destroying Freedom" as they marched through the Thai capital. Boonthan Verawongse of the rights group Amnesty International called on the Thai government to put pressure on Myanmar's generals. "Without intervention by the Thai government and many Asian countries, the Burmese junta will still be very strong and oppress people in the country," he said. Myanmar receives most of its export earnings from selling gas to Thailand, which is competing against China, India and others for a slice of the country's abundant gas reserves. Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors condemned last week's ruthless crackdown, where soldiers opened fire to clear the streets of the capital Yangon of up 100,000 Buddhist monk-led protesters, but have so far ruled out sanctions. State media said 10 people were killed in the violence, though diplomats believe the real number is likely to be far higher.
