 Khulna, Oct 06 (bdnews24.com)  A new draft voter list for Khulna City Corporation reveals that the list previously drawn up for the southern city exceeded the actual number of voters by over 90,000 voters. District election officer Md Mujibur Rahman told bdnews24.com Saturday: "Khulna City Corporation's new draft voter list shows 93,000 fewer voters than on the previous list." The sharp fall in the number of voters this time around is a result of its greater accuracy, he said. A re-listing will begin Saturday and the number might increase by up to 3,000, Rahman said. The voter list compiled during the last government showed 4, 81,480 voters for KCC. The new draft roll has 3, 87,991 voters listed. The district election officer said eligible voters who were not listed in the first phase may be included until October 10 in the 31 wards of the city corporation. Voters have to come to the Zila School voter registration centre in the city with a certificate from their ward commissioner. The first phase of voter listing in Khulna city started on August 17 and ended on September 19. bdnews24.com/c
