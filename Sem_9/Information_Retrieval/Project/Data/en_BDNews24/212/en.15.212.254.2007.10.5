 HYDERABAD, India, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian selectors dropped off spinner Ramesh Powar and recalled left-arm spinner Murali Kartik on Friday for the fourth and fifth one-dayers against Australia. Powar struggled during last month's one-day series in England which India lost 4-3 and was dropped for Friday's third one-dayer against Australia after ending the first two games wicketless. Kartik, 31, played the last of his 30 one-day games in Pakistan in February last year before undergoing shoulder surgery. He impressed with English county Middlesex this season. The fourth game of the seven-match series will be played in Chandigarh on Monday with the next in Baroda on Thursday. India's victorious Twenty20 World Cup squad was retained for a Twenty20 game against Australia in Mumbai on Oct. 20. Squad: Mahendra Dhoni (captain), Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Saurav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Robin Uthappa, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Dinesh Karthik, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Murali Kartik, Rudra Pratap Singh, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth
