<TEXT>
 HYDERABAD, India, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captain Mahendra Dhoni has accused his Australian counterpart Ricky Ponting of using "harsh" language during Friday's one-day international even though both teams had been told to improve their behaviour. Australia won by 47 runs to go 2-0 up in the seven-match series and the game appeared to pass off smoothly after International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Chris Broad warned the sides not to repeat the mid-pitch clashes that marred Tuesday's second one-dayer in Kochi. Dhoni told reporters he had complained to the umpire about certain words Ponting and a couple of other Australian players had used while he was batting. "We discussed with the referee about not using harsh words, but he (Ponting) did, and a couple of their players did," Dhoni said. He refused to disclose what was said in the middle. However, the Australian team's media manager Philip Pope said: "All players shook hands at the end of the game and there doesn't seem to have been any of the difficulties the media had perceived in Kochi." India's temperamental paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, who was in the spotlight following verbal clashes with Australian Andrew Symonds in Kochi, kept his cool throughout the match. "It was a much more sportsman-like, friendly-like game today," Symonds said. "Both teams obviously realised things got a bit out of hand the other day. "Both chose to play completely within the rules of the ICC." The next match will be played in Chandigarh on Monday
