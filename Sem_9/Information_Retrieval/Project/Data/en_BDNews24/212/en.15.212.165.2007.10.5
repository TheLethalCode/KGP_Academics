 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Friday announced a 20-member squad for the World Cup pre-qualifier against Tajikistan, billed for Monday at Bangabandhu National Stadium. An emergency meeting of the BFF approved the squad after the selection committee, headed by its acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu, submitted the squad to the meeting. "After collecting the squad from coach Syed Nayeemuddin, the selection committee didn't bring any change or make any observation on the squad because the selection committee only saw the fitness and training sessions of the team," said Manzoor Hossain Malu. Malu said that it was not possible to make any observation without seeing a match. The national team Friday played the first warm-up match against Dhaka XI and the match ended in a 1-1 draw. After the match, coach Nayeemuddin said, "It could have been better for the side in terms of bringing the combination, had we got a few more warm-up matches before taking on Tajikistan." "However, I think the team played better in the second half and you should not consider the team's performance by this game as I see it just as a combination match," said the Indian coach. Nayeemuddin expressed satisfaction with the players' fitness level as the boys experienced a 20-day hard training on the sandy beach of Cox's Bazar before participating at a two- week fitness training at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. Squad: Biplob Bhattacharjee and Mazharul Islam Himel (goalkeepers), Hasan Al Mamun, Wali Faisal, Mahmudul Hasan, Arup Kumar Baidya, Nazrul Islam, Rajani Kanta Barman and Amit Khan Shuvra (defenders), Abul Hossain, Arman Aziz, Ariful Islam, Zahid Hossain, Zahed Pervez Chowdhury, Anamul Hoque Sharif, Zumratul Hossain Mithu, Nasirul Islam Nasir (midfielders), Saifur Rahman Moni, Jahid Hasan Ameli and Mohammad Robin (strikers).
