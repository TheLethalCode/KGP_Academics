<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Egyptian club has cooked what is says is the world's largest platter of the Oriental sweet konafa and the biggest-ever pot of beans. The City Club, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of Cairo, says it plans to enter the 18-square-metre platter of konafa and two-tonne pot of beans into the Guinness Book of World Records. "We wanted to be the first to do this, to set a new record for the world and a new image for our club," said singer Sameh Yousry, organiser of the event, which took place on Friday as part of celebrations for the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. Publishers of the Guinness Book of World Records could not be reached for comment. Chef Ayman Hassan said it took 10 workers and three days to make the beans, which could feed about 2,000 people. The konafa was made of 100 kilograms of mixed nuts, 100 kilograms of cream, 150 kilograms of crushed bananas and 75 kilograms of sugar.
