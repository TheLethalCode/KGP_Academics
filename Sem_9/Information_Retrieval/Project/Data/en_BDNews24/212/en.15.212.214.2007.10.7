<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh have been invited to play in a six-a-side cricket tournament in Hong Kong this month, scheduled for October 27-28, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board official. It is a regular fixture in Hong Kong's cricket calendar, but it is yet to be finalised whether the BCB will send a team to represent Bangladesh, though they have played in this tournament on a number of earlier occasions. "They (Hong Kong) invited us only after West Indies pulled out from the 10-team event," BCB chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com Sunday. "I can't tell you whether the board will send a team to the tournament as we have to think about what players will be available." "Our players will be busy with the national cricket league at that time, which means hardly any top cricketers will be available for the Hong Kong tournament," said Rahman. bdn
