<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Dubai Airport authorities Sunday sent 82 Biman passengers back to Bangladesh on the grounds that they did not have valid travel documents. Manager of Shah Amanat Airport in Chittagong Squadron Leader Sajjad Hossain told bdnews24.com Dubai Airport authorities sent the passengers back on a return flight. The passengers were sent back on board a Bangladesh Biman flight at about noon. Thirty-three were sent to Shah Amanat Airport and the rest went on to Zia International Airport. A Bangladesh Biman official on condition of anonymity said the mostly working-class returnees alleged that Dubai Airport authorities had sent them back without checking their passports and other papers. Hossain said the returnees stayed at the airport until 4 pm but did not demonstrate or make a scene. Some broke down in tears because they were sent back after spending a huge amount of hard-earned money. A Biman official preferring not to be named said most of the travel documents were okay. Why they had been sent back would have to be investigated, he said. The official said the visas of the most of the returned passengers had been processed by relatives in Dubai. These passengers embarked with photocopies of the visas sent to them by their relatives. It is believed that Dubai Airport authorities sent them back because their papers were not updated. On Sept 30, 35 Oman Airlines passengers were sent back from Oman for the same reasons. bdnews24.com
