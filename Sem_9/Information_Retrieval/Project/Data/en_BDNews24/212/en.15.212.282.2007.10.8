 LONDON, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-war protesters were given an 11th hour go-ahead to stage a march to parliament on Monday after police had earlier threatened to use an old Victorian law to stop them. The Stop the War Coalition said it had been given police permission to march from Trafalgar Square to parliament less than an hour before the start of the event, designed to call for the government to withdraw troops from Iraq. The authorities had effectively banned the march under the Metropolitan Police Act of 1839 which dates from the time of the Chartist protest movement, a period when the ruling class believed they were on the brink of social revolution. That impression was confirmed by the 1848 revolutions that toppled thrones in Europe and gave birth to the Marxist movement. "The ban's been lifted," a spokesman for Stop the War told Reuters as an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square. Celebrities, veteran peace campaigners and MPs are expected to join the anti-war campaigners for the march down Whitehall. They include politician Tony Benn, musician Brian Eno, comedian Mark Thomas and former Starsky and Hutch TV actor David Soul. The Stop the War Coalition had been determined to go ahead with the march -- organised to coincide with the first day of parliament after the long Summer recess -- even if it had not been given the official green light. Convener Lindsey German told BBC Radio Four: "We've never had this restriction before and we don't accept it. "We think, in a democracy, we should be allowed to go to our parliament." She also questioned the timing of the move. "We have to ask: why is it (the Act) being raised at this time? I guess that (Prime Minister) Gordon Brown would like to draw a line under the war in Iraq and demonstrations on the first day that parliament comes back are probably an embarrassment to the governmen
