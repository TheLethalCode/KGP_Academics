 LAHORE, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan made a solid start in their response to South Africa's first innings total of 357, with the hosts reaching the tea interval on 51 without loss on day two of the second test at the Gaddafi stadium on Tuesday. Salman Butt (30) and Kamran Akmal (21) scored at an average of around seven runs per over after leg-spinner, Danish Kaneria had taken 4-114 to dismiss the visitors in the afternoon. Needing a victory to even the two-test series, Pakistan were left frustrated by an eighth-wicket stand of 88 by Mark Boucher (54) and Paul Harris (46) that pushed the tourists to a respectable total after they had resumed on 259-6. Harris who made his highest test score was unlucky to miss out on a maiden fifty when he played a lazy shot to a full ball from Umar Gul and spooned a catch to Shoaib Malik in the covers. His innings from 132 balls was punctuated with six fours and took the South African total from 259-7 to 347-8. Three runs later, Kaneria bowled Dale Steyn round his legs and with Boucher hitting out to boost the total, he eventually succumbed to the spinner and holed out to Abdul Rehman at long on after reaching his 26th half century. His watchful innings lasted 226 minutes and 132 balls and included four boundaries and a hook shot off Gul for a six. Butt and makeshift opener Akmal made a breezy start and their attacking intent brought them quick runs with the half-century stand coming in only 7.5 overs. In the first session, South Africa lost one wicket when Andre Nel was snapped up by Misbah-ul-Haq at forward short leg trying to fend off a short-pitched ball from Gul in the first over of the day
