<TITLE> Delwar snubs Bhuiyan on 'unity call' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday questioned the validity of Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's call for unity in the troubled BNP. The new secretary general said: "Mannan Bhuiyan does not have the right to speak for unity in BNP, nor can he speak on behalf of the party. The chairperson has expelled him in line with the party constitution." Speaking to reporters in his NAM flat, Delwar rejected the possibility of sitting with Bhuiyan as part of efforts to unite the divided party. Asked about bringing back Bhuiyan to the party, Delwar said: "Only chairperson Khaleda Zia can decide on the issue. I am the secretary general nominated by her. I have no right to speak on this matter." On Friday, Bhuiyan, a pro-reform leader, urged party colleagues to unite BNP, forgetting differences of opinion to take part in the next election. Delwar claimed: "BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. We are thinking over how the party can be made stronger." Demanding that the government allow the party's central office in Naya Paltan to open, he said: "We urge the caretaker government to allow us to sit in the party office as we need to carry out party activities." bdnew
