<TEXT>
 LONDON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former President Bill Clinton said on Friday he could take a role promoting the United States around the world if his wife Hillary becomes president. Clinton said the government had "squandered" widespread global support after the September 11 attacks in 2001. "There was a period after 9/11 when we decided on a go-it-alone, my way or the highway approach which I think really alienated a lot of the world," he told BBC Radio. Asked what role he might take if his wife became President, he said: "I'd be of most use to her doing something to try to help restore America's standing in the world and build more allies and get us to work together again." A new Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Hillary Clinton pulling away from her Democratic rivals for the nomination with 53 percent support compared with 20 percent for Senator Barak Obama and John Edwards with 13 percent. Bill Clinton stressed he knew who would be boss if she wins the presidency. "In the end she would make her own decisions just as I did when I was President," he said. "She would be a great president and I would be the happiest person on earth if she could get elected," he added.
