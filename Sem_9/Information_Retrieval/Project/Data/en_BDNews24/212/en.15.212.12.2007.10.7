 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  The low in the Bay has weakened, the weather office said Sunday. The southern region experienced scattered rain Saturday. The cloud-covered Dhaka skies dumped rain in the city and its surrounds Sunday, dissipating the heat to an extent. The weather office forecast that rain might ease the sultry weather. Weathermen advised the maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla to raise local cautionary signal three as the sea continued to be squally and wavy under the influence of the low in the north-western Bay. Fishing boats and trawlers have been advised to cruise close to the coastlines and not to venture into the deep sea until otherwise told. Naima Baten, assistant climatologist with the Meteorological Department, said the relentless humidity soured the weather to insufferable limits, making people sweat heavily. The almost stationary low in the Bay exacerbated the heat. She said the low was generating banks of floating clouds and brewing thunderstorms in the northern Bay, which might cause gusty to squally winds blowing over the seaports. The bdnews24.com Barisal correspondent said launch services on 28 river routes in the south have been suspended since 6am Sunday in view of the stormy weather. The Patuakhali correspondent said operations of launches have been suspended on 21 river routes considering the squally weather. bdnew
