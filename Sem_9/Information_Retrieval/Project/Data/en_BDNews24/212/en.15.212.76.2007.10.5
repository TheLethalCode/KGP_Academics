 KARACHI, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's former captain and batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq will retire after playing the second test against South Africa in Lahore. The 37-year-old veteran of 119 tests said he was available for the Lahore test which would be his last. "I want to now give way to youngsters and allow them to take centre stage. I don't want to stop any youngster's progress," Inzamam said on Friday. Inzamam stepped down as captain and retired from one-day internationals after his team was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year. "I have taken this decision after much thought and I realise that my presence in the dressing room could be a pressure on the younger players. So I have decided this is the best time for me to bid farewell to a game I have loved so much," Inzamam said. The Multan-born batsman who also played in 378 one-day internationals said his biggest regret remained the performance of the team in the 2007 World Cup. "It was one of the biggest disappointments of my long career the way we performed because we had a good team. But there have been other disappointments as well and that is part of the game," Inzamam said. He said winning the 1992 World Cup final against England was the best moment of his career plus the hundred he scored against Bangladesh in 2003 in his hometown Multan to help Pakistan win the match. "It was my comeback match after disappointing form in the 2003 World Cup and it was an important innings for me." Inzamam said he would be available to serve Pakistan cricket in any capacity if required by the Pakistan cricket Board
