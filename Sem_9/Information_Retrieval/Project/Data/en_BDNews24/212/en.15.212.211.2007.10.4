<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com) Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Thursday requested the Election Commission to ease the conditions for registration of political parties. Speaking to reporters, he said no political party would be able to get registered fulfilling the conditions set in the EC's draft proposal for electoral reform. "We have supported the Election Commission's roadmap. We are also interested to provide all-out cooperation at party level for implementation of the roadmap," Zillur said. "The statements of the government and the activities of the Election Commission seem to show that they want to hold elections by December 2008." However, Zillur reiterated previous AL demands that the EC not register any religion-based political parties, and it immediately withdraw the state of emergency for holding local government elections in January. Saying that the Awami League is maintaining its stand of not participating in elections before the release of party president Sheikh Hasina, he added: "Time will tell what will be our next decision." The acting president said the party would make all-out efforts for the release of Sheikh Hasina. Speaking to reporters after attending iftar with AL front organisation Sechhasevak League, he said: "The Awami League is once more a united party." "Some misunderstanding was created recently among the party leaders and workers but it has been smoothed over." bdnews24.c
