 Dhaka, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com) - The Communist Party of Bangladesh Saturday called for a clearer public understanding of the "ownership and profit distribution" of organisations involved in microcredit programmes. "NGOs have turned poverty into a business," said CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan and general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim in a joint statement. In a report released Thursday, Transparency International Bangladesh said most of the NGOs approved over the last five years are Islamic organisations living off shady foreign funds, mostly from Saudi Arabia. The sleaze watchdog accused the NGOs of belonging to the "midlevel corruption sector". In the survey, based on 20 NGOs, TIB uncovered massive irregularities in policymaking and fund handling by the organisations. Responding to the report, the CPB said: "Our party has long demanded transparency, accountability and democratic control of NGOs." "The TIB report shows that the NGOs' declared aim is to develop the status of poor people and their empower them. "However, many NGOs have built up business, bank accounts and other activities in the corporate sector which is in no way acceptable." The statement called for a policy to ensure the transparency and accountability of 47,000 organisations active in the country. The CPB also demanded the non-governmental sector to make all their financial dealings transparent at all levels. bdnews24
