 PARIS, Sun Oct 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British jurors probing Princess Diana's death are to see for themselves in Paris where she died in a high-speed car crash with her lover Dodi al-Fayed. The jury, which has been meeting in London in an inquest to decide if the Paris crash 10 years ago was an accident, will on Monday and Tuesday retrace the last day of the couple -- from the Ritz Hotel where they spent their final evening together to the crash scene in the Alma underpass.

At last week's dramatic opening to the long-delayed inquest, the jury was shown security camera pictures that pieced together the couple's last day in August 1997. Shots from the corridors of the Ritz Hotel captured a relaxed and smiling Diana in the arms of her lover, head tilted sideways in a characteristic gesture. The camera captures Diana and Dodi running for the car shortly after midnight to start her fateful journey. Al-Fayed, owner of London's luxury Harrods store, said in a string of accusations listed in court by the judge, that the royal family could not bear the idea of Diana marrying a Musl
