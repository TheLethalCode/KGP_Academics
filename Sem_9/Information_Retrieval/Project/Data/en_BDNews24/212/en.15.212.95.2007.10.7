 DAMASCUS, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey assured the Damascus government on Sunday it would not let Israel use its airspace to strike Syria after an Israeli raid heightened tension in the Middle East. Diplomats said at least four Israeli planes flew in attack formation along the Syrian-Turkish border before striking deep into Syria on Sept 6. Syria and Israel have given little information on the target. "Turkey will not let Turkish territory or airspace be used in any activity that could harm the security or safety of Syria," Foreign Minister Ali Babacan said after meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus.

The raid came after speculation that Syria and Israel could resume peace talks that collapsed in 2000 over the scope of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a plateau which Israel occupied in 1967. Syria has called for the Golan issue to be on the agenda of a peace conference in November sponsored by the United States, Israel's chief ally.
