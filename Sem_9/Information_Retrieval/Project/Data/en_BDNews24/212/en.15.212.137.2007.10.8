 ISLAMABAD, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Pakistani soldiers were killed when their helicopter crashed during a visit to Kashmir by President Pervez Musharraf on Monday to mark the second anniversary of an earthquake in the region, an army spokesman said. General Musharraf, who took the most votes in a presidential election on Saturday, had travelled ahead in another helicopter and was unhurt. However, his spokesman, retired Major General Rashid Qureshi, was injured in the crash, the spokesman said. "It was a technical fault, that's why it went down," army spokesman Major General Waheed Arshad said, ruling out a militant attack. "It took off after President Musharraf left," Arshad said. "The president is safe and sound. He has reached his destination." A villager in Ghori said he heard some kind of blast as the helicopter overflew the village, in a valley 18 km (11 miles) south of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir. "I was standing in my courtyard when the helicopter passed over, its sound was unusually loud. Then I heard a blast and a few parts of the chopper fell to the ground," Waqar Kazmi told Reuters. The helicopter crash landed in flames and villagers rushed to help people on board escape. "We rescued three soldiers from the burning chopper before the fire intensified," Arshad Kazmi, who was among the first to reach the spot said, said. US ally Musharraf has survived at least three assassination attempts by al Qaeda linked militants. The most recent was last July, when assassins tried to shoot down his aeroplane after it took off from the military airfield at Rawalpindi, but the plane was well out of range. The Supreme Court says Musharraf cannot be confirmed as the winner of Saturday's election by the parliamentary and provincial assemblies until it rules whether he was eligible to stand while still army chief. Musharraf has vowed to quit the army and be sworn in as a civilian leader if he is elected. bd
