<TITLE> Pakistan's Inzamam keen to end career on winning note </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq is looking to end his test career in style with a big-hitting performance and a team victory over South Africa this week. Inzamam, 37, will retire after the second test in Lahore which starts on Monday after having served his country since 1990, playing 119 tests and 378 one-day matches, and being captain from 2003 to 2007. "Obviously it will be a very emotional and sentimental moment for me when I walk out tomorrow for one last time wearing the green Pakistan cap," he told Reuters on Sunday. "But if we can win this test, it would be the perfect parting gift for me. "Every player wants to end his career on a winning note. And given that we are one down in the series if I get a big score and help the team win it would be a memorable end to my career," Inzamam said. The big batsman famous for his combination of batting power and flair needs to score 20 runs to become Pakistan's highest run-getter in test cricket. He also holds the record for the highest number of hundreds by a Pakistani batsman (25) and runs in one-day cricket (11,739). Pakistan will play Mohammad Yousuf and Inzamam in the test after having lost the first match in Karachi by 160 runs. "I haven't played for Pakistan since that disappointing World Cup in March. I know how much that debacle hurt our people. I want to do something special for them one last time," he said. Inzamam will play his last test at the Gaddafi stadium where he made his debut against West Indies and then played some key innings in the 1992 World Cup to help his country win the final. Inzamam said the players in the side and new captain, Shoaib Malik, had been "wonderful" to him after he joined and trained with them on Saturday. EMOTIONAL RETURN "Being back with the team was very emotional for me and the players are backing me to do something special. I just hope I can deliver for the team," he said. Gaddafi stadium is also the venue where he made his highest test score and only the second triple hundred (329) by a Pakistani batsman in 2002 against New Zealand. Inzamam said it was always difficult for a top sportsman to retire after years of competition. "It is never easy, it was difficult for me to take the decision to retire after this test. But I am fortunate to get this chance because in Pakistan many of our former greats didn't get an opportunity to retire gracefully," he added. "I have been with this team for years now and I can see it has developed good spirit despite the World Cup setback and Malik is doing a good job. "I have taken the right decision to go out now and allow younger players a chance to have a successful career," said Inzamam
