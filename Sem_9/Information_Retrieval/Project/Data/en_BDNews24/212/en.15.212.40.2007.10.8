 DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Turkish soldiers died on Monday from Kurdish rebel landmine explosions, bringing the death toll among troops over the past 24 hours to 15 and piling pressure on Ankara to take tough action. The increased attacks on security personnel in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey have reignited talk of a Turkish military incursion into neighbouring northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels who use the region as a base.

Speaking after Sunday's attack, the worst in more than a decade, Erdogan said Turkey would now press its fight against the PKK "in a very different way", implying it might send troops to crush an estimated 3,000 PKK rebels based in northern Iraq. Government spokesman Cemil Cicek told reporters on Monday a cross-border operation would be "complicated", but refused to rule out any option. He denied opposition accusations the government lacked the political will to combat terrorism effectively. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group began its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 19
