 DAKAR, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senegal captain El Hadji Diouf announced he was ending his international career on Monday, citing organisational problems at the West African side. "I have stopped my international career," Diouf told commercial radio station RFM in a telephone interview from England, where he plays club football for Premier League Bolton Wanderers. "There are so many problems with the national team. "The team has a scheduled friendly match in a week and we don't even know who we are playing against. This is unacceptable," said the 26-year-old striker, who has played for his country over 30 times. "If we have to come and play for our country, we have to pay for our own air ticket and reimbursement of the cost is another big problem," he added. Senegal have qualified for the next year's African Nation's Cup in Ghana. "I don't think I will change my mind," Diouf said
