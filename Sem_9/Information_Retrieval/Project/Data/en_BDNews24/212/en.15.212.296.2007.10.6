 BAGHDAD, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq rejected on Saturday testimony by the former head of the country's anti-corruption commission who said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki protected some corrupt relatives from the investigative body. "The testimony by ... Radhi al-Radhi in front of members of (US) Congress is nothing more than false allegations ... that serves known sides and figures who are systematically attempting to harm Prime Minister Nuri Kamil al-Maliki's reputation," a statement from Maliki's office said. Radhi, who left Iraq in August after threats against him, told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that 31 employees at the Iraqi Independent Integrity Commission were killed because of their jobs and that the government lost $18 billion through corruption. The statement from Maliki's office said the prime minister had consistently asked Radhi to tackle graft and pointed out that Iraq's parliament had accused Radhi himself of politicising the independent body. "The prime minister continuously demanded the former head of integrity (Independent Integrity Commission), to pursue corruption in all institutions and to bring those implicated to justice regardless of their political, religious or ethnic background," the statement said. "But the former head of integrity, according to evidence and documents that were presented in (parliament), followed only parts of corruption cases ... ignoring huge cases of corruption which implicated certain figures and parties," it said. Maliki vowed tough measures against graft since taking up his post last year but corruption remains rampant in Iraqi institutions.
