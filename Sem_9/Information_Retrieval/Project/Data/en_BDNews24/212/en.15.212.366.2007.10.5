 AMSTERDAM, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect General Zdravko Tolimir is refusing medical treatment, putting his life at risk, the war crimes tribunal in The Hague said on Friday. Tolimir, 58, a close aide of Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic, was arrested and transferred to the tribunal in June. He faces genocide and war crimes charges related to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims. "Tolimir has given various reasons for refusing medical care, ranging from religious beliefs to asserting that he is, in fact, in good health," the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said in a statement. Tolimir is suffering from an aneurism in his brain, as well as a serious heart condition, both of which are exacerbated by his high blood pressure. Tolimir is refusing medication or treatment to lower his blood pressure, putting him at risk of a stroke or heart attack, the tribunal said. "There is a very real and serious risk of the accused experiencing a life-threatening episode at any time and without warning," Hans Holthuis, the tribunal's registrar, was quoted as saying in the statement. Holthuis said he was raising the issue and requesting that the tribunal "take all appropriate measures to further assess Tolimir's health" and determine whether he can stand trial and represent himself. Serb ultranationalist leader Vojislav Seselj went on hunger strike for 28 days last year after the UN court decided to assign him a defence lawyer against his wishes. He ended it after the court's Appeals Chamber restored his right to represent himself. Tolimir has refused to "cooperate with physicians, accept appropriate medical treatment or prescribed medicines" since his arrest and transfer to the Hague on June 1, the court said. Tolimir is alleged to have helped Mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995, and is thought by military experts to have helped the commander evade arrest since. Tolimir's arrest boosted hopes that Mladic and his political boss Radovan Karadzic could be caught, but UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Wednesday that Serbia's progress in capturing suspected war criminals was too slow.
