<TITLE> UK well placed to withstand credit squeeze-Darling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain is in a much stronger position than many other countries to withstand a global credit squeeze, finance minister Alistair Darling said on Sunday. Asked in a BBC television interview if financial market turbulence would hit growth, Darling said: "If you look at what is happening around the world at the moment following on the problems in the American housing market, which have now spread right across the world, I think you will find that commentators, the IMF, will downgrade their expectations for growth." "What is different in this country is that we are in a much, much stronger position than many other countries. We withstood problems in the past when the American stock market collapsed at the begining of this decade. I think we will get through these problems. We're well placed to do that," he said. Darling gave no clue as to whether he would revise down his forecast for British growth next year when he delivers his first pre-budget report to parliament on Tuesday. The Treasury's current assumption is that Britain's gross domestic product will grow by 2.5 to 3 percent next year. Britain was hit with its first bank run for a century last month when savers queued up to withdraw their money from Northern Rock, a victim of the credit crunch. But Darling said Britain's economy was "strong, stable (and) able to withstand some of the difficulties that we and other countries are going to face over the next few years". Asked if he would review inheritance tax in response to an opposition Conservative pledge to exempt people bequeathing less than one million pounds ($2.04 million) from the tax, Darling said: "I will look at all tax rates and you'll have to wait and see what precisely I do across a whole range of measures until Tuesday." "What I will not do though is to make promises I can't pay for," he said. The Conservatives said at their conference last week that, if elected, they would raise the inheritance tax threshold and exempt most first-time home buyers from property tax, funding the measures with a levy on wealthy foreigners who do not pay tax in Britain on most of their income. The promises gave a boost to the Conservatives in the opinion polls, leading Prime Minister Gordon Brown to abandon thoughts of calling an election next month. Darling accused the Conservatives of making extravagant promises which they could not pay for. Darling is expected to pour billions more into the state health service on Tuesday and he could opt for a cut in tax on home purchases and inherited wealth to blunt the attraction of the Conservatives' promises. The government also looks set to close an unpopular loophole that has allowed private equity bosses to pay lower tax rates.
