 Islamabad, Oct 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's cabinet approved on Friday a "reconciliation ordinance" preparing the way for President Pervez Musharraf to forge a power-sharing accord with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf, who is seeking another term in office in an election on Saturday, is due to promulgate the ordinance, that will erase corruption against Bhutto and others, later on Friday. "The cabinet has approved the draft of the ordinance. There have been no changes in the draft which has been agreed upon by the two sides," Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Reuters, referring to the government and Bhutto.
