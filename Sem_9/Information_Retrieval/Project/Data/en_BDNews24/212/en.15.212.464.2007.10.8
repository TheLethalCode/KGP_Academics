 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnew24.com)  A special court dealing with high-profile graft cases Monday sentenced former Awami League minister Mohammad Nasim to 13 years in jail after it convicted him of having undeclared assets and concealing the information. The court also handed his wife Laila Arzumand Banu three years' jail term on charges of aiding her husband in amassing assets. Banu is absconding. On March 21, ACC assistant director Mahbubul Alam filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against Nasim and Banu on charge of concealing wealth information of Tk 1.64 crore. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 imposed a fine of Tk 10 lakh on Nasim, the former home minister. He will have to serve another year in prison if he fails to pay the fine. The court also fined Banu Tk 1 lakh and said she would have to stay another month in jail if she fails to pay the fine. Nasim got 10 years for acquiring wealth illegally and three years for suppressing information about that wealth. The court also ordered authorities to confiscate the illegal assets of the couple. On Feb 4, joint forces arrested Nasim from his Dhanmondi home. His wife is evading arrest. Earlier on Sept 17, in a statement Nasim said, "The ACC has filed the case biased by a special quarter in a political motive to smear my family." Nasim was one of 50 on the ACC-prepared list of persons with suspected corruption links. The graft watchdog asked the listed persons to submit their wealth statement within 72 hours of the receipt of the notice. The case alleged that Nasim and his wife had suppressed information on their having Tk 23.47 lakh worth of furniture and Tk 22 lakh electronic appliances. It also said the price of west Raja Bazar flat in his wife's name was shown much less at Tk 13 lakh and the Sirajganj house at Tk 82 lakh. Discrepancy was found in the statements that they had Tk 3 lakh in the main branch of IFIC Bank, Tk 4.69 lakh in Dhanmondi branch of Standard Chartered Bank, gold ornaments of Tk 50,000 in the locker, 3.92 acres of land worth Tk 2.48 lakh at Kashinathpur in Pabna district, two flats in Al-Amin City Tower, one vehicle and Tk 9.19 lakh for booking of a garage. ACC deputy director Akhter Hamid Bhuiyan pressed charges against them on July 19. Judge Md Azizul Huq of Dhaka Senior Special Judge's Court transferred the case to Special Judges' Court-1. On July 26, the court framed charges against them and 38 people testified in the court on behalf of the state. Nasim and two others also gave statements. The hearing ended on Oct 3. Earlier, former BNP state minister Amanullah Aman and his wife Sabera Aman, former state minister Mir Md Nasiruddin and son Mir Md Helaluddin, former BNP lawmaker Wadud Bhuiyan, former BNP MP Ali Asghar Loby and his wife Khusnud Asghar, former Awami League state minister Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, general secretary of Awami Swechhashebak League Pankaj Devnath and wife Monika Devnath, CBA president of BTTB Firoz Miah were convicted of corruption. Former AL lawmakers Shamim Osman and Jainal Hajari, former political secretary to prime minister Harris Chowdhury and Tarique Rahman's friend Giasuddin Al Mamun were sentenced each to three years in jail for not filing wealth statement by the ACC deadline. bdnew
