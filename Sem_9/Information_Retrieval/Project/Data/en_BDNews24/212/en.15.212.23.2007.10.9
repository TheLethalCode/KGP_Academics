 BAGHDAD, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two suicide car bombs killed at least 22 people in northern Iraq on Tuesday in attacks targeting a local police chief as well as a Sunni Arab tribal leader working with US forces to fight al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in Iraq had vowed to ramp up attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, specifically to target government officials and tribal leaders who had joined with the US military to combat the Sunni Islamist group. The two suicide car bombs hit the town of Baiji, 180 km (110 miles) north of the capital in Salahuddin province, police said. Baiji is a major oil refining centre fed with crude oil and gas from the vast fields under the nearby city of Kirkuk. Police said one bomb targeted a mosque. The other was aimed at Baiji's police chief, Colonel Saad Nifous, who was wounded in a blast at his home. Police did not immediately have a break-up of the 22 dead from the combined attacks, but they earlier said at least 10 civilians had been killed in the mosque attack. A police source in Baiji said the target of that bombing was Hamad al-Jubouri, the Sunni Arab leader of the "Awakening" council for Salahuddin. It was unclear if Jubouri was hurt. The councils are based on a model first used in Western Anbar province where Sunni Arab sheikhs joined with US forces to drive al Qaeda militants from much of the vast desert region. US President George W. Bush has lauded Anbar and its improved security as an example of what could happen elsewhere in Iraq. The province was once the heart of the Sunni Arab insurgency and the most dangerous part of Iraq for US troops. It has become much safer since tribal leaders organised young men into police units. The US military said recently that tribal groups, also known as "Awakening" councils, were taking root in other provinces such as Salahuddin where many Sunni Arabs have remained fiercely loyal to former president Saddam Hussein. In two other attacks in the north on Tuesday, the deputy police chief of Nineveh province was killed by gunmen in the city of Mosul and the head of police intelligence in Kirkuk was wounded in a drive-by shooting, police sources said. "FAILED ATTEMPT" The spokesman for US troops in northern Iraq said while the Baiji police chief was all right following the attack, the condition of tribal leader Jubouri was unclear. "This is yet another failed attempt to break the will of the Iraqi people," Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Donnelly said. The military blames al Qaeda in Iraq for most mass-casualty attacks in the country. The group also often claims responsibility for killing officials and tribal leaders. Al Qaeda in Iraq is largely a homegrown organisation that the US military says has foreign leadership and links to the main al Qaeda network led by Osama bin Laden. Washington and US commanders have said a security crackdown involving 30,000 extra US troops helped bring down US military and Iraqi civilian deaths in September, but they say there is still too much violence in the country. The crackdown is designed to buy time for Iraq's feuding leaders to pass laws aimed at reconciling majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs, who were dominant under Saddam. Tuesday's deaths come after at least 21 people were killed in car and roadside bomb attacks on Monday. In the worst attack, 10 people died when a suicide car bomber hit a police station in city of Samarra, north of Baghdad.
