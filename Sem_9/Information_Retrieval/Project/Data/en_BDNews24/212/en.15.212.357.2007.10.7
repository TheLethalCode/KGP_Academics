<TITLE> Jakarta's new governor to tackle traffic, floods </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fauzi Bowo, who took over as the governor of Jakarta on Sunday, faces the near-impossible task of tackling this chaotic city's traffic jams, floods, poverty and pollution in order to make the Indonesian capital more liveable. As with most mega-cities, Jakarta is a magnet for those in search of work, but its creaking infrastructure is inadequate for the 14 million people who live in the capital and its suburbs. Traffic creeps along at a snail's pace during rush hour, making Jakartans angry, frustrated, and late for appointments. Some commuters get up as early as 4 a.m. to beat the gridlock, while each rainy season, millions suffer as homes are damaged and roads rendered impassable by filthy floodwater. The jams have even spawned a micro-economy of sorts: buskers and cigarette vendors ply trapped motorists for trade, freelance road wardens stick their hands out for a tip as they try in vain to redirect the traffic, while motorcyclists and passengers can be hired to beat the chaos. "Transportation is certainly one of the major shortcomings of this city," Bowo, 59, told Reuters in an interview last week at the governor's office, a complex of buildings that includes a grand, Dutch colonial-era mansion. "Public transport has not been tackled by the administration. We just started in the last five years to improve it." Jakarta's sprawl encompasses extremes of wealth. At one end, there are luxurious villas tucked away behind security gates and gleaming skyscrapers, some topped with helipads: at the other, the slums and stinking canals that serve as open sewers in this developing-world capital. When leading private pollster Indonesian Survey Institute asked which problem should be at the top of the Jakarta government's priority list earlier this year, 16.5 percent of those polled said unemployment, 13 percent floods, and 12.9 percent traffic. Bowo, the first governor of Jakarta to be elected by the people, needs to spend billions of dollars on an ambitious overhaul of the infrastructure -- extending bus routes, building a subway and monorail, and completing a complex network of canals and reservoirs to prevent flooding in the rainy season. The trained engineer, who was nicknamed "Mr Moustache" by Jakartans, said he may also introduce a road pricing system similar to the ones in Singapore and London, and may make certain days "car-free" or for use by those vehicles with odd or even number plates in order to cut congestion. But in a city as anarchic as Jakarta, some wonder whether such measures can succeed, as Jakartans are adept at getting around the rules. The "three-in-one" scheme in the city centre, which restricts use of the fast lanes to those cars carrying three or more people, is either ignored or circumvented, as drivers pick up "road jockeys" who loiter at street corners and pay them a small fee to be their impromptu passengers. Many road junctions are manned by unofficial monitors who expect to be tipped to direct cars as they do a u-turn, even though they are more of a hindrance than a help. Jakarta's attempt at a car-free day recently was considered a disaster, as closing off the roads caused even bigger traffic jams elsewhere in the city. Thanks to a recovery in the local economy and decline in interest rates, more and more Jakartans are able to buy cars and motorbikes on credit. Last year alone, 138 cars and bajaj -- the puttering three-wheelers that wobble and weave through slow-moving traffic -- were registered each day in Jakarta, Bowo said, while growth in the number of new motorbikes was even higher. But Bowo -- previously deputy to the former governor, Sutiyoso, who now has his eye on the presidency -- says that weaning Jakartans off their beloved cars and motorbikes will be hard. "We can only do it if we provide the public with alternative transportation," Bowo said, adding that his goal is to cut the proportion of trips using private transport from 85 percent currently to about 60 perce
