 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  A special court dealing with high-profile corruption cases Sunday jailed former BNP lawmaker Ali Asghar Loby for 13 years for illegally accumulating assets and suppressing information. Judge Shahed Nuruddin of Special Judge's Court-3 also sentenced Loby's wife Khushnud to three years in jail in the same case for aiding her husband in amassing the illegal wealth. The court also ordered the state to confiscate the illegal assets of the couple. Loby, a former president of Bangladesh Cricket Board, was fined Tk 10 lakh and faces another six months in prison if he failed to pay the fine. Khushnud was fined Tk 1 lakh and faces one more month in jail if the fine remained unpaid. Loby was handed down 10 years for making wealth illegally and three years for suppressing information about his wealth, the judge said. One sentence will take effect after the end of the other, meaning Loby has to be behind bars for 13 years. On March 21, ACC deputy director Shirin Parvin filed a case with Gulshan Police Station against Loby and his wife for earning wealth worth Tk 24.97 crore beyond his declared assets. ACC assistant director Abu Sayeed pressed charges against him with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on June 17. On July 8, the court accepted the charges, and the trial started on July 11. On July 5, the same court in another case sentenced Loby to eight years in jail and fined him Tk 25 lakh on charges of dodging income tax. bdnews24.co
