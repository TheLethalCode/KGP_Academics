<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Popular Bollywood performer and composer Adnan Sami, who once weighed over 200 kg, said he feels rejuvenated after shedding around half his body weight. British-born Sami, who merges Indian and Western styles, started dieting after his doctors warned that he only had a few months left to live. He lost the 100 kg over about a year. "It has given me a new lease of life, there is so much more I can do today," the 34-year-old musician said during a press conference to launch a TV musical show he will be hosting. "I was laughing when I got to know that I will have to stand and walk on the sets," he added. "I could not have done that earlier." The singer had to use a stick for walking, and sometimes a wheelchair. At his heaviest, he could not lie down to sleep. His father made an emotional appeal for him to lose weight, saying he did not want to attend his son's funeral, Sami said.
