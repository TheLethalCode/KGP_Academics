<TITLE> Stopping Kallis the key, says Pakistan captain Shoaib </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik believes stopping South Africa's Jacques Kallis will be the key to winning the second test and levelling the two-match series. Kallis made a successful comeback to the South African team after being dropped for the Twenty20 World Cup, scoring 155 and 100 not out to set up a 160-runs victory. Pakistan dropped him on 36 and 51 in the first innings. "Kallis was the main difference between the two teams in the first test we lost in Karachi," Shoaib told reporters on Sunday. "We dropped a couple of catches on the first day and it cost us. We have watched his play and we have a couple of plans for him for this test." Pakistan will be boosted by the return of premier batsman Mohammad Yousuf while former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq is playing his final match before he retires from cricket. "Getting Yousuf back I think will offset the advantage of Kallis that they have. He is our answer to Kallis," Shoaib said. He rejected suggestions Inzamam's final performance could turn into a distraction for his side. "In fact I can say with confidence that just having Inzamam back training with us has boosted the confidence level of myself and my team a lot. "His inclusion is not a distraction but a boost for us. He has upped the morale of the team and we are hoping he has a good match," the Pakistan skipper said. Inzamam, 37, will play his 120th test in Lahore and requires just 20 more runs to become the highest run-getter in tests for Pakistan, a record held by Javed Miandad with 8,832 runs in 124 tests
