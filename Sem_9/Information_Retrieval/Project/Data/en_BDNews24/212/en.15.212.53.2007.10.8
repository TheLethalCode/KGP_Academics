 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After Beyonce scrapped her debut show in Malaysia, the managers of music artists are being warned to study dress code restrictions before booking dates in the Muslim-majority country. A September 28 statement from Kuala Lumpur-based promoter Pineapple Concerts gave no reason for the cancellation of the November 1 Beyonce concert at the city's 9,000-capacity Putra Stadium, although Pineapple later blamed a 'scheduling conflict.' But Malaysian industry sources maintain the cancellation was caused by Beyonce's apparent refusal to abide by the country's strict dress code for performers. Many Muslim groups, including the 10,000-member National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students (NUMMS), had urged the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage -- which in 2005 introduced a compulsory dress code and other rules for performers -- to stop the concert from taking place. "Our guidelines for performances by foreign artists are explicitly stated," said Siti Zaleha Baba, chief assistant secretary of the ministry's central committee for filming and performance by foreign artists. "Promoters are advised to alert artist managers about the guidelines before applying for a license to stage the concert. Any artist can perform in Malaysia provided they follow the guidelines." Female performers must show no skin from the tops of their chests to their knees, and clothes cannot feature obscene or drug-related images or messages. There is also a ban on profanity, hugging or kissing audience members or fellow artists, jumping and shouting, and throwing objects onstage or at the audience. TAKING A PLEDGE Promoters and sponsors must pledge in writing that they accept and will inform the performers of the rules, as well as ensuring that they follow them. Malaysia has become an increasingly important Asian touring stop for artists, with an average 12 to 15 annual shows by major international acts. One Western act to fall afoul of the guidelines was the Pussycat Dolls. Kuala Lumpur-based concert promoter Absolute Entertainment was fined $2,900 by the city council in July 2006 when the act violated the dress code and performed 'suggestive' dance routines during its show at the 2,000-capacity Sunway Lagoon Surf Beach venue. The penalty followed a complaint by Culture, Arts and Heritage minister Rais Yatim, who said: "The way the Pussycat Dolls behaved onstage amounted to gross indecency." Yet the group experienced no sales backlash in Malaysia. Its 'PCD' (Universal Music Malaysia) album has sold more than 45,000 units since its May 2006 release, according to the label -- a solid tally in the territory for a relatively new act. "If they choose to return, they will undergo more stringent checks at their performance," Kuala Lumpur-based Universal Music Southeast Asia vice president Sandy Monteiro said. "It's likely the promoter will have to assure the authorities of guideline compliance." In contrast, Gwen Stefani complied with the dress code for her August 21 sold-out show at the Putra Stadium after NUMMS said that her 'revealing' outfits clashed with Islamic values. Other performers who have followed the guidelines include Mariah Carey and Linkin Park. "Our culture celebrates freedom of expression, and we're accustomed to that," said Jim Guerinot, manager for Stefani at Rebel Waltz. "But when you travel the globe and encounter different cultures, you have to respect their local custom
