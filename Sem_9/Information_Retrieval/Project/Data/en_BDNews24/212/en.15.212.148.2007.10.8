 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said trying all crimes was not possible in any country, let alone Bangladesh. He, however, said there should be a precedent and the trials were aimed at setting examples. Mainul made the remarks while speaking as chief guest at a "share-certificate" distribution ceremony of Dhaka Reporters Unity Multipurpose Cooperative Society. "Who has indulged in how much corruption is not the main issue, what is important is to take the country forward, establish good governance and rule of honest people," Mainul said. "The government is not working only to stage elections. The great responsibility of the government is to establish good governance and democracy. Journalists have a big responsibility in this regard." The adviser reiterated that the government would hold elections by 2008 and added: "At the same time, one of our big pledges is to present an honest government to the nation through election." Power adviser Tapan Chowdhury was present at the event. bdnews24.
