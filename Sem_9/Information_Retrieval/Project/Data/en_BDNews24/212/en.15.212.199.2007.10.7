 COPENHAGEN, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Danish police arrested at least 436 people on Saturday in Copenhagen after demonstrators evicted from a youth centre six months ago tried to occupy a different building, officials said. "We have never arrested so many people in a single incident before," a police spokesman told Danish news agency Ritzau. Around 3,000 demonstrators tried to climb over police vehicles to reach the building. Police responded with teargas and then moved in for the arrests. No injuries were reported, police said. The demonstrators failed to occupy the building. Most of those arrested were expected to be released by morning. The conflict over the youth centre has been simmering since 2000, when the local government sold the building to a religious group. Left-wing activists had used it as a base since 1982 but were evicted in March, which led to violent street clashes and hundreds of arrests. bd
