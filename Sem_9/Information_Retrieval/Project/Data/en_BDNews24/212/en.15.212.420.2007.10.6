 BANGALORE, India, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- The coalition government in India's Karnataka state, home to the global IT city of Bangalore, could fall after a key ally withdrew support in a power-sharing row on Saturday. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it was pulling out of the government as the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD (S) party, which leads the coalition, is not handing power to the BJP for the next 20 months, as was agreed between the two. Leaders of the BJP, which has 79 legislators in the 224-member state legislature, will meet Governor Rameshwar Thakur on Sunday and formally withdraw support, they said. This will reduce the government to a minority and could force Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to resign if he is not able to save the government with the help of the Congress, the other big party in the state which has 65 lawmakers. If all efforts to save the government fail, fresh elections could be held in the state of which Bangalore, the city of more than 1,500 Indian and global IT firms, is the capital. "This is a worst kind of betrayal in (the) political history of India," senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said, accusing Kumaraswamy of reneging on the power-sharing promise. "This government has to be dismissed," said state BJP spokesman Suresh Kumar. "We will go the people. The JD (S) will be taught a lesson for its betrayal." Chief Minister Kumaraswamy said he was not fulfilling the power-sharing agreement as he was worried about BJP's "communal and divisive" politics. "I am prepared to go back on my promise for the sake of my party and people of Karnataka," Kumaraswamy told a rally on Friday. The BJP, which is powerful mostly in north India, was hoping to rule Karnataka and make inroads into southern Indian states which are ruled by a hue of smaller parties. It is a party identified with right-wing politics and has often been accused of inciting anti-Muslim communal flare ups in many parts of India.
