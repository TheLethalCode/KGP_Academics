 GENEVA, Oct 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks to open up world trade hold the key to prosperity for poor countries, political leaders from developed and developing countries said on Thursday. But a top Singapore diplomat said growing protectionist fears in Europe and America threatened to derail the Doha round of trade talks at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). "If Doha fails, the international community will have failed the global poor," Liberian Foreign Minister Olubanke King-Akerele told the WTO's public forum. "We want to grow our way out of poverty," she said. The Doha round was launched nearly six years ago to boost the world economy by opening up world trade. Unlike previous global trade negotiations it aims specifically to help developing countries by rebalancing world trade rules. Liberia is one of Africa's poorest countries, with 80 percent of the population living on less than $1 a day. King-Akerele said increased trading opportunities, such as a scheme to allow Liberian farmers to grow and export chilli, not only provided hope to people in the country but would help solidify peace in the war-torn region. Singapore diplomat and political scientist Kishore Mahbubani said the United States and European Union had forced China to open up its markets as a price for WTO entry. As a result China was now the fastest growing economy. "It shows you what a powerful impact it can have when you bite the bullet and go for massive trade liberalisation," he told the forum. NEGOTIATING TRAIN Finnish President Tarja Halonen said the Doha round had to result in a fair deal for all the WTO's 151 members, including the developing ones, to promote economic growth and employment. "All countries have the right to develop and to aim for growth and prosperity," she said. "No nation ... can think that a competitive advantage is for ever in poverty or in cheap labour." Diplomats have been working intensely in Geneva in recent weeks to conclude a Doha deal. The United States is under pressure to cut its market-distorting farm subsidies and other rich countries such as the European Union to cut their tariffs on agriculture products. In return, rich countries want developing countries to open up their markets for manufactures by cutting tariffs there. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy told forum participants the end was in sight in the key agriculture and industry talks, and negotiations were speeding up in other areas such as services, which account for more than two thirds of the global economy. "I hope we will soon be able to see the negotiating train reach its ultimate destination," he said. But US and EU officials are expressing frustration at the negotiating stance of some major developing countries. US Trade Representative Susan Schwab said Washington was showing flexibility by offering to negotiate its farm subsidies in a range proposed by a WTO mediator. The European Union had also been flexible but the Doha deal, now within reach, risked being lost if some other rich and developing countries did not make difficult choices, she said in a comment piece in the Financial Times.
