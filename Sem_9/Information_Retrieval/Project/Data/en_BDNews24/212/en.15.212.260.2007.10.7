<TITLE> All graft suspects may access Truth Commission: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday all graft suspects would have access to the proposed Truth Commission. "The government's Truth Commission initiative has been planned so that all citizens including the business community may take advantage of it," Mainul told reporters, after a committee meeting. "All citizens are equal in the eyes of the law, which is why the commission's reach will extend beyond the business community," he said. Economists as well as businessmen have received the caretaker government's proposal for a system of financial penalties instead of prison terms, with guarded enthusiasm. Many economists see the move as a chance for the business community to operate more freely than has been possible during the anti-corruption drive. However the law adviser stressed: "The criminal elements will be punished by the government in due course." bdnews2
