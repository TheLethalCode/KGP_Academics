 TAIPEI, Oct 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Typhoon Krosa slammed into Taiwan on Saturday, with strong winds and heavy rains cutting power and cancelling flights while mainland China braced for what it called a serious impact. Authorities in China ordered the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian to call more than 27,000 fishing boats back to safe harbours, Xinhua said. In Taiwan, disaster authorities said the storm shut down schools and businesses in the north of the country. "The wind is tremendous here, and we've lost power," said Chuang Min-hsiang, of Taitung. "We're all at home doing work to protect ourselves from the typhoon." Three people were hurt, the National Fire Agency said. A service staff member at Taipei's Kaohsiung airport said more than 10 international flights were cancelled on Saturday. EVA Airways, Taiwan's No. 2 international carrier, cancelled most of its afternoon flights, according to TV reports. Northern Taiwan's main port in Keelung was closed at 6 a.m. British typhoon tracking system Tropical Storm Risk (http://tsr.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/) called Krosa a category 4 typhoon. Krosa was 160 km (100 miles) off the coast of Taiwan at 0200 GMT on Saturday after picking up strength throughout the week, and was packing sustained winds of 184 kph (114 mph) and gusts of up to 227 kph (140 mph), Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau reported. Tropical Storm Risk said Krosa was expected to weaken to a category 3 storm by early Sunday morning and a category 2 storm by the middle of Sunday, when it was expected to swipe Zhejiang province of China, before heading northeast toward Fukuoka. Xinhua news agency reported that tours during its week-long holidays were cancelled in Zhejiang's coastal area and all holiday-makers evacuated from the islands. Likewise, neighbouring Fujian province cancelled coastal tours and sent tourists to safer areas. "No matter whether it lands on the Zhejiang-Fujian coast or brushes northward, it will have a serious impact," Xinhua reported. Typhoons regularly hit China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan from August through the end of the year, gathering strength from the warm waters of the Pacific or the South China Sea before weakening over land. bd
