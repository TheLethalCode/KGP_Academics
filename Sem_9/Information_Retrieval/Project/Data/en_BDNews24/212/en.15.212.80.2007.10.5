<TITLE> German train drivers to strike 3 hours nationwide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's GDL train drivers' union will strike for three hours across the country on Friday after failing to reach an agreement on wage increases with national rail operator Deutsche Bahn. GDL Chairman Manfred Schell said in a statement that the strike would last from 0600 to 0900 GMT. GDL represents some 34,000 train drivers in Germany. Schell also urged Deutsche Bahn to agree to the union's demands for wage increases of up to 31 percent. "If they don't do this, then they should prepare for another battle with labour," he said. Deutsche Bahn spokesman Gunnar Meyer said the company had a contingency plan and would strive to keep as many as two thirds of the country's 750 long-distance trains and up to half of the 19,000 regional trains in operation. He said Deutsche Bahn would try as much as possible to maintain light-rail traffic, which commuters rely on heavily for travel to and in Germany's larger cities. Deutsche Bahn, which the government wants to partially privatise by 2009, has been locked in a months-long wage dispute with GDL, which says Germany's train drivers are underpaid compared with their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. After disruptive GDL strikes over the summer, the two sides agreed to hold new talks through September, but they have been unable to reach a compromise. Deutsche Bahn had hoped to persuade GDL to sign up to a wage deal that it struck with two other unions, which foresees salary increases of 4.5 percent. Recently it offered to pay the drivers for an additional two hours' work per week -- which it said would result in bottom-line salary increases of up to 10 percent. But GDL has said the new offer just means more work for the same pay.
