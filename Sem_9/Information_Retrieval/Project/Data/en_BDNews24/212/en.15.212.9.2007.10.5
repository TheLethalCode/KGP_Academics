<TITLE> Trezeguet criticises Domenech for France omission </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus striker David Trezeguet has lambasted France coach Raymond Domenech for leaving him out of the squad for this month's Euro 2008 qualifiers against the Faroe Islands and Lithuania. Trezeguet, who is joint top scorer with seven goals in Serie A this season, was dumped after failing to score in France's 1-0 defeat by Scotland last month. Domenech said on Thursday there was a lot of competition between strikers. "The coach has always said that he calls up players on the basis of their performances for their clubs," Trezeguet was quoted as saying on the Gazzetta dello Sport Web site (www.gazzetta.it) on Friday. "I have scored seven goals in six matches. I could not do more. I am disappointed. There is no explanation. I have talked with my coaches about it and no one understands the decision." Trezeguet, 29, said he would now seriously consider his international future. "After the World Cup I was thinking of leaving the national team and giving up my place to someone that responded better to the system of play Domenech wants," he said. "I am giving myself two months to decide. I want to feel useful to the national team and not be called up to make up the numbers. If in time responding to the call-ups becomes a pain, then it won't be worth it any more." World Cup finalists France, who are third in Group B, travel to the Faroe Islands on Oct. 13 before hosting Lithuania in Nantes four days later
