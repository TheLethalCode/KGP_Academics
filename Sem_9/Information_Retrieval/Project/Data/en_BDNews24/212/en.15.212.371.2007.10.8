<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League's new acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Sunday called for the ban on politics to be lifted and the general election called as soon as possible. "The nation is going through a critical time now. The people have been worried about the future of the country during the state of emergency," Ashraful told reporters at the Awami League president's office in Dhanmondi. The acting general secretary vowed the battle for AL chief Sheikh Hasina's release would continue through legal and constitutional means. "The fundamental rights of the people are still suspended. The Awami League will participate in the next election under the leadership of party president Sheikh Hasina," he said. "There is no alternative to democracy. The people of this country have participated in many movements and sacrificed many things for democracy and the right to vote," Ashraful said. Ashraful took the post of acting general secretary over from Mukul Bose Saturday. Ashraful described the Awami League as a secular, non-communal party with a glorious past and a bright future. "We hope the party will become the country's top political organisation again as we truly reflect the peoples' aspirations," he said. bdnews
