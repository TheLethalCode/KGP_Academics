 MOSCOW, Sun Oct 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police clamped tight security on Moscow on Sunday ahead of protests remembering murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya and a Kremlin birthday party for President Vladimir Putin whose policies she criticized. About 2,500 extra police, some on horseback, patrolled near Pushkin Square in the city centre, where friends of the journalist, shot dead a year ago, joined members of the dissident "Other Russia" movement to demand her killers be brought to justice. Colleagues gathered for a private graveside remembrance of the reporter while others laid flowers and photographs at the entrance to her apartment building in Moscow. Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of Putin particularly over his policies in Chechnya, was shot dead by a lone assassin a year ago inside the building's lift as she returned home from shopping. Prosecutors announced the arrest of 11 suspects in August but some were later released for lack of evidence and the chief investigator on the case was sidelined amid accusations of political interference. Russia's human rights commissioner Vladimir Lukin said a final solution of the murder case was "of crucial importance for the public and the state". "Establishing the names of the organizers of the murder is the key thing, which has yet to be done," he said on Sunday, Interfax news agency reported. Prosecutors say the crime was masterminded by anti-Kremlin forces abroad whose aim was to discredit Russia but have not produced any evidence of this. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) wrote to Putin last week questioning aspects of the official investigation into Politkovskaya's death and urging a "thorough, transparent and unbiased" probe. Human Rights Watch and other activists expressed fears that trouble could be sparked in Moscow on Sunday by pro-Kremlin youth groups, who reject any suggestion of government involvement in the reporter's death. Leaders of Nashi, the largest pro-Kremlin youth organisation said they had no intention of interfering in the protests and were instead organizing a big riverside outdoor party to mark Putin's 55th birthday. KREMLIN PARTY Putin, who enjoys strong support among Russians, was himself hosting a birthday reception in the Kremlin, his last as president before he steps down next March, possibly to become prime minister. The Russian leader cut short his attendance at a meeting of leaders of former Soviet states in Tajikistan on Saturday so he could throw the party for top military officials and friends. Putin drew fire in the aftermath of Politkovskaya's death for describing her influence as "minimal" but later praised her critical writing as an important contribution to public life. Few Russians, who receive their news from state-controlled media, were aware of Politkovskaya's work and attendance at Sunday's commemorative events was unlikely to be high. Rainy, cold weather also discouraged supporters. In Nizny Novgorod, 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow, four foreign human rights campaigners were fined between 3,000 roubles ($120) and 5,000 roubles ($199.9) for not registering their presence in the city on Saturday. The activists were attending a forum to commemorate Politkovskaya's anniversary but said they were forced to stay in private homes when their hotel reservations were cancelled. This meant they were unable to register their stay with authorities, a process normally done by hote
