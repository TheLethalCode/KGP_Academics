 PRISTINA, Serbia, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The vanguard of the European Union's planned mission to oversee the independence of Serbia's breakaway Kosovo province has just leased new premises on a hill above the dusty capital, Pristina. The house-warming is on hold, as is Kosovo's independence. But with no breakthrough seen at talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, which continue in Brussels next Sunday, Western diplomats say the EU is getting ready to deploy its operation with or without a U.N. resolution. It would involve the despatch of 1,875 police and judicial personnel in the biggest mission yet undertaken by the 27-member EU, a milestone in the development of its common European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The deadlock in negotiations will be discussed in London on Tuesday when Kosovo Albanian leaders meet senior British officials to press the 90-percent Albanian majority's case for nothing less than independence. Deadlock or not, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana last week gave the clearest indication yet of EU resolve to deploy regardless of the outcome of talks that have a Dec. 10 deadline for completion. "We have to be prepared to deploy the ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) mission ... and we still have to discuss with the U.N. secretary-general under what potential legal basis that mission could be deployed," Solana said. Indications are that the EU could begin taking over from UNMIK, the increasingly unpopular UN mission, within weeks of talks ending. It could deploy at the invitation of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Kosovo itself. In June 1999, UN Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under the control of the United Nations, after NATO bombing to drive out Serb forces accused of killing and expelling civilians in a two-year war with Albanian separatist guerrillas. It reaffirmed the sovereignty of Slobodan Milosevic's now defunct Yugoslavia, to which Serbia is the successor state. And Serbia firmly rejects Kosovo's secession. But Western powers see a way around the legal obstacle. "We don't need to ditch 1244," a senior Western diplomat told Reuters. "Its powers can be cascaded down to new actors." DOUBTS UN-mediated talks have already failed once. Since August a 'troika' of envoys from the United States, Russia and the EU is is leading a fresh search for compromise. Sunday's meeting in Brussels will be its second face-to-face encounter. Russia insists the UN Security Council is the only body that can decide Kosovo's fate, but has blocked adoption of a Western-backed plan for independence under EU supervision, raising fears that further stalling could provoke unrest. The United States, Britain and France are pushing for Western consensus on recognition of Kosovo outside the United Nations, denying Moscow a veto over what is increasingly framed as a matter of EU credibility in its own backyard. A majority of the EU's 27 member states are said to be ready to recognise a unilateral declaration of independence, with timing to be agreed. Key player Germany, however, is uncertain. "If no bridges are crossed in the troika process, we should move rapidly to a status settlement," said the Western diplomat. "But Pristina must remain in step," he added. EU members differ on the timing and want close coordination. In Kosovo's Serb-dominated north, where a skeleton EU team is operating out of a converted hotel, Western officials fear the new EU mission could be greeted as "occupiers". "In the event of a unilateral declaration of independence, the Serbs will not recognise the follow-up mission," one official told Reuters. "Their presence is going to be treated as hostile," he said. "There could be a complete power vacuu
