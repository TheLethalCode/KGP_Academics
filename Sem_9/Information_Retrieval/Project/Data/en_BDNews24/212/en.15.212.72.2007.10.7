 LONDON, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal moved back to the top of the Premier League with a 3-2 win over Sunderland on Sunday with Robin van Persie securing the points with a well-worked winner 10 minutes from time. Having won their last nine successive matches in all competitions, Arsenal looked set for another straightforward win after goals from Dutch striker van Persie and Swiss defender Philippe Senderos put them 2-0 up after only 14 minutes in the early kickoff. Van Persie scored with a blistering free kick after Abou Diaby had a goal ruled out when the referee failed to play the advantage rule. Senderos scored with a soft goal to make it 2-0 seven minutes later. Arsenal were also unfortunate to have a third disallowed when Diaby had what appeared a valid goal ruled out for offside. Sunderland fought back with Ross Wallace scoring against the run of play after 25 minutes and Kenwyne Jones heading the equaliser three minutes after the break. Van Persie struck the winner in the closing stages, while Sunderland were reduced to 10 men after 90 minutes when Paul McShane was sent off for a clattering late challenge on Belarus midfielder Aleksandr Hleb. Arsenal, who have led the table for the last three weeks, were knocked off the top by Manchester United on Saturday after the champions beat Wigan Athletic 4-0 at Old Trafford. Arsenal have 22 points from eight matches, United 20 from nine. Seven other Premier League matches were being played later on Sund
