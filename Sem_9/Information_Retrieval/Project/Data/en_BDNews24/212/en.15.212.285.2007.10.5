<TITLE> South Korea puts temporary halt on US beef imports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea has temporarily blocked imports of US beef after finding banned spinal material in a shipment, the agriculture ministry said on Friday, a move likely to add heat to a simmering trade dispute. US lawmakers have said they may not be able to approve a sweeping bilateral trade deal struck in April unless South Korea fully opens up its market to American beef. The ministry said it suspended quarantine inspections after finding the spinal material in an 18.5 tonne shipment sent in early September. By suspending inspections, South Korea is effectively putting a temporary ban on imports, once worth $850 million annually, because the checks are needed to allow the beef into the country. The ministry did not identify the US beef packer that sent the shipment. In August, South Korea halted quarantine inspections for about three weeks after finding a large part of a spinal column in a shipment. It resumed inspections after receiving safety assurances from the United States. At present, South Korea, which banned all imports in 2003 following an outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States, allows only imports of boneless US beef from cattle less than 30 months old. In April, South Korea accepted the first shipment of boneless meat back into the country, which once was the third-largest overseas market for the product. US beef has been a hit among consumers in South Korea, after it went on sale at prices about half that of the domestic product.
