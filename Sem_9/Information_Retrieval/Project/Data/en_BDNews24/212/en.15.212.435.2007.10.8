 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has penalised Grameenphone Tk 168.4 crore (about $25 million) for its "involvement in illegal (international) call termination activities". This is the first time the government has punished a mobile phone operator for violating the telecoms law. Earlier, RanksTel had paid Tk 14 crore to BTRC for the same offence. "We won't spare anybody regardless of his capacity if found involved in illegal call termination business," BTRC chairman retired Major General Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com Sunday. "Grameenphone has already made partial payment of the aforesaid amount and the balance will be deposited to the exchequer shortly," said the retired major general without disclosing the amount GP has paid by far. But Grameenphone claimed it has paid "Compensation for revenues lost due to the use of Grameenphone subscriptions by some customers to illegally transfer international calls". "In this case, measures for monitoring general usage by certain customer groups could have prevented customers' wrongful use of our products and thus loss of revenue for the government. Such measures are now being developed," GP's new CEO Anders Jensen said in a statement Sunday. The government began a witch-hunt against the illegal overseas call terminators in early 2007. Leading fixed and mobile phone providers were found involved in the scam. The RAB intelligence wing filed a case against Grameenphone with Ramna Police Station on Feb 13 alleging its involvement in illegal call termination business. Subsequently on May 31, BTRC sought an explanation from GP. In reply on June 17, the operator pleaded not guilty but agreed to pay Tk 168.40 crore as fixed by BTRC for "the staggering loss suffered by the Government." In return, the regulator has also agreed to drop the charges against GP, officials said. Sources said Grameenphone has struggled to convince its parent company Telenor about the payment of penalty. But BTRC remained unmoved and the Norwegian telecoms major finally gave up to the regulatory measure. "We have settled it in only seven months and it has been possible as the matter has been settled out of the court," Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com. The BTRC chairman said the legal process would have dragged the case for years and the government could never realise such a huge amount of cash from Grameenphone. Alam said other mobile operators will be similarly penalised for their connection with illegal international call termination business. "Our committee is talking to Aktel, Banglalink and CityCell about the amount each of them will pay to the government." Officials said Aktel and Banglalink had already agreed to the payable amount. But former foreign minister M Morshed Khan's family-owned CityCell is yet to accept the amount that BTRC demands. The regulatory crackdown coincided with a move by the government to issue international telecoms gateway licences where the fixed and mobile phone operators are not qualified to bid.
