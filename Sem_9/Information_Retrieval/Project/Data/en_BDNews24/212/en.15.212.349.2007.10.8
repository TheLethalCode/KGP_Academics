 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) - The Detective Branch of Police has taken three top wanted men, Habibur Rahman alias Noimul Islam Taj, Sohel Ibrahim and Biplob, popularly known as Lombu Selim, on a seven-day remand. The three were sent back from India Sunday. CID police inspector Md Azizul Haque produced them before the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court and appealed for a 10-day remand, but magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah granted seven days. In the report submitted to the court, Haque alleged that the three arrested under the emergency powers rules were "accomplices" of Kala Jahangir, who has a criminal past. "When in Bangladesh they were involved in different crimes including murder, mugging and issuing threats," the report said. "After the government published the list of top criminals, they fled to India. They were extradited with the cooperation of the India government," Haque said in the report. After arresting them on charges of trespass, the Indian authorities handed the three over to Bangladesh authorities at Benapole checkpoint Sunday. bdnew
