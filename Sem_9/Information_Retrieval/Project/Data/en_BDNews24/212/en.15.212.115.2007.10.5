<TITLE> Ramadan prices still denting pockets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Ramadan price hike continues to spike household grocery costs despite government intervention to control prices, although shoppers are more concerned with clothing and apparel purchases ahead of Eid festivities. Consumers offered mixed responses to a slew of government measures to keep kitchen market prices from spiralling out of control. Measures like increasing the number of BDR fair price shops, the Open Market Sales (OMS) programme, increased market patrols by RAB, and selling through the Directorate for Agricultural Marketing have not yet yielded undisputed gains to the consumer. But consumers say setting commodity price lists has definitely helped. "The price list has made things a bit easier. Initially, sellers used to demand higher prices than those on the list. They do not do that anymore," homemaker Shahana Begum told bdnews24.com at Hatirpul Bazaar. Banker Masum Khan said, "The government seems to be trying. I appreciate that the price-list, RAB patrols and BDR shops are visible at market places. But I'm not yet convinced that these initiatives have worked." "Retailers sometimes charge more than list prices, despite law enforcers patrolling the market. I myself have paid more." Onion, aubergine, broiler chicken and milk powder prices have gone up in a week. Last week imported onions were sold at Tk 34-35 per kg and local ones at Tk 40-42. Now both are sold between Tk 42 and Tk 46. Importers and BDR officials said rising imported onion prices reflected a price hike in the Indian onion market. The Directorate of Agricultural Marketing said local onions were selling at Tk 2-3 above the list price. The gap between the price of local and imported onions has narrowed since the Tk 5 difference at the beginning of Ramadan. Onion prices were unstable on Friday. According to the same list, garlic, pulses and hilsha prices have decreased. BDR director (Operations) Colonel Abdul Halim told bdnews24.com, "We have observed the price rises of some commodities. We will first see whether the price changes are logical and then decide whether to take steps." On consumers' complaints about retailers charging higher than list prices, he said, "These complaints were more frequent earlier, but after we acted on the problem we hear less about it." The BDR will continue observing kitchen markets, he added. bdnews24.
