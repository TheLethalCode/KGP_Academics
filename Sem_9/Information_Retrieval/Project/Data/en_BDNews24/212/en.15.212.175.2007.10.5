 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Shakil and Rubel shared seven wickets as Bangladesh Under-19 team handed a 27-run defeat to Barisal Division in the warm-up low-scoring match ahead of the National Cricket League at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Friday. The junior side were bundled out for a paltry 122 in 43.5 overs after deciding to bat first with opener Saikat putting up the highest score of 46 knocking 84 balls. One-down, Rony was the second successful batsman with 36, followed by Rubel's 11, and the remaining batsmen failed to cross the double digit as Ali Arman Rajon and Arafat Salahuddin each grabbed three wickets for five and 12. Barisal, in reply, spectacularly folded up with 95 in 37.5 overs as pacer Rubel removed three batsmen in the very first over with the scoreboard reading 0/3. After losing three wickets in the first over, Barisal never recovered the damage and eventually folded to below hundred as Shakil then broke the middle order claiming four wickets for 25 runs in 10 overs. Barisal opener Hannan Sarkar topscored with 29 followed by Sajidul Islam's 13 and Mohammad Shahin's 12.
