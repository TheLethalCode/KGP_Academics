 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Oct 7 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Sunday invited bids to operate international telecoms services by private companies. >>IGW bid invitation >>ICX bid invitation The regulator will issue licences for two interconnection exchanges (ICX) in Dhaka and will also issue three licences of international gateway (IGW) facilities. The ICX will be linked with the IGW. Fixed and mobile operators' outbound calls will first terminate in one of the six ICXs. Then the calls will be processed in the IGW and routed to the overseas destinations via BTTB's submarine cable station. A similar path will be followed for inbound overseas calls. Bidders have to pay Tk 50,000 to buy each ICX and IGW bid document. BTRC will host a pre-bid meeting on Nov 5 and the offers will be received until 12:00pm of Nov 22, according to the announcements. In line with a decision taken in a cabinet meeting in 2003, the BNP-led four-party coalition government had moved to end BTTB's monopoly. But it fizzled out, helping illegal international call termination outfits mushroom. Once the licences are awarded, the last barrier to liberalising the telecoms sector will be removed. State-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) has been enjoying the monopoly over international gateway. But industry insiders questioned the current liberalisation initiative's success. No foreign company or foreign joint venture will qualify to apply for IGW or ICX licence, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam categorically told the media in a press conference on Aug 17. Non-resident Bangladeshis' business outfits are not eligible either. "Only the companies fully owned by resident Bangladeshi citizens are qualified for the international telecoms licences." The retired major general also said fixed or mobile phone operators cannot join the race. But BTTB gets the ICX as well as the IGW licences by default being the country's incumbent international telecoms monopoly. All the provisions are the result of the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services (ILDTS) Policy-2007 which was enacted without public consultation and remains undisclosed. bdn
