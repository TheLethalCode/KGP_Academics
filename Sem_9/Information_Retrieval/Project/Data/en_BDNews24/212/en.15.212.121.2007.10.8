 Oct 8 (Reuters) - Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies won the 2007 Nobel prize for medicine or physiology for their work on stem cells, Sweden's Karolinska Institute said on Monday. Here are some details about the winners: MARIO CAPPECCHI: -- Mario Capecchi was born Italy in 1937 and is a U.S. citizen. He received his B.S. degree in chemistry and physics from Antioch College in 1961 and his Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard University in 1967. -- Capecchi is best-known for his pioneering work on the development of gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem (ES) cells. This technology allows scientists to create mice with mutations in any desired gene. -- The power of this technology is that the investigator chooses both which gene to mutate and how to mutate it. The investigator has virtually complete freedom on how to manipulate the DNA sequences in the genome of living mice. MARTIN EVANS: -- Martin Evans was born in Britain in 1941. After graduating from the University of Cambridge in 1963, he gained his PhD at University College, London. -- In 1978, he returned to the University of Cambridge and it was here he discovered embryonic stem cells in mice with his collaborator Dr Matthew Kaufman in 1981. -- The scientist considered by many as the chief architect of stem cell research was knighted in 2003. Evans is professor of mammalian genetics at Cardiff University and a Fellow of the Royal Society. -- He helped show how the cells that form all the tissues in a mouse's body -- embryonic stem cells -- can be removed and grown separately in the lab. -- He also helped create a method to alter genes in mice with amazing accuracy. This breakthrough, known as gene targeting, is helping the drive to develop new treatments for human illnesses. OLIVER SMITHIES: -- Smithies was born in 1925 in Halifax, Britain, and also is a U.S. citizen. He studied medicine and biochemistry in Oxford. In 1951, he went to the United States to the University of Wisconsin. -- From 1953-1960, he worked at the Connaught Medical Research Laboratory at the University of Toronto, Canada, and then went back to the University of Wisconsin, where he was a Professor of Genetics and Medical Genetics. Since 1988, he has worked at the University of North Carolina. -- Smithies developed the "knock-out" technology which allows for shutting down genes in animals to study their function. With this method, which is being used now in research laboratories all over the world, scientists are able to develop animal models of human disease.
