Prof Mozaffer Ahmad underlined the need for an independent NGO Commission to regulate the NGO activities. "About 4,000 Islamic NGOs are operating in the country with the fundsmostly from Saudi Arabia," Ahmad told a roundtable, organised by the sleaze watchdog at the CIRDAP Auditorium.

The survey uncovered irregularities in policymaking and fund handling by the NGOs in a sector hit by what the report said was "midlevel corruption". bdn
