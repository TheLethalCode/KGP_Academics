<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's main indexes rose on Monday, led by Orascom Construction Industries, as positive sentiment over a planned auction for cement plant licences lifted the building sector, traders said. OCI shares rose 1 percent to 472.90 Egyptian pounds ($85.21). Shares in Sixth of October Development and Investment gained a percent to 181 pounds while Heliopolis Housing rose 1.7 percent to end at 475 pounds. Egypt shortlisted 24 firms on Thursday to bid for 14 licences to build or expand existing operations as part of efforts to increase domestic supply, and an auction will be held on Oct. 28. Overall, the benchmark Case 30 index gained 1.4 percent to 8,892.60 points, a fresh closing high, while the well watched Hermes index rose 1.5 percent to 78,084.72 points. The broader CIBC index was up 0.8 percent to 390.22 points. "It's mainly the whole cement sector news. There are 14 licences for factories and eight of those are greenfield," said Aly Allouba, head of equities at Delta Securities, explaining the rise. Shares in Egyptian Resorts rose 0.6 percent to 11.70 pounds, the firm's second consecutive day of gains following two sessions of declines after an auction to sell the government's 24 percent stake in the company was indefinitely delayed. On the financial side, banking shares were also generally higher over possible consolidation in the sector, dealers said, with shares in Commercial International Bank (CIB) rising 1.3 percent to 80.99 pounds. CIB and Arab African International said last week they were considering a merger to create Egypt's biggest private bank and had agreed to conduct due diligence studies. Credit Agricole was the best CASE 30 performer of the day gaining 5.6 percent to 19.61 pounds, while shares in investment bank EFG-Hermes were up 2.2 percent to 48.95 pounds. National Societe Generale Bank was up 0.7 percent to 45.25 pounds. ($1 = 5.55 Egyptian poun
