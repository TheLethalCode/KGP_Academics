 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com)  Former Baum Social Council president Jumlian Amlai has started writing the first-ever history of the Bom ethnic group. Amlai said, "The Baums in Bandarban embraced Christianity in 1927. Because the Baums did not have an alphabet, Christian priests wrote the Bible and other religious books in the Baum language using Roman script." "Since the 1960s, fairy tales, ballads and folk music have been written in the Baum language using the Roman alphabet. But the practice is on the wane now. I am taking this personal initiative to preserve our own language and culture." The pioneer Baum historian has collected source material from Mizoram for his research. Because many Baum live in Mizoram, written documents and books on Baums are available there. Amlai's history will be written in English, but he plans to publish Baum and Bangla editions later. He said, "After accepting Christianity, Baum culture and customs have changed. The old ways including nature worship and a belief in miracles have passed into oblivion. "Oral histories collected from the older generation will help round out the book's perspective. Old idioms reflecting Baum life will also be included." A 1966 effort to compile a Baum dictionary by Prof Laurence G Loeffler of Zurich University's anthropology department will also find fruition in Amlai's work. Some of his research material will be incorporated into Amlai's history. A fresh initiative to publish Dr Loeffler's Baum dictionary may also be in the pipeline. Amlai intends to consult Hill Tracts intellectuals and researchers before publishing the manuscript. Sanjeeb Drong, general secretary of the Adibashi Forum, a national organisation of Bangladeshi indigenous people, welcomed the initiative to write a history of the Baum people. He told bdnews24.com, "Baum is a fringe linguistic minority group - unknown and neglected. This history will not only enrich the history of the indigenous people it will enrich the history of Bangladesh." Drong said, "Besides Baum culture, customs and heritage, the tale of the deprivation of the indigenous people of the Hill Tracts should also be looked at. This history book will not only help researchers but will also help the new generation of indigenous people in their search for roots." Indigenous writer Dipayan Khisa estimates that there are about 25 lakh people from 45 ethnic groups living in Bangladesh, of whom 13 ethnic groups live in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Rangamati Tribal Cultural Institute published a history of the Chakma tribe in the 1980s. The Baum will be the ninth of 45 linguistic minority communities in Bangladesh to record their community's history with the publication of Amlai's work. The Chakma, Marma, Rakhaine, Tripura, Monipuri, Santal, Garo and Khasia communities have already produced written histories. Several history books on the Chakma and Marma tribes have been written personally. A Baum Social Council survey in 2003 showed that some 9561 Baum belonging to 1900 families live in Bandarban. bdnews24
