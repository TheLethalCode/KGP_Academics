 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Productivity in compliant factories is much higher than in less or non-compliant garment enterprises, a nongovernmental think-tank said in a study Monday. The Centre for Policy Dialogue said that an increase in workers' wages could bring about a positive impact in terms of worker performance. It also said that big, new and foreign firms were more productive than old and locally owned RMG enterprises. "We have found that big firms are more productive, more compliant. Profitability of large entities is also higher," said CPD executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya while sharing the findings of a study Bangladesh Apparel sector in post-MFA period at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel Monday. Finance and commerce adviser Mirza Azizul Islam, diplomats, representatives of multilateral donor agencies, BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury, BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque and trade union leaders also spoke. "Compliance is an essential requirement to sustain in the global market. It is to be ensured by all-entrepreneurs, governments and workers," finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam said. The study conducted in Dhaka and Chittagong with 190 sample enterprises observed that profits in RMG units increased 16.7 percent in 2005 from a year ago. The CPD said large factories are more compliant than small factories. It said highly compliant factories are 57 percent more productive than moderately compliant enterprises. The research body suggested devising a common compliance standard in line with constitution and buyers requirement and recommended formation of Compliance Upgradation Fund. "We need to have a unified code of conduct on compliance issues as the requirements of buyers vary," said Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury. The BGMEA said that of the factories now under operation, over 90 percent were compliant. "We have already proved that we are very good garment manufacturers. RMG sector can grow a lot, but we have to have a good country image," he said. But Nazrul Islam Khan, president of Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies, referring to the absence of trade union rights in factories said: "If we really care about the image, the employers and government should come up to meet international labour standards in factories." "I will request you to take note that we have raised wages by 13 percent when prices of our products have declined 6 percent," Bangladesh Knitwear Manufactures and Exporters Association president Fazlul Hoque said requesting not to compare Bangladesh's situation with the standards of the European Union and the USA. bd
