<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnew24.com)  Expelled BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Tuesday backed former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury proposal for a "government of national consensus" for next 10 years. He stressed political accord in forming future government and broader understanding among political parties on some basic national issues. "We need accord. We agree on the proposal of Badruddoza Chowdhury," Bhuiyan told reporters at his Gulshan home. "Many serious problems will go if there is consensus among political parties and a consensus government is formed," he said. "The deterioration of relationship between the political parties is not good. We should stand united for the country." Badruddoza, who heads the Bikalpadhara party, Monday proposed for a national unity government at an iftar congregation of citizens, politicians, diplomats and journalists. Bhuiyan is the latest among scores of political leaders including Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman who have responded positively to the proposal. "There may be more issues beyond the proposals he has offered for consensus. Our reform proposals may merge with them." Replying to a question, Bhuyian said the consensus may happen before or after the elections. On the serious split in the BNP after his expulsion, Bhuiyan said he still wanted unity. "I have said and am saying again BNP should be reformed with a view to make the party fair, accountable and democratic." "Through the reforms BNP will take part in the next elections as a unique party and thus it will win. Those who do not want reforms in the party would be detached from people and the party activists." bdnews24.com/sm/
