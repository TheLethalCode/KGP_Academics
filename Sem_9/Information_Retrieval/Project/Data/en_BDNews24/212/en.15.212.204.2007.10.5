<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian Muslims have become more secular, while support for Islamic law and radical Islamic groups has declined in the past year, says a poll by a leading private pollster released on Friday. Some 85 percent of the country's 220 million population are Muslims, making it the world's most populous Muslim country. While most Indonesians practice the moderate version of the faith, there is a radical fringe that has become increasingly vocal.

The number of people in favour of cutting the hands of thiefs dropped to 34 percent from 40 percent in an earlier survey by the institute in 2005, while 43 percent think people who committed adultery should be stoned compared to 55 percent in 2005. The number of people who opposed the idea of a female president also halved to 22 percent from 41 percent in 2005, indicating that "secularisation of political values is increasingly accepted by Muslims". The survey also found that less Muslims are in support of militant organisations such as Jemaah Islamiah and Hizbut Tahrir. Jemaah Islamiah is blamed for a string of deadly attacks in the country, including the 2002 cafe bombings on the resort island of Bali, which killed over 200 people, many of them foreigners. International group Hizbut Tahrir is known for its campaign for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate, a single Islamic government across Muslim nations. There has been steady support for Islamic parties in recent years, but three secular parties including the ruling Golkar would get the most votes if an election were to be held today, the survey said. "Looking at the results, secular political parties stand to gain in the upcoming elections," the report sa
