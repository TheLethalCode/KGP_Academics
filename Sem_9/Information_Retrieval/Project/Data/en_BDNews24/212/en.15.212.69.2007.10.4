<TITLE> Much dismay from Malaysian ban </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 04 (bdnews24.com)  The government has expressed its dismay over the ban imposed by the Malaysian government on fresh recruitment of Bangladeshi workers, but hoped that it would be temporary. Some 1.6 lakh Bangladeshi workers who have already been approved will be able to go to Malaysia for work, senior government officials said Thursday. The announcement of a fresh ban on the import of Bangladeshi workers on Wednesday had cast a shadow of uncertainty over hundreds of workers who had already received Malaysian visas. "The Malaysian government has shut down fresh recruitment," expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com "But it will import 1.6 lakh Bangladeshi workers who are already in the pipeline," he said, after a tripartite meeting of the ministry, the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training and recruiting agencies. Malaysian home minister Radzi Sheikh Ahmad announced a ban on the import of workers from Bangladesh Wednesday following what he termed "too many problems" relating to hiring Bangladeshis. The Star, a Malaysian newspaper, reporting that the ban was for an "indefinite" period effective immediately, drew sharp protests from employers. This was the second time the Malaysian government has put a freeze on Bangladeshi labour imports. The first was in 1999. "Of course, it is disheartening but the ban is only temporary. We hope it is only for weeks, not months or years," the newspaper quoted Bangladesh high commissioner in Malaysia, M Khairuzzaman, as saying. He hoped for a settlement soon: "If there are loopholes in the system, let's plug them." The Malaysian cabinet put 'an indefinite freeze' on recruiting Bangladeshi workers Wednesday, after hundreds of Bangladeshi workers were stranded at Kuala Lumpur airport. Press reports say problems with receiving and managing arriving workers have created a big problem. "Since there are too many problems arising from employing workers from Bangladesh, we have decided to freeze the exercise again," The Star quoted Malaysian home affairs minister Datuk Seri Radzi Sheikh Ahmad as saying. The minister said that the problem was exacerbated by agents in Bangladesh, who had collaborated with local agents send as many Bangladeshis as possible to Malaysia. "I hope the recruitment process will start again," foreign affairs secretary Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com, citing his talks with the Bangladesh high commissioner in Malaysia. He said Malaysia imposed the ban on recruiting Bangladesh workers because of 'procedural causes' without giving further details. "There were some problems that led to the Malaysian decision." The decision of the Malaysian government drew protests from Malaysian employers and Bangladeshi recruiting agencies. "The government is always playing hot and cold," said an official of the Malaysian Employers Federation. "This is causing havoc to our planning. This is not good in terms of long-term investment," the official added. The Malaysian government placed a similar restriction in 1999, but lifted it in 2006 and approved a fresh intake of 345,000 workers. Of the approved workers 182,500 have already reached Malaysia, according to the government. The remaining 162,500 will go there in phases. "There is no concern for those who have already been approved," BMET director general Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com. "Some 1,400 workers went to Malaysia on Wednesday," he said, adding that the pre-approved workers would be able to go over the next 3 to 4 months. Abdul Matin Chowdhury said he has directed the recruiting agencies to address the allegation that hundreds of workers were stranded at a Malaysian airport. "We've asked the recruiting agencies not to send any worker without job confirmation," he said. Responding to questions about the government's strategy to deal with the new ban, Chowdhury said, "We'll decide after getting the Malaysian government's decision." Nasiruddin Majumdar of Madina Overseas, one of the major agencies dealing with the labour placement in Malaysia, blamed some third countries for the ban. "Some countries do not want Bangladeshis to go there (Malaysia)." Malaysia's booming economy has become a magnet for cheap labour, especially for menial work that locals are unwilling to do. Some 27 lakh foreign workers mainly from Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Philippines and Pakistan work there legally. It has been reported that hundreds of thousands more are working illegally. bdnews24.com
