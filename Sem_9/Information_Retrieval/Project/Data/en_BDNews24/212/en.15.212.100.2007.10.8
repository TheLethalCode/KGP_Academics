 MOSCOW, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Russian policemen were killed and 10 wounded when a convoy of vehicles carrying interior ministry servicemen was ambushed in the troubled Chechnya region on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported on Monday. The column of cars came under fire from unknown gunmen in the mountainous Vedeno district in southern Chechnya on Sunday morning, said media reports, quoting Chechen police sources. The policemen were among reinforcements sent to the area after clashes with rebels on Saturday in which one separatist gumman was killed.
