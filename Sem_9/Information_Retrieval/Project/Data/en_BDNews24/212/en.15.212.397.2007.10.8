 Dhaka, Oct 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Bikalpadhara chief and former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury Monday proposed a "government of national consensus" with a 10-year tenure. "Let the caretaker government implement its roadmap for a fair election. We, the politicians, will make a roadmap focusing on how the nation can go ahead," Chowdhury told an iftar party of politicians, citizens, diplomats and journalists at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. It cannot be denied that crimes and corruption had destroyed many "bright successes" of the politicians, Chowdhury said. In his address as a "senior citizen", he asked the politicians to forge a broader consensus on a range of issues. Calling for unity in a country with decades of bitter rivalry among major political camps, Chowdhury asked the politicians to shun campaigns of "revenge and hatred". "My urge to the politicians is for a united Bangladesh." A number of issues that have "undermined the country's political culture" also came in his three-page address. Chowdhury, a former leader of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, called for avoiding spread of malice against the past or present political leaders for partisan interest. "Give up politics of schism on the basis of religion, caste or culture," he said. Chowdhury, a physician by profession, advocated creation of rooms for young leadership and a political campaign consistent with the country's socio-economic context. He stood for an election environment free from political and administrative pressure. Chowdhury asked the interim administration to hold regular dialogue on different issues and take the decisions on economy and politics on the basis of the dialogue outcomes. "The present rulers should hold dialogues with the politicians not only on elections, but also on administrative and economic issues as the politicians will run the country in future," Chowdhury said. He said the government should nurture politics in a "peaceful environment". bdnews24.co
