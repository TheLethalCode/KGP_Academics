 Jens Hack MUNICH, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's biggest technology group, Siemens, is unhappy about its joint ventures with Finland's Nokia and Fujitsu of Japan, its new chief said as he announced a management shake-up. In remarks made on Thursday but embargoed for release until Friday, Chief executive Peter Loescher also dismissed recent talk that he might sell off Siemens' lighting business, Osram, or its TS trains business. "We are absolutely not satisfied with NSN," he said, referring to network equipment company Nokia Siemens Networks.

This clips the wings of heretofore powerful regional bosses and streamlines a complex grid management structure that blurred responsibility and accountability. The group's supervisory board would get a detailed management plan at its meeting on Nov. 28, he said. "Siemens was, is and will remain an integrated technology company," he said, but added it would systematically work through its portfolio to see what should stay. It has already sold its automotive division to Continental AG. Siemens shares rose 0.4 percent to 98.67 euros by 0916 GMT, while the German blue-chip index edged up 0.1 percent. Loescher said Siemens intends to put more of a focus on Asia in future. "We are set up well in Asia. There is huge potential there to keep growing," he said, but added that the U.S. market remai
